'''90''' ('''ninety''') is the [[natural number]] preceded by [[89 (number)|89]] and followed by [[91 (number)|91]].

In the English language, the numbers 90 and 19 are often confused, as sounding very similar. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 19 /naɪnˈtiːn/ vs 90 /ˈnaɪnti/. However, in dates such as 1999, and when contrasting numbers in the teens and when counting, such as 17, 18, 19, the stress shifts to the first syllable: 19 /ˈnaɪntiːn/.

{{Wiktionary|ninety}}

[[Image:I-90.svg|100px|thumb|[[Interstate 90]] is a freeway that runs from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to [[Massachusetts]].]]

== In mathematics ==
'''90''' is:

* a [[unitary perfect number]] because it is the sum of its [[unitary divisor]]s (excluding itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002827|title=Sloane's A002827 : Unitary perfect numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[semiperfect number]] because it is equal to the sum of a subset of its divisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005835|title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[pronic number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002378|title=Sloane's A002378 : Oblong (or promic, pronic, or heteromecic) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[nontotient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005277|title=Sloane's A005277 : Nontotients|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Perrin number]], preceded in the sequence by 39, 51, 68.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001608|title=Sloane's A001608 : Perrin sequence|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Harshad number]] since 90 is divisible by the sum of its base 10 digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal space, the interior angles of a rectangle measure 90 degrees each. Also, in a right triangle, the angle opposing the hypotenuse measures 90 degrees, with the other two angles adding up to 90 for a total of [[180 (number)|180]] degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/testprep/books/newsat/chapter20section4.rhtml http://www.sparknotes.com/testprep/books/newsat/chapter20section4.rhtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an angle measuring 90 degrees is called a right angle.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Erich. [http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html What's Special About This Number?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In science ==
'''Ninety''' is:

* the atomic number of [[thorium]], an [[actinide]]. As an atomic weight, 90 identifies an [[isotope]] of [[strontium]], a by-product of nuclear reactions including fallout. It contaminates [[milk]].
* the latitude in degrees of the [[North Pole|North]] and the [[South Pole|South]] geographical poles.

'''Andrew Browder''' (born January 8, 1931) is an American mathematician at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.brown.edu/faculty/browder.html Andrew Browder at Brown University] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Andrew Browder was born in [[Moscow]], Russia, where his father [[Earl Browder]], an American communist from Kansas, United States, was living and working for a period. His mother was Raisa, a Russian woman. His brothers were [[Felix Browder]], also born in Moscow, and [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]]. Andrew, Felix and William have careers in mathematics. Their father returned to the United States in the early 1930s, bringing his family with him. The senior Browder became head of the [[Communist Party USA]]. He ran for US President in 1936 and 1940.

The analytic nature of the game of [[chess]] enthralled Andrew early on: "My own main sport was always chess. My father taught me the game when I was six, a friend of the family gave me a chess book when I was eleven or twelve, and after that I was hooked."

==Career==

Andrew traces his interest in mathematics to 1955 when he was a private at [[Fort Dix]] and [[Eisenhower]] offered early release to servicemen entering [[graduate school]]. He studied at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. For two years he was a Miller Fellow at [[University of California, Berkeley]] and also studied at [[Aarhus, Denmark]]. As for teaching, "I taught well over one hundred courses, some of which I found interesting and enjoyable, some pretty depressing, most somewhere in between. The students had parallel experiences."&lt;ref&gt;M. Cook &amp; R. C. Gunning (2013) [http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1203335 Andrew Browder], ''Mathematicians: An Outer View of an Inner World'', pages 124,5, [[Princeton University Press]] via [[Project MUSE]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Browder married and has as least one child:  Laura Browder, professor of American Studies at the [[University of Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Works==

In 1969 Browder published ''Introduction to Function Algebras''. "The author develops much of the general theory of [[function algebra]]s and then applies it in the last two chapters to the theory of [[Padé approximation|rational approximation]] in the plane, and to finding analytic structure in the spectrum of a [[Dirichlet algebra]]."&lt;ref&gt;H. S. Bear [[Mathematical Reviews]] #0246125&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 he published an upper-level [[textbook]] ''Mathematical Analysis'' for well-motivated students having a background of [[calculus]] and [[linear algebra]]. Four topics are encompassed by the text: single-variable theory, [[topology]] and [[function space]]s, [[measure theory]] and [[Lebesgue integration]],  and [[function of several variables|functions of several variables]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert G. Bartle]] ''Mathematical Reviews'' #1411675&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Browder published his article "Topology in the Complex Plane", which described the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]], the [[Jordan curve theorem]], and [[Alexander duality]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Browder (2000) "Topology in the Complex Plane", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' 107(5): 393–401 {{mr|id=1763391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Browder wrote "A variation formula for harmonic modules and its application to several complex variables".&lt;ref&gt;A. Browder &amp; Hiroshi Yamaguchi (1994) [https://www.projecteuclid.org/euclid.hmj/1206127923 A variation formula for harmonic modules and its application to several complex variables], ''[[Hiroshima Mathematical Journal]]'' 24(3): 493–520 via [[Project Euclid]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11187">In [[computer science]], '''anonymous recursion''' is [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] which does not explicitly call a function by name. This can be done either explicitly, by using a [[higher-order function]] – passing in a function as an argument and calling it – or implicitly, via [[reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] features which allow one to access certain functions depending on the current context, especially "the current function" or sometimes "the calling function of the current function".

In programming practice, anonymous recursion is notably used in [[JavaScript]], which provides reflection facilities to support it. In general programming practice, however, this is considered poor style, and recursion with named functions is suggested instead. Anonymous recursion via explicitly passing functions as arguments is possible in any language that supports functions as arguments, though this is rarely used in practice, as it is longer and less clear than explicitly recursing by name.

In theoretical computer science, anonymous recursion is important, as it shows that one can implement recursion without requiring named functions. This is particularly important for the [[lambda calculus]], which has anonymous unary functions, but is able to compute any recursive function. This anonymous recursion can be produced generically via [[fixed-point combinator]]s.

==Use==
Anonymous recursion is primarily of use in allowing recursion for [[anonymous function]]s, particularly when they form [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] or are used as [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], to avoid having to [[name binding|bind the name]] of the function.

Anonymous recursion primarily consists of calling "the current function", which results in [[direct recursion]]. Anonymous [[indirect recursion]] is possible, such as by calling "the caller (the previous function)", or, more rarely, by going further up the [[call stack]], and this can be chained to produce [[mutual recursion]]. The [[self-reference]] of "the current function" is a functional equivalent of the "[[this (computer programming)|this]]" keyword in [[object-oriented programming]], allowing one to refer to the current context.

Anonymous recursion can also be used for named functions, rather that calling them by name, say to specify that one is recursing on the current function, or to allow one to rename the function without needing to change the name where it calls itself. However, as a matter of [[programming style]] this is generally not done.

==Alternatives==

===Named functions===
The usual alternative is to use named functions and named recursion. Given an anonymous function, this can be done either by binding a name to the function, as in named function expressions in JavaScript, or by assigning the function to a variable and then calling the variable, as in function statements in JavaScript. Since languages that allow anonymous functions generally allow assigning these functions to variables (if not first-class functions), many languages do not provide a way to refer to the function itself, and explicitly reject anonymous recursion; examples include [[Go (programming language)|Go]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=226 Issue 226: It's impossible to recurse a anonymous function in Go without workarounds.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in JavaScript the factorial function can be defined via anonymous recursion as such:&lt;ref name=olliej&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/a/235760/2025416 answer] by olliej, Oct 25 '08 to "[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/103598/why-was-the-arguments-callee-caller-property-deprecated-in-javascript Why was the arguments.callee.caller property deprecated in JavaScript?]", ''StackOverflow&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
[1,2,3,4,5].map(function(n) {
     return (!(n&gt;1))? 1 : arguments.callee(n-1)*n;
 });
&lt;/source&gt;
Rewritten to use a named function expression yields:
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
[1,2,3,4,5].map(function factorial(n) {
     return (!(n&gt;1))? 1 : factorial(n-1)*n;
 });
&lt;/source&gt;

===Passing functions as arguments===
Even without mechanisms to refer to the current function or calling function, anonymous recursion is possible in a language that allows functions as arguments. This is done by adding another parameter to the basic recursive function and using this parameter as the function for the recursive call. This creates a higher-order function, and passing this higher function ''itself'' allows anonymous recursion within the actual recursive function. This can be done purely anonymously by applying a [[fixed-point combinator]] to this higher order function. This is mainly of academic interest, particularly to show that the lambda calculus has recursion, as the resulting expression is significantly more complicated than the original named recursive function. Conversely, the use of fixed-pointed combinators may be generically referred to as "anonymous recursion", as this is a notable use of them, though they have other applications.&lt;ref&gt;This terminology appear to be largely [[mathematical folklore|folklore]], but it does appear in the following:
* Trey Nash, ''Accelerated C# 2008'', Apress, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59059-873-3}}, p. 462—463. Derived substantially&lt;!--gives him credit!--&gt; from [http://www.linkedin.com/pub/wes-dyer/2/727/a39 Wes Dyer]'s blog (see next item).
* Wes Dyer [http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/archive/2007/02/02/anonymous-recursion-in-c.aspx Anonymous Recursion in C#], February 02, 2007, contains a substantially similar example found in the book above, but accompanied by more discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ifworks&gt;The If Works [http://blog.jcoglan.com/2008/01/10/deriving-the-y-combinator/ Deriving the Y combinator], January 10th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This is illustrated below using Python. First, a standard named recursion:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def fact(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * fact(n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
Using a higher-order function so the top-level function recurses anonymously on an argument, but still needing the standard recursive function as an argument:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def fact0(n0):
    if n0 == 0:
        return 1
    return n0 * fact0(n0 - 1)
fact1 = lambda f, n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * f(n1 - 1)
fact = lambda n: fact1(fact0, n)
&lt;/source&gt;
We can eliminate the standard recursive function by passing the function argument into the call:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
fact1 = lambda f, n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * f(f, n1 - 1)
fact = lambda n: fact1(fact1, n)
&lt;/source&gt;
The second line can be replaced by a generic [[higher-order function]] called a ''[[Combinatory logic|combinator]]:''
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
F = lambda f: (lambda x: f(f, x))
fact1 = lambda f, n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * f(f, n1 - 1)
fact = F(fact1)
&lt;/source&gt;
Written anonymously:&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/a/8703135/2025416 Hugo Walter's answer] to "[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/481692/can-a-lambda-function-call-itself-recursively-in-python Can a lambda function call itself recursively in Python?]"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
(lambda f: (lambda x: f(f, x))) \
(lambda g, n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * g(g, n1 - 1))
&lt;/source&gt;

In the [[lambda calculus]], which only uses functions of a single variable, this can be done via the ''[[Fixed-point combinator|Y combinator]].'' First make the higher-order function of two variables be a function of a single variable, which directly returns a function, by [[currying]]:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
fact1 = lambda f: (lambda n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * f(f)(n1 - 1))
fact = fact1(fact1)
&lt;/source&gt;
There are two "applying a higher order function to itself" operations here: &lt;code&gt;f(f)&lt;/code&gt; in the first line and &lt;code&gt;fact1(fact1)&lt;/code&gt; in the second. Factoring out the second double application into a ''[[Combinatory logic|combinator]]'' yields:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
C = lambda x: x(x)
fact1 = lambda f: (lambda n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * f(f)(n1 - 1))
fact = C(fact1)
&lt;/source&gt;
Factoring out the other double application yields:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
C = lambda x: x(x)
D = lambda f: (lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v)))
fact1 = lambda g: (lambda n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * g(n1 - 1))
fact = C(D(fact1))
&lt;/source&gt;
Combining the two combinators into one yields the [[Fixed-point combinator|Y combinator]]:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
C = lambda x: x(x)
D = lambda f: (lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v)))
Y = lambda y: C(D(y))
fact1 = lambda g: (lambda n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * g(n1 - 1))
fact = Y(fact1)
&lt;/source&gt;
Expanding out the Y combinator yields:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
Y = lambda f: (lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v))) \
              (lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v)))
fact1 = lambda g: (lambda n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * g(n1 - 1))
fact = Y(fact1)
&lt;/source&gt;
Combining these yields a recursive definition of the factorial in lambda calculus (anonymous functions of a single variable):&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/a/10144992/2025416 Nux's answer] to "[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/481692/can-a-lambda-function-call-itself-recursively-in-python Can a lambda function call itself recursively in Python?]"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
(lambda f: (lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v)))
           (lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v)))) \
(lambda g: (lambda n1: 1 if n1 == 0 else n1 * g(n1 - 1)))
&lt;/source&gt;

==Examples==

===JavaScript===
In [[JavaScript]], the current function is accessible via &lt;code&gt;arguments.callee&lt;/code&gt;, while the calling function is accessible via &lt;code&gt;arguments.caller&lt;/code&gt;. These allow anonymous recursion, such as in this implementation of the factorial:&lt;ref name=olliej /&gt;
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
[1,2,3,4,5].map(function(n) {
     return (!(n&gt;1))? 1 : arguments.callee(n-1)*n;
 });
&lt;/source&gt;

===Perl===
Starting with [[Perl]] 5.16, the current subroutine is accessible via the &lt;code&gt;__SUB__&lt;/code&gt; token, which returns a reference to the current subroutine, or &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; outside a subroutine.&lt;ref&gt;Perldoc, "[http://perldoc.perl.org/feature.html#The-'current_sub'-feature The 'current_sub' feature]", perldoc feature&lt;/ref&gt; This allows anonymous recursion, such as in the following implementation of the factorial:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
use feature ":5.16";

sub {
  my $x = shift;
  $x == 0 ? 1 : $x * __SUB__-&gt;( $x - 1 );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== R ===
In [[R (programming language)|R]], the current function can be called using &lt;code&gt;Recall&lt;/code&gt;. For example,
&lt;source lang=R&gt;
sapply(0:5, function(n) {
  if(n == 0) return(1)
  n * Recall(n - 1)
})
&lt;/source&gt;
It will not work, however, if passed as an argument to another function , e.g. &lt;code&gt;lapply&lt;/code&gt;, inside the anonymous function definition. In this case, &lt;code&gt;sys.function(0)&lt;/code&gt; can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/a/19714566 agstudy's answer] to [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19714153/get-currently-called-function-to-write-anonymous-recursive-function Get currently called function to write anonymous recursive function]

at ''StackOverflow''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the code below squares a list recursively:
&lt;source lang=R&gt;
(function(x) {
  if(is.list(x)) {
    lapply(x, sys.function(0))
  } else {
    x^2
  }
})(list(list(1, 2, 3), list(4, 5)))
&lt;/source&gt;

Other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of [[pi]], defining and investigating the [[Archimedes spiral|spiral]] bearing his name, and creating a system using [[exponentiation]] for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]] and [[statics]], including an explanation of the principle of the [[lever]]. He is credited with designing innovative [[machine]]s, such as his [[Archimedes' screw|screw pump]], [[block and tackle|compound pulleys]], and defensive war machines to protect his native [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] from invasion.

Archimedes died during the [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] when he was killed by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. [[Cicero]] describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a [[sphere]] and a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries.

Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from [[Alexandria]] read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until {{circa|530{{nbsp}}AD}} by [[Isidore of Miletus]] in [[Byzantine]] Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the [[Middle Ages]] were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo, Archimedes, and Renaissance engineers |author=Bursill-Hall, Piers |publisher=sciencelive with the University of Cambridge |url=http://www.sciencelive.org/component/option,com_mediadb/task,view/idstr,CU-MMP-PiersBursillHall/Itemid,30 |accessdate=2007-08-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034534/http://www.sciencelive.org/component/option%2Ccom_mediadb/task%2Cview/idstr%2CCU-MMP-PiersBursillHall/Itemid%2C30 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archimedes&amp;nbsp;– The Palimpsest |publisher=[[Walters Art Museum]] |url=http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/palimpsest_making1.html |accessdate=2007-10-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928102802/http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/palimpsest_making1.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Archimedes was born c. 287&amp;nbsp;BC in the seaport city of [[Syracuse, Sicily]], at that time a self-governing [[Colonies in antiquity|colony]] in [[Magna Graecia]], located along the coast of [[Southern Italy]]. The date of birth is based on a statement by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] historian [[John Tzetzes]] that Archimedes lived for 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. L. Heath|Heath, T.L.]], ''Works of Archimedes'', 1897&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an [[astronomer]] about whom nothing else is known.

During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in [[Alexandria]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], where [[Conon of Samos]] and [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (''[[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'' and the ''[[Archimedes' cattle problem|Cattle Problem]]'') have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}

Archimedes died c. 212&amp;nbsp;BC during the [[Second Punic War]], when Roman forces under General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long [[siege]]. According to the popular account given by [[Plutarch]], Archimedes was contemplating a [[mathematical diagram]] when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a {{nowrap|lesser-known}} account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he must not be harmed.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Death/Histories.html|title = Death of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]|accessdate = 2007-01-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061210060235/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Death/Histories.html| archivedate= 10 December 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcellus called Archimedes "a geometrical [[Hekatonkheires#Hesiod|Briareus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jaeger. Archimedes and the Roman Imagination, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last words attributed to Archimedes are "Do not disturb my circles", a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. This quote is often given in [[Latin]] as "''[[Noli turbare circulos meos]]''," but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch. [[Valerius Maximus]], writing in ''Memorable Doings and Sayings'' in the 1st century AD, gives the phrase as "''...sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli' inquit, 'obsecro, istum disturbare'''" – "... but protecting the dust with his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this.{{'"}} The phrase is also given in [[Katharevousa Greek]] as "μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε!" (''Mē mou tous kuklous taratte!'').&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

[[File:Cicero Discovering the Tomb of Archimedes by Benjamin West.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|''Cicero Discovering the Tomb of Archimedes'' (1805) by [[Benjamin West]]]]

The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a [[sphere]] and a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75&amp;nbsp;BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman [[orator]] [[Cicero]] was serving as [[quaestor]] in [[Sicily]]. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris |last=Rorres |url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html |title=Tomb of Archimedes: Sources |publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=2007-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209201723/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html |archivedate=9 December 2006 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/TombIllus.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes&amp;nbsp;– Illustrations|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate = 2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by [[Polybius]] in his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'' was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and [[Livy]]. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Siege/Polybius.html|title = Siege of Syracuse| publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate = 2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609013114/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Siege/Polybius.html| archivedate= 9 June 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries and inventions==

===Archimedes' principle===
{{main article|Archimedes' principle}}
[[File:03. Реакциска сила кај архимедовиот закон.ogv|thumb|right|250px|By placing a metal bar in a container with water on a scale, the bar displaces as much water as its own [[volume]], increasing its [[mass]] and weighing down the scale.]]
The most widely known [[anecdote]] about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to [[Vitruvius]], a [[votive crown]] for a temple had been made for [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero II of Syracuse]], who had supplied the pure [[gold]] to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some [[silver]] had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith.&lt;ref name="vitruvius"&gt;{{cite web|title = ''De Architectura'', Book IX, paragraphs 9–12, text in English and Latin|author= [[Vitruvius]]| publisher = [[University of Chicago]]|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html|accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its [[density]].
While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the [[volume]] of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Incompressibility of Water|publisher =[[Harvard University]]|url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html|accessdate=2008-02-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080317130651/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html| archivedate= 17 March 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ({{lang-el|"εὕρηκα}}, ''heúrēka''!", meaning "I have found [it]!").&lt;ref name="vitruvius" /&gt; The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Buoyancy|author= [[HyperPhysics]]| publisher =[[Georgia State University]]|url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/pbuoy.html|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714113647/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pbuoy.html#c1| archivedate= 14 July 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement.&lt;ref name="inaccuracy"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html|title = The Golden Crown|publisher = [[Drexel University]]|accessdate = 2009-03-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311051318/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html| archivedate= 11 March 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in [[fluid statics|hydrostatics]] as [[Archimedes' principle]], which he describes in his treatise ''On Floating Bodies''. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Archimedes' Principle''|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll |publisher=[[Weber State University]]|url =http://www.physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/principle.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070808132323/http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/principle.htm| archivedate= 8 August 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of pure gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a pure gold reference sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] considered it "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself."&lt;ref name="galileo"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/bilancetta.html|title = The Golden Crown: Galileo's Balance|publisher = [[Drexel University]]|accessdate = 2009-03-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224221137/http://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/bilancetta.html| archivedate= 24 February 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 12th-century text titled ''Mappae clavicula'' there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem.&lt;ref name="kingcrown"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27690606 O.A.W.

===Archimedes' screw===
{{main article|Archimedes' screw}}
[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|left|The [[Archimedes' screw]] can raise water efficiently.]]
A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the ''[[Syracusia]]'', which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The ''Syracusia'' is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Casson|first= Lionel|authorlink= Lionel Casson|title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World|year=1971 |publisher= Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0691035369}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Aphrodite]] among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the [[Archimedes' screw]] was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a {{nowrap|low-lying}} body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times by [[Vitruvius]] may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World''|author=[[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]] |author2=[[John Peter Oleson|Oleson, John Peter]]| publisher = ''Technology and Culture'' Volume 44, Number 1, January 2003 (PDF)| url =http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/toc/tech44.1.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes' screw&amp;nbsp;– Optimal Design|author=Rorres, Chris| publisher =Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|url =http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Screw/optimal/optimal.html |accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated.gif|An animation of an Archimedes' screw]]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first seagoing [[steamboat|steamship]] with a [[propeller|screw propeller]] was the [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SS Archimedes|publisher= wrecksite.eu |url = http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?636|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claw of Archimedes===
The [[Claw of Archimedes]] is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as "the ship shaker," the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled ''Superweapons of the Ancient World'' built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|title = Archimedes' Claw&amp;nbsp;– Illustrations and Animations&amp;nbsp;– a range of possible designs for the claw| publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Claw/illustrations.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes' Claw&amp;nbsp;– watch an animation|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll|publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/claw.htm|accessdate=2007-08-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813202716/http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/claw.htm| archivedate= 13 August 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat ray===

[[File:Archimedes-Mirror by Giulio Parigi.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic interpretation of Archimedes' mirror used to burn Roman ships.

Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a [[parabolic reflector]] to burn ships attacking [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].
The 2nd century AD author [[Lucian]] wrote that during the [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] (c. 214–212&amp;nbsp;BC), Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, [[Anthemius of Tralles]] mentions [[burning-glass]]es as Archimedes' weapon.&lt;ref&gt;''Hippias'', 2 (cf. [[Galen]], ''On temperaments'' 3.2, who mentions ''pyreia'', "torches"); [[Anthemius of Tralles]], ''On miraculous engines'' 153 [Westerman].&lt;/ref&gt; The device, sometimes called the "Archimedes heat ray", was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. In the modern era, similar devices have been constructed and may be referred to as a [[heliostat]] or [[solar furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =World's Largest Solar Furnace| work = Atlas Obscura| url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-solar-furnace|accessdate= November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. [[René Descartes]] rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[John Wesley]] |url = http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/wesley_natural_philosophy/duten12.htm| title = ''A Compendium of Natural Philosophy'' (1810) Chapter XII, ''Burning Glasses''|publisher = Online text at Wesley Center for Applied Theology|accessdate = 2007-09-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012154432/http://wesley.nnu.edu/john_wesley/wesley_natural_philosophy/duten12.htm |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished [[bronze]] or [[copper]] shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship.

A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the [[Skaramagas]] naval base outside [[Athens]]. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1&amp;nbsp;m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood {{nowrap|mock-up}} of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160&amp;nbsp;feet (50&amp;nbsp;m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of [[bitumen|tar]] paint, which may have aided combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Archimedes' Weapon| publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date = November 26, 1973| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908175,00.html?promoid=googlep|accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}}

In October 2005 a group of students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a {{nowrap|mock-up}} wooden ship at a range of around 100&amp;nbsp;feet (30&amp;nbsp;m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', using a wooden fishing boat in [[San Francisco]] as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its [[autoignition temperature]], which is around 300&amp;nbsp;°C (570&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How Wildfires Work|author= Bonsor, Kevin| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714174036/http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2007 | deadurl= no|date= 2001-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fuels-ignition-temperatures-d_171.html Fuels and Chemicals&amp;nbsp;– Auto Ignition Temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''MythBusters'' broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of "busted" (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. ''MythBusters'' also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.&lt;ref name="death ray"&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes Death Ray: Testing with MythBusters|publisher = MIT| url = http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ''MythBusters'' again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled "President's Challenge". Several experiments were carried out, including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a {{nowrap|mock-up}} of a Roman sailing ship 400&amp;nbsp;feet (120&amp;nbsp;m) away. In all of the experiments, the sail failed to reach the 210&amp;nbsp;°C (410&amp;nbsp;°F) required to catch fire, and the verdict was again "busted". The show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding, [[Glare (vision)|dazzling]], or distracting the crew of the ship.&lt;ref name="death ray2"&gt;{{cite web|title = TV Review: MythBusters 8.27&amp;nbsp;– President's Challenge| url = http://fandomania.com/tv-review-mythbusters-8-27-presidents-challenge/|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discoveries and inventions===
While Archimedes did not invent the [[lever]], he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work ''On the Equilibrium of Planes''. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the [[Peripatetic school]] of the followers of [[Aristotle]], and are sometimes attributed to [[Archytas]].&lt;ref name="lever rorres"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverLaw.html|title = The Law of the Lever According to Archimedes|publisher = [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]|accessdate = 2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lever clagett"&gt;{{cite book |first=Marshall |last=Clagett|url = https://books.google.com/?id=mweWMAlf-tEC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=archytas+lever&amp;q=archytas%20lever| title = Greek Science in Antiquity| publisher = Dover Publications|accessdate = 2010-03-20 |isbn=978-0486419732 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pappus of Alexandria]], Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." ({{lang-el|δῶς μοι πᾶ στῶ καὶ τὰν γᾶν κινάσω}})&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] in ''Synagoge'', Book VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed [[block and tackle|block-and-tackle]] [[pulley]] systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of [[lever]]age to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dougherty, F.C. |author2=Macari, J. |author3=Okamoto, C. |title=Pulleys |publisher=[[Society of Women Engineers]] |url=http://www.swe.org/iac/lp/pulley_03.html |accessdate=2007-07-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718031943/http://www.swe.org/iac/LP/pulley_03.html |archivedate=18 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the [[catapult]], and with inventing the [[odometer]] during the [[First Punic War]].

[[Cicero]] (106–43&amp;nbsp;BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his [[dialogue]] ''[[De re publica]]'', which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129&amp;nbsp;BC. After the capture of Syracuse c. 212&amp;nbsp;BC, General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it thus:

{{Text and translation|''Hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat ut soli luna totidem conversionibus in aere illo quot diebus in ipso caelo succederet, ex quo et in caelo sphaera solis fieret eadem illa defectio, et incideret luna tum in eam metam quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione.''|When Gallus moved the globe, it happened that the Moon followed the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, from which also in the sky the Sun's globe became to have that same eclipse, and the Moon came then to that position which was its shadow on the Earth, when the Sun was in line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''De re publica'' 1.xiv §21|author= [[Cicero]]| publisher =thelatinlibrary.com|url = http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/repub1.shtml#21|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =''De re publica'' Complete e-text in English from Gutenberg.org|author=[[Cicero]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url= http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988|accessdate=2007-09-18|date=2005-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a description of a [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]]. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled {{nowrap|''[[On Sphere-Making]]''}}.

==Mathematics==
[[File:PiArchimede4.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes used [[Pythagoras' Theorem]] to calculate the side of the 12-gon from that of the [[hexagon]] and for each subsequent doubling of the sides of the regular polygon.]]
While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. [[Plutarch]] wrote: "He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Extract from ''Parallel Lives''|author= [[Plutarch]]| publisher = fulltextarchive.com| url = http://fulltextarchive.com/page/Plutarch-s-Lives10/#p35|accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Archimedes was able to use [[infinitesimal]]s in a way that is similar to modern [[Integral|integral calculus]]. Through proof by contradiction ([[reductio ad absurdum]]), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the [[method of exhaustion]], and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'' he did this by drawing a larger [[regular hexagon]] outside a [[circle]] and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3{{sfrac|1|7}} (approximately 3.1429) and 3{{sfrac|10|71}} (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Archimedes on measuring the circle|author= Heath, T.L.| publisher =math.ubc.ca| url =http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/archimedes/circle.html|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also proved that the [[area]] of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the [[square]] of the [[radius]] of the circle (πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]'', Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the [[Archimedean property]] of real numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Archimedean ordered fields| author = Kaye, R.W.| publisher = web.mat.bham.ac.uk| url = http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/seqser/archfields| accessdate = 2009-11-07| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316065753/http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/seqser/archfields| archive-date = 2009-03-16| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parabolic segment and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|150px|right|As proven by Archimedes, the area of the [[parabola|parabolic]] segment in the upper figure is equal to 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle in the lower figure.]]
In ''Measurement of a Circle'', Archimedes gives the value of the [[square root]] of 3 as lying between {{sfrac|265|153}} (approximately 1.7320261) and {{sfrac|1351|780}} (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused [[John Wallis]] to remark that he was: "as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heath, T.L. ''Works of Archimedes'', Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0486420841}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that he used an [[iteration|iterative]] procedure to calculate these values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Computation of Pi by Archimedes|author= McKeeman, Bill| author-link=William M. McKeeman| publisher =Matlab Central| url = http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29504-the-computation-of-pi-by-archimedes/content/html/ComputationOfPiByArchimedes.html#37|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'', Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is {{sfrac|4|3}} times the area of a corresponding inscribed [[triangle]] as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an [[Series (mathematics)#History of the theory of infinite series|infinite]] [[geometric series]] with the [[Geometric series#Common ratio|common ratio]] {{sfrac|1|4}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty 4^{-n} = 1 + 4^{-1} + 4^{-2} + 4^{-3} + \cdots = {4\over 3}. \;&lt;/math&gt;

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller [[secant line]]s, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series {{nowrap|[[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]]}} which sums to {{sfrac|1|3}}.

In ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: "There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]]), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited." To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the [[myriad]]. The word is from the Greek {{lang|grc|μυριάς}} ''murias'', for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 [[Names of large numbers|vigintillion]], or 8{{e|63}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Sand Reckoner |first=Bradley W |last=Carroll|publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/sand.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813215029/http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/sand.htm| archivedate= 13 August 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
The works of Archimedes were written in [[Doric Greek]], the dialect of ancient [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of ancient Greece By Wilson, Nigel Guy  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&amp;pg=PA77 p. 77] {{ISBN|0794502253}} (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The written work of Archimedes has not survived as well as that of [[Euclid]], and seven of his treatises are known to have existed only through references made to them by other authors. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] mentions ''[[On Sphere-Making]]'' and another work on [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], while [[Theon of Alexandria]] quotes a remark about [[refraction]] from the {{nowrap|now-lost}} ''Catoptrica''.{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in [[Alexandria]]. The writings of Archimedes were first collected by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Greek architect [[Isidore of Miletus]] (c. 530&amp;nbsp;AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (836–901&amp;nbsp;AD), and Latin by [[Gerard of Cremona]] (c. 1114–1187&amp;nbsp;AD). During the [[Renaissance]], the ''Editio Princeps'' (First Edition) was published in [[Basel]] in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Editions of Archimedes' Work|publisher = Brown University Library| url = http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/math/wholefr.html|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070808235638/http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/math/wholefr.html| archivedate= 8 August 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 1586 [[Galileo Galilei]] invented a hydrostatic balance for weighing metals in air and water after apparently being inspired by the work of Archimedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Galileo Project: Hydrostatic Balance|author=Van Helden, Al|publisher = [[Rice University]]| url = http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/balance.html|accessdate=2007-09-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070905185039/http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/balance.html| archivedate= 5 September 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surviving works===
* ''[[On the Equilibrium of Planes]]'' (two volumes)
:The first book is in fifteen propositions with seven [[Axiom|postulates]], while the second book is in ten propositions. In this work Archimedes explains the ''[[Torque|Law of the Lever]]'', stating, "Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights."
:Archimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]] of various geometric figures including [[triangle]]s, [[parallelogram]]s and [[parabola]]s.&lt;ref name="works"&gt;{{cite book |author =Heath, T.L.|url = https://archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp|title = The Works of Archimedes (1897).

* ''[[Measurement of a Circle|On the Measurement of a Circle]]''
:This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of [[Conon of Samos]]. In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an [[Approximations of π|approximation]] of the value of pi ({{pi}}), showing that it is greater than {{sfrac|223|71}} and less than {{sfrac|22|7}}.
* ''[[On Spirals]]''
:This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the [[Archimedean spiral]]. It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant [[angular velocity]]. Equivalently, in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] ({{math|''r''}}, {{math|θ}}) it can be described by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;\, r=a+b\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:with [[real number]]s {{math|a}} and {{math|b}}. This is an early example of a [[Curve|mechanical curve]] (a curve traced by a moving [[point (geometry)|point]]) considered by a Greek mathematician.
* ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder|On the Sphere and the Cylinder]]'' (two volumes)
[[File:Esfera Arquímedes.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder including its bases. A [[sphere]] and [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request. (see also: [[Equiareal map]])]]
:In this treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a [[sphere]] and a [[circumscribe]]d [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and [[diameter]]. The volume is {{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the sphere, and 2{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the cylinder. The surface area is 4{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the sphere, and 6{{pi}}{{math|''r''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the cylinder (including its two bases), where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere and cylinder. The sphere has a volume {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the circumscribed cylinder. Similarly, the sphere has an area  {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the cylinder (including the bases). A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.
* ''[[On Conoids and Spheroids]]''
:This is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of [[cross section (geometry)|sections]] of [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], spheres, and paraboloids.
* ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' (two volumes)
:In the first part of this treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as [[Eratosthenes]] that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not {{nowrap|self-gravitating}}, since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.

:In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float. [[Archimedes' principle]] of buoyancy is given in the work, stated as follows: {{quote|Any body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in sense to, the weight of the fluid displaced.}}
* ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''
:In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a [[triangle]] with equal base and height. He achieves this by calculating the value of a [[geometric series]] that sums to infinity with the [[ratio]] {{sfrac|1|4}}.

:This is a [[dissection puzzle]] similar to a [[Tangram]], and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a [[square]]. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of [[Stanford University]] in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square.

:This work was discovered by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in [[Wolfenbüttel]], Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the [[The Cattle of Helios|Herd of the Sun]] by solving a number of simultaneous [[Diophantine equation]]s. There is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be [[square number]]s. This version of the problem was first solved by A.

:In this treatise, Archimedes counts the number of grains of sand that will fit inside the universe. This book mentions the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System|solar system]] proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]], as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the [[myriad]], Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8{{e|63}} in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. ''The Sand Reckoner'' or ''Psammites'' is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =English translation of ''The Sand Reckoner'' |publisher = [[University of Waterloo]]| url = http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/reckoner.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811235335/http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/reckoner.shtml| archivedate= 11 August 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''
:This treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|infinitesimals]], and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the [[method of exhaustion]] to derive the results. As with ''The Cattle Problem'', ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'' was written in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes in [[Alexandria]].

===Apocryphal works===
Archimedes' ''[[Book of Lemmas]]'' or ''Liber Assumptorum'' is a treatise with fifteen propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The scholars [[T.L. Heath]] and [[Marshall Clagett]] argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The ''Lemmas'' may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Archimedes' Book of Lemmas| publisher = [[cut-the-knot]]| url = http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/BookOfLemmas/index.shtml|accessdate= 2007-08-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711111858/http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/BookOfLemmas/index.shtml| archivedate= 11 July 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that [[Heron's formula]] for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} However, the first reliable reference to the formula is given by [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] in the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Heron of Alexandria |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Heron.html|date=April 1999|accessdate= 2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archimedes Palimpsest.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|In 1906, The Archimedes Palimpsest revealed works by Archimedes thought to have been lost.]]
The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. In 1906, the Danish professor [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] visited [[Constantinople]] and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered that it was a [[palimpsest]], a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as [[vellum]] was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Reading Between the Lines|author= Miller, Mary K.| publisher= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=March 2007| url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/archimedes.html| accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s.

==Notes==
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}}In the preface to ''On Spirals'' addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium, Archimedes says that "many years have elapsed since Conon's death." [[Conon of Samos]] lived {{nowrap|c. 280–220 BC}}, suggesting that Archimedes may have been an older man when writing some of his works.

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}}The treatises by Archimedes known to exist only through references in the works of other authors are: ''[[On Sphere-Making]]'' and a work on polyhedra mentioned by Pappus of Alexandria; ''Catoptrica'', a work on optics mentioned by [[Theon of Alexandria]]; ''Principles'', addressed to Zeuxippus and explaining the number system used in ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''; ''On Balances and Levers''; ''On Centers of Gravity''; ''On the Calendar''. Of the surviving works by Archimedes, [[T.L. Heath]] offers the following suggestion as to the order in which they were written: ''On the Equilibrium of Planes I'', ''The Quadrature of the Parabola'', ''On the Equilibrium of Planes II'', ''On the Sphere and the Cylinder I, II'', ''On Spirals'', ''On Conoids and Spheroids'', ''On Floating Bodies I, II'', ''On the Measurement of a Circle'', ''The Sand Reckoner''.

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}}[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Boyer, Carl Benjamin]] ''A History of Mathematics'' (1991) {{ISBN|0471543977}} "Arabic scholars inform us that the familiar area formula for a triangle in terms of its three sides, usually known as Heron's formula&amp;nbsp;— ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''s''(''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a'')(''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'')(''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''c'')}}, where ''s'' is the semiperimeter&amp;nbsp;— was known to Archimedes several centuries before Heron lived. Arabic scholars also attribute to Archimedes the 'theorem on the broken [[chord (geometry)|chord]]'&amp;nbsp;... Archimedes is reported by the Arabs to have given several proofs of the theorem."

'''d.''' {{Note_label|D|d|none}} "It was usual to smear the seams or even the whole hull with pitch or with pitch and wax".

The '''axiom of reducibility''' was introduced by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the early 20th century as part of his [[Type theory|ramified theory of types]]. Russell devised and introduced the axiom in an attempt to manage the contradictions he had discovered in his analysis of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Type Theory|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=29 March 2012|author=Thierry Coquand|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With Russell's discovery (1901, 1902)&lt;ref&gt;According to van Heijenoort 1967:124, Russell discovered the paradox in June 1901. van Heijenoort in turn references Bertrand Russell (1944) "My mental development" in ''The philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp (Tudor, New York), page 13. But Russell did not report it to Frege until his letter to Frege dated 16 June 1902. Livio 2009:186 reports the same date. Livio 2009:191 writes that Zermelo discovered the paradox as early as 1900, but does not give his source for this (Ewald 1996?). Indeed, Zermelo makes this claim in a footnote 9 to his 1908 ''A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering'' in van Heijenoort 1967:191.&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[paradox]] in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'' and Frege's acknowledgment of the same (1902), Russell tentatively introduced his solution as "Appendix B: Doctrine of Types" in his 1903 ''The Principles of Mathematics''.&lt;ref&gt;cf Introductory remarks by W. V. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Russell's paradox|contradiction]] can be stated as "the class of all classes that do not contain themselves as elements".&lt;ref&gt;cf Introductory remarks by W. V. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this appendix Russell asserts that his "doctrine" would solve the immediate problem posed by Frege, but "there is at least one closely analogous contradiction which is probably not soluble by this doctrine. The totality of all logical objects, or of all propositions, involves, it would seem a fundamental logical difficulty. What the complete solution of the difficulty may be, I have not succeeded in discovering; but as it affects the very foundations of reasoning..."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:528&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in van Heijenoort 150–182&lt;/ref&gt; Russell had studied "the contradictions" (among them the [[Epimenides paradox]], the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], and [[Richard's paradox]]) and concluded that "In all the contradictions there is a common characteristic, which we may describe as self-reference or reflexiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908:154. The exact wording appears in Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:60&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1903, Russell defined ''predicative'' functions as those whose order is one more than the highest-order function occurring in the expression of the function. While these were fine for the situation, ''impredicative'' functions had to be disallowed:

{{quote|A function whose argument is an individual and whose value is always a first-order proposition will be called a first-order function. A function involving a first-order function or proposition as apparent variable will be called a second-order function, and so on. A function of one variable which is of the order next above that of its argument will be called a ''predicative'' function; the same name will be given to a function of several variables [etc].&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908a in van Heijenoort 1967:165.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He repeats this definition in a slightly different way later in the paper (together with a subtle prohibition that they would express more clearly in 1913):

{{quote|A predicative function of ''x'' is one whose values are propositions of the type next above that of ''x'', if ''x'' is an individual or a proposition, or that of values of ''x'' if ''x'' is a function. It may be described as one in which the apparent variables, if any, are all of the same type as ''x'' or of lower type; and a variable is of lower type than ''x'' '''if it can significantly occur as argument to ''x'', or as argument to an argument to ''x'', and so forth.''' [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908a in van Heijenoort 1967:169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This usage carries over to [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and Russell's 1913 ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' wherein the authors devote an entire subsection of their Chapter II: "The Theory of Logical Types" to subchapter I. ''The Vicious-Circle Principle'': "We will define a function of one variable as ''predicative'' when it is of the next order above that of its argument, i.e. of the lowest order compatible with its having that argument. . . A function of several arguments is predicative if there is one of its arguments such that, when the other arguments have values assigned to them, we obtain a predicative function of the one undetermined argument."&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:53&lt;/ref&gt;

They again propose the definition of a ''predicative function'' as one that does not violate The Theory of Logical Types. Indeed the authors assert such violations are "incapable [to achieve]" and "impossible":

{{quote|We are thus led to the conclusion, both from the vicious-circle principle and from direct inspection, that the functions to which a given object ''a'' can be an argument are incapable of being arguments to each other, and that they have no term in common with the functions to which they can be arguments. We are thus led to construct a hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The authors stress the word ''impossible'':

{{quote|if we are not mistaken, that not only is it impossible for a function φz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; to have itself or anything derived from it as argument, but that, if ψz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; is another function such there are arguments ''a'' with which both "φa" and "ψa" are significant, then ψz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; and anything derived from it cannot significantly be argument to φz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In the original z&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; is z with a circumflex (hat) over it, etc. Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:47&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Russell's axiom of reducibility==
The axiom of reducibility states that any truth function (i.e. [[propositional function]]) can be expressed by a formally equivalent ''predicative'' truth function. It made its first appearance in [[Bertrand Russell]]'s (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'', but only after some five years of trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;cf commentary by [[W. V. Quine]] in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152&lt;/ref&gt; In his words: 
{{quote|Thus a predicative function of an individual is a first-order function; and for higher types of arguments, predicative functions take the place that first-order functions take in respect of individuals. We assume then, that every function is equivalent, for all its values, to some predicative function of the same argument. This assumption seems to be the essence of the usual assumption of classes [modern sets] . . . we will call this assumption the ''axiom of classes'', or the '''''axiom of reducibility'''''.&lt;ref&gt;boldface added, cf Russell 1908 reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For relations (functions of two variables such as "For all x and for all y, those values for which f(x,y) is true" i.e. ∀x∀y: f(x,y)), Russell assumed an ''axiom of relations'', or [the same] '''''axiom of reducibility'''''.

In 1903, he proposed a possible process of evaluating such a 2-place function by comparing the process to double integration: One after another, plug into ''x'' definite values ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (i.e. the particular ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is "a constant" or a parameter held constant), then evaluate f(''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') across all the ''n'' instances of possible ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. For all ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' evaluate f(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), then for all ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' evaluate f(''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), etc until all the ''x'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are exhausted). This would create an ''m'' by ''n'' matrix of values: TRUE or UNKNOWN. (In this exposition, the use of indices is a modern convenience.) 

In 1908, Russell made no mention of this [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of ''x'', ''y'' values that render a two-place function (e.g. relation) TRUE, but by 1913 he has introduced a matrix-like concept into "function". In *12 of [[Principia Mathematica]] (1913) he defines "a matrix" as "any function, of however many variables, which does not involve any apparent variables. Then any possible function other than a matrix is derived from a matrix by means of generalisation, i.e. by considering the proposition which asserts that the function in question is true with all possible values or with some values of one of the arguments, the other argument or arguments remaining undetermined".&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913:162&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if one asserts that "∀y: f(x, y) is true", then ''x'' is the apparent variable because it is unspecified. 

Russell now defines a matrix of "individuals" as a ''first-order'' matrix, and he follows a similar process to define a ''second-order matrix'', etc. Finally, he introduces the definition of a ''predicative function'':

{{quote|A function is said to be ''predicative'' when it is a matrix. It will be observed that, in a hierarchy in which all the variables are individuals or matrices, a matrix is the same thing as an elementary function [cf 1913:127, meaning: the function contains ''no'' apparent variables]. ¶ "Matrix" or "predicative function" is a primitive idea.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913:164&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this reasoning, he then uses the same wording to propose the same ''axioms of reducibility'' as he did in his 1908.

As an aside, Russell in his 1903 considered, and then rejected, "a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples",&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:99&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the modern set-theoretic notion of [[ordered pair]]. An intuitive version of this notion appeared in Frege's (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' (translated in van Heijenoort 1967:23); Russell's 1903 followed closely the work of Frege (cf Russell 1903:505ff). Russell worried that "it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent from the relatum: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. It would seem, viewing the idea philosophically, that sense can only be derived from some relational proposition . . . it seems therefore more correct to take an [[intension]]al view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:99&lt;/ref&gt; As shown below, [[Norbert Wiener]] (1914) reduced the notion of relation to class by his definition of an ordered pair.

==Criticism==

===Zermelo 1908===
The outright prohibition implied by Russell's ''axiom of reducibility'' was roundly criticised by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I'', stung as he was by a demand similar to that of Russell that came from [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]:

{{quote|According to Poincaré (1906, p. 307) a definition is "predicative" and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are "dependent" upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it.&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo (1908) ''The possibility of a well-ordering'' reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zermelo countered:

{{quote|A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo (1908) ''The possibility of a well-ordering'' reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wiener 1914===
In his 1914 ''A simplification of the logic of relations'', [[Norbert Wiener]] removed the need for the axiom of reducibility as applied to relations between two variables ''x'', and ''y'' e.g. φ(''x'',''y''). He did this by introducing a way to express a relation as a set of ordered pairs: "It will be seen that what we have done is practically to revert to Schröder's treatment of a relation as a class [set] of ordered couples".&lt;ref&gt;Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:226&lt;/ref&gt; Van Heijenoort observes that "[b]y giving a definition of the ordered pair of two-elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes."&lt;ref&gt;Wiener in van Heijenoort 1967:224&lt;/ref&gt; But Wiener opined that while he had dispatched Russell and Whitehead's two-variable version of the axiom *12.11, the single-variable version of the axiom of reducibility for (axiom *12.1 in ''Principia Mathematica'') was still necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wittgenstein 1918===
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], while imprisoned in a prison camp, finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. His introduction credits "the great works of Frege and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell". Not a self-effacing intellectual, he pronounced that "the ''truth'' of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved."&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:4&lt;/ref&gt; So given such an attitude, it is no surprise that Russell's theory of types comes under criticism:

:In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a role; it must admit of being established without mention being thereby made of the ''meaning'' of a sign; it ought to presuppose ''only'' the description of the expressions.

This appears to support the same argument Russell uses to erase his "paradox". This "using the signs" to "speak of the signs" Russell criticises in his introduction that preceded the original English translation:

{{quote|What causes hesitation is the fact that, after all, Mr Wittgenstein manages to say a good deal about what cannot be said, thus suggesting to the sceptical reader that possibly there may be some loophole through a hierarchy of languages, or by some other exit.}}

This problem appears later when Wittgenstein arrives at this gentle disavowal of the axiom of reducibility—one interpretation of the following is that Wittgenstein is saying that Russell has made (what is known today as) a [[category error]]; Russell has asserted (inserted into the theory) a "further law of logic" when ''all'' the laws (e.g. the unbounded [[Sheffer stroke]] adopted by Wittgenstein) have ''already'' been asserted:

{{quote|6.123
:It is clear that the laws of logic cannot themselves obey further logical laws. (There is not, as Russell supposed, for every "type" a special law of contradiction; but one is sufficient, since it is not applied to itself.)
6.1231
:The mark of logical propositions is not their general validity. To be general is only to be accidentally valid for all things. An ungeneralised proposition can be tautologous just as well as a generalised one.
6.1232
:Logical general validity, we could call essential as opposed to accidental general validity, e.g., of the proposition "all men are mortal". Propositions like Russell's "axiom of reducibility" are not logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, they can only be true by a happy chance.
6.1233
:We can imagine a world in which the axiom of reducibility is not valid. But it is clear that logic has nothing to do with the question of whether our world is really of this kind or not.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Russell 1919===
Russell in his 1919 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', a non-mathematical companion to his first edition of ''PM'', discusses his Axiom of Reducibility in Chapter 17 ''Classes'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;146ff).  He concludes that "we cannot accept "class" as a primitive idea; the symbols for classes are "mere conveniences" and classes are "logical fictions, or (as we say) 'incomplete symbols' ... classes cannot be regarded as part of the ultimate furniture of the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;146). The reason for this is because of the problem of impredicativity: "classes cannot be regarded as a species of individuals, on account of the contradiction about classes which are not members of themselves ... and because we can prove that the number of classes is greater than the number of individuals, [etc]". What he then does is propose 5 obligations that must be satisfied with respect to a theory of classes, and the result is his axiom of reducibility. He states that this axiom is "a generalised form of Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles" (p.&amp;nbsp;155). But he concludes Leibniz's assumption is not necessarily true for all possible predicates in all possible worlds, so he concludes that:

{{quote|I do not see any reason to believe that the axiom of reducibility is logically necessary, which is what would be meant by saying that it is true in all possible worlds. The admission of this axiom into a system of logic is therefore a defect ... a dubious assumption. (p. 155)}}

The goal that he sets for himself then is "adjustments to his theory" of avoiding classes:
{{quote|in its reduction of propositions nominally about classes to propositions about their defining functions. The avoidance of classes as entities by this method must, it would be seem, be sound in principle, however the detail may still require adjustment. (p. 155)}}

===Skolem 1922===
[[Thoralf Skolem]] in his 1922 ''Some remarks on axiomatised set theory'' took a less than positive attitude toward "Russell and Whitehead" (i.e. their work ''Principia Mathematica''):

{{quote|Until now, so far as I know, only ''one'' such system of axioms has found rather general acceptance, namely that constructed by Zermelo (1908). Russell and Whitehead, too, constructed a system of logic that provides a foundation for set theory; if I am not mistaken, however, mathematicians have taken but little interest in it.&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:291&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skolem then observes the problems of what he called "nonpredicative definition" in the set theory of Zermelo:&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo stipulates that there exist "a domain ''B'' of objects, among which are the sets." But by a theorem Zermelo proves that this domain ''B'' cannot be a set itself "and this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned."(cf Zermelo 1908 in van Heijenoort:203) The ultimate problem (to be answered by Skolem [1922] and Fraenkel [1922]) is a precise definition of Zermelo's notion of ''definite property'' which, via Zermelo's Axiom of separation (Axiom der Aussonderung), when applied via a propositional function to a set ''M'', separates from ''M'' a subset e.g. ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:292).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the difficulty is that we have to form some sets whose existence depends upon ''all'' sets ... Poincaré called this kind of definition and regarded it as the real logical weakness of set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:297. In a footnote 7 to the quotation above, he backs this up with a demonstration derived from the axioms of Zermelo: "A typical nonpredicative stipulation, is for example that the intersection of all sets that have an arbitrary definite property ''E'' again be a set. This in fact follows from the axioms [etc]."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While Skolem is mainly addressing a problem with Zermelo's set theory, he does make this observation about the ''axiom of reducibility'':

{{quote|they [Russell and Whitehead], too, simply content themselves with circumventing the difficulty by introducing a stipulation, the ''axiom of reducibility''. Actually, this axiom decrees that the nonpredicative stipulations will be satisfied. There is no proof of that; besides, so far as I can see, such a proof must be impossible from Russell and Whitehead's point of view as well as from Zermelo's. [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:297&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Russell 1927===
In his 1927 ''Introduction'' to the second edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' Russell criticises his own axiom:

{{quote|One point in regard to which improvement is obviously desirable is the axiom of reducibility (*12.1.11). This axiom has a purely pragmatic justification: it leads to the desired results, and to no others. But clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content. On this subject, however, it cannot be said that a satisfactory solution is as yet obtainable. ... There is another course recommended by Wittgenstein† [† ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', *5.54ff] for philosophical reasons. This is to assume that functions of propositions are always truth-functions, and that a function can only occur as in a proposition through its values. There are difficulties ... It involves the consequence that all functions of functions are extensional. ... [But the consequences of his logic are that] the theory of infinite Dedekindian and well-ordering collapses, so that irrationals, and real numbers generally, can no longer be adequately dealt with. Also Cantor's proof that 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''n'' breaks down unless ''n'' is finite. Perhaps some further axiom, less objectionable than the axiom of reducibility, might give these results, but we have not succeeded in finding such an axiom.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the 2nd Edition 1927 of Whitehead and Russell 1913:xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wittgenstein's 5.54ff is more centred on the notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]]:

{{quote|5.54
:In the general propositional form, propositions occur in a proposition only as bases of the truth-operations.
5.541
:At first sight it appears as if there were also a different way in which one proposition could occur in another. ¶ Especially in certain propositional forms of psychology, like "A thinks, that ''p'' is the case," or "A thinks ''p''," etc.  ¶ Here it appears superficially as if the proposition ''p'' stood to the object A in a kind of relation.  ¶ (And in modern epistemology [Russell, Moore, etc.] those propositions have been conceived in this way.)
5.542
:But it is clear that "A believes that ''p'', "A thinks ''p''", "A says ''p''", are of the form " ' ''p'' ' thinks ''p'' "; and here we have no co-ordination of a fact and an object, but a co-ordination of facts by means of a co-ordination of their objects.
5.5421 [etc: "A composite soul would not be a soul any longer."]
5.5422
:The correct explanation of the form of the proposition "A judges ''p''" must show that it is impossible to judge a nonsense. (Russell's theory does not satisfy this condition).&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A possible interpretation of Wittgenstein's stance is that the thinker A i.e. ''{{'}}p{{'}}'' ''is identically'' the thought ''p'', in this way the "soul" remains a unit and not a composite. So to utter "the thought thinks the thought" is nonsense, because per 5.542 the utterance does not specify anything.

===von Neumann 1925===
John von Neumann in his 1925 ''An axiomatisation of set theory'' wrestled with the same issues as did Russell, Zermelo, Skolem, and Fraenkel. He summarily rejected the effort of Russell:

{{quote|Here Russell, J. Konig, Weyl, and Brouwer must be mentioned. They arrived at entirely different results [from the set theorists], but the over-all effect of their activity seems to me outright devastating. In Russell, all of mathematics and set theory seems to rest upon the highly problematic "axiom of reducibility", while Weyl and Brouwer systematically reject the larger part of mathematics and set theory as completely meaningless.&lt;ref&gt; von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then notes the work of the set theorists Zermelo, Fraenkel and Schoenflies, in which "one understands by "set" nothing but an object of which one knows no more and wants to know no more than what follows about it from the postulates. The postulates [of set theory] are to be formulated in such a way that all the desired theorems of Cantor's set theory follow from them, but not the antinomies.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt;

While he mentions the efforts of [[David Hilbert]] to prove the consistency of his axiomatisation of mathematics&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt; von Neumann placed him in the same group as Russell. Rather, von Neumann considered his proposal to be "in the spirit of the second group ... We must, however, avoid forming sets by collecting or separating elements [durch Zusammenfassung oder Aussonderung von Elementen], and so on, as well as eschew the unclear principle of 'definiteness' that can still be found in Zermelo. [...] We prefer, however, to axiomatise not 'set' but 'function'."&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:401&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Heijenoort observes that ultimately this axiomatic system of von Neumann's, "was simplified, revised, and expanded ... and it come to be known as the von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory."&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:394&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hilbert 1927===
[[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert system|axiomatic system]] that he presents in his 1925 ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' is the mature expression of a task he set about in the early 1900s but let lapse for a while (cf his 1904 ''On the foundations of logic and arithmetic''). His system is neither set theoretic nor derived directly from Russell and Whitehead. Rather, it invokes 13 axioms of logic—four axioms of Implication, six axioms of logical AND and logical OR, 2 axioms of logical negation, and 1 ε-axiom ("existence" axiom)-- plus a version of the [[Peano axioms]] in 4 axioms including [[mathematical induction]], some definitions that "have the character of axioms, and certain ''recursion axioms'' that result from a general recursion schema"&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467&lt;/ref&gt; plus some formation rules that "govern the use of the axioms".&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hilbert states that, with regard to this system, i.e. "Russell and Whitehead's theory of foundations[,] ... the foundation that it provides for mathematics rests, first, upon the axiom of infinity and, then upon what is called the axiom of reducibility, and both of these axioms are genuine contentual assumptions that are not supported by a consistency proof; they are assumptions whose validity in fact remains dubious and that, in any case, my theory does not require ... reducibility is not presupposed in my theory ... the execution of the reduction would be required only in case a proof of a contradiction were given, and then, according to my proof theory, this reduction would always be bound to succeed."&lt;ref&gt;Boldface added, Hilbert in van Heijenoort 1967:473&lt;/ref&gt;

It is upon this foundation that modern [[recursion theory]] rests.

===Ramsey 1925===
In 1925, [[Frank Plumpton Ramsey]] argued that it is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;The Foundations of Mathematics (1925), pages 1..61 of ''The Foundations of Mathematics'', F. P. Ramsey, Littlefield Adams &amp; Co, Paterson New Jersey, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; However in the second edition of [[Principia Mathematica]] (1927, page xiv) and in Ramsey's 1926 paper&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical Logic, pages 62..61, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; it is stated that certain theorems about [[real numbers]] could not be proved using Ramsey's approach.  Most later mathematical formalisms (Hilbert's [[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalism]] or [[Brower]]'s [[Intuitionism]] for example) do not use it.

Ramsey showed that it is possible to reformulate the definition of ''predicative'' by using the definitions in [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].  As a result, all functions of a given order are ''predicative'', irrespective of how they are expressed.  He goes on to show that his formulation still avoids the paradoxes.  However, the "Tractatus" theory did not appear strong enough to prove some mathematical results.

===Gödel 1944===
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'' offers in the words of his commentator Charles Parsons, "[what] might be seen as a defense of these [realist] attitudes of Russell against the reductionism prominent in his philosophy and implicit in much of his actual logical work. It was perhaps the most robust defense of realism about mathematics and its objects since the paradoxes and come to the consciousness of the mathematical world after 1900".&lt;ref&gt;This commentary appears on pages 102–118, and the paper itself on pages 119–141 appears in 1990 ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works, Volume II'', Oxford University Press, New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, Gödel is sympathetic to the notion that a propositional function can be reduced to (identified with) the ''real objects'' that satisfy it, but this causes problems with respect to the theory of real numbers, and even integers (p.&amp;nbsp;134). He observes that the first edition of ''PM'' "abandoned" the realist (constructivistic) "attitude" with his proposal of the axiom of reducibility (p.&amp;nbsp;133). However, within the introduction to the second edition of ''PM'' (1927) Gödel asserts "the constructivistic attitude is resumed again" (p.&amp;nbsp;133) when Russell "dropped" of the axiom of reducibility in favour of the matrix (truth-functional) theory; Russell "stated explicitly that all primitive predicates belong to the lowest type and that the only purpose of variables (and evidently also of constants) is to make it possible to assert more complicated truth-functions of atomic propositions ... [i.e.] the higher types and orders are solely a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]]''" (p.&amp;nbsp;134). But this only works when the number of individuals and primitive predicates is finite, for one can construct finite strings of symbols such as:
:&lt;math&gt;x = a_1 \vee x = a_2 \vee \dots \vee x = a_k&lt;/math&gt; [example on page 134]
And from such strings one can form strings of strings to obtain the equivalent of classes of classes, with a mixture of types possible. However, from such finite strings the whole of mathematics cannot be constructed because they cannot be "analyzed", i.e. reducible to the law of identity or disprovable by a negations of the law:
{{quote|Even the theory of integers is non-analytic, provided that one requires of the rules of elimination that they allow one actually to carry out the elimination in a finite number of steps in each case.&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Because this would imply the existence of a decision procedure for all arithmetical propositions. Cf. ''Turing 1937''.) ... [Thus] the whole of mathematics as applied to sentences of infinite length has to be presupposed to prove [the] analyticity [of the theory of integers], e.g., the axiom of choice can be proved to be analytic only if is assumed to be true. (p. 139)}}

But he observes that "this procedure seems to presuppose arithmetic in some form or other" (p.&amp;nbsp;134), and he states in the next paragraph that "the question of whether (or to what extent) the theory of integers can be obtained on the basis of the ramified hierarchy must be considered as unsolved." (p.&amp;nbsp;135)

Gödel proposed that one should take a "more conservative approach":

{{quote|make the meaning of the terms "class" and "concept" clearer, and to set up a consistent theory of classes and concepts as objectively existing entities. This is the course which the actual development of mathematical logic has been taking ... Major among the attempts in this direction  ... are the simple theory of types ... and axiomatic set theory, both of which have been successful at least to this extent, that they permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes. Many symptoms show only too clearly, however, that the primitive concepts need further elucidation. (p. 140)}}

===W. V. Quine 1967===
In a critique that also discusses the pros and cons of Ramsey (1931)&lt;ref&gt;W. V. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152&lt;/ref&gt; Quine calls Russell's formulation of "types" to be "troublesome ... the confusion persists as he attempts to define {{'}}''n''th order propositions'... the method is indeed oddly devious ... the axiom of reducibility is self-effacing", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) in van Heijenoort 1967:151&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kleene Quine observes that Ramsey (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:532 gives this reference: "Ramsey, F. P. 1926, ''The foundations of mathematics'', Proc. London Math. Soc., ser. 2, vol. 25, pp. 338–384. Reprinted as pp. 1–61 in ''The foundations of mathematics and other logical essays'' by F. P. Ramsey, ed. by R. B. Braithwaite, London (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner) and new your (Harcourt, brace) 1931. The latter reprinted London (Routledge and Kegan Paul) and New York (Humanities Press) 1950."&lt;/ref&gt; (1931) divided the various paradoxes into two varieties (i) "those of pure set theory" and (ii) those derived from "semantic concepts such as falsity and specifiability", and Ramsey believed that the second variety should have been left out of Russell's solution. Quine ends with the opinion that "because of the confusion of propositions with sentences, and of attributes with their expressions, Russell's purported solution of the semantic paradoxes was enigmatic anyway."&lt;ref&gt;W. V. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152. Kleene (1952) is less sanguine about the problem of the paradoxes, cf Kleene 1952:43. Kleene 1952 analyzes the situation this way: that Ramsey 1926 classifies the paradoxes as the "logical" versus the "epistomolical or "semantical" and Ramsey observes that the logical antinomies are (apparently) stopped by the simple hierarchy of types, and the semantical ones are (apparently) prevented ... by the absence ... of the requisite means for referring to expressions in the same language. But Ramsey's arguments to justify impredicative definitions within a type entail a conception of the totality of predicates of the type as existing independently of their constructibility or definability"; thus neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded (see at Kleene 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephen Kleene 1952===
In his section '''§12. First inferences from the paradoxes''', subchapter "LOGICISM" Kleene (1952) traces the development of Russell's theory of types:
{{quote|To adapt the logicistic [sic] construction of mathematics to the situation arising from the discovery of the paradoxes, Russell excluded impredicative definitions by his ''ramified theory of types'' (1908, 1910).&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kleene observes that "to exclude impredicative definitions within a type, the types above type 0 [primary objects or individuals "not subjected to logical analysis"] are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1 [properties of individuals, i.e. logical results of the [[propositional calculus]] ], properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to ''order'' 0, and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order below to the next higher order)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene, however, parenthetically observes that "the logicistic definition of natural number now becomes predicative when the [property] P in it is specified to range only over properties of a given order; in [this] case the property of being a natural number is of the next higher order".&lt;ref&gt;Slight punctuation changes added for clarity, Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt; But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which [see Kleene's example at [[Impredicativity]]] contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his ''axiom of reducibility''.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt; But, Kleene wonders, "on what grounds should we believe in the axiom of reducibility?"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that, whereas ''Principia Mathematica'' is presented as derived from ''intuitively''-derived axioms that "were intended to be believed about the world, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world[,] ... if properties are to be constructed, the matter should be settled on the basis of constructions, not by an axiom." Indeed, he quotes Whitehead and Russell (1927) questioning their own axiom: "clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45, quoting from Whitehead and Russell's introduction to their 1927 2nd edition of ''Principia Mathematica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene references work of Ramsey 1926 but notes that "neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded in attaining the logicistic goal constructively" and "an interesting proposal ... by Langford 1927 and Carnap 1931-2, is also not free of difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;both quotes from Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt; Kleene ends this discussion with quotes from Weyl (1946) that "the system of ''Principia Mathematica'' ... [is founded on] a sort of logician's paradise" and anyone "who is ready to believe in this 'transcendental world' could also accept the system of axiomatic set theory (Zermelo, Fraenkel, etc), which, for the deduction of mathematics, has the advantage of being simpler in structure."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], in particular in [[computer algebra|computational algebra]], the '''Berlekamp&amp;ndash;Zassenhaus algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for factoring [[polynomial]]s over the [[integer]]s, named after [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Hans Zassenhaus]]. As a consequence of [[Gauss's lemma (number theory)|Gauss's lemma]], this amounts to solving the problem also over the rationals.

The algorithm starts by finding factorizations over suitable [[finite field]]s using [[Hensel's lemma]] to lift the solution from modulo a prime&amp;nbsp;''p'' to a convenient power of&amp;nbsp;''p''. After this the right factors are found as a subset of these. 
The worst case of this algorithm is exponential in the number of factors.

{{harvtxt|Van Hoeij|2002}} improved this algorithm by using the [[LLL algorithm]], substantially reducing the time needed to choose the right subsets of mod&amp;nbsp;''p'' factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12329">In [[mathematics]], the '''Borsuk–Ulam theorem''' states that every [[continuous function]] from an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] into [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] maps some pair of [[antipodal point]]s to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.

Formally: if &lt;math&gt;f: S^n \to \R^n&lt;/math&gt; is continuous then there exists an &lt;math&gt;x\in S^n&lt;/math&gt; such that:  &lt;math&gt;f(-x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the [[Earth]]'s equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously.

The case &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth's surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures.

The Borsuk–Ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of [[odd function]]s. Recall that &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] and &lt;math&gt;B^n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[n-ball|''n''-ball]]:
* If &lt;math&gt;g : S^n \to \R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous odd function, then there exists an &lt;math&gt;x\in S^n&lt;/math&gt; such that:  &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;g : B^n \to \R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function which is odd on &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; (the boundary of &lt;math&gt;B^n&lt;/math&gt;), then there exists an &lt;math&gt;x\in B^n&lt;/math&gt; such that:  &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==

According to {{harvtxt|Jiří Matoušek|2003|p=25}}, the first historical mention of the statement of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem appears in {{harvtxt|Lyusternik|Shnirel'man|1930}}.  The first proof was given by {{harvs|first=Karol|last=Borsuk|authorlink=Karol Borsuk|year=1933|txt}}, where the formulation of the problem was attributed to [[Stanislaw Ulam]].  Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by {{harvtxt|Steinlein|1985}}.

==Equivalent statements==
The following statements are equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.&lt;ref name=prescott2002&gt;{{cite web | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.124.4120 | title=Extensions of the Borsuk–Ulam Theorem (Thesis) | publisher=Harvey Mudd College | date=2002 | accessdate=25 May 2015 | author=Prescott, Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With odd functions ===
A function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called ''odd'' (aka ''antipodal'' or ''antipode-preserving'') if for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;g(-x)=-g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an ''n''-sphere into Euclidean ''n''-space has a zero. PROOF: 
* If the theorem is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function, &lt;math&gt;g(-x)=g(x)&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Hence every odd continuous function has a zero.
* For every continuous function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the following function is continuous and odd: &lt;math&gt;g(x)=f(x)-f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;. If every odd continuous function has a zero, then &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has a zero, and therefore, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the theorem is correct.

=== With retractions ===
Define a ''retraction'' as a function &lt;math&gt;h: S^n \to S^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt; The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.

Proof: If the theorem is correct, then every continuous odd function from &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; must include 0 in its range. However,  &lt;math&gt;0 \notin S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, if it is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function &lt;math&gt;g: S^n \to R^n&lt;/math&gt; with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function &lt;math&gt;h: S^n \to S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;h(x)=\frac{g(x)}{|g(x)|}&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has no zeroes, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.

== Proofs ==

===1-dimensional case===
The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the [[intermediate value theorem]] (IVT).

Let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be an odd real-valued continuous function on a circle. Pick an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; then we are done. Otherwise, without loss of generality, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt; But &lt;math&gt;g(-x)&lt;0.&lt;/math&gt; Hence, by the IVT, there is a point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; at which &lt;math&gt;g(y)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===General case - algebraic topology proof===
Assume that &lt;math&gt;h: S^n \to S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an odd continuous function with &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; (the case &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt; is treated above, the case &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt; can be handled using basic [[Covering space|covering theory]]). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced function &lt;math&gt;h': \mathbb{RP}^n \to \mathbb{RP}^{n-1},&lt;/math&gt; which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the [[Hurewicz theorem]], the induced map on cohomology with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_2&lt;/math&gt; coefficients, 

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb F_2[a]/a^{n+1} = H^*(\mathbb{RP}^n;\mathbb{F}_2) \leftarrow H^*(\mathbb{RP}^{n-1};\mathbb F_2) = \mathbb F_2[b]/b^{n},&lt;/math&gt;

sends &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. But then we get that &lt;math&gt;b^n = 0&lt;/math&gt; is sent to &lt;math&gt;a^n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.&lt;ref name=rotman&gt;Joseph J. Rotman, ''An Introduction to Algebraic Topology'' (1988) Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|0-387-96678-1}} ''(See Chapter 12 for a full exposition.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also show the stronger statement that any odd map &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; has odd degree and then deduce the theorem from this result.

===General case - combinatorial proof===
The Borsuk&amp;ndash;Ulam theorem can be proved from [[Tucker's lemma]].&lt;ref name=prescott2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=FreundTodd1982&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(81)90027-3 | year=1982| volume=30 | title=A constructive proof of Tucker's combinatorial lemma | journal=[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A]] | pages=321–325|author1=Freund, Robert M|author2=Todd, Michael J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SimmonsSu2003&gt;{{Cite journal|author1 = Simmons, Forest W.| author2=Su, Francis Edward | doi=10.1016/s0165-4896(02)00087-2 |year=2003| volume=45 | title=Consensus-halving via theorems of Borsuk&amp;ndash;Ulam and Tucker | journal=Mathematical Social Sciences | pages=15–25| hdl=10419/94656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;g : S^n \to \R^n&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous odd function. Because ''g'' is continuous on a compact domain, it is [[uniformly continuous]]. Therefore, for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every two points of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; which are within &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; of each other, their images under ''g'' are within &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of each other.

Define a triangulation of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; with edges of length at most &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Label each vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of the triangulation with a label &lt;math&gt;l(v)\in {\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots, \pm n}&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:

* The absolute value of the label is the ''index'' of the coordinate with the highest absolute value of ''g'': &lt;math&gt;|l(v)| = \arg\max_k (g(v)_k)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The sign of the label is the sign of ''g'', so that: &lt;math&gt;l(v) = \sgn (g(v)) |l(v)|&lt;/math&gt;.

Because ''g'' is odd, the labeling is also odd: &lt;math&gt;l(-v) = -l(v)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices &lt;math&gt;u, v&lt;/math&gt; with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are &lt;math&gt;l(u)=1, l(v)=-1&lt;/math&gt;. By the definition of ''l'', this means that in both &lt;math&gt;g(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(v)&lt;/math&gt;, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate: in &lt;math&gt;g(u)&lt;/math&gt; this coordinate is positive while in &lt;math&gt;g(v)&lt;/math&gt; it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between &lt;math&gt;g(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(v)&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, so in particular &lt;math&gt;|g(u)_1 - g(v)_1| = |g(u)_1| + |g(v)_1| \leq \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;g(u)_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(v)_1&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs) and so &lt;math&gt;|g(u)_1|, |g(v)_1| \leq \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. But since the largest coordinate of &lt;math&gt;g(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(v)&lt;/math&gt; is coordinate #1, this means that  &lt;math&gt;|g(u)_k|, |g(v)_k| \leq \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for each  &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;|g(u)|, |g(v)| \leq c_n \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_n &lt;/math&gt; is some constant depending on &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;|\cdot| &lt;/math&gt; which you have chosen.

The above is true for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;; hence there must be a point ''u'' in which &lt;math&gt;|g(u)|=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Corollaries==

* No subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[ham sandwich theorem]]: For any [[Compact space|compact]] sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; we can always find a hyperplane dividing each of them into two subsets of equal measure.

== Equivalent results ==
Above we showed how to prove the Borsuk–Ulam theorem from Tucker's lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker's lemma from the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.

== Generalizations ==
* In the original theorem, the domain of the function ''f'' is the unit ''n''-sphere (the boundary of the unit ''n''-ball). In general, it is true also when the domain of ''f'' is the boundary of any open bounded symmetric subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; containing the origin (Here, symmetric means that if ''x'' is in the subset then -''x'' is also in the subset).&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|title=Borsuk fixed-point theorem|id=p/b110770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Consider the function ''A'' which maps a point to its antipodal point: &lt;math&gt;A(x) = -x.&lt;/math&gt; Note that &lt;math&gt;A(A(x)))=x.&lt;/math&gt; The original theorem claims that there is a point ''x'' in which &lt;math&gt;f(A(x))=f(x).&lt;/math&gt; In general, this is true also for every function ''A'' for which &lt;math&gt;A(A(x)))=x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1969632 |author=Yang, Chung-Tao | year= 1954|volume=60 | title=On Theorems of Borsuk-Ulam, Kakutani-Yamabe-Yujobo and Dyson, I | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | pages=262–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general this is not true for other functions ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mathoverflow.net/questions/61141/generalization-of-borsuk-ulam | title=Generalization of Borsuk-Ulam | publisher=Math Overflow | accessdate=18 May 2015 | author=Jens Reinhold, Faisal | author2=Sergei Ivanov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7905">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[category theory]], the '''category of sets''', denoted as '''Set''', is the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] whose [[Category theory|objects]] are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  The arrows or [[morphism]]s between sets ''A'' and ''B'' are the [[total function]]s from ''A'' to ''B'', and the composition of morphisms is the [[Function composition|composition of functions]].

Many other categories (such as the [[category of groups]], with [[group homomorphisms]] as arrows) add structure to the objects of the category of sets and/or restrict the arrows to functions of a particular kind.

==Properties of the category of sets==
The axioms of a category are satisfied by '''Set''' because composition of functions is [[Associative property|associative]], and because every set ''X'' has an [[identity function]] ''id&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; : X → X'' which serves as identity element for function composition.

The [[epimorphism]]s in '''Set''' are the [[surjective]] maps, the [[monomorphism]]s are the [[injective]] maps, and the [[isomorphism]]s are the [[bijective]] maps.

The [[empty set]] serves as the [[initial object]] in '''Set''' with [[empty function]]s as morphisms.  Every [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] is a [[terminal object]], with the functions mapping all elements of the source sets to the single target element as morphisms. There are thus no [[zero object]]s in '''Set'''. 

The category '''Set''' is [[complete category|complete and co-complete]]. The [[product (category theory)|product]] in this category is given by the [[cartesian product]] of sets. The [[coproduct (category theory)|coproduct]] is given by the [[disjoint union]]: given sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''i'' ranges over some index set ''I'', we construct the coproduct as the union of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;×{''i''} (the cartesian product with ''i'' serves to ensure that all the components stay disjoint).

'''Set''' is the prototype of a [[concrete category]]; other categories are concrete if they are "built on" '''Set''' in some well-defined way.

Every two-element set serves as a [[subobject classifier]] in '''Set'''. The power object of a set ''A'' is given by its [[power set]], and the [[exponential object]] of the sets ''A'' and ''B'' is given by the set of all functions from ''A'' to ''B''. '''Set''' is thus a [[topos]] (and in particular [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] and [[Regular_category#Exact_%28effective%29_categories|exact in the sense of Barr]]).

'''Set''' is not [[abelian category|abelian]], [[additive category|additive]] nor [[preadditive category|preadditive]].

Every non-empty set is an [[injective object]] in '''Set'''. Every set is a [[projective module|projective object]] in '''Set''' (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]).

The [[Accessible category|finitely presentable objects]] in '''Set''' are the finite sets. Since every set is a [[direct limit]] of its finite subsets, the category '''Set''' is a [[Accessible category|locally finitely presentable category]].

If ''C'' is an arbitrary category, the [[Contravariant functor|contravariant functors]] from ''C'' to '''Set''' are often an important object of study. If ''A'' is an object of ''C'', then the functor from ''C'' to '''Set''' that sends ''X'' to Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''A'') (the set of morphisms in ''C'' from ''X'' to ''A'') is an example of such a functor. If ''C'' is a small category (i.e. the collection of its objects forms a set), then the contravariant functors from ''C'' to '''Set''', together with natural transformations as morphisms, form a new category, a [[functor category]] known as the category of [[presheaves]] on ''C''.

==Foundations for the category of sets==

In [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] the collection of all sets is not a set; this follows from the [[axiom of foundation]]. One refers to collections that are not sets as [[proper class]]es. One cannot handle proper classes as one handles sets; in particular, one cannot write that those proper classes belong to a collection (either a set or a proper class). This is a problem: it means that the category of sets cannot be formalized straightforwardly in this setting. Categories like '''Set''' whose collection of objects forms a proper class are known as [[Large category|large categories]], to distinguish them from the small categories whose objects form a set. 

One way to resolve the problem is to work in a system that gives formal status to proper classes, such as [[NBG set theory]]. In this setting, categories formed from sets are said to be ''small'' and those (like '''Set''') that are formed from proper classes are said to be ''large''.

Another solution is to assume the existence of [[Grothendieck universe]]s. Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is a set which is itself a model of ZF(C) (for instance if a set belongs to a universe, its elements and its powerset will belong to the universe).  The existence of Grothendieck universes (other than the empty set and the set &lt;math&gt;V_\omega&lt;/math&gt; of all [[hereditarily finite set]]s) is not implied by the usual ZF axioms; it is an additional, independent axiom, roughly equivalent to the existence of [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]]s. Assuming this extra axiom, one can limit the objects of '''Set''' to the elements of a particular universe. (There is no "set of all sets" within the model, but one can still reason about the class ''U'' of all inner sets, i.e., elements of ''U''.)

In one variation of this scheme, the class of sets is the union of the entire tower of Grothendieck universes. (This is necessarily a [[proper class]], but each Grothendieck universe is a set because it is an element of some larger Grothendieck universe.) However, one does not work directly with the "category of all sets". Instead, theorems are expressed in terms of the category '''Set'''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; whose objects are the elements of a sufficiently large Grothendieck universe ''U'', and are then shown not to depend on the particular choice of ''U''. As a foundation for [[category theory]], this approach is well matched to a system like [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]] in which one cannot reason directly about proper classes; its principal disadvantage is that a theorem can be true of all '''Set'''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; but not of '''Set'''.

Various other solutions, and variations on the above, have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Lane 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feferman 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blass 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The same issues arise with other concrete categories, such as the [[category of groups]] or the [[category of topological spaces]].

==Life==
Truesdell was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. After high school, he spent two years in [[Europe]] learning French, German, and Italian, and improving his Latin and Greek. His linguistic skills stood him in good stead in his later historical investigations. At [[Caltech]] he was deeply influenced by the teaching of [[Harry Bateman]]. In particular, a course in [[partial differential equation]]s "taught me the difference between an ordinary good teacher and a great mathematician, and after that I never cared what grade I got in anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Truesdell, C. |title=An idiot's fugitive essays on science: methods, criticism, training, circumstances |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=0-387-90703-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} page 422&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a B.Sc. in mathematics and physics in 1941, and an MSc. in mathematics in 1942.

In 1943, he completed a Ph.D. in mathematics at [[Princeton University]]. For the rest of the decade, the [[U.S. Navy]] employed him to do [[mechanics]] research.

Truesdell taught at [[Indiana University]] 1950-61, where his students included [[James Serrin]], [[Jerald Ericksen]], and [[Walter Noll]]. From 1961 until his retirement in 1989, Truesdell was professor of rational mechanics at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.unito.it/convegniseminari/truesdell/truesdell.htm Remembering Clifford Truesdell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402030542/http://www.dm.unito.it/convegniseminari/truesdell/truesdell.htm |date=2007-04-02 }}, from [[Turin]]'s Accademia delle Scienze&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = B.

Truesdell was the founder and editor-in-chief of the journals ''[[Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis]]'' and ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', which were unusual in several ways. Following Truesdell's criticisms of awkward style in scientific writing,&lt;ref&gt;See "A Comment on Scientific Writing" in Truesdell (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; the journal accepted papers in English, French, German, and Latin.

In addition to his original work in mechanics, Truesdell was a major historian of science and mathematics, editing or co-editing six volumes of the collected works of [[Leonhard Euler]].

== Criticism of Truesdell's support of rational thermodynamics ==
{{POV section|date=April 2012}}

In the words of [[Bernard Lavenda]] if there is something rational in [[rational thermodynamics]] it is well-hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Lavenda, Bernard |title=Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes |publisher=Macmillan Press |year=1978 |pages= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the 'rational' theory even failed in fields where the authors assumed expertise: "More damage was suffered by rational thermodynamics when it was found that the theory could not be applied to non-Newtonian fluids.".&lt;ref name="history-thermo"&gt;{{cite book |author= Müller, Ingo |title=A History of Thermodynamics: the Doctrine of Energy and Entropy |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |pages= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truesdell become also famous by his attacks on [[Lars Onsager]] (Nobel Prize 1968 for nonequilibrium thermodynamics) and related scientists. As Ingo Müller reports:&lt;ref name="history-thermo"/&gt;

:"Truesdell’s outspoken partisanship of rational thermodynamics and his flamboyant style fuelled some lively controversies between adherents of TIP and the protagonists of rational thermodynamics, chiefly Truesdell himself. His attacks on Onsagerism were advanced with much satirical verve, that makes them fun to read for those who were not targeted. However, the defenders of TIP tried their best to pay Truesdell back in his own coin. Woods pointed out some awkward features of rational thermodynamics in a paper entitled “The bogus axioms of continuum mechanics.”57 And Ronald Samuel Rivlin (1915–2005) delighted a worldwide audience with a frequently repeated humorous lecture under the title “On red herrings and other sundry unidentified fish in modern continuum mechanics.”

'''Cointegration''' is a [[statistical]] property of a collection {{math|(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of [[time series]] variables. First, all of the series must be integrated of order ''d'' (see [[Order of integration]]). Next, if a [[linear combination]] of this collection is integrated of order zero, then the collection is said to be co-integrated. Formally, if (''X'',''Y'',''Z'') are each integrated of order ''d'', and there exist coefficients ''a'',''b'',''c'' such that {{math|''aX''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bY''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''cZ''}} is integrated of order 0, then ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are cointegrated.  Cointegration has become an important property in contemporary time series analysis. Time series often have trends—either deterministic or [[stochastic]]. In an influential paper, Charles Nelson and [[Charles Plosser]] (1982) provided statistical evidence that many US macroeconomic time series (like GNP, wages, employment, etc.) have stochastic trends—these are also called unit root processes, or processes integrated of order {{tmath|1 : I(1)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0304-3932(82)90012-5| title = Trends and random walks in macroeconmic time series| journal = Journal of Monetary Economics| volume = 10| issue = 2| pages = 139| year = 1982| last1 = Nelson | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Plosser | first2 = C. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also showed that unit root processes have non-standard statistical properties, so that conventional econometric theory methods do not apply to them.

==Introduction==
If two or more series are individually  [[Order of integration|integrated]] (in the time series sense) but some [[linear combination]] of them has a lower [[order of integration]], then the series are said to be cointegrated. A common example is where the individual series are first-order integrated ({{tmath|I(1)}}) but some ('''cointegrating''') vector of coefficients exists to form a [[Stationary process|stationary]] linear combination of them. For instance, a [[stock market index]] and the price of its associated [[futures contract]] move through time, each roughly following a [[random walk]]. Testing the hypothesis that there is a [[statistically significant]] connection between the futures price and the spot price could now be done by testing for the existence of a cointegrated combination of the two series.

===History===
The first to introduce and analyse the concept of spurious—or nonsense—correlations was Udne Yule in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yule |first=U. |year=1926 |title= Why do we sometimes get nonsense-correlations between time series? - A study in sampling and the nature of time series | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=11–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the 1980s, many economists used [[linear regression]]s on non-stationary time series data, which Nobel laureate [[Clive Granger]] and [[Paul Newbold]] showed to be a dangerous approach that could produce [[spurious correlation]],&lt;ref name="GrangerNewbold"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Granger |first=C. |last2=Newbold |first2=P. |year=1974 |title=Spurious Regressions in Econometrics |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=111–120 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(74)90034-7 |citeseerx=10.1.1.353.2946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Babak |last=Mahdavi Damghani |year=2012|title=The Misleading Value of Measured Correlation |journal=[[Wilmott Magazine|Wilmott]] |volume=2012 |issue=1 |pages=64–73 |doi=10.1002/wilm.10167|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; since standard detrending techniques can result in data that are still non-stationary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Clive |last=Granger |year=1981 |title=Some Properties of Time Series Data and Their Use in Econometric Model Specification |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=121–130 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(81)90079-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Granger's 1987 paper with [[Robert Engle]] formalized the cointegrating vector approach, and coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engle |first=Robert F. |last2=Granger |first2=Clive W. J. |year=1987 |title=Co-integration and error correction: Representation, estimation and testing |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=251–276 |jstor=1913236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For integrated {{tmath|I(1)}} processes, Granger and Newbold showed that de-trending does not work to eliminate the problem of spurious correlation, and that the superior alternative is to check for co-integration. Two series with {{tmath|I(1)}} trends can be co-integrated only if there is a genuine relationship between the two. Thus the standard current methodology for time series regressions is to check all-time series involved for integration. If there are {{tmath|I(1)}} series on both sides of the regression relationship, then it's possible for regressions to give misleading results.

The possible presence of cointegration must be taken into account when choosing a technique to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between two variables having [[unit root]]s (i.e. integrated of at least order one).&lt;ref name="GrangerNewbold" /&gt; The usual procedure for testing hypotheses concerning the relationship between non-stationary variables was to run [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) regressions on data which had been differenced. This method is biased if the non-stationary variables are cointegrated.

For example, regressing the consumption series for any country (e.g. Fiji) against the GNP for a randomly selected dissimilar country (e.g. Afghanistan) might give a high [[R-squared]] relationship (suggesting high explanatory power on Fiji's consumption from Afghanistan's [[GNP]]). This is called [[Spurious correlation|spurious regression]]: two integrated {{tmath|I(1)}} series which are not directly causally related may nonetheless show a significant correlation; this phenomenon is called spurious correlation.

==Tests==
The three main methods for testing for cointegration are:

===Engle–Granger two-step method===
If &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_t&lt;/math&gt; are non-stationary and cointegrated, then a linear combination of them must be stationary.  In other words:

: &lt;math&gt;
y_t - \beta x_t = u_t \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt; is stationary.

If we knew &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt;, we could just test it for stationarity with something like a [[Dickey–Fuller test]], [[Phillips–Perron test]] and be done.  But because we don't know &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt;, we must estimate this first, generally by using [[ordinary least squares]], and then run our stationarity test on the estimated &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt; series, often denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_t&lt;/math&gt;.

A second regression is then run on the first differenced variables from the first regression, and the lagged residuals &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; is included as a regressor.

===Johansen test===
The [[Johansen test]] is a test for cointegration that allows for more than one cointegrating relationship, unlike the Engle–Granger method, but this test is subject to asymptotic properties, i.e. large samples. If the sample size is too small then the results will not be reliable and one should use Auto Regressive Distributed Lags (ARDL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giles|first1=David|title=ARDL Models - Part II - Bounds Tests|url=http://davegiles.blogspot.com/2013/06/ardl-models-part-ii-bounds-tests.html|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pesaran|first1=M.H.|last2=Shin|first2=Y.|last3=Smith|first3=R.J.|title=Bounds testing approaches to the analysis of level relationships|journal=Journal of Applied Econometrics|date=2001|volume=16|issue=3|pages=289–326|doi=10.1002/jae.616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phillips–Ouliaris cointegration test===
[[Peter C. B. Phillips]] and [[Sam Ouliaris]] (1990) show that residual-based unit root tests applied to the estimated cointegrating residuals do not have the usual Dickey–Fuller distributions under the null hypothesis of no-cointegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. C. B. |last=Phillips |first2=S. |last2=Ouliaris |title=Asymptotic Properties of Residual Based Tests for Cointegration |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=165–193 |jstor=2938339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the spurious regression phenomenon under the null hypothesis, the distribution of these tests have asymptotic distributions that depend on (1) the number of deterministic trend terms and (2) the number of variables with which co-integration is being tested. These distributions are known as Phillips–Ouliaris distributions and critical values have been tabulated. In finite samples, a superior alternative to the use of these asymptotic critical value is to generate critical values from simulations.

===Multicointegration===
In practice, cointegration is often used for two {{tmath|I(1)}} series, but it is more generally applicable and can be used for variables integrated of higher order (to detect correlated accelerations or other second-difference effects). '''Multicointegration''' extends the cointegration technique beyond two variables, and occasionally to variables integrated at different orders.

===Variable shifts in long time series===
Tests for cointegration assume that the cointegrating vector is constant during the period of study. In reality, it is possible that the long-run relationship between the underlying variables change (shifts in the cointegrating vector can occur). The reason for this might be technological progress, economic crises, changes in the people's preferences and behaviour accordingly, policy or regime alteration, and organizational or institutional developments. This is especially likely to be the case if the sample period is long. To take this issue into account, tests have been introduced for cointegration with one unknown [[structural break]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Allan W. |last2=Hansen |first2=Bruce E. |year=1996 |title=Residual-based tests for cointegration in models with regime shifts |journal=Journal of Econometrics |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=99–126 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(69)41685-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tests for cointegration with two unknown breaks are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hatemi-J |first=A. |year=2008 |title=Tests for cointegration with two unknown regime shifts with an application to financial market integration |journal=[[Empirical Economics]] |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=497–505 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/empeco/v35y2008i3p497-505.html |doi=10.1007/s00181-007-0175-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical logic|classical]] [[deductive logic|deductive]] [[logic]], a '''consistent''' [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is one that does not contain a [[contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946 states it this way: "A deductive theory is called CONSISTENT or NON-CONTRADICTORY if no two asserted statements of this theory contradict each other, or in other words, if of any two contradictory sentences . . . at least one cannot be proved," (p. 135) where Tarski defines ''contradictory'' as follows: "With the help of the word ''not'' one forms the NEGATION of any sentence; two sentences, of which the first is a negation of the second, are called CONTRADICTORY SENTENCES" (p. 20). This definition requires a notion of "proof". Gödel in his 1931 defines the notion this way: "The class of ''provable formulas'' is defined to be the smallest class of formulas that contains the axioms and is closed under the relation "immediate consequence", i.e., formula ''c'' of ''a'' and ''b'' is defined as an ''immediate consequence'' in terms of ''modus ponens'' or substitution; cf Gödel 1931 van Heijenoort 1967:601. Tarski defines "proof" informally as "statements follow one another in a definite order according to certain principles . . . and accompanied by considerations intended to establish their validity[true conclusion for all true premises -- Reichenbach 1947:68]" cf Tarski 1946:3. Kleene 1952 defines the notion with respect to either an induction or as to paraphrase) a finite sequence of formulas such that each formula in the sequence is either an axiom or an "immediate consequence" of the preceding formulas; "A ''proof is said to be a proof ''of'' its last formula, and this formula is said to be ''(formally) provable'' or be a ''(formal) theorem" cf Kleene 1952:83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [[Paraconsistent logic]]&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or syntactic terms. The semantic definition states that a theory is consistent [[if and only if]] it has a [[Model theory#First-order logic|model]], i.e., there exists an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] under which all [[Well-formed formula|formulas]] in the theory are true. This is the sense used in traditional [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]], although in contemporary mathematical logic the term '''satisfiable''' is used instead. The syntactic definition states a theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is consistent if and only if there is no [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that both &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and its negation &lt;math&gt;\lnot\varphi&lt;/math&gt; are elements of the set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set of [[Closed-form expression|closed sentences]] (informally "axioms") and &lt;math&gt;\langle A\rangle&lt;/math&gt; the set of closed sentences provable from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; under some (specified, possibly implicitly) formal deductive system. The set of axioms &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''consistent''' when &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a signature, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a theory in &lt;math&gt;L_{\infty \omega}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; a sentence in &lt;math&gt;L_{\infty\omega}&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a '''consequence''' of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, or that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; '''entails''' &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, in symbols &lt;math&gt;T \vdash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, if every model of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a model of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. (In particular if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has no models then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; entails &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.)

'''Warning''': we don't require that if &lt;math&gt;T \vdash \varphi&lt;/math&gt; then there is a proof of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. In any case, with infinitary languages it's not always clear what would constitute a proof. Some writers use &lt;math&gt;T\vdash\varphi&lt;/math&gt; to mean that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is deducible from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; in some particular formal proof calculus, and they write &lt;math&gt;T \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; for our notion of entailment (a notation which clashes with our &lt;math&gt;A \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt;). For first-order logic the two kinds of entailment coincide by the completeness theorem for the proof calculus in question.
We say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is '''valid''', or is a '''logical theorem''', in symbols &lt;math&gt;\vdash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true in every &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-structure. We say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is '''consistent''' if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true in some &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-structure. Likewise we say that a theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is '''consistent''' if it has a model.
We say that two theories S and T in L infinity omega are equivalent if they have the same models, i.e. if Mod(S) = Mod(T). (Please note definition of Mod(T) on p. 30 ...) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''A Shorter Model Theory'' by Wilfrid Hodges, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

If there exists a deductive system for which these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for any theory formulated in a particular deductive [[Mathematical logic#Formal logical systems|logic]], the logic is called '''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The completeness of the [[sentential calculus]] was proved by [[Paul Bernays]] in 1918{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:265 states that Bernays determined the ''independence'' of the axioms of ''Principia Mathematica'', a result not published until 1926, but he says nothing about Bernays proving their ''consistency''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emil Post]] in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;Post proves both consistency and completeness of the propositional calculus of PM, cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Post's 1931 ''Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions'' in van Heijenoort 1967:264ff. Also Tarski 1946:134ff.&lt;/ref&gt; while the completeness of [[predicate calculus]] was proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Gödel's 1930 ''The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic'' in van Heijenoort 1967:582ff&lt;/ref&gt; and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect to the [[Mathematical induction|induction axiom schema]] were proved by Ackermann (1924), von Neumann (1927) and Herbrand (1931).&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Herbrand's 1930 ''On the consistency of arithmetic'' in van Heijenoort 1967:618ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger logics, such as [[second-order logic]], are not complete.

A '''consistency proof''' is a [[mathematical proof]] that a particular theory is consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Informally, [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] is ordinarily assumed; some dialects of informal mathematics customarily assume the [[axiom of choice]] in addition.&lt;/ref&gt; The early development of mathematical [[proof theory]] was driven by the desire to provide finitary consistency proofs for all of mathematics as part of [[Hilbert's program]].  Hilbert's program was strongly impacted by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which showed that sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their own consistency (provided that they are in fact consistent).

Although consistency can be proved by means of model theory, it is often done in a purely syntactical way, without any need to reference some model of the logic. The [[cut-elimination]] (or equivalently the [[Normalization property|normalization]] of the [[Curry-Howard|underlying calculus]] if there is one) implies the consistency of the calculus: since there is obviously no cut-free proof of falsity, there is no contradiction in general.

==Consistency and completeness in arithmetic and set theory==
In theories of arithmetic, such as [[Peano arithmetic]], there is an intricate relationship between the consistency of the theory and its [[completeness (logic)|completeness]]. A theory is complete if, for every formula φ in its language, at least one of φ or ¬φ is a logical consequence of the theory.

[[Presburger arithmetic]] is an axiom system for the natural numbers under addition. It is both consistent and complete.

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] show that any sufficiently strong [[recursively enumerable]] theory of arithmetic cannot be both complete and consistent. Gödel's theorem applies to the theories of [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA) and [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] (PRA), but not to [[Presburger arithmetic]].

Moreover, Gödel's second incompleteness theorem shows that the consistency of sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theories of arithmetic can be tested in a particular way. Such a theory is consistent if and only if it does ''not'' prove a particular sentence, called the Gödel sentence of the theory, which is a formalized statement of the claim that the theory is indeed consistent. Thus the consistency of a sufficiently strong, recursively enumerable, consistent theory of arithmetic can never be proven in that system itself. The same result is true for recursively enumerable theories that can describe a strong enough fragment of arithmetic&amp;mdash;including set theories such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].  These set theories cannot prove their own Gödel sentence—provided that they are consistent, which is generally believed.

Because consistency of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion '''{{vanchor|relative consistency}}''' is interesting in set theory (and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems). If ''T'' is a [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] and ''A'' is an additional [[axiom]], ''T'' + ''A'' is said to be consistent relative to ''T'' (or simply that ''A'' is consistent with ''T'') if it can be proved that
if ''T'' is consistent then ''T'' + ''A'' is consistent. If both ''A'' and ¬''A'' are consistent with ''T'', then ''A'' is said to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of ''T''.

== First-order logic ==

===Notation===
&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; (Turnstile symbol) in the following context of [[mathematical logic]], means "provable from". That is, &lt;math&gt;a\vdash b&lt;/math&gt; reads: ''b'' is provable from ''a'' (in some specified formal system). See [[List of logic symbols]]. In other cases, the turnstile symbol may mean implies; permits the derivation of. See: [[List of mathematical symbols]].

===Definition===
*A set of [[formulas]] &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; in first-order logic is '''consistent''' (written &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Con} \Phi&lt;/math&gt;) if there is no formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi \vdash \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi \vdash \lnot\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

Define an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on the set of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-[[term (logic)|terms]] by &lt;math&gt;t_0 \sim t_1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\; t_0 \equiv t_1 \in \Phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[First-order logic#Equality and its axioms|equality]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\overline t &lt;/math&gt; denote the equivalence class of terms containing &lt;math&gt;t &lt;/math&gt;; and let &lt;math&gt;T_\Phi := \{ \; \overline t \mid t \in T^S \} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T^S &lt;/math&gt; is the set of terms based on the symbol set &lt;math&gt;S &lt;/math&gt;.

Define the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-[[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak T_\Phi &lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt; T_\Phi &lt;/math&gt;, also called the '''term-structure''' corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, by:

There are several things to verify. First, that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is in fact an [[equivalence relation]].  Then, it needs to be verified that (1), (2), and (3) are well defined.  This falls out of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation and also requires a proof that (1) and (2) are independent of the choice of &lt;math&gt; t_0, \ldots ,t_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt; class representatives.  Finally, &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak I_\Phi \vDash \varphi &lt;/math&gt; can be verified by induction on formulas.

== Model theory ==

In [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC set theory]] with classical [[first-order logic]],&lt;ref&gt;the common case in many applications to other areas of mathematics as well as the ordinary mode of reasoning of [[informal mathematics]] in calculus and applications to physics, chemistry, engineering&lt;/ref&gt; an '''inconsistent''' theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is one such that there exists a closed sentence &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; contains both &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and its negation &lt;math&gt;\varphi'&lt;/math&gt;. A '''consistent''' theory is one such that the following [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] conditions hold

#&lt;math&gt;\{\varphi,\varphi'\}\not\subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;according to [[De Morgan's laws]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\varphi'\not\in T \lor \varphi\not\in T&lt;/math&gt;

A '''convex polygon''' is a [[simple polygon]] (not [[self-intersecting polygon|self-intersecting]]) in which no line segment between two points on the boundary ever goes outside the polygon. Equivalently, it is a simple polygon whose [[Interior (topology)|interior]] is a [[convex set]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathopenref.com/polygonconvex.html Definition and properties of convex polygons with interactive animation.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees, while in a strictly convex polygon all interior angles are strictly less than 180 degrees.

== Properties ==

The following properties of a simple polygon are all equivalent to convexity:
*Every [[internal angle]] is less than or equal to 180 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]].
*Every point on every [[line segment]] between two points inside or on the boundary of the polygon remains inside or on the boundary.
*The polygon is entirely contained in a closed half-plane defined by each of its edges.
*For each edge, the interior points are all on the same side of the line that the edge defines.
*The angle at each vertex contains all other vertices in its edges and interior.
*The polygon is the [[convex hull]] of its edges.

Additional properties of convex polygons include:
*The intersection of two convex polygons is a convex polygon.
*A convex polygon may be [[polygon triangulation|triangulated]] in [[linear time]] through a [[fan triangulation]], consisting in adding diagonals from one vertex to all other vertices.
*[[Helly's theorem]]: For every collection of at least three convex polygons: if the intersection of every three of them is nonempty, then the whole collection has a nonempty intersection.
*[[Krein–Milman theorem]]: A convex polygon is the [[convex hull]] of its vertices. Thus it is fully defined by the set of its vertices, and one only needs the corners of the polygon to recover the entire polygon shape.
*[[Hyperplane separation theorem]]: Any two convex polygons with no points in common have a separator line. If the polygons are closed and at least one of them is compact, then there are even two parallel separator lines (with a gap between them).
*'''Inscribed triangle''' property: Of all triangles contained in a convex polygon, there exists a triangle with a maximal area whose vertices are all polygon vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christos|last=-|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/a/269544/29780|work=Math Stack Exchange|title=Is the area of intersection of convex polygons always convex?}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Inscribing triangle''' property: every convex polygon with area ''A'' can be inscribed in a triangle of area at most equal to 2''A''. Equality holds (exclusively) for a [[parallelogram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W|title=Triangle Circumscribing|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleCircumscribing.html|work=Wolfram Math World}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Inscribed/inscribing rectangles''' property: For every convex body C in the plane, we can inscribe a rectangle r in C such that a [[homothetic transformation|homothetic]] copy R of r is circumscribed about C and the positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and &lt;math&gt;0.5 \text{ × Area}(R) \leq \text{Area}(C) \leq 2 \text{ × Area}(r)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01263495| title = Approximation of convex bodies by rectangles| journal = Geometriae Dedicata| volume = 47| pages = 111| year = 1993| last1 = Lassak | first1 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[mean width]] of a convex polygon is equal to its perimeter divided by pi. So its width is the diameter of a circle with the same perimeter as the polygon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jim Belk|title=What's the average width of a convex polygon?|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/a/20936/29780|work=Math Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every polygon inscribed in a circle (such that all vertices of the polygon touch the  circle), if not [[list of self-intersecting polygons|self-intersecting]], is convex. However, not every convex polygon can be inscribed in a circle.

==Strict convexity==

The following properties of a simple polygon are all equivalent to strict convexity:

*Every internal angle is strictly less than 180 degrees.
*Every line segment between two points in the interior, or between two points on the boundary but not on the same edge, is strictly interior to the polygon (except at its endpoints if they are on the edges).
*For each edge, the interior points and the boundary points not contained in the edge are on the same side of the line that the edge defines.
*The angle at each vertex contains all other vertices in its interior (except the given vertex and the two adjacent vertices).

Every nondegenerate [[triangle]] is strictly convex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7577">==Convolution power==
In [[mathematics]], the '''convolution power''' is the ''n''-fold iteration of the [[convolution]] with itself. Thus if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[natural number]], then the convolution power is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; x^{*n} = \underbrace{x * x * x * \cdots * x * x}_n,\quad x^{*0}=\delta_0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''*''' denotes the convolution operation of functions on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Dirac delta distribution]].  This definition makes sense if ''x'' is an [[integrable]] function (in [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]), a rapidly decreasing [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] (in particular, a compactly supported distribution) or is a finite [[Borel measure]].

If ''x'' is the distribution function of a [[random variable]] on the real line, then the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; convolution power of ''x'' gives the distribution function of the sum of ''n'' independent random variables with identical distribution ''x''.  The [[central limit theorem]] states that if ''x'' is in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with mean zero and variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;P\left(\frac{x^{*n}}{\sigma\sqrt{n}} &lt; \beta\right) \to \Phi(\beta)\quad\rm{as}\ n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;
where Φ is the cumulative [[standard normal distribution]] on the real line.  Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;x^{*n}/\sigma\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; tends weakly to the standard normal distribution.

In some cases, it is possible to define powers ''x''&lt;sup&gt;*''t''&lt;/sup&gt; for arbitrary real ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  If μ is a [[probability measure]], then μ is [[Infinite divisibility (probability)|infinitely divisible]] provided there exists, for each positive integer ''n'', a probability measure μ&lt;sub&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{1/n}^{* n} = \mu.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, a measure is infinitely divisible if it is possible to define all ''n''th roots.  Not every probability measure is infinitely divisible, and a characterization of infinitely divisible measures is of central importance in the abstract theory of [[stochastic process]]es.  Intuitively, a measure should be infinitely divisible provided it has a well-defined "convolution logarithm."  The natural candidate for measures having such a logarithm are those of (generalized) [[Poisson process|Poisson]] type, given in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_{\alpha,\mu} = e^{-\alpha}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha^n}{n!}\mu^{*n}.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the [[Lévy–Khinchin theorem]] states that a necessary and sufficient condition for a measure to be infinitely divisible is that it must lie in the closure, with respect to the [[vague topology]], of the class of Poisson measures {{harv|Stroock|1993|loc=§3.2}}.

Many applications of the convolution power rely on being able to define the analog of [[analytic function]]s as [[formal power series]] with powers replaced instead by the convolution power.  Thus if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n}&lt;/math&gt; is an analytic function, then one would like to be able to define

:&lt;math&gt;F^*(x) = a_0\delta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n x^{*n}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) or more generally is a finite Borel measure on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the latter series converges absolutely in norm provided that the norm of ''x'' is less than the radius of convergence of the original series defining ''F''(''z'').  In particular, it is possible for such measures to define the '''convolutional exponential'''

:&lt;math&gt;\exp^*(x) = \delta_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^{*n}}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is not generally possible to extend this definition to arbitrary distributions, although a class of distributions on which this series still converges in an appropriate weak sense is identified by {{harvtxt|Ben Chrouda|El Oued|Ouerdiane|2002}}.



==Properties==
If ''x'' is itself suitably differentiable, then the [[Convolution#Differentiation|properties]] of convolution, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\big\{x^{*n}\big\} = (\mathcal{D}x)  * x^{*(n-1)} = x  * \mathcal{D}\big\{x^{*(n-1)}\big\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[derivative]] operator.  Specifically, this holds if ''x'' is a compactly supported distribution or lies in the [[Sobolev space]] ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt; to ensure that the derivative is sufficiently regular for the convolution to be well-defined.

==Applications==
In the configuration random graph, the size distribution of [[Connected_component_(graph_theory)|connected components]] can be expressed via the convolution power of the excess [[degree distribution]] ({{harvtxt|Kryven|2017}}):
:&lt;math&gt;
w(n)=\begin{cases}
\frac{\mu_1}{n-1} u_1^{*n}(n-2),&amp; n&gt;1, \\
u(0) &amp; n=1.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;w(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the size distribution for connected components, &lt;math&gt;
u_1(k) = \frac{k+1}{\mu_1} u(k+1),
&lt;/math&gt; is the excess degree distribution, and &lt;math&gt;u(k)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[degree distribution]].

As [[convolution algebra]]s are special cases of [[Hopf algebra]]s, the convolution power is a special case of the (ordinary) power in a Hopf algebra.  In applications to [[quantum field theory]], the convolution exponential, convolution logarithm, and other analytic functions based on the convolution are constructed as formal power series in the elements of the algebra {{harv|Brouder|Frabetti|Patras|2008}}.  If, in addition, the algebra is a [[Banach algebra]], then convergence of the series can be determined as above.  In the formal setting, familiar identities such as
:&lt;math&gt;x = \log^*(\exp^*x) = \exp^*(\log^*x)&lt;/math&gt;
continue to hold.  Moreover, by the permanence of functional relations, they hold at the level of functions, provided all expressions are well-defined in an open set by convergent series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3997">In [[mathematics]], the '''Crofton formula''', named after [[Morgan Crofton]] (1826&amp;ndash;1915), is a classic result of [[integral geometry]] relating the length of a curve to the [[expected value|expected]] number of times a "random" [[line (mathematics)|line]] intersects it.

==Statement==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[curve|rectifiable plane curve]]. Given an oriented line ''l'', let &lt;math&gt;n_\gamma&lt;/math&gt;(''l'') be the number of points at which &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and ''l'' intersect. We can parametrize the general line ''l'' by the direction &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in which it points and its signed distance &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. The Crofton formula expresses the [[length of an arc|arc length]] of the curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in terms of an [[integral]] over the space of all oriented lines:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{length} (\gamma) = \frac14\iint n_\gamma(\varphi, p)\; d\varphi\; dp.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[differential form]]

:&lt;math&gt;d\varphi\wedge dp&lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under [[Euclidean group|rigid motions]], so it is a natural integration measure for speaking of an "average" number of intersections.  The right-hand side in the Crofton formula is sometimes called the Favard length.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Luis Santaló|title=Integral geometry and geometric probability|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof sketch==
Both sides of the Crofton formula are [[additive map|additive]] over concatenation of curves, so it suffices to prove the formula for a single line segment. Since the right-hand side does not depend on the positioning of the line segment, it must equal some function of the segment's length. Because, again, the formula is additive over concatenation of line segments, the integral must be a constant times the length of the line segment. It remains only to determine the factor of 1/4; this is easily done by computing both sides when &amp;gamma; is the [[unit circle]].

==Other forms==
The space of oriented lines is a double [[covering map|cover]] of the space of unoriented lines. The Crofton formula is often stated in terms of the corresponding density in the latter space, in which the numerical factor is not 1/4 but 1/2. Since a convex curve intersects [[almost everywhere|almost every]] line either twice or not at all, the unoriented Crofton formula for convex curves can be stated without numerical factors: the measure of the set of straight lines which intersect a convex curve is equal to its length.

The Crofton formula generalizes to any [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] surface; the integral is then performed with the natural measure on the space of [[geodesic]]s.

==Applications==
Crofton's formula yields elegant proofs of the following results, among others:
*Between two nested, convex, closed curves, the inner one is shorter.
*[[Barbier's theorem]]: a [[curve of constant width]] ''w'' has a perimeter of &amp;pi;''w''.
*The [[isoperimetric inequality]]: among closed curves with a given perimeter, the circle gives the unique maximum area.
*The [[convex hull]] of any bounded rectifiable closed curve ''C'' has perimeter at most the length of ''C'', with equality only when ''C'' is already a convex curve

In [[geometry]], the '''cross-ratio''', also called the '''double ratio''' and '''anharmonic ratio''', is a number associated with a list of four [[collinear]] points, particularly points on a [[projective line]]. Given four points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' on a line, their cross ratio is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;(A,B;C,D) = \frac {AC\cdot BD}{BC\cdot AD}&lt;/math&gt;

where an orientation of the line determines the sign of each distance and the distance is measured as projected into [[Euclidean space]]. (If one of the four points is the line's point at infinity, then the two distances involving that point are dropped from the formula.)
The point ''D'' is the [[Projective harmonic conjugate|harmonic conjugate]] of ''C'' with respect to ''A'' and ''B'' precisely if the cross-ratio of the quadruple is&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, called the ''harmonic ratio''.  The cross-ratio can therefore be regarded as measuring the quadruple's deviation from this ratio; hence the name ''anharmonic ratio''.

The cross-ratio is preserved by [[linear fractional transformation]]s.  It is essentially the only projective [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] of a quadruple of collinear points; this underlies its importance for [[projective geometry]].  

The cross-ratio had been defined in deep antiquity, possibly already by [[Euclid]], and was considered by [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]], who noted its key invariance property. It was extensively studied in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;A theorem on the anharmonic ratio of lines appeared in the work of [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]], but [[Michel Chasles]], who devoted considerable efforts to reconstructing lost works of [[Euclid]], asserted that it had earlier appeared in his book ''Porisms''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Variants of this concept exist for a quadruple of concurrent lines on the projective plane and a quadruple of points on the [[Riemann sphere]].
In the [[Cayley–Klein model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]], the distance between points is expressed in terms of a certain cross-ratio.

[[File:pappusharmonic.svg|thumb|right|300px|''D'' is the [[Projective harmonic conjugate|harmonic conjugate]] of ''C'' with respect to ''A'' and ''B'', so that the cross-ratio {{nowrap|(''A'', ''B''; ''C'', ''D'')}} equals&amp;nbsp;−1.]]

[[Pappus of Alexandria]] made implicit use of concepts equivalent to the cross-ratio in his ''Collection: Book VII''. Early users of Pappus included [[Isaac Newton]], [[Michel Chasles]], and [[Robert Simson]]. In 1986 Alexander Jones made a translation of the original by Pappus, then wrote a commentary on how the lemmas of Pappus relate to modern terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones (1986) ''Book 7 of the Collection'', part 1: introduction, text, translation {{ISBN|0-387-96257-3}}, part 2: commentary, index, figures {{ISBN|3-540-96257-3}}, [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern use of the cross ratio in projective geometry began with [[Lazare Carnot]] in 1803 with his book ''Géométrie de Position''. The term used was ''le rapport anharmonique'' (Fr: anharmonic ratio). German geometers call it ''das Doppelverhältnis'' (Ger: double ratio).

Given three points on a line, a fourth point that makes the cross ratio equal to minus one is called the [[projective harmonic conjugate]].  In 1847 [[Carl von Staudt]] called the construction of the fourth point a '''Throw''' ('''Wurf'''), and used the construction to exhibit arithmetic implicit in geometry. His [[Karl von Staudt#Algebra of throws|Algebra of Throws]] provides an approach to numerical propositions, usually taken as axioms, but proven in projective geometry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Eves]] (1972) ''A Survey of Geometry'', Revised Edition, page 73, [[Allyn and Bacon]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term "cross-ratio" was introduced in 1878 by [[William Kingdon Clifford]].&lt;ref&gt;[[W.K. Clifford]] (1878) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04370002 Elements of Dynamic, books I,II,III], page 42, London: MacMillan &amp; Co; on-line presentation by [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Mathematical Monographs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The cross-ratio of a quadruple of distinct points on the [[real line]] with coordinates ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4) = \frac{(z_3-z_1)(z_4-z_2)}{(z_3-z_2)(z_4-z_1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be written as a "double ratio" of two division ratios of triples of points:

:&lt;math&gt;(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4) = \frac{z_3-z_1}{z_3-z_2}:\frac{z_4-z_1}{z_4-z_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The cross-ratio is normally  extended to the case when one of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is [[infinity]] &lt;math&gt; (\infty);&lt;/math&gt; this is done by removing the corresponding two differences from the formula.

For example: if &lt;math&gt; z_1 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; the cross ratio becomes: 
:&lt;math&gt;(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4) = \frac{(z_3-\infty)(z_4-z_2)}{(z_3-z_2)(z_4-\infty)}=\frac{(z_4-z_2)}{(z_3-z_2)} .&lt;/math&gt;

In geometry, if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are collinear points, then the cross ratio is defined similarly as
:&lt;math&gt;(A,B;C,D) = \frac {AC\cdot BD}{BC\cdot AD} ,&lt;/math&gt; 
where each of the distances is signed according to a consistent orientation of the line.

The same formulas can be applied to four different [[complex number]]s or, more generally, to elements of any [[field (mathematics)|field]] and can also be extended to the case when one of them is the symbol ∞, by removing the corresponding two differences from the formula.
The formula shows that cross-ratio is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of four points, generally four numbers &lt;math&gt;z_1, \ z_2, \ z_3, \ z_4&lt;/math&gt; taken from a field.

==Properties==
The cross ratio of the four collinear points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;(A,B;C,D) = \frac {AC}{CB}:\frac {AD}{DB}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\frac {AC}{CB}&lt;/math&gt; describes the ratio with which the point ''C'' divides the line segment ''AB'', and &lt;math&gt;\frac {AD}{DB}&lt;/math&gt; describes the ratio with which the point ''D'' divides that same line segment. The cross ratio then appears as a ratio of ratios, describing how the two points ''C'', ''D'' are situated with respect to the line segment ''AB''. As long as the points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are distinct, the cross ratio (''A'', ''B''; ''C'', ''D'') will be a non-zero real number. We can easily deduce that
* (''A'', ''B''; ''C'', ''D'') &lt; 0 if and only if one of the points ''C'', ''D'' lies between the points ''A'', ''B'' and the other does not
* (''A'', ''B''; ''C'', ''D'') = 1 / (''A'', ''B''; ''D'', ''C'')
* (''A'', ''B''; ''C'', ''D'') = (''C'', ''D''; ''A'', ''B'')
* (''A'', ''B''; ''C'', ''D'') ≠ (''A'', ''B''; ''C'', ''E'') ↔ ''D'' ≠ ''E''

=== Six cross-ratios ===
Four points can be ordered in [[factorial|4!]] =  4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 ways, but there are only six ways for partitioning them into two non-ordered pairs. Thus, four points can have only six different cross-ratios, which are related as:
 
&lt;math&gt; (A,B;C,D) = (B,A;D,C) = (C,D;A,B) = (D,C;B,A) = \lambda &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (A,B;D,C) = (B,A;C,D) = (C,D;B,A) = (D,C;A,B) =
\frac{1} {\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (A,C;B,D) = (B,D;A,C) = (C,A;D,B) = (D,B;C,A) = 
1-\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (A,C;D,B) = (B,D;C,A) = (C,A;B,D) = (D,B;A,C) =
\frac 1 {1-\lambda}  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (A,D;B,C) = (B,C;A,D) = (C,B;D,A) = (D,A;C,B) = 
\frac{\lambda-1} {\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (A,D;C,B) = (B,C;D,A) =  (C,B;A,D) = (D,A;B,C) =
\frac {\lambda} {\lambda-1}  &lt;/math&gt;

==Projective geometry==
{{further|Projective geometry}}
{{cross_ratio_metrology_example.svg}}
Cross-ratio is a '''projective [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]''' in the sense that it is preserved by the [[projective transformation]]s of a projective line.

In particular, if four points lie on a straight line ''L'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; then their cross-ratio is a well-defined quantity, because any choice of the origin and even of the scale on the line will yield the same value of the cross-ratio.

Furthermore, let {{nowrap|{''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{!}} 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ 4} }} be four distinct lines in the plane passing through the same point ''Q''. Then any line ''L'' not passing through ''Q'' intersects these lines in four distinct points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (if ''L'' is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; then the corresponding intersection point is "at infinity"). It turns out that the cross-ratio of these points (taken in a fixed order) does not depend on the choice of a line ''L'', and hence it is an invariant of the 4-tuple of lines {''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}. 

This can be understood as follows: if ''L'' and ''L''&amp;prime; are two lines not passing through ''Q'' then the perspective transformation from ''L'' to ''L''&amp;prime; with the center ''Q'' is a projective transformation that takes the quadruple {''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} of points on ''L'' into the quadruple {''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;} of points on ''L''&amp;prime;.

Therefore, the invariance of the cross-ratio under projective automorphisms of the line implies (in fact, is equivalent to) the independence of the cross-ratio of the four [[collinear]] points {''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} on the lines {''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} from the choice of the line that contains them.

==Definition in homogeneous coordinates==
If four collinear points are represented in [[homogeneous coordinate]]s by vectors ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'' such that {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''a'' + ''b''}} and {{nowrap|1=''d'' = ''ka'' + ''b''}}, then their cross-ratio is&amp;nbsp;''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kaplansky |title=Linear Algebra and Geometry: A Second Course |year=1969 |isbn=0-486-43233-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in non-Euclidean geometry==
[[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Felix Klein]] found an application of the cross-ratio to [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Given a nonsingular [[Conic section|conic]] ''C'' in the real [[projective plane]], its [[Stabilizer subgroup#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] ''G&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the [[projective group]] {{nowrap|1=''G'' = PGL(3, '''R''')}} [[group action|acts]] [[transitive action|transitively]] on the points in the interior of ''C''. However, there is an invariant for the action of ''G&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' on ''pairs'' of points. In fact, every such invariant is expressible as a function of the appropriate cross ratio.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Hyperbolic geometry===
Explicitly, let the conic be the [[unit circle]]. For any two points ''P'', ''Q'', inside the unit circle . If the line connecting them intersects the circle in two points, ''X'' and ''Y'' and the points are, in order, {{nowrap|''X'', ''P'', ''Q'', ''Y''}}. Then the hyperbolic distance between ''P'' and ''Q'' in the [[Cayley–Klein model]] of the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; d_h(P,Q)=\frac{1}{2} \left| \log \left( \frac{|XQ||PY|}{|XP||QY|}\right ) \right| &lt;/math&gt;

(the factor one half is needed to make the [[Gaussian curvature|curvature]] &amp;minus;1). Since the cross-ratio is invariant under projective transformations, it follows that the hyperbolic distance is invariant under the projective transformations that preserve the conic ''C''.

Conversely, the group ''G'' acts transitively on the set of pairs of points {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} in the unit disk at a fixed hyperbolic distance.

Later, partly through the influence of [[Henri Poincaré]], the cross ratio of four [[complex number]]s on a circle was used for hyperbolic metrics. Being on a circle means the four points are the image of four real points under a [[Möbius transformation]], and hence the cross ratio is a real number. The [[Poincaré half-plane model]] and [[Poincaré disk model]] are two models of hyperbolic geometry in the [[complex projective line]].

These models are instances of [[Cayley–Klein metric]]s.

== The anharmonic group ==
The cross-ratio may be defined by any of these four expressions:

: &lt;math&gt; (A,B;C,D) = (B,A;D,C) = (C,D;A,B) = (D,C;B,A). \, &lt;/math&gt;

These differ by the following [[permutation]]s of the variables:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(A, B) (C, D) \\[6pt]
(A, C) (B, D) \\[6pt]
(A, D) (B, C) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

These three and the identity permutation leave the cross ratio unaltered. They make up a realization of the [[Klein four-group]], a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of order&amp;nbsp;4 in which the order of every non-identity element is&amp;nbsp;2.

Other permutations of the four variables alter the cross-ratio so that it may take any of the following six values.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(A, B; C, D) &amp; = \lambda &amp; (A, B; D, C) &amp; = \frac 1 \lambda \\[6pt]
(A, C; D, B) &amp; = \frac 1 {1-\lambda} &amp; (A, C; B, D) &amp; = 1-\lambda \\[6pt]
(A, D; C, B) &amp; = \frac \lambda {\lambda-1} &amp; (A, D; B, C) &amp; = \frac{\lambda-1} \lambda
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As functions of ''&amp;lambda;'', these form a non-abelian group of order&amp;nbsp;6 with the operation of composition of functions.  This is the '''anharmonic group'''.  It is a subgroup of the group of all [[Möbius transformation]]s. The six cross-ratios listed above represent torsion elements (geometrically, [[elliptic transform]]s) of {{nowrap|[[Projective linear group|PGL]](2, '''Z''')}}. Namely, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1-\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda}{\lambda-1}&lt;/math&gt; are of order 2 in {{nowrap|PGL(2, '''Z''')}}, with [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]], respectively, −1, 1/2, and 2 (namely, the orbit of the harmonic cross-ratio). Meanwhile, elements
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda-1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; are of order 3 in {{nowrap|PGL(2, '''Z''')}} – in {{nowrap|PSL(2, '''Z''')}} (this corresponds to the subgroup [[Alternating group|A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] of even elements). Each of them fixes both values &lt;math&gt;e^{\pm i\pi/3}&lt;/math&gt; of the "most symmetric" cross-ratio.

The anharmonic group is generated by {{nowrap|''λ'' ↦ 1/''λ''}} and {{nowrap|''λ'' ↦ 1 − ''λ''}}. Its action on {{nowrap|{0, 1, ∞}{{null}}}} gives an isomorphism with S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It may also be realised as the six Möbius transformations mentioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chandrasekharan | first=K. | authorlink=K. S. Chandrasekharan | title=Elliptic Functions | series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften | volume=281 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1985 | isbn=3-540-15295-4 | zbl=0575.33001 | page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which yields a projective [[Dihedral group of order 6#Representation theory|representation of S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] over any field (since it is defined with integer entries), and is always faithful/injective (since no two terms differ only by 1/−1). Over the field with two elements, the projective line only has three points, so this representation is an isomorphism, and is the [[Projective linear group#Exceptional isomorphisms|exceptional isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_3 \approx \mathrm{PGL}(2, 2)&lt;/math&gt;. In characteristic 3, this stabilizes the point &lt;math&gt;-1 = [-1:1]&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to the orbit of the harmonic cross-ratio being only a single point, since &lt;math&gt;2 = 1/2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Over the field with 3 elements, the projective line has only 4 points and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_4 \approx \mathrm{PGL}(2, 3)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus the representation is exactly the stabilizer of the harmonic cross-ratio, yielding an embedding &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_3 \hookrightarrow \mathrm{S}_4&lt;/math&gt; equals the stabilizer of the point &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Role of Klein four-group===
In the language of [[group theory]], the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; acts on the cross-ratio by permuting coordinates. The [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of this action is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]] K. This group consists of 2-cycle permutations of type &lt;math&gt; (AB)(CD) &lt;/math&gt; (in addition to the identity), which preserve the cross-ratio. The effective symmetry group is then the [[quotient group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_4/\mathrm{K}&lt;/math&gt;, which is isomorphic to S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Exceptional orbits===
For certain values of ''λ'' there will be greater symmetry and therefore fewer than six possible values for the cross-ratio. These values of ''λ'' correspond to [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of the action of S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the Riemann sphere (given by the above six functions); or, equivalently, those points with a non-trivial [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] in this permutation group.

The first set of fixed points is {{nowrap|{0, 1, ∞}.}} However, the cross-ratio can never take on these values if the points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are all distinct. These values are limit values as one pair of coordinates approach each other:
:&lt;math&gt;(Z,B;Z,D) = (A,Z;C,Z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(Z,Z;C,D) = (A,B;Z,Z) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(Z,B;C,Z) = (A,Z;Z,D) = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The second set of fixed points is {{nowrap|{&amp;minus;1, 1/2, 2}.}} This situation is what is classically called the '''{{visible anchor|harmonic cross-ratio}}''', and arises in [[projective harmonic conjugate]]s.  In the real case, there are no other exceptional orbits.

In the complex case, the most symmetric cross-ratio occurs when &lt;math&gt;\lambda = e^{\pm i\pi/3}&lt;/math&gt;. These are then the only two values of the cross-ratio, and these are acted on according to the sign of the permutation.

==Transformational approach==
{{Main|Möbius transformation}}

The cross-ratio is invariant under the [[projective transformation]]s of the line. In the case of a [[complex number|complex]] projective line, or the [[Riemann sphere]], these transformations are known as [[Möbius transformation]]s. A general Möbius transformation has the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}\;,\quad \mbox{where } a,b,c,d\in\Bbb{C} \mbox{ and } ad-bc \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;

These transformations form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] [[group action|acting]] on the [[Riemann sphere]], the [[Möbius group]].

The projective invariance of the cross-ratio means that

:&lt;math&gt;(f(z_1), f(z_2); f(z_3), f(z_4)) = (z_1, z_2; z_3, z_4).\ &lt;/math&gt;

The cross-ratio is [[real number|real]] if and only if the four points are either [[line (geometry)#Collinear points|collinear]] or [[concyclic]], reflecting the fact that every Möbius transformation maps [[generalized circle]]s to generalized circles.

The action of the Möbius group is [[simply transitive]] on the set of triples of distinct points of the Riemann sphere: given any ordered triple of distinct points, {{nowrap|(''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, there is a unique Möbius transformation ''f''(''z'') that maps it to the triple {{nowrap|(1, 0, ∞)}}. This transformation can be conveniently described using the cross-ratio: since {{nowrap|(''z'', ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}} must equal {{nowrap|(''f''(''z''), 1; 0, ∞)}}, which in turn equals ''f''(''z''), we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=(z, z_2; z_3, z_4) .&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative explanation for the invariance of the cross-ratio is based on the fact that the group of projective transformations of a line is generated by the translations, the homotheties, and the multiplicative inversion. The differences {{nowrap|''z''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are invariant under the [[translation (mathematics)|translations]]

: &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto z + a&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] in the ground field ''F''. Furthermore, the division ratios are invariant under a [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]]

:&lt;math&gt;z \mapsto b z&lt;/math&gt;

for a non-zero constant ''b'' in ''F''. Therefore, the cross-ratio is invariant under the [[affine transformation]]s.

In order to obtain a well-defined [[multiplicative inverse|inversion mapping]]

:&lt;math&gt;T : z \mapsto z^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

the affine line needs to be augmented by the [[point at infinity]], denoted ∞, forming the projective line ''P''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''F''). Each affine mapping {{nowrap|''f'' : ''F'' → ''F''}} can be uniquely extended to a mapping of ''P''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''F'') into itself that fixes the point at infinity. The map ''T'' swaps 0 and ∞. The projective group is [[generating set of a group|generated by]] ''T'' and the affine mappings extended to ''P''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''F''). In the case {{nowrap|1=''F'' = '''C'''}}, the [[complex plane]], this results in the [[Möbius group]]. Since the cross-ratio is also invariant under ''T'', it is invariant under any projective mapping of ''P''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''F'') into itself.

===Co-ordinate description===
If we write the complex points as vectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}_n = [\Re(z_n),\Im(z_n)]^{\rm T}&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;x_{nm}=x_n-x_m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; be the dot product of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; then the real part of the cross ratio is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;
C_1 = \frac{ (x_{12},x_{14}) (x_{23},x_{34}) - (x_{12},x_{34}) (x_{14},x_{23}) + (x_{12},x_{23}) (x_{14},x_{34}) } {|x_{23}|^2 |x_{14}|^2  }
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an invariant of the 2D [[special conformal transformation]] such as inversion &lt;math&gt;x^\mu \rightarrow \frac{x^\mu}{|x|^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

The imaginary part must make use of the 2-dimensional cross product &lt;math&gt;a\times b = [a,b] = a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
C_2 = \frac{ (x_{12},x_{14}) [x_{34},x_{23}] - (x_{43},x_{23}) [ x_{12},x_{34} ]  } {|x_{23}|^2 |x_{14}|^2  }
&lt;/math&gt;

==Ring homography==
The concept of cross ratio only depends on the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] operations of addition, multiplication, and inversion (though inversion of a given element is not certain in a ring). One approach to cross ratio interprets it as a [[homography]] that takes three designated points to 0, 1, and infinity. Under restrictions having to do with inverses, it is possible to generate such a mapping with ring operations in the [[projective line over a ring#Cross-ratio|projective line over a ring]]. The cross ratio of four points is the evaluation of this homography at the fourth point.

==Differential-geometric point of view==
The theory takes on a differential calculus aspect as the four points are brought into proximity. This leads to the theory of the [[Schwarzian derivative]], and more generally of [[projective connection]]s.

==Higher-dimensional generalizations==
{{Further|General position}}
The cross-ratio does not generalize in a simple manner to higher dimensions, due to other geometric properties of configurations of points, notably collinearity – [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]s are more complicated, and distinct ''k''-tuples of points are not in [[general position]].

While the projective linear group of the plane is 3-transitive (any three distinct points can be mapped to any other three points), and indeed simply 3-transitive (there is a ''unique'' projective map taking any triple to another triple), with the cross ratio thus being the unique projective invariant of a set of four points, there are basic geometric invariants in higher dimension. The projective linear group of ''n''-space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^n=\mathbf{P}(K^{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; has (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 dimensions (because it is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}(n,K) = \mathbf{P}(\mathrm{GL}(n+1,K)),&lt;/math&gt; projectivization removing one dimension), but in other dimensions the projective linear group is only 2-transitive – because three collinear points must be mapped to three collinear points (which is not a restriction in the projective line) – and thus there is not a "generalized cross ratio" providing the unique invariant of ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; points.

Collinearity is not the only geometric property of configurations of points that must be maintained – for example, [[five points determine a conic]], but six general points do not lie on a conic, so whether any 6-tuple of points lies on a conic is also a projective invariant. One can study orbits of points in [[general position]] – in the line "general position" is equivalent to being distinct, while in higher dimensions it requires geometric considerations, as discussed – but, as the above indicates, this is more complicated and less informative.

However, a generalization to [[Riemann surfaces]] of positive [[genus]] exists, using the [[Abel–Jacobi map]] and [[theta functions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8786">The '''Cut-insertion theorem''', also known as '''Pellegrini's theorem''',&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Pellegrini has been the first Electronic Engineering graduate at the [[University of Pisa]] where is currently Professor Emeritus. He is also author of the [[Electrokinematics theorem]], that connects the velocity and the charge of carriers moving inside an arbitrary volume to the currents, voltages and power on its surface through an arbitrary irrotational vector.&lt;/ref&gt; is a linear network theorem that allows transformation of a generic network N into another
network N' that makes analysis simpler and for which the main properties are more apparent.

==Statement==
[[File:Generica rete lineare N.jpg|thumb|right|Generic linear network N.]]
[[File:Rete lineare equivalente N'.JPG|thumb|Equivalent linear network N'.]]
[[File:Teorema di socmposizione.JPG|thumb|Implementation of the three-terminal circuit by means of an independent
source W&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and an immittance X&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
Let ''e'', ''h'', ''u'', ''w'', ''q=q''', and '' t=t' '' be six arbitrary nodes of the network N and ''&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'' be an independent voltage or current source connected between ''e'' and ''h'', while ''&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;'' is the output quantity, either a voltage or current, relative to the branch with [[immittance]] &lt;math&gt;X_{u}&lt;/math&gt;, connected between ''u'' and ''w''. Let us now cut the '' qq' '' connection and insert a three-terminal circuit ("TTC") between the two nodes ''q'' and ''q' '' and the node '' t=t' '', as in figure b (&lt;math&gt;W_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_{p}&lt;/math&gt; are homogeneous quantities, voltages or currents, relative to the ports ''qt'' and '' q'q't' '' of the TTC).

In order for the two networks N and N' to be equivalent for any &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the two constraints &lt;math&gt;W_{r}=W_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{r}}=\bar{W_{p}}&lt;/math&gt;, where the overline indicates the dual quantity, are to be satisfied.

The above mentioned three-terminal circuit can be implemented, for example, connecting an ideal independent voltage or current source &lt;math&gt;W_{p}&lt;/math&gt; between ''q' '' and '' t' '', and an immittance &lt;math&gt;X_{p}&lt;/math&gt; between ''q'' and ''t''.

==Network functions==
With reference to the network N', the following [[Transfer function|network functions]] can be defined:

&lt;math&gt; A\equiv\frac{U}{W_{p}}|_{S=0} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  ;      &lt;math&gt; \beta\equiv\frac{W_{r}}{U} |_{S=0} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;    ;    &lt;math&gt; X_{i}\equiv\frac{W_{p}}{\bar{W_{p}}} |_{S=0} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \gamma\equiv\frac{U}{S} |_{W_{p}=0} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; ; &lt;math&gt; \alpha\equiv\frac{W_{r}}{S} |_{W_{p}=0} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; ; &lt;math&gt; \rho\equiv\frac{\bar{W_{p}}}{S} |_{W_{p}=0} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

from which, exploiting the [[Superposition theorem]], we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;W_{r}=\alpha S+\beta AW_{p}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{p}}=\rho S+\frac{W_{p}}{X_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore the first constraint for the equivalence of the networks is satisfied if &lt;math&gt;W_{p}=\frac{\alpha}{1-\beta A}S&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore,

&lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{r}}=\frac{W_{r}}{X_{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{p}}=\left(\frac{1}{X_{i}}+\frac{\rho}{\alpha}(1-\beta A)\right)W_{r}&lt;/math&gt;

therefore the second constraint for the equivalence of the networks holds if  &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{X_{p}}=\frac{1}{X_{i}}+\frac{\rho}{\alpha}(1-\beta A)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Notice that for the evaluation of X&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; we need network functions that depend, in their turn, on X&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. To proceed with calculations, it is therefore appropriate to perform a cut for which ρ=0, so that X&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfer function==
If we consider the expressions for the network functions &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the first constraint for the equivalence of the networks, and we also consider that, as a result of the superposition principle, &lt;math&gt;U=\gamma S+AW_{p}&lt;/math&gt;, the transfer function &lt;math&gt;A_{f}\equiv \frac{U}{S}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;A_{f}=\frac{\alpha A}{1-\beta A}+\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

For the particular case of a [[Negative feedback amplifier|feedback amplifier]], the network functions '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''', '''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;''' take into account the nonidealities of such amplifier. In particular:

* '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''' takes into account the nonideality of the comparison network at the input
* '''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;''' takes into account the non unidirectionality of the feedback chain
* '''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;''' takes into account the non unidirectionality of the amplification chain.

If the amplifier can be considered ideal, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt;, the transfer function reduces to the known expression deriving from classical feedback theory:

&lt;math&gt;A_{f}=\frac{A}{1-\beta A}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Evaluation of the impedance and of the admittance between two nodes==

The evaluation of the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (or of the [[admittance]]) between two nodes is made somewhat simpler by the cut-insertion theorem.

===Impedance===
[[File:Ammettenza.jpg|thumb|right|Cut for the evaluation of the impedance between the nodes ''k=h'' and ''j=e=q''.]]
Let us insert a generic source &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; between the nodes ''j=e=q'' and ''k=h'' between which we want to evaluate the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. By performing a cut as shown in the figure, we notice that the immittance &lt;math&gt;X_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is in series with &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and the current through it is thus the same as that provided by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. If we choose an input voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_{s}=S&lt;/math&gt; and, as a consequence, a current &lt;math&gt;I_{s}=\bar{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and an impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{p}=X_{p}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write the following relationships:

&lt;math&gt;Z=\frac{V_{s}}{I_{s}}=\frac{V_{s}}{I_{r}}=Z_{p}\frac{V_{s}}{V_{r}}=Z_{p}\frac{V_{s}}{V_{p}}=Z_{p}\frac{1-\beta A}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

Considering that &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{V_{r}}{V_{s}} |_{V_{p}=0}=\frac{Z_{p}}{Z_{p}+Z_{b}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance seen between the nodes ''k=h'' and ''t'' if remove &lt;math&gt;Z_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and short-circuit the voltage sources, we obtain the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; between the nodes ''j'' and ''k'' in the form:

&lt;math&gt;Z=\left(Z_{p}+Z_{b}\right)\left(1-\beta A \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Admittance===
[[File:Impedenza, scomposizione.JPG|thumb|right|Cut for the evaluation of the impedance between the nodes ''k=h=t'' and ''j=e=q''.]]
We proceed in a way analogous to the impedance case, but this time the cut will be as shown in the figure to the right, noticing that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is now in parallel to &lt;math&gt;X_{p}&lt;/math&gt;. If we consider an input current source &lt;math&gt;I_{s}=S&lt;/math&gt; (as a result we have a voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{s}=\bar{S}&lt;/math&gt;) and an admittance &lt;math&gt;Y_{p}=X_{p}&lt;/math&gt;, the admittance &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; between the nodes ''j'' and ''k'' can be computed as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Y=\frac{I_{s}}{V_{s}}=\frac{I_{s}}{V_{r}}=Y_{p}\frac{I_{s}}{I_{r}}=Y_{p}\frac{I_{s}}{I_{p}}=Y_{p}\frac{1-\beta A}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

Considering that &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{I_{r}}{I_{s}} |_{I_{p}=0}=\frac{Y_{p}}{Y_{p}+Y_{b}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Y_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the admittance seen between the nodes ''k=h'' and ''t'' if we remove &lt;math&gt;Y_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and open the current sources, we obtain the admittance &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in the form:

&lt;math&gt;Y=\left(Y_{p}+Y_{b}\right)\left(1-\beta A \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Comments===
[[File:Circuito a tre terminali (TTC).jpg|thumb|Implementation of the three-terminal circuit by means of an independent source &lt;math&gt;W_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and a dependent source &lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{p}}&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The implementation of the TTC with an independent source &lt;math&gt;W_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and an immittance &lt;math&gt;X_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is useful and intuitive for the calculation of the impedance between two nodes, but involves, as in the case of the other network functions, the difficulty of the calculation of &lt;math&gt;X_{p}&lt;/math&gt; from the equivalence equation. Such difficulty can be avoided using a dependent source &lt;math&gt;\bar{W_{p}}&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;X_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and using the Blackman formula&lt;ref&gt; R. B. Blackman, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1943.tb00443.x/abstract ''Effect of Feedback on Impedance''], Bell System Tech. J. 22, 269 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; for the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Such an implementation of the TTC allows finding a feedback topology even in a network consisting of a voltage source and two impedances in series.

'''DNA computing''' is a branch of [[computing]] which uses [[DNA]], [[biochemistry]], and [[molecular biology]] hardware, instead of the traditional silicon-based [[computer]] [[technology|technologies]].  Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments, and applications of DNA computing. The term "molectronics" has sometimes been used, but this term had already been used for an earlier technology, a then-unsuccessful rival of the first [[integrated circuit]]s;&lt;ref&gt;"Molectronic Computer Shown by [[Texas Instruments|Texas Instr.]]", unknown publication, circa 1963, in Box 2, Folder 3, listed in ''[[Jack Kilby]] Papers: A Guide to the Collection'', Southern Methodist University. [http://lib.texas.edu/taro/smu/00116/smu-00116.html]{{Dead link|date=July 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this term has also been used more generally, for molecular-scale electronic technology.&lt;ref&gt;"Application-specific methods for testing molectronic or nanoscale devices" (filed April 1, 2004), Patent US 7219314 B1.

== History ==
[[File:Len-mankin-pic.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Leonard Adleman]], the inventor of DNA computing|alt=A photograph of Loenard Aldeman, the inventor of DNA computing]]

While the initial interest was in using this novel approach to tackle [[NP-hard]] problems, it was soon realized that they may not be best suited for this type of computation, and several proposals have been made to find a "[[killer application]]" for this approach. In 1997, computer scientist Mitsunori Ogihara working with biologist Animesh Ray suggested one to be the evaluation of [[Boolean circuit]]s and described an implementation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ogihara and A. Ray, [http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de/comp-phys/handouts/Boolean2.pdf "Simulating Boolean circuits on a DNA computer"].

In 2002, researchers from the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Rehovot, Israel, unveiled a programmable molecular computing machine composed of enzymes and DNA molecules instead of silicon microchips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0224_030224_DNAcomputer.html |title=Computer Made from DNA and Enzymes |accessdate=2009-11-26 |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |date=2003-02-24 |work=National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, 2004, [[Ehud Shapiro]], Yaakov Benenson, Binyamin Gil, Uri Ben-Dor, and Rivka Adar at the [[Weizmann Institute]] announced in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] that they had constructed a DNA computer coupled with an input and output module which would theoretically be capable of diagnosing [[cancer]]ous activity within a cell, and releasing an anti-cancer drug upon diagnosis.&lt;ref name="shapiro_cancer"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benenson | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gil | first2 = B. | last3 = Ben-Dor | first3 = U. | last4 = Adar | first4 = R. | last5 = Shapiro | first5 = E. | title = An autonomous molecular computer for logical control of gene expression | doi = 10.1038/nature02551 | journal = Nature | volume = 429 | issue = 6990 | pages = 423–429 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15116117| pmc =3838955 |bibcode = 2004Natur.429..423B }}.

In January 2013, researchers were able to store a JPEG [[photograph]], a set of Shakespearean sonnets, and an audio file of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s speech [[I Have a Dream]] on [[DNA digital data storage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/347702/description/DNA_stores_poems_a_photo_and_a_speech DNA stores poems, a photo and a speech | Science News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, researchers created a [[transcriptor]] (a biological transistor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonnet | first1 = Jerome | last2 = Yin | first2 = Peter | last3 = Ortiz | first3 = Monica E. | last4 = Subsoontorn | first4 = Pakpoom | last5 = Endy | first5 = Drew | year = 2013 | title = Amplifying Genetic Logic Gates | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132/599 | journal = Science | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 599–603 | doi=10.1126/science.1232758| bibcode = 2013Sci...340..599B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, researchers used the CRISPR gene-editing system to insert a GIF of a galloping horse and rider into the DNA of living bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shipman|first1=Seth L.|last2=Nivala|first2=Jeff|last3=Macklis|first3=Jeffrey D.|last4=Church|first4=George M.|title=CRISPR–Cas encoding of a digital movie into the genomes of a population of living bacteria|journal=Nature|date=12 July 2017|volume=547|issue=7663|pages=345–349|doi=10.1038/nature23017|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature23017.html|accessdate=14 November 2017|language=en|bibcode=2017Natur.547..345S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Idea ==
The organisation and complexity of all living beings is based on a coding system functioning with four key components of the [[DNA molecule|DNA-molecule]]. Because of this, the DNA is very suited as a medium for data processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amos | first1 = Martyn |display-authors=etal | year = 2002 | title = Topics in the theory of DNA computing | url = | journal = Theoretical computer science | volume = 287 | issue = 1| pages = 3–38 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3975(02)00134-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to different calculations a DNA-computer with one liter of fluid containing six grams of DNA could potentially have a memory capacity of 3072 [[exabyte]]s. The theoretical maximum data transfer speed would also be enormous due to the massive [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] of the calculations. Therefore, about 1000 [[FLOPS|petaFLOPS]] could be reached, while today's most powerful computers do not go above a few dozen (99 petaFLOPS being the current record).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierce et al |title=Current resolution of data in DNA computing |journal=Bioinformatics Research |date=2016 |volume=88 |issue=34 |pages=435-451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pros and cons ==
The slow processing speed of a DNA-computer (the response time is measured in minutes, hours or days, rather than milliseconds) is compensated by its potential to make a high amount of multiple parallel computations. This allows the system to take a similar amount of time for a complex calculation as for a simple one. This is achieved by the fact that millions or billions of molecules interact with each other simultaneously. However, it is much harder to analyze the answers given by a DNA-Computer than by a digital one.

== Examples/Prototypes ==
In 1994 [[Leonard Adleman]] presented the first prototype of a DNA-Computer. The [[:de:TT-100|TT-100]] was a test tube filled with 100 microliters of a DNA-solution. He managed to solve for example an instance of the directed [[Hamiltonian path]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;Braich, Ravinderjit S., et al. "Solution of a satisfiability problem on a gel-based DNA computer." ''DNA Computing''. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2001. 27-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment a simple version of the “[[travelling salesman problem]]” was “solved”. For this purpose, different DNA-fragments were created, each one of them representing a city that had to be visited. Every one of these fragments is capable of a linkage with the other fragments created. These DNA-fragments were produced and mixed in a [[test tube]]. Within seconds, the small fragments form bigger ones, representing the different travel routes. Through a chemical reaction (that lasts a few days), the DNA-fragments representing the longer routes were eliminated. The remains are the solution to the problem. However, current technical limitations prevent evaluation of the results. Therefore, the experiment isn’t suitable for application, but it is nevertheless a [[proof of concept]].

=== Combinatorial problems ===
First results to these problems were obtained by [[Leonard Adleman]] ([[NASA]] [[JPL]])
* In 1994: Solving a [[Hamiltonian path problem|Hamiltonian path]] in a graph with 7 summits.
* In 2002: Solving a [[NP-complete]] problem as well as a [[3-satisfiability|3-SAT]] problem with 20 variables.

=== Tic-tac-toe game ===
In 2002, J. Macdonald, D. Stefanovic and Mr. Stojanovic created a DNA computer able to play [[tic-tac-toe]] against a human player.&lt;ref&gt;[FR] - J. Macdonald, D. Stefanovic et M. Stojanovic, ''Des assemblages d'ADN rompus au jeu et au travail'', [[:fr:Pour la Science|Pour la Science]], {{n°|375}}, January 2009, {{p.|68-75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculator consists of nine bins corresponding to the nine squares of the game. Each bin contains a substrate and various combinations of DNA enzymes. The substrate itself is composed of a DNA strand onto which was grafted a fluorescent chemical group at one end, and the other end, a repressor group. Fluorescence is only active if the molecules of the substrate are halved. The DNA enzyme simulate [[Logic function|logical functions]]. For example, such a DNA will unfold if two specific types of DNA strand are introduced to reproduce the logic function AND.

By default, the computer is supposed to play first in the central square. The human player has then as a starter eight different types of DNA strands assigned to each of eight boxes that may be played. To indicate that box nr. i is being ticked, the human player pours into all bins the strands corresponding to input #i. These strands bind to certain DNA enzymes present in the bins, resulting in one of these two bins in the deformation of the DNA enzymes which binds to the substrate and cuts it. The corresponding bin becomes fluorescent, indicating which box is being played by the DNA computer. The various DNA enzymes are divided into various bins in such a way to ensure the victory of the DNA computer against the human player.

=== Neural network based computing ===
Kevin Cherry and Lulu Qian at Caltech developed a DNA-based artificial neural network that can recognize 100-bit hand-written digits. They achieve this by programming on computer in advance with appropriate set of weights represented by varying concentrations weight molecules which will later be added to the test tube that holds the input DNA strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qian|first=Lulu|last2=Winfree|first2=Erik|last3=Bruck|first3=Jehoshua|date=July 2011|title=Neural network computation with DNA strand displacement cascades|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10262|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=475|issue=7356|pages=368–372|doi=10.1038/nature10262|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherry|first=Kevin M.|last2=Qian|first2=Lulu|date=2018-07-04|title=Scaling up molecular pattern recognition with DNA-based winner-take-all neural networks|url=https://nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0289-6|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=559|issue=7714|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0289-6|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capabilities ==

DNA computing is a form of [[parallel computing]] in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For certain specialized problems, DNA computers are faster and smaller than any other computer built so far. Furthermore, particular mathematical computations have been demonstrated to work on a DNA computer.  As an example, [[DNA]] molecules have been utilized to tackle the [[assignment problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = DNA-based computing of strategic assignment problems | journal = Physical Review Letters | date = 2011 | first1 = Jian-Jun | last1 = Shu | first2 = Q.-W. | last2 = Wang | first3 = K.-Y. | last3 = Yong | volume = 106 | issue = 18 | pages = 188702 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.188702 | pmid=21635133| bibcode = 2011PhRvL.106r8702S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; has provided a general implementation of [[Strassen algorithm|Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm]] on a DNA computer, although there are problems with [[scalability|scaling]]. In addition, Caltech researchers have created a circuit made from 130 unique DNA strands, which is able to calculate the square root of numbers up to 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[Science News]][http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/330621/title/Flexible_DNA_computer_finds_square_roots_ Flexbile DNA computer finds square roots]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Salehi et al. showed that with a new coding referred to as "''fractional coding''", chemical reactions in general and DNA reactions in particular, can compute polynomials. In the fractional coding two DNA molecules are used to represent each variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.A. Salehi, K.K. Parhi and M.D. Riedel|first=|year=2017|title=Chemical Reaction Networks for Computing Polynomials|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00163|journal=ACS Synthetic Biology|volume=6 |issue=1|pages=76–83|via=|doi=10.1021/acssynbio.5b00163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA computing does not provide any new capabilities from the standpoint of [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], the study of which problems are computationally solvable using different models of computation.
For example,
if the space required for the solution of a problem grows exponentially with the size of the problem ([[EXPSPACE]] problems) on [[von Neumann architecture|von Neumann machines]], it still grows exponentially with the size of the problem on DNA machines.
For very large EXPSPACE problems, the amount of DNA required is too large to be practical.

==Methods==
There are multiple methods for building a computing device based on DNA, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Most of these build the basic logic gates ([[Logical AND|AND]], [[Logical OR|OR]], [[Logical NOT|NOT]]) associated with [[digital logic]] from a DNA basis. Some of the different bases include DNAzymes, [[oligonucleotide|deoxyoligonucleotides]], enzymes, toehold exchange.

===DNAzymes===
Catalytic DNA ([[deoxyribozyme]] or DNAzyme) catalyze a reaction when interacting with the appropriate input, such as a matching [[oligonucleotide]]. These DNAzymes are used to build logic gates analogous to digital logic in silicon; however, DNAzymes are limited to 1-, 2-, and 3-input gates with no current implementation for evaluating statements in series.

The DNAzyme logic gate changes its structure when it binds to a matching oligonucleotide and the fluorogenic substrate it is bonded to is cleaved free. While other materials can be used, most models use a fluorescence-based substrate because it is very easy to detect, even at the single molecule limit.&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;
{{Cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = S. | title = Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Single Biomolecules | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5408.1676 | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5408 | pages = 1676–1683 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10073925| pmc = |bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1676W }}. Also available here: http://www.lps.ens.fr/~vincent/smb/PDF/weiss-1.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of fluorescence can then be measured to tell whether or not a reaction took place. The DNAzyme that changes is then “used,” and cannot initiate any more reactions. Because of this, these reactions take place in a device such as a continuous stirred-tank reactor, where old product is removed and new molecules added.

Two commonly used DNAzymes are named E6 and 8-17. These are popular because they allow cleaving of a substrate in any arbitrary location.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; While these DNAzymes have been demonstrated to be useful for constructing logic gates, they are limited by the need for a metal cofactor to function, such as Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and thus are not useful [[in vivo]].&lt;ref name="weiss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A design called a ''stem loop'', consisting of a single strand of DNA which has a loop at an end, are a dynamic structure that opens and closes when a piece of DNA bonds to the loop part. This effect has been exploited to create several [[logic gate]]s. These logic gates have been used to create the computers MAYA I and [[MAYA II]] which can play [[tic-tac-toe]] to some extent.&lt;!--

Enzyme based DNA computers are usually of the form of a simple [[Turing machine]]; there is analogous hardware, in the form of an enzyme, and software, in the form of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Shapiro

Benenson, Shapiro and colleagues have demonstrated a DNA computer using the [[FokI]] enzyme&lt;ref name="shapiro"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benenson | first1 = Y. | last2 = Paz-Elizur | first2 = T. | last3 = Adar | first3 = R. | last4 = Keinan | first4 = E. | last5 = Livneh | first5 = Z. | last6 = Shapiro | first6 = E. | doi = 10.1038/35106533 | title = Programmable and autonomous computing machine made of biomolecules | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = 6862 | pages = 430–434 | year = 2001 | pmid =  11719800| pmc = 3838952| bibcode = 2001Natur.414..430B }}.

&lt;/ref&gt; On negative diagnosis it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing. A limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required, one to administer each drug. The entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete. This method also requires transition molecules as well as the FokI enzyme to be present. The requirement for the FokI enzyme limits application ''in vivo'', at least for use in "cells of higher organisms".&lt;ref name="kahan08"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be pointed out that the 'software' molecules can be reused in this case.

=== Toehold exchange ===
DNA computers have also been constructed using the concept of toehold exchange. In this system, an input DNA strand binds to a [[sticky end]], or toehold, on another DNA molecule, which allows it to displace another strand segment from the molecule. This allows the creation of modular logic components such as AND, OR, and NOT gates and signal amplifiers, which can be linked into arbitrarily large computers. This class of DNA computers does not require enzymes or any chemical capability of the DNA.&lt;!--

DNA nanotechnology has been applied to the related field of DNA computing. DNA tiles can be designed to contain multiple sticky ends with sequences chosen so that they act as [[Wang tile]]s. A DX array has been demonstrated whose assembly encodes an [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation; this allows the DNA array to implement a [[cellular automaton]] which generates a [[fractal]] called the [[Sierpinski gasket]]. This shows that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays, increasing its scope beyond simple periodic arrays.&lt;!--

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10920">'''Densely packed decimal''' (DPD) is an efficient method for [[binary coding|binary]] encoding [[decimal]] digits.

The traditional system of binary encoding for decimal digits, known as [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD), uses four bits to encode each digit, resulting in significant wastage of binary data bandwidth (since four bits can store 16 states and are being used to store only 10). Densely packed decimal is a more efficient code that packs three digits into ten bits using a scheme that allows compression from, or expansion to, BCD with only two or three gate delays in hardware.&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2002"/&gt;

The densely packed decimal encoding is a refinement of [[Chen–Ho encoding]]; it gives the same compression and speed advantages, but the particular arrangement of bits used confers additional advantages:
* Compression of one or two digits (into the optimal four or seven bits respectively) is achieved as a subset of the three-digit encoding. This means that arbitrary numbers of decimal digits (not just multiples of three digits) can be encoded efficiently. For example, 38=12×3+2 decimal digits can be encoded in 12×10+7=127 bits – that is, 12 sets of three decimal digits can be encoded using 12 sets of ten binary bits and the remaining two decimal digits can be encoded using a further seven binary bits.
* The subset encoding mentioned above is simply the rightmost bits of the standard three-digit encoding; the encoded value can be widened simply by adding leading 0 bits.
* All seven-bit BCD numbers (0 through 79) are encoded identically by DPD. This makes conversions of common small numbers trivial. (This must break down at 80, because that requires eight bits for BCD, but the above property requires that the DPD encoding must fit into seven bits.)
* The low-order bit of each digit is copied unmodified. Thus, the non-trivial portion of the encoding can be considered a conversion from three base-5 digits to seven binary bits. Further, digit-wise [[Truth value|logical values]] (in which each digit is either 0 or 1) can be manipulated directly without any encoding or decoding being necessary.

== History ==
In 1971, [[Tien Chi Chen]]&lt;ref name="CSE"/&gt; and [[Irving Tze Ho]]&lt;ref name="Tseng_1988"/&gt; devised a lossless [[prefix code]] (known as [[Chen–Ho encoding]] since 2000&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2000_CH"/&gt;) which packed three decimal digits into ten binary bits using a scheme which allowed compression from or expansion to BCD with only two or three gate delays in hardware. Densely packed decimal is a refinement of this, devised by [[Mike F. Cowlishaw]] in 2002,&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2002"/&gt; which was incorporated into the [[IEEE 754-2008]]&lt;ref name="IEEE-754_2008"/&gt; and [[ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011]]&lt;ref name="ISO-60559_2011"/&gt; standards for decimal [[floating-point]].

== Encoding ==
Like Chen–Ho encoding, DPD encoding classifies each decimal digit into one of two ranges, depending on the most significant bit of the binary form: "small" digits have values 0 through 7 (binary 0000–0111), and "large" digits, 8 through 9 (binary 1000–1001). Once it is known or has been indicated that a digit is small, three more bits are still required to specify the value. If a large value has been indicated, only one bit is required to distinguish between the values 8 or 9.

When encoding, the most significant bit of each of the three digits to be encoded select one of eight coding patterns for the remaining bits, according to the following table. The table shows how, on decoding, the ten bits of the coded form in columns ''b9'' through ''b0'' are copied into the three digits ''d2'' through ''d0'', and the remaining bits are filled in with constant zeros or ones.

{{Densely packed decimal}}

Bits b7, b4 and b0 (&lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;) are passed through the encoding unchanged, and do not affect the meaning of the other bits. The remaining seven bits can be considered a seven-bit encoding for three base-5 digits.

Bits b8 and b9 are not needed and ignored when decoding DPD groups with three large digits (marked as "x" in the last row of the table above), but are filled with zeros when encoding.

The eight decimal values whose digits are all 8s or 9s have four codings each.
The bits marked x in the table above are ignored on input, but will always be 0 in computed results.
(The 8×3 = 24 non-standard encodings fill in the gap between 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=1000 and 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;=1024.)

'''Dusa McDuff''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|CorrFRSE]] (born 18 October 1945) is an English mathematician who works on [[symplectic geometry]]. She was the first recipient of the [[Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics]], was a [[Noether Lecture]]r, and is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].

==Early life and education==
Margaret Dusa Waddington was born in London, England, on 18 October 1945 to [[Edinburgh]] architect [[Margaret Justin Blanco White]], second wife of [[biologist]] [[Conrad Hal Waddington]], her father.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-25578|title=McDuff, Prof. (Margaret) Dusa|last=|first=|work=Who's who|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister is the anthropologist [[Caroline Humphrey]], and she has an elder half-brother C. Jake Waddington by her father's first marriage. Her mother was the daughter of [[Amber Reeves]], the noted feminist, author and lover of [[H. G. Wells]]. McDuff grew up in Scotland where her father was Professor of [[Genetics]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. McDuff was educated at [[St George's School, Edinburgh|St. George's School]] for Girls in Edinburgh and, although the standard was lower than at the corresponding boys' school, [[Edinburgh Academy|The Edinburgh Academy]], McDuff had an exceptionally good mathematics teacher.&lt;ref name="as" /&gt; She writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I always wanted to be a mathematician (apart from a time when I was eleven when I wanted to be a farmer's wife), and assumed that I would have a career, but I had no idea how to go about it: I didn't realize that the choices which one made about education were important and I had no idea that I might experience real difficulties and conflicts in reconciling the demands of a career with life as a woman.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=University of St. Andrews: Dusa McDuff|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/McDuff.html|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turning down a scholarship to the [[University of Cambridge]] to stay with her boyfriend in [[Scotland]], she enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=as&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographies of Women Mathematicians: Dusa McDuff|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/mcduff.htm|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated with a BSc Hons in 1967, going on to [[Girton College, Cambridge]] as a doctoral student. Here, under the guidance of mathematician George A. Reid, McDuff worked on problems in [[functional analysis]]. She solved a problem on [[Von Neumann algebra|Von Neumann algebras]], constructing infinitely many different factors of type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and published the work in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.

After completing her doctorate in 1971 McDuff was appointed to a two-year Science Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship at Cambridge. Following her husband, the literary translator [[David McDuff]], she left for a six-month visit to Moscow. Her husband was studying the Russian Symbolist poet [[Innokenty Annensky]]. Though McDuff had no specific plans&lt;ref name=sb&gt;{{cite web|title=Dusa McDuff: Some Autobiographical Notes|url=http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~tony/visualization/dusa/dusabio.html|publisher=Stony Brook University|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it turned out to be a profitable visit for her mathematically. There, she met [[Israel Gelfand]] in Moscow who gave her a deeper appreciation of mathematics.&lt;ref name="as" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; McDuff later wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[My collaboration with him]... was not planned: it happened that his was the only name which came to mind when I had to fill out a form in the Inotdel office. The first thing that Gel'fand told me was that he was much more interested in the fact that my husband was studying the Russian Symbolist poet [[Innokenty Annensky]] than that I had found infinitely many [[Hyperfinite type II factor|type II-sub-one factors]], but then he proceeded to open my eyes to the world of mathematics. It was a wonderful education, in which reading [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Mozart]] and [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] played as important a role as learning about [[Lie group]]s or reading [[Élie Cartan|Cartan]] and [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]]. [[Israel Gelfand|Gel'fand]] amazed me by talking of mathematics as though it were poetry. He once said about a long paper bristling with formulas that it contained the vague beginnings of an idea which he could only hint at and which he had never managed to bring out more clearly. I had always thought of mathematics as being much more straightforward: a formula is a formula, and an algebra is an algebra, but [[Israel Gelfand|Gel'fand]] found hedgehogs lurking in the rows of his spectral sequences!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On returning to Cambridge McDuff started attending [[Frank Adams]]'s [[topology]] lectures and was soon invited to teach at the [[University of York]]. In 1975 she separated from her husband, and was divorced in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=don/&gt; At the University of York, she "essentially wrote a second PhD"&lt;ref name="sb" /&gt; while working with [[Graeme Segal]]. At this time a position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) opened up for her, reserved for visiting female mathematicians. Her career as a mathematician developed further while at [[MIT]], and soon she was accepted to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] where she worked with Segal on the [[Atiyah–Segal completion theorem]]. She then returned to England where she was took up a lectureship at the [[University of Warwick]].&lt;ref name=awm&gt;{{cite web|last=McDuff|first=Dusa|title=Symplectic Structures – A New Approach to Geometry|url=http://www.awm-math.org/noetherbrochure/McDuff98.html|work=Association of Women Mathematicians|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time she met mathematician [[John Milnor]] who was then based in [[Princeton University]]. To live closer to him she took up an untenured assistant professorship at the [[Stony Brook University]].&lt;ref name="sb" /&gt; Now an independent mathematician, she began work on the relationship between [[diffeomorphism]]s and the classifying space for [[foliation]]s. She has since worked on [[Symplectic Geometry|symplectic topology]]. In the spring of 1985, McDuff attended the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]] to study [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhael Gromov's]] work on elliptic methods. Since 2007, she has held the Helen Lyttle Kimmel chair at [[Barnard College]].

In 1984 McDuff married [[John Milnor]], a mathematician at [[Stony Brook University]], and a [[Fields medal]]list, [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics|Wolf Prize winner]] and [[Abel Prize]] Laureate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=don&gt;Donald J. Albers &amp; [[Gerald L. Alexanderson]] (2011) ''Fascinating Mathematical People: interviews and memoirs'', "Dusa McDuff", pp 215–39, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-691-14829-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lp&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~wmnmath/People/Biographies/McDuff.html L. Polterovich, "Focus on the scientist: Dusa McDuff"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and research==
For the past 30 years McDuff has been a contributor to the development of the field of [[symplectic geometry]] and [[topology]]. She gave the first example of symplectic forms on a closed manifold that are [[cohomology|cohomologous]] but not [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] and also classified the rational and ruled symplectic four-manifolds, completed with [[François Lalonde]].&lt;ref name=fl&gt;{{cite web|title=Université de Montréal Département de mathématiques et de statistique: Lalonde, Francois|url=http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/portrait/lalonde|publisher=Université de MontréalDépartement de mathématiques et de statistique|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, partly in collaboration with Susan Tolman,&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Tolman|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~stolman/|publisher=UIUC|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has studied applications of methods of [[Symplectic Geometry|symplectic topology]] to the theory of Hamiltonian torus actions.  She has also worked on embedding capacities of 4-dimensional symplectic [[ellipsoid]]s with Felix Schlenk,&lt;ref name=fs&gt;{{cite web|title=Felix Schlenk|url=http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=54438|publisher=Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives rise to some very interesting number-theoretical questions. It also indicates a connection between the [[combinatorics]] of [[Pseudoholomorphic curve|J-holomorphic curves]] in the blow up of the projective plane and the numbers that appear as indices in [[embedded contact homology]].&lt;ref name=don /&gt;&lt;ref name=lp /&gt; With [[Katrin Wehrheim]], she has challenged the foundational rigor of a classic proof in [[symplectic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170209-the-fight-to-fix-symplectic-geometry/|magazine=Quanta|title=A Fight to Fix Geometry’s Foundations: When two mathematicians raised pointed questions about a classic proof that no one really understood, they ignited a years-long debate about how much could be trusted in a new kind of geometry|first=Kevin|last=Hartnett|date=February 9, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With {{ill|Dietmar Salamon|de|Dietmar Arno Salamon}}, she co-authored two textbooks ''Introduction to [[Symplectic topology|Symplectic Topology]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198504511.do ''Introduction to Symplectic Topology'', 2nd edition, Oxford U.

'''Equity value''' is the value of a company available to owners or shareholders. It is the [[enterprise value]] plus all cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, and less all [[money market|short-term debt]], long-term debt and minority interests.

Equity value accounts for all the [[ownership interest]] in a firm including the value of unexercised [[stock options]] and securities convertible to equity.  

From a [[mergers and acquisitions]] to  an academic perspective, equity value differs from [[market capitalization]] or market value in that it incorporates all equity interests in a firm whereas market capitalization or market value only reflects those common shares currently outstanding.

==Calculating Equity Value==
Equity value can be calculated two ways, either the intrinsic value method, or the fair market value method. The intrinsic value method is calculated as follows: 

 Equity Value = 
 [[Market capitalization]] 
 + Amount that in-the-money [[stock options]] are in the money
 + Value of [[Stock|equity]] issued from in-the-money [[convertible security|convertible securities]] 
 - Proceeds from the conversion of convertible securities

The fair market value method is as follows:

 Equity Value = 
 [[Market capitalization]] 
 + fair value of all stock [[Option (finance)|options]] (in the money and out of the money), calculated using the [[Black–Scholes]] formula or a similar method
 + Value of [[convertible security|convertible securities]] in excess of what the same securities would be valued without the conversion attribute

The fair market value method more accurately captures the value of out of the money securities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4283">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[topological group]]s, '''an extension of topological groups''', or a '''topological extension''', is a  [[short exact sequence]] &lt;math&gt; 0\to H\stackrel{\imath}{\to} X \stackrel{\pi}{\to}G\to 0 &lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;H, X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are topological groups and  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;  are  continuous homomorphisms which are also open onto their images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cabello Sánchez | first= Félix | title=Quasi-homomorphisms | zbl=1051.39032 | volume=178 | number=3 | pages=255–270 | year=2003 | journal=Fundam. Math. | doi=10.4064/fm178-3-5 | url=http://journals.impan.gov.pl/cgi-bin/fm/pdf?fm178-3-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every extension of topological groups is therefore  a [[group extension]].

==Classification of extensions of topological groups==
We say that the topological extensions  
:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; 
and  
:&lt;math&gt;0\to H\stackrel{i'}{\rightarrow} X'\stackrel{\pi'}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
are equivalent (or congruent) if there exists a topological isomorphism &lt;math&gt;T: X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; making [[Commutative diagram|commutative]] the diagram of Figure 1.

[[File:Extensions groups2.png|thumb|Figure 1]]

We say that the topological extension

:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is a ''split extension'' (or splits) if it is equivalent to the trivial extension

:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i_H}{\rightarrow} H\times G\stackrel{\pi_G}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i_H: H\to H\times G&lt;/math&gt; is the natural inclusion over the first factor and &lt;math&gt;\pi_G: H\times G\to  G&lt;/math&gt; is the natural projection over the second factor.

It is easy to prove that the topological extension  &lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; splits if and only if there is a continuous homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R: X \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R\circ i&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the topological extension &lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; splits if and only if the subgroup &lt;math&gt;i(H)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Direct sum of topological groups|topological direct summand]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

* Take &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; the [[real numbers]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z &lt;/math&gt; the [[Integer|integer numbers]]. Take   &lt;math&gt;\imath &lt;/math&gt; the natural inclusion and &lt;math&gt;\pi &lt;/math&gt; the natural projection. Then

:: &lt;math&gt; 0\to \mathbb Z\stackrel{\imath}{\to} \mathbb R \stackrel{\pi}{\to}\mathbb R/\mathbb Z\to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

: is an extension of topological abelian groups. Indeed it is an example of a non-splitting extension.

==Extensions of locally compact abelian groups (LCA)==

An extension of topological abelian groups will be a  short exact sequence &lt;math&gt; 0\to H\stackrel{\imath}{\to} X \stackrel{\pi}{\to}G\to 0 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H, X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are [[Locally compact group|locally compact abelian groups]] and  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;  are relatively open continuous homomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fulp | first1=R.O. | last2=Griffith | first2=P.A. | title=Extensions of locally compact abelian groups.

[[File:GanttChartAnatomy.svg|right|thumb|A Gantt chart showing three kinds of schedule dependencies (in red) and percent complete indications.]]
A '''Gantt chart''' is a type of [[bar chart]] that illustrates a [[schedule (project management)|project schedule]], named after its inventor, [[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), who designed such a chart around the years 1910–1915.{{sfn|Gantt|1910}}{{sfn|Morris|1997|p=7}} Modern Gantt charts also show the [[Dependency (project management)|dependency]] relationships between activities and current schedule status.

== Definition ==
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=97, 117, 276}} that illustrates a project schedule.&lt;ref name="Kumar 2005 pp. 13–21"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=Pankaja Pradeep |title=Effective Use of Gantt Chart for Managing Large Scale Projects |journal=Cost Engineering |publisher=American Association of Cost Engineers |publication-place=Morgantown, WV |volume=47 |issue=7 |year=2005 |oclc=209778284 |issn=0274-9696 |pages=13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=117, 276}} The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity.{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=117, 276}}{{sfn|Selig|2008|p=235}} Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a [[project]]. Terminal elements and summary elements constitute the [[work breakdown structure]] of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the [[Dependency (project management)|dependency]] (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line as shown here.

Gantt charts are sometimes equated with bar charts.{{sfn|Selig|2008|p=235}}{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=236|loc=Chapter 12}}

Gantt charts are usually created initially using an ''early start time approach'', where each task is scheduled to start immediately when its prerequisites are complete. This method maximizes the [[Float (project management)|float time]] available for all tasks.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

== Historical development ==

Although now regarded as a common charting technique, Gantt charts were considered revolutionary when first introduced.{{sfn|Wilson|2003}} The first known tool of this type was developed in 1896 by [[Karol Adamiecki]], who called it a ''harmonogram''.{{sfn|Marsh|1974|p=32}} Adamiecki did not publish his chart until 1931, however, and only in Polish, which limited both its adoption and recognition of his authorship.

In 1912, {{ill|Hermann Schürch|de}} published what would be considered Gantt charts while discussing a construction project. It appears that Schürch's charts were not notable but rather routine in Germany at the time they were published.{{sfn|Weaver|2012a|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Weaver|2012b|pp=4–6}}{{sfn|Weaver|2017|pp=6–7}} The prior development leading to Schürch's work is unknown.{{sfn|Weaver|2017|p=7}} Unlike later Gantt charts, Schürch's charts did not display interdependencies, leaving them to be inferred by the reader. These were also static representations of a planned schedule.{{sfn|Weaver|2017|p=6}}

The chart is named after [[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), who designed his chart around the years 1910–1915.{{sfn|Gantt|1910}}{{sfn|Morris|1997|p=7}}

One of the first major applications of Gantt charts was by the United States during [[World War I]], at the instigation of [[William Crozier (artillerist)|General William Crozier]].{{sfn|Clark|1922}}

The earliest Gantt charts were drawn on paper and therefore had to be redrawn entirely in order to adjust to schedule changes. For many years, project managers used pieces of paper or blocks for Gantt chart bars so they could be adjusted as needed.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=281|loc=Chapter 14}} Gantt's collaborator, [[Walter Polakov]] introduced Gantt charts to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 when he was working for the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]]. They were used in developing the [[First Five Year Plan]], supplying Russian translations to explain their use.&lt;ref name ="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, D. J. (2004) "[https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=artspapers Marxist Manager Amidst the Progressives: Walter N.

In the 1980s, personal computers allowed widespread creation of complex and elaborate Gantt charts. The first desktop applications were intended mainly for project managers and project schedulers. With the advent of the Internet and increased collaboration over networks at the end of the 1990s, Gantt charts became a common feature of web-based applications, including collaborative [[groupware]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} By 2012, almost all Gantt charts were made by software which can easily adjust to schedule changes.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=281|loc=Chapter 14}}

In 1999, Gantt charts were identified as "one of the most widely used management tools for project scheduling and control".{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

== Example ==
In the following table there are seven tasks, labeled ''a'' through ''g''. Some tasks can be done concurrently (''a'' and ''b'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''c'' and ''d'' cannot begin until ''a'' is complete). Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''O''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''M''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''P''). The expected time (''T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'') is estimated using the [[Beta distribution#Project management: task cost and schedule modeling|beta probability distribution]] for the time estimates, using the formula (''O''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''M''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''P'')&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a Gantt chart or a network diagram.

:[[File:pert example gantt chart.gif|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]

== Progress Gantt charts ==
In a progress Gantt chart, tasks are shaded in proportion to the degree of their completion: a task that is 60% complete would be 60% shaded, starting from the left. A vertical line is drawn at the time index when the progress Gantt chart is created, and this line can then be compared with shaded tasks. If everything is on schedule, all task portions left of the line will be shaded, and all task portions right of the line will not be shaded. This provides a visual representation of how the project and its tasks are ahead or behind schedule.{{sfn|Klein|1999|pp=56–57}}

== Linked Gantt charts ==
''Linked Gantt charts'' contain lines indicating the dependencies between tasks. However, linked Gantt charts quickly become cluttered in all but the simplest cases. [[Critical path network diagram]]s are superior to visually communicate the relationships between tasks.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=239|loc=Chapter 12}} However, Gantt charts are often preferred over network diagrams because Gantt charts are easily interpreted without training, whereas critical path diagrams require training to interpret.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=236|loc=Chapter 12}} Gantt chart software typically provides mechanisms to link task dependencies, although this data may or may not be visually represented.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}} Gantt charts and network diagrams are often used for the same project, both being generated from the same data by a software application.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

==Education and career==
Knight was the youngest of three sisters who all became mathematics and science educators,
daughters of a seamstress and a civil service radar specialist.
As a freshman at [[Fort Valley State University|Fort Valley State College]] in 1957, Knight was studying [[home economics]] when the [[Sputnik]] launch created a big push for more American students to become educated in mathematics and the sciences. Knight transferred to mathematics, "because it had fewer labs than any of the sciences", and graduated in 1961.{{r|centennial|diaspora|maa}}

She completed a master's degree in 1963 at [[Clark Atlanta University|Atlanta University]], under the supervision of [[Abdulalim A. Shabazz]],
and took a teaching position at the [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]], also becoming an NSF fellow, a position that allowed her to travel and meet with other college mathematics teachers. In 1966, she returned to graduate school, and completed a doctorate in mathematics education in 1970 at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] under the supervision of Henry H. Walbesser.{{r|centennial|diaspora|maa}}

Returning from her doctorate, Knight remained at the Hampton Institute, where she became chair of mathematics and computer science.{{r|dta}} In 1985 she moved to [[Coppin State University|Coppin State College]] as a full professor.{{r|diaspora|maa}} She retired in 2006.

==Recognition==
In 1980, the Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics named Knight as their College Teacher of the Year.{{r|jet}}
In 1993 she was named Maryland Mathematics Teacher of the Year, and the [[Mathematical Association of America]] gave Knight a Distinguished Teaching Award.{{r|dta}}
In 1996 the [[University System of Maryland]] named her as that year's Wilson H. Elkins Distinguished Professor.{{r|nctm}}
The [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] gave her their 1999 lifetime achievement award for her service to mathematics education, outspoken support of equity "regardless of ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic background", and distinguished teaching.{{r|nctm}} She was the 2013 Cox–Talbot Lecturer of the [[National Association of Mathematicians]], one of the member societies of the [[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences]].{{r|cox}}
In 2018 the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] named her as one of their inaugural Fellows.{{r|fawm}}

==Access sequences and competitive ratio==
As typically formulated, the online binary search tree problem involves search trees defined over a fixed key set (1, 2, ..., ''n''). An ''access sequence'' is a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2,&lt;/math&gt; ... where each number ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is one of the given keys.

Any particular algorithm for maintaining binary search trees (such as the [[splay tree]] algorithm or [[Iacono's working set structure]]) has a ''cost'' for each access sequence that models the amount of time it would take to use the structure to search for each of the keys in the access sequence in turn. The cost of a search is modeled by assuming that the search tree algorithm has a single pointer into a binary search tree, which at the start of each search points to the root of the tree. The algorithm may then perform any sequence of the following operations:
* Move the pointer to its left child.
* Move the pointer to its right child.
* Move the pointer to its parent.
* Perform a single [[tree rotation]] on the pointer and its parent.
The search is required, at some point within this sequence of operations to move the pointer to a node containing the key, and the cost of the search is the number of operations that are performed in the sequence. The total cost cost&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') for algorithm ''A'' on access sequence ''X'' is the sum of the costs of the searches for each successive key in the sequence.

As is standard in [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive analysis]], the [[competitive ratio]] of an algorithm ''A'' is defined to be the maximum, over all access sequences, of the ratio of the cost for ''A'' to the best cost that any algorithm could achieve:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_A = \sup_X \frac{\mathrm{cost}_A(X)}{\mathrm{cost}_\mathrm{opt}(X)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dynamic optimality conjecture]] states that [[splay tree]]s have constant competitive ratio, but this remains unproven. The geometric view of binary search trees provides a different way of understanding the problem that has led to the development of alternative algorithms that could also (conjecturally) have a constant competitive ratio.

==Translation to a geometric point set==
In the geometric view of the online binary search tree problem,
an ''access sequence'' &lt;math&gt;x_1, . . ., x_m&lt;/math&gt; (sequence of searches performed on a binary search tree (BST) with a key set &lt;math&gt;{1,2,...,n}&lt;/math&gt;) is mapped to the set of points &lt;math&gt;{(x_i, i)}&lt;/math&gt;, where X-axis represents key space and Y-axis represents time; to which a set of '''touched''' nodes is added.  By '''touched''' nodes we mean the following. Consider a BST access algorithm with a single pointer to a node in the tree. At the beginning of an access to a given key &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, this pointer is initialized to the root of the tree. Whenever the pointer moves to or is initialized to a node, we say that the node is touched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

We represent a BST algorithm for a given input sequence by drawing a point for each item that gets touched.

For example, assume the following BST on 4 nodes is given: [[File:StaticBinarySearchTree GeometricalView example.jpg|130px]]
The key set is {1, 2, 3, 4}.

{{double image|right|Geometrical view of binary search trees - access sequence only.jpg|275|Geometrical view of binary search trees - access sequence.jpg|275|Mapping of the access sequence 3, 1, 4, 2 only.|A geometric view of binary search tree algorithm.}}

Let 3, 1, 4, 2 be the access sequence. 
* In the first access, only the node 3 is touched. 
* In the second access, the nodes 3 and 1 are touched. 
* In the third access - 3 and 4 are touched. 
* In the fourth access, touch 3, then 1, and after that 2.

The touches are represented geometrically: If an item ''x'' is touched in the operations for the ''i''th access, then a point (''x'',''i'') is plotted.

== Arborally satisfied point sets ==

[[File:Rectangle spanned by two points example.jpg|thumb|right|Rectangle spanned by two points. This point set is ''not'' arborally satisfied.]]

[[File:Example of arborally satisfied set of points.jpg|thumb|right|This is an example of arborally satisfied set of points.]]

A point set is said to be '''arborally satisfied''' if the following property holds: for any
pair of points that do not both lie on the same horizontal or vertical line, there exists a third point
which lies in the rectangle spanned by the first two points (either inside or on the boundary).

=== Theorem ===
A point set containing the points &lt;math&gt;(x_i, i)&lt;/math&gt; is arborally satisfied if and only if it corresponds to a valid BST for the input sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, . . ., x_m&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Proof ====
First, prove that the point set for any valid BST algorithm is arborally satisfied.
Consider points &lt;math&gt;(x, i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y, j)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|x}} is touched at time {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|y}} is touched at time {{mvar|j}}. Assume by symmetry that &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i &lt; j&lt;/math&gt;. It needs to be shown that there exists a third point in the rectangle
with corners as &lt;math&gt;(x, i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y, j)&lt;/math&gt;. Also let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_t(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[lowest common ancestor]] of nodes {{mvar|a}}
and {{mvar|b}} right before time {{mvar|t}}. There are a few cases:
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y) \ne x&lt;/math&gt;, then use the point &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y), i)&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_i(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; must have been touched if {{mvar|x}} was.
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LCA}_j(x, y) \ne y&lt;/math&gt;, then the point &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{LCA}_j(x, y), j)&lt;/math&gt; can be used.
* If neither of the above two cases hold, then {{mvar|x}} must be an ancestor of {{mvar|y}} right before time {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|y}} be an ancestor of {{mvar|x}} right before time {{mvar|j}}. Then at some time {{mvar|k}} &lt;math&gt;(i \ge k &lt; j)&lt;/math&gt;, {{mvar|y}} must have been rotated above {{mvar|x}}, so the point &lt;math&gt;(y, k)&lt;/math&gt; can be used.

Next, show the other direction: given an arborally satisfied point set, a valid BST corresponding to that point set can be constructed. Organize our BST into a treap which is organized in heap-order by next-touch-time. Note that next-touch-time has ties and is thus not uniquely defined, but this isn’t a problem as long as there is a way to break ties. When time {{mvar|i}} reached, the nodes touched form a connected subtree at the top, by the heap ordering property. Now, assign new next-touch-times for this subtree, and rearrange it into a new local treap.
If a pair of nodes, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, straddle the boundary between the touched and untouched part
of the treap, then if {{mvar|y}} is to be touched sooner than {{mvar|x}} then &lt;math&gt;(x, now) \to (y, next - touch(y))&lt;/math&gt; is an unsatisfied rectangle because the leftmost such point would be the right child of {{mvar|x}}, not {{mvar|y}}.

{{clear}}

=== Corollary ===
Finding the best BST execution for the input sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, . . ., x_m&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to finding the minimum cardinality superset of points (that contains the input in geometric representation) that is arborally satisfied. The more general problem of finding the minimum cardinality arborally satisfied superset of a general set of input points (not limited to one input point per {{mvar|y}} coordinate), is known to be [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="DHIKP09"/&gt;

== Greedy algorithm ==
The following greedy algorithm constructs arborally satisfiable sets:
* Sweep the point set with a horizontal line by increasing {{mvar|y}} coordinate. 
* At time {{mvar|i}}, place the minimal number of points at &lt;math&gt;y = i&lt;/math&gt; to make the point set up to &lt;math&gt;y \ge i&lt;/math&gt; arborally satisfied. This minimal set of points is uniquely defined: for any unsatisfied rectangle formed with &lt;math&gt;(x_i, i)&lt;/math&gt; in one corner, add the other corner at &lt;math&gt;y = i&lt;/math&gt;.

The algorithm has been conjectured to be optimal within an additive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

In [[mathematics]], '''infinity plus one''' has meaning for the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]], and also as the number [[ω+1]] ([[omega]] plus one) in the [[ordinal number]]s and [[Surreal number#.22... and Beyond..22|surreal number]]s. 

== Mathematics ==
There are several mathematical theories which include both infinite values and addition.

* [[Cardinal number]]s are representations of sizes (cardinalities) of abstract sets, which may be [[infinite set|infinite]]. [[Cardinal addition|Addition of cardinal numbers]] is defined as the cardinality of the [[disjoint union]] of sets of given cardinalities. It can be easily shown that κ + 1 = κ for any infinite cardinal κ, as illustrated by [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]. Moreover, if one assumes the [[axiom of choice]], then κ + λ = max { κ, λ } if at least one of κ or λ is infinite.
* [[Ordinal number]]s represent [[order type]]s of [[well-order]]ed sets. [[Ordinal addition]] is defined as the order type of the [[concatenation]] of orders. This operation is not [[commutative]]: ω + 1 is a strictly larger ordinal than ω, but 1 + ω = ω.
* [[Hyperreal number]]s are an extension of the [[real number]] system which contains infinite and [[infinitesimal number]]s. The resulting system is an [[ordered field]] thanks to the [[transfer principle#Transfer principle for the hyperreals|transfer principle]], which states that any [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentence which is true for real numbers also holds for hyperreals. Since ∀''x'': ''x'' &amp;lt; ''x'' + 1 is a first-order sentence holding for reals (as it follows from the ordered field axioms), adding one to an infinite hyperreal produces infinity. The same will hold for any [[non-Archimedean ordered field]].
* [[Surreal number]]s also extend real numbers to a system which satisfies the axioms of an [[ordered field]], and so addition behaves similarly to hyperreals, in that ''x'' &amp;lt; ''x'' + 1 for all surreals ''x''. In this system, one may find elements corresponding to infinite ordinals; however, surreal addition and multiplication correspond not to the usual ordinal operations, but to the [[ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural sum and natural product]].

'''Multiple encryption''' is the process of [[encryption|encrypting]] an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or a different algorithm. It is also known as '''cascade encryption''', '''cascade ciphering''', '''multiple encryption''', and '''superencipherment'''. '''Superencryption''' refers to the outer-level encryption of a multiple encryption.

==Independent keys==
Picking any two [[cipher]]s, if the [[key (cryptography)|key]] used is the same for both, the second cipher could possibly undo the first cipher, partly or entirely. This is true of ciphers where the decryption process is exactly the same as the encryption process&amp;mdash;the second cipher would completely undo the first. If an attacker were to recover the key through [[cryptanalysis]] of the first encryption layer, the attacker could possibly decrypt all the remaining layers, assuming the same key is used for all layers.

To prevent that risk, one can use keys that are [[statistical independence|statistically independent]] for each layer (e.g. independent [[Random number generator|RNGs]]).

==Importance of the first layer==
With the exception of the [[one-time pad]], no cipher has been theoretically proven to be unbreakable.
Furthermore, some recurring properties may be found in the [[Ciphertext|ciphertexts]] generated by the first cipher. Since those ciphertexts are the plaintexts used by the second cipher, the second cipher may be rendered vulnerable to attacks based on known plaintext properties (see references below).

This is the case when the first layer is a program P that always adds the same string S of characters at the beginning (or end) of all ciphertexts (commonly known as a [[Magic number (programming)|magic number]]). When found in a file, the string S allows an [[Kernel (operating system)|operating system]] to know that the program P has to be launched in order to decrypt the file. This string should be removed before adding a second layer.

To prevent this kind of attack, one can use the method provided by [[Bruce Schneier]] in the references below: generate a random pad of the same size of the plaintext, then [[XOR]] the plaintext with the pad, resulting in a first ciphertext. Encrypt the pad and the first ciphertext with a different cipher and a different key, resulting in 2 more ciphertexts. [[Concatenate]] the last 2 ciphertexts in order to build the final ciphertext. A cryptanalyst must break both ciphers to get any information.  This will, however, have the drawback of making the ciphertext twice as long as the original plaintext.

Note, however, that a weak first cipher may merely make a second cipher that is vulnerable to a [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintext attack]] also vulnerable to a [[Known-plaintext attack|known plaintext attack]]. However, a [[block cipher]] must not be vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack to be considered secure. Therefore, the second cipher described above is not secure under that definition, either. Consequently, both ciphers still need to be broken. The attack illustrates why strong assumptions are made about secure block ciphers and ciphers that are even partially broken should never be used.

==The Rule of Two==

The '''Rule of Two''' is a data security principle from the [[National Security Agency|NSA's]] Commercial Solutions for Classified Program (CSfC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/csfc_program/ |title=Commercial Solutions for Classified Program |publisher=US National Security Agency |access-date=24 December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies two completely independent layers of cryptography to protect data. For example, data could be protected by both hardware encryption at its lowest level and software encryption at the application layer.

The principle is practiced in the NSA's secure mobile phone called [[Fishbowl (secure phone)|Fishbowl]]. The phones use two layers of encryption protocols, [[IPsec]] and [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol]] (SRTP), to protect voice communications.

== Example of Multiple Encryption==

The figure shows from inside to outside the process of how the encrypted capsule is formed in the context of Echo Protocol, used by the Software Application GoldBug Messenger.&lt;ref&gt;http://goldbug.sf.net&lt;/ref&gt; GoldBug has implemented a hybrid system for authenticity and confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, David / Maier, Ann-Kathrin (2016): BIG SEVEN Study, open source crypto-messengers to be compared - or: Comprehensive Confidentiality Review &amp; Audit of GoldBug, Encrypting E-Mail-Client &amp; Secure Instant Messenger, Descriptions, tests and analysis reviews of 20 functions of the application GoldBug based on the essential fields and methods of evaluation of the 8 major international audit manuals for IT security investigations including 38 figures and 87 tables., URL: https://sf.net/projects/goldbug/files/bigseven-crypto-audit.pdf - English / German Language, Version 1.1, 305 pages, June 2016 (ISBN: DNB 110368003X - 2016B14779)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Figure 02 GoldBug – Encrypted Message Format within the Echo- Protocol.png|thumb|500px]]

'''&lt;u&gt;First layer of the encryption:&lt;/u&gt;''' 
The ciphertext of the original readable message is hashed, and subsequently the symmetric keys are encrypted via the asymmetric key - e.g. deploying the algorithm RSA.
In an intermediate step the ciphertext, and the hash digest of the ciphertext are combined into a capsule, and packed together.
It follows the approach: [[w:Authenticated encryption#Encrypt-then-MAC|Encrypt-then-MAC]]. In order for the receiver to verify that the ciphertext has not been tampered with, the digest is computed before the ciphertext is decrypted.

'''&lt;u&gt;Second layer of encryption:&lt;/u&gt;'''
Optionally it is still possible, therefore to encrypt the capsule of the first layer in addition with an [[w:Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256]], - comparable to a commonly shared, 32-character long symmetric password. Hybrid Encryption is then added to multiple encryption.

'''&lt;u&gt;Third layer of the encryption:&lt;/u&gt;'''
Then, this capsule is transmitted via a secure [[w:Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] connection to the communication partner

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20305">[[File:Orders of magnitude (english annotations).png|thumb|The scale of everything. It begins with spacetime (Quantum Foam) and moves through small elementary particles, intermediate elementary particles, large elementary particles, components of composite particles, the components of atoms, electromagnetic waves, simple atoms, complex atoms, molecules, small viruses, large viruses, chromosomes, cells, hairs, body parts, species, groups of species,  small areas such as craters, large areas such as land masses, planets, orbits, stars, small planetary systems, intermediate planetary systems, large planetary systems, collections of stars, star clusters, galaxies, galaxy groups, galaxy clusters, galaxy superclusters, the cosmic web, Hubble volumes, and ends with the Universe.]]
An '''order of magnitude''' is an approximate measure of the number of digits that a number has in the commonly-used [[base-ten number system]]. It is equal to the [[logarithm]] (base 10) rounded to a [[Integer|whole number]]. For example, the order of magnitude of 1500 is 3, because 1500 = 1.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Difference (mathematics)|Differences]] in order of magnitude can be [[measured]] on a base-10 [[logarithmic scale]] in “[[Decade (log scale)|decades]]” (i.e., factors of ten).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/orders.html
 |title      = Orders of Magnitude
 |last       = Brians 
 |first      = Paus
 |accessdate = 9 May 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]].

==Definition==
Generally, the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order of Magnitude|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderofMagnitude.html|website=Wolfram MathWorld|accessdate=3 January 2017|quote=Physicists and engineers use the phrase "order of magnitude" to refer to the smallest power of ten needed to represent a quantity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To work out the order of magnitude of a number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number is first expressed in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;N =a\times10^b&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}\leq a&lt;\sqrt{10}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; represents the order of magnitude of the number. The order of magnitude can be any [[integer]]. The table below enumerates the order of magnitude of some numbers in light of this definition:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;!! Expression in &lt;math&gt;N =a\times10^b&lt;/math&gt;!! Order of magnitude &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0.2 || 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ||−1 
|-
| 1 || 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ||0 
|-
| 5 || 0.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ||1
|-
| 6 || 0.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ||1
|-
| 31 || 3.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 1
|-
| 32 || 0.32 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || 2
|-
| 999 || 0.999 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|| 3
|-
| 1000 || 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|| 3
|}
The [[geometric mean]] of &lt;math&gt;10^b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{b+1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{10}\times10^b&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that a value of exactly &lt;math&gt;10^b&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;a=1&lt;/math&gt;) represents a geometric "halfway point" within the range of possible values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

Some use a simpler definition where &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;a\leq 5&lt;/math&gt;, perhaps because the [[arithmetic mean]] of &lt;math&gt;10^b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{b+c}&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;5\times10^{b+c-1}&lt;/math&gt; for increasing &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. This definition has the effect of lowering the values of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; slightly:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;!! Expression in &lt;math&gt;N =a\times10^b&lt;/math&gt;!! Order of magnitude &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0.2 || 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ||−1 
|-
| 1 || 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ||0 
|-
| 5 || 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ||0
|-
| 6 || 0.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ||1
|-
| 31 || 3.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 1
|-
| 32 || 3.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || 1
|-
| 999 || 0.999 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|| 3
|-
| 1000 || 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|| 3
|}
Yet others restrict &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to values where &lt;math&gt;1\leq a&lt;10&lt;/math&gt;, making the order of magnitude of a number exactly equal to its exponent part in [[scientific notation]].

==Uses==
Orders of magnitude are used to make approximate comparisons.  If numbers differ by one order of magnitude, ''x'' is ''about'' ten times different in quantity than ''y''.  If values differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100. Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale: the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.

===Calculating the order of magnitude===
The order of magnitude of a number is, intuitively speaking, the number of powers of 10 contained in the number.  More precisely, the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the [[common logarithm]], usually as the [[integer]] part of the logarithm, obtained by [[truncation]].  For example, the number {{val|4000000}} has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602; its order of magnitude is 6.  When truncating, a number of this order of magnitude is between 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. In a similar example, with the phrase "He had a seven-figure income", the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one, so it is very easily determined without a calculator to 6. An order of magnitude is an approximate position on a [[logarithmic scale]].

===Order-of-magnitude estimate===
An order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable, whose precise value is unknown, is an estimate [[Rounding|rounded]] to the nearest power of ten.  For example, an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion (such as the [[human]] [[population]] of the [[Earth]]) is 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]. To round a number to its nearest order of magnitude, one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer.  Thus {{val|4000000}}, which has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602, has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude, because "nearest" implies rounding rather than truncation.  For a number written in scientific notation, this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten (about 3.162). For example, the nearest order of magnitude for {{val|1.7|e=8}} is 8, whereas the nearest order of magnitude for {{val|3.7|e=8}} is 9. An order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a [[zeroth order approximation]].

===Order of magnitude difference===
An order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10.  For example, the mass of the planet [[Saturn]] is 95 times that of [[Earth]], so Saturn is ''two orders of magnitude'' more massive than Earth.  Order-of-magnitude differences are called '''[[decade (log scale)|decades]]''' when measured on a [[logarithmic scale]].

==Non-decimal orders of magnitude==
{{see also|Logarithmic scale}}
Other orders of magnitude may be calculated using [[Radix|bases]] other than 10. The ancient Greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred (about 2.512) as bright as the nearest weaker [[Magnitude (astronomy)|level of brightness]], and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is (100&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; or a '''factor''' of 100 times brighter.

The different [[decimal]] [[numeral systems]] of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number, and have created names for the powers of this larger base. The table shows  what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base {{val|1000000}}. It can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example, because bi- means 2 and tri- means 3 (these make sense in the long scale only), and the suffix -illion tells that the base is {{val|1000000}}. But the number names billion, trillion themselves (here with [[Long and short scales|other meaning]] than in the first chapter) are not names of the ''orders of'' magnitudes, they are names of "magnitudes", that is the ''numbers'' {{val|1000000000000}} etc.

[[SI]] units in the table at right are used together with [[SI prefix]]es, which were devised with mainly base 1000 magnitudes in mind. [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|The IEC standard prefixes]] with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.

The ancient [[apparent magnitude]]s for the brightness of stars uses the base &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[5]{100} \approx 2.512&lt;/math&gt; and is reversed. The modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values.

===Extremely large numbers===
For extremely [[large numbers]], a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their [[Logarithm#Inverses of other exponential functions|double logarithm]] or [[super-logarithm]]. Rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very "round numbers", rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the "nearest" round number.

The double logarithm yields the categories:
: ..., 1.0023–1.023, 1.023–1.26, 1.26–10, 10–10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;{{val|1000|fmt=none}}&lt;/sup&gt;, ...
(the first two mentioned, and the extension to the left, may not be very useful, they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left).

The super-logarithm yields the categories:&lt;!-- 0-1 doesn't seem right --&gt;
:0–1, 1–10, 10–10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ... [[tetration|or]]

:0–&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;10, &lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;10–&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;10, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;10–&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;10, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;10–&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;10, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;10–&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;10, ...

The "midpoints" which determine which round number is nearer are in the first case:
:1.076, 2.071, 1453, {{val|4.20|e=31}}, {{val|1.69|e=316}},...
and, depending on the interpolation method, in the second case
:−0.301, 0.5, 3.162, {{val|1453|fmt=none}}, {{val|1|e=1453|fmt=none}}, &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow)^1 10^{1453}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow)^2 10^{1453}&lt;/math&gt;,... (see [[Large numbers#Standardized system of writing very large numbers|notation of extremely large numbers]])

For extremely small numbers (in the sense of close to zero) neither method is suitable directly, but the generalized order of magnitude of the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] can be considered.

Similar to the [[logarithmic scale#Graphic representation|logarithmic scale]] one can have a double logarithmic scale (example provided [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death|here]]) and super-logarithmic scale. The intervals above all have the same length on them, with the "midpoints" actually midway. More generally, a point midway between two points corresponds to the [[generalised f-mean]] with ''f''(''x'') the corresponding function log log ''x'' or slog ''x''. In the case of log log ''x'', this mean of two numbers (e.g. 2 and 16 giving 4) does not depend on the base of the logarithm, just like in the case of log ''x'' ([[geometric mean]], 2 and 8 giving 4), but unlike in the case of log log log ''x'' (4 and {{val|65536}} giving 16 if the base is 2, but not otherwise).

In mathematics, [[perturbation theory]] works typically by expanding unknown quantity in a [[power series]] in a small parameter.  However, in a '''perturbation problem beyond all orders''', [[flat function|all coefficients of the perturbation expansion vanish]] and the difference between the function and the constant function 0 cannot be detected by a power series.

A simple example is understood by an attempt at trying to expand &lt;math&gt;e^{-1/\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; in a [[Taylor series]] in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; about 0. All terms in a naïve Taylor expansion are identically zero. This is because the function &lt;math&gt;e^{-1/z}&lt;/math&gt; possesses an [[essential singularity]] at &lt;math&gt;z = 0&lt;/math&gt; in the complex &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-plane, and therefore the function is most appropriately modeled by a [[Laurent series]] -- a Taylor series has a zero [[radius of convergence]]. Thus, if a physical problem possesses a solution of this nature, possibly in addition to an analytic part that may be modeled by a power series, the perturbative analysis fails to recover the singular part. Terms of nature similar to &lt;math&gt;e^{-1/\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; are considered to be "beyond all orders" of the standard perturbative power series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">The '''Philosophy of mathematics education''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] area of study and research based on the intersection of the fields of [[mathematics education]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the latter being understood in an inclusive sense to include multidisciplinary theorizing about mathematics incorporating philosophical, sociological, anthropological, semiotic, historical, ethnomathematical, etc., perspectives. 

Some of the central questions addressed by this sub-field are:
*What is mathematics?, and what accounts have philosophers and other theorists given of it?
*How does mathematics relate to society? 
*What are the aims of teaching and learning mathematics?
*What fundamental assumptions underlie the learning and teaching mathematics? 
*How do philosophies of mathematics link with mathematics teaching and learning? 
*What is the status of mathematics education as knowledge field?

For further details see 'What is the philosophy of mathematics education?' by [[Paul Ernest]].

There is a dedicated ''[[Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal]]'' freely available on the web.

'''Plane wave expansion method''' (PWE) refers to a computational technique in [[electromagnetics]] to solve the [[Maxwell's equations]] by formulating an [[eigenvalue]] problem out of the equation. This method is popular among the [[photonic crystal]] community as a method of solving for the [[band structure]] (dispersion relation) of specific photonic crystal geometries. PWE is traceable to the analytical formulations, and is useful in calculating modal solutions of  Maxwell's equations over an inhomogeneous or periodic geometry. It is specifically tuned to solve problems in a time-harmonic forms, with [[Dispersion (optics)|non-dispersive]] media.

==Principles==
{{Dubious|date=August 2009}}

[[Plane wave]]s are solutions to the homogeneous [[Helmholtz equation]], and form a basis to represent fields in the periodic media. PWE as applied to photonic crystals as described is primarily sourced 
from Dr. Danner's tutorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleadj/planewave.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric or magnetic fields are expanded for each field component in terms of the [[Fourier series]] components along the reciprocal lattice vector. Similarly, the dielectric permittivity (which is periodic along reciprocal lattice vector for photonic crystals) is also expanded through Fourier series components. 

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\epsilon_r} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_m^{\epsilon_r} e^{-i \vec{G}.\vec{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
E(\omega,\vec{r}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_n^{E_y} e^{-i\vec{G}.\vec{r}} e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

with the Fourier series coefficients being the K numbers subscripted by m, n respectively, and the reciprocal lattice [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] given by &lt;math&gt;\vec{G}&lt;/math&gt;. In real modeling, the range of components considered will be reduced to just &lt;math&gt;\pm Nmax&lt;/math&gt; instead of the ideal, infinite wave.

Using these expansions in any of the curl-curl relations like,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\epsilon(\vec{r})} \nabla \times \nabla \times E(\vec{r},\omega) = \left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2 E(\vec{r},\omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

and simplifying under assumptions of a source free, linear, and non-dispersive region we obtain the [[eigen value]]  relations which can be solved.

==Example for 1D case==
For a y-polarized z-propagating electric wave, incident on a 1D-DBR periodic in only z-direction and homogeneous along x,y, with a lattice period of a. We then have the following simplified relations:

[[Image:Photonic Crystal 1D DBR aircore epsr12point25 DbyA0point8.png|thumb|right|Band structure of a 1D Photonic Crystal, DBR air-core calculated using plane wave expansion technique with 101 planewaves, for d/a=0.8, and dielectric contrast of 12.250.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\epsilon_r} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_m^{\epsilon_r} e^{-i \frac{2\pi m}{a}z}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
E(\omega,\vec{r}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} K_n^{E_y} e^{-i\frac{2\pi n}{a}z} e^{-i\vec{k}\vec{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The constitutive eigen equation we finally have to solve becomes,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_n{\left( \frac{2\pi n}{a} + k_z \right)\left( \frac{2\pi m}{a} + k_z \right) K_{m-n}^{\epsilon_r} K_{n}^{E_y}} = \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}K_{m}^{E_y}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be solved by building a matrix for the terms in the left hand side, and finding its eigen value and vectors. The eigen values correspond to the modal solutions, while the corresponding magnetic or electric fields themselves can be plotted using the Fourier expansions. The [[coefficients]] of the field harmonics are obtained from the specific eigen vectors.

The resulting band-structure obtained through the eigen modes of this structure are shown to the right.

==Advantages==
PWE expansions are rigorous solutions. PWE is extremely well suited to the modal solution problem. Large size problems can be solved using iterative techniques like [[Conjugate gradient method]].
For both generalized and normal eigen value problems, just a few band-index plots in the band-structure diagrams are required, usually lying on the [[brillouin zone edges]]. This corresponds to eigen modes solutions using iterative techniques, as opposed to diagonalization of the entire matrix.

The PWEM is highly efficient for calculating modes in periodic dielectric structures.  Being a Fourier space method, it suffers from the [[Gibbs phenomenon]] and slow convergence in some configuration when fast Fourier factorization is not used.  It is the method of choice for calculating the band structure of photonic crystals.  It is not easy to understand at first, but it is easy to implement.

==Disadvantages==
{{Dubious|date=August 2009}}
Sometimes spurious modes appear. Large problems scaled as ''O(n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)'', with the number of the plane waves (n) used in the problem. This is both time consuming and complex in memory requirements.

Alternatives include Order-N spectral method, and methods using [[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) which are simpler, and model transients.

If implemented correctly, spurious solutions are avoided.  It is less efficient when index contrast is high or when metals are incorporated.  It cannot be used for scattering analysis.

Being a Fourier-space method, Gibbs phenomenon affects the method's accuracy.  This is particularly problematic for devices with high dielectric contrast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5320">'''Projected dynamical systems''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory investigating the behaviour of [[dynamical system]]s where solutions are restricted to a constraint set. The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems and the dynamical world of [[ordinary differential equations]]. A '''projected dynamical system''' is given by the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] to the '''projected differential equation'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \Pi_K(x(t),-F(x(t)))
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' is our constraint set. Differential equations of this form are notable for having a discontinuous vector field.

== History of projected dynamical systems ==

Projected dynamical systems have evolved out of the desire to dynamically model the behaviour of nonstatic solutions in equilibrium problems over some parameter, typically take to be time. This dynamics differs from that of ordinary differential equations in that solutions are still restricted to whatever constraint set the underlying equilibrium problem was working on, e.g. nonnegativity of investments in [[finance|financial]] modeling, [[convex set|convex]] [[Polyhedron|polyhedral]] sets in [[operations research]], etc. One particularly important class of equilibrium problems which has aided in the rise of projected dynamical systems has been that of [[variational inequality|variational inequalities]].

The formalization of projected dynamical systems began in the 1990s. However, similar concepts can be found in the mathematical literature which predate this, especially in connection with variational inequalities and differential inclusions.

== Projections and Cones ==

Any solution to our projected differential equation must remain inside of our constraint set ''K'' for all time. This desired result is achieved through the use of projection operators and two particular important classes of [[convex cone]]s. Here we take ''K'' to be a [[closed set|closed]], [[convex set|convex]] subset of some [[Hilbert space]] ''X''.

The ''normal cone'' to the set ''K'' at the point ''x'' in ''K'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
N_K(x) = \{ p \in V | \langle p, x - x^* \rangle \geq 0, \forall x^* \in K \}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The ''[[tangent cone]]'' (or ''contingent cone'') to the set ''K'' at the point ''x'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
T_K(x) = \overline{\bigcup_{h&gt;0} \frac{1}{h} (K-x)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The ''projection operator'' (or ''closest element mapping'') of a point ''x'' in ''X'' to ''K'' is given by the point &lt;math&gt;P_K(x)&lt;/math&gt; in ''K'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\| x-P_K(x) \| \leq \| x-y \|
&lt;/math&gt;

for every ''y'' in ''K''.

The ''vector projection operator'' of a vector ''v'' in ''X'' at a point ''x'' in ''K'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\Pi_K(x,v)=\lim_{\delta \to 0^+} \frac{P_K(x+\delta v)-x}{\delta}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Projected Differential Equations ==

Given a closed, convex subset ''K'' of a Hilbert space ''X'' and a vector field ''-F'' which takes elements from ''K'' into ''X'', the projected differential equation associated with ''K'' and ''-F'' is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \Pi_K(x(t),-F(x(t))).
&lt;/math&gt;

On the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of ''K'' solutions behave as they would if the system were an unconstrained ordinary differential equation. However, since the vector field is discontinuous along the boundary of the set, projected differential equations belong to the class of discontinuous ordinary differential equations. While this makes much of ordinary differential equation theory inapplicable, it is known that when ''-F'' is a [[Lipschitz]] continuous vector field, a unique [[absolutely continuous]] solution exists through each initial point ''x(0)=x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''K'' on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

This differential equation can be alternately characterized by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = P_{T_K(x(t))}(-F(x(t)))
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = -F(x(t))-P_{N_K(x(t))}(-F(x(t))).
&lt;/math&gt;

The convention of denoting the vector field ''-F'' with a negative sign arises from a particular connection projected dynamical systems shares with variational inequalities. The convention in the literature is to refer to the vector field as positive in the variational inequality, and negative in the corresponding projected dynamical system.

A [[Quasiperiodicity|quasiperiodic]] [[crystal]], or '''quasicrystal''', is a [[structure]] that is [[Order and disorder (physics)|ordered]] but not [[Bravais lattice|periodic]]. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks [[translational symmetry]]. While crystals, according to the classical [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], can possess only two, three, four, and six-fold [[rotational symmetries]], the [[Bragg diffraction]] pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other [[symmetry]] orders, for instance five-fold.

[[Aperiodic tiling]]s were discovered by mathematicians in the early 1960s, and, some twenty years later, they were found to apply to the study of quasicrystals. The discovery of these aperiodic forms in nature has produced a [[paradigm shift]] in the fields of [[crystallography]]. Quasicrystals had been investigated and observed earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Steurer W.|journal= Z. Kristallogr. |volume=219 |year=2004|pages= 391–446|doi=10.1524/zkri.219.7.391.35643|title=Twenty years of structure research on quasicrystals. Part I. Pentagonal, octagonal, decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals|issue=7–2004|bibcode = 2004ZK....219..391S }}&lt;/ref&gt; but, until the 1980s, they were disregarded in favor of the prevailing views about the atomic structure of matter. In 2009, after a dedicated search, a mineralogical finding, [[icosahedrite]], offered evidence for the existence of natural quasicrystals.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

Roughly, an ordering is non-periodic if it lacks [[translational symmetry]], which means that a shifted copy will never match exactly with its original. The more precise mathematical definition is that there is never translational symmetry in more than ''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1 [[linear independence|linearly independent]] directions, where ''n'' is the dimension of the space filled, e.g., the three-dimensional tiling displayed in a quasicrystal may have translational symmetry in two directions. Symmetrical diffraction patterns result from the existence of an indefinitely large number of elements with a regular spacing, a property loosely described as [[long-range order]]. Experimentally, the aperiodicity is revealed in the unusual symmetry of the diffraction pattern, that is, symmetry of orders other than two, three, four, or six. 
In 1982 [[materials science|materials scientist]] [[Dan Shechtman]] observed that certain [[aluminium]]-[[manganese]] alloys produced the unusual diffractograms which today are seen as revelatory of quasicrystal structures. Due to fear of the scientific community's reaction, it took him two years to publish the results&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=s/&gt; for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt;

==History==

[[File:Penrose Tiling (Rhombi).svg|thumb|A [[Penrose tiling]]]]
In 1961, [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] asked whether determining if a set of tiles admits a tiling of the plane is an [[algorithmically unsolvable problem]] or not. He conjectured that it is solvable, relying on the hypothesis that every set of tiles that can tile the plane can do it ''periodically'' (hence, it would suffice to try to tile bigger and bigger patterns until obtaining one that tiles periodically). Nevertheless, two years later, his student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] constructed a set of some 20,000 square tiles (now called [[Wang tiles]]) that can tile the plane but not in a periodic fashion. As further aperiodic sets of tiles were discovered, sets with fewer and fewer shapes were found. In 1976 [[Roger Penrose]] discovered a set of just two tiles, now referred to as [[Penrose tiling|Penrose tiles]], that produced only non-periodic tilings of the plane. These tilings displayed instances of fivefold symmetry. One year later [[Alan Lindsay Mackay|Alan Mackay]] showed experimentally that the diffraction pattern from the Penrose tiling had a two-dimensional [[Fourier transform]] consisting of sharp 'delta' peaks arranged in a fivefold symmetric pattern.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; Around the same time [[Robert Ammann]] created a set of aperiodic tiles that produced eightfold symmetry.

Mathematically, quasicrystals have been shown to be derivable from a general method that treats them as projections of a higher-dimensional lattice. Just as circles, ellipses, and hyperbolic curves in the plane can be obtained as [[conic section|section]]s from a three-dimensional double cone, so too various (aperiodic or periodic) arrangements in two and three dimensions can be obtained from postulated hyperlattices with four or more dimensions. Icosahedral quasicrystals in three dimensions were projected from a six-dimensional hypercubic lattice by [[Peter Kramer (physicist)|Peter Kramer]] and Roberto Neri in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108767384001203|title=On periodic and non-periodic space fillings of E&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; obtained by projection|year=1984|last1=Kramer|first1=P.|last2=Neri|first2=R.|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica A]] |volume=40|pages=580–587|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tiling is formed by two tiles with [[rhombohedral]] shape.

Shechtman first observed ten-fold [[electron diffraction]] patterns in 1982, as described in his notebook.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20111007225727/http://www.quasi.iastate.edu/discovery.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The observation was made during a routine investigation, by electron microscopy, of a rapidly cooled [[alloy of aluminium and manganese]] prepared at the US [[National Bureau of Standards]] (later NIST).

In the summer of the same year Shechtman visited Ilan Blech and related his observation to him. Blech responded that such diffractions had been seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=C. Y.|journal=J. Cryst. Growth|year=1979|volume=47|pages=274–282|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(79)90252-5|title=Crystallography of decahedral and icosahedral particles|issue=2|bibcode = 1979JCrGr..47..274Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=C. Y.|last2=Yacaman|first2=M. J.|last3=Heinemann|first3=K.|journal=[[J. Cryst.

Shechtman quoted Cahn as saying: "Danny, this material is telling us something and I challenge you to find out what it is".

The observation of the ten-fold diffraction pattern lay unexplained for two years until the spring of 1984, when Blech asked Shechtman to show him his results again. A quick study of Shechtman's results showed that the common explanation for a ten-fold symmetrical diffraction pattern, the existence of twins, was ruled out by his experiments. Since periodicity and twins were ruled out, Blech, unaware of the two-dimensional tiling work, was looking for another possibility: a completely new structure containing cells connected to each other by defined angles and distances but without translational periodicity. Blech decided to use a computer simulation to calculate the diffraction intensity from a cluster of such a material without long-range translational order but still not random. He termed this new structure multiple [[polyhedral symmetry|polyhedral]].&lt;!-- may be Polyhedral group? --&gt;

The idea of a new structure was the necessary paradigm shift to break the impasse. The “Eureka moment” came when the computer simulation showed sharp ten-fold diffraction patterns, similar to the observed ones, emanating from the three-dimensional structure devoid of periodicity. The multiple polyhedral structure was termed later by many researchers as icosahedral glass but in effect it embraces ''any arrangement of polyhedra connected with definite angles and distances'' (this general definition includes tiling, for example).

Shechtman accepted Blech's discovery of a new type of material and it gave him the courage to publish his experimental observation.  Shechtman and Blech jointly wrote a paper entitled "The Microstructure of Rapidly Solidified Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mn" &lt;ref name="first paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shechtman|first=Dan|author2=I. A. Blech |title=The Microstructure of Rapidly Solidified Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Mn|journal=[[Met. Trans.

The JAP editor promptly rejected the paper as being better fit for a metallurgical readership. As a result, the same paper was re-submitted for publication to the ''[[Metallurgical Transactions A]]'', where it was accepted. Although not noted in the body of the published text, the published paper was slightly revised prior to publication.

Meanwhile, on seeing the draft of the Shechtman–Blech paper in the summer of 1984, John Cahn suggested that Shechtman's experimental results merit a fast publication in a more appropriate scientific journal. Shechtman agreed and, in hindsight, called this fast publication "a winning move”. This paper, published in the ''Physical Review Letters'' (PRL),&lt;ref name="s" /&gt; repeated Shechtman's observation and used the same illustrations as the original Shechtman–Blech paper in the ''Metallurgical Transactions A''.  The PRL paper,  the first to appear in print, caused considerable excitement in the scientific community.

Next year Ishimasa ''et al.'' reported twelvefold symmetry in Ni-Cr particles.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; Soon, eightfold diffraction patterns were recorded in V-Ni-Si and Cr-Ni-Si alloys.&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; Over the years, hundreds of quasicrystals with various compositions and different symmetries have been discovered. The first quasicrystalline materials were thermodynamically unstable—when heated, they formed regular crystals. However, in 1987, the first of many stable quasicrystals were discovered, making it possible to produce large samples for study and opening the door to potential applications. In 2009, following a 10-year systematic search, scientists reported the first natural quasicrystal, a mineral found in the [[Khatyrka]] River in eastern [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; This natural quasicrystal exhibits high crystalline quality, equalling the best artificial examples.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; The natural quasicrystal phase, with a composition of Al&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, was named [[icosahedrite]] and it was approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] in 2010. Furthermore, analysis indicates it may be meteoritic in origin, possibly delivered from a carbonaceous chondrite asteroid.&lt;ref name=Bindi2011&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Zn-Mg-HoDiffraction.JPG|thumb|[[Electron crystallography|Electron diffraction pattern]] of an icosahedral [[Holmium–magnesium–zinc quasicrystal|Ho–Mg–Zn quasicrystal]]]]
In 1972 de Wolf and van Aalst&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; reported that the diffraction pattern produced by a crystal of [[sodium carbonate]] cannot be labeled with three indices but needed one more, which implied that the underlying structure had four dimensions in [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]]. Other puzzling cases have been reported,&lt;ref name="Kleinert"/&gt; but until the concept of quasicrystal came to be established, they were explained away or denied.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt;&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; However, at the end of the 1980s the idea became acceptable, and in 1992 the [[International Union of Crystallography]] altered its definition of a crystal, broadening it as a result of Shechtman’s findings, reducing it to the ability to produce a clear-cut diffraction pattern and acknowledging the possibility of the ordering to be either periodic or aperiodic.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The concept of ''aperiodic crystal'' was coined by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in another context with a somewhat different meaning. In his popular book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is life?]]'' in 1944, Schrödinger sought to explain how hereditary information is stored: molecules were deemed too small, amorphous solids were plainly chaotic, so it had to be a kind of crystal; as a periodic structure could encode very little information, it had to be aperiodic. [[DNA]] was later discovered, and, although not crystalline, it possesses properties predicted by Schrödinger—it is a regular but aperiodic molecule.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the symmetries compatible with translations are defined as "crystallographic", leaving room for other "non-crystallographic" symmetries. Therefore, aperiodic or [[quasiperiodic function|quasiperiodic]] structures can be divided into two main classes: those with crystallographic point-group symmetry, to which the incommensurately modulated structures and composite structures belong, and those with non-crystallographic point-group symmetry, to which quasicrystal structures belong.

Originally, the new form of matter was dubbed "Shechtmanite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Impossible' Form of Matter Takes Spotlight In Study of Solids|publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/05/science/impossible-form-of-matter-takes-spotlight-in-study-of-solids.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne|date=1989-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "quasicrystal" was first used in print by [[Paul Steinhardt|Steinhardt]] and Levine&lt;ref name=r9/&gt; shortly after Shechtman's paper was published.
The adjective ''quasicrystalline'' had already been in use, but now it came to be applied to any pattern with unusual symmetry.&lt;ref name="adj" group="notes"/&gt; 'Quasiperiodical' structures were claimed to be observed in some decorative tilings devised by medieval Islamic architects.&lt;ref name=r11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lu/&gt; For example, [[Girih tiles]] in a medieval Islamic mosque in [[Isfahan]], Iran, are arranged in a two-dimensional quasicrystalline pattern.&lt;ref name=r12/&gt; These claims have, however, been under some debate.&lt;ref name="Makovicky"/&gt;

Shechtman was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2011 for his work on quasicrystals. "His discovery of quasicrystals revealed a new principle for packing of atoms and molecules," stated the Nobel Committee and pointed that "this led to a paradigm shift within chemistry." &lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-05/technion-s-shechtman-wins-chemistry-nobel-for-discovery-of-quasicrystals.html|title=Technion’s Shechtman Wins Nobel in Chemistry for Quasicrystals Discovery|author=Andrea Gerlin|date= 5 October 2011|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15181187|title=Nobel win for crystal discovery|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2011-10-05|date=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways to mathematically define quasicrystalline patterns. One definition, the "cut and project" construction, is based on the work of [[Harald Bohr]] (mathematician brother of [[Niels Bohr]]). The concept of an almost periodic function (also called a quasiperiodic function) was studied by Bohr, including work of Bohl and Escanglon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02395468|title=Zur Theorie fastperiodischer Funktionen I|year=1925|last1=Bohr|first1=H.|journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=45|page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He introduced the notion of a superspace. Bohr showed that quasiperiodic functions arise as restrictions of high-dimensional periodic functions to an irrational slice (an intersection with one or more [[hyperplane]]s), and discussed their Fourier point spectrum. These functions are not exactly periodic, but they are arbitrarily close in some sense, as well as being a projection of an exactly periodic function.

In order that the quasicrystal itself be aperiodic, this slice must avoid any [[lattice plane]] of the higher-dimensional lattice. [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] showed that [[Penrose tilings]] can be viewed as two-dimensional slices of five-dimensional [[hypercubic]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Algebraic theory of Penrose's non-periodic tilings of the plane|year=1981|last1=de Bruijn|first1=N.|journal=Nederl. Akad. Wetensch. Proc|volume=A84|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, the [[Fourier transform]] of such a quasicrystal is nonzero only at a dense set of points [[linear span|spanned]] by integer multiples of a finite set of [[basis vectors]] (the projections of the primitive [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors of the higher-dimensional lattice).&lt;ref name=Suck04/&gt;
The intuitive considerations obtained from simple model aperiodic tilings are formally expressed in the concepts of [[Meyer set|Meyer]] and [[Delone set]]s. The mathematical counterpart of physical diffraction is the [[Fourier transform]] and the qualitative description of a diffraction picture as 'clear cut' or 'sharp' means that singularities are present in the Fourier [[spectrum]]. There are different methods to construct model quasicrystals. These are the same methods that produce aperiodic tilings with the additional constraint for the diffractive property. Thus, for a [[substitution tiling]] the [[eigenvalues]] of the substitution matrix should be [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number|Pisot numbers]]. The aperiodic structures obtained by the cut-and-project method are made diffractive by choosing a suitable orientation for the construction; this is a geometric approach that has also a great appeal for physicists.

Classical theory of crystals reduces crystals to point lattices where each point is the center of mass of one of the identical units of the crystal. The structure of crystals can be analyzed by defining an associated [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Quasicrystals, on the other hand, are composed of more than one type of unit, so, instead of lattices, quasilattices must be used. Instead of groups, [[groupoids]], the mathematical generalization of groups in [[category theory]], is the appropriate tool for studying quasicrystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paterson|first=Alan L. T.|title=Groupoids, inverse semigroups, and their operator algebras|year=1999|publisher=Springer|page=164|isbn=978-0-8176-4051-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using mathematics for construction and analysis of quasicrystal structures is a difficult task for most experimentalists. Computer modeling, based on the existing theories of quasicrystals, however, greatly facilitated this task. Advanced programs have been developed&lt;ref name="comp"/&gt; allowing one to construct, visualize and analyze quasicrystal structures and their diffraction patterns.

Interacting [[Spin (physics)|spins]] were also analyzed in quasicrystals: [[AKLT Model]] and [[8-vertex model]] were solved in quasicrystals analytically.&lt;ref name=vertex&gt;Korepin, V.E.

Study of quasicrystals may shed light on the most basic notions related to [[quantum critical point]] observed in [[heavy fermion]] metals. Experimental measurements on the gold-aluminium-ytterbium quasicrystal have revealed a [[quantum critical point]] defining the divergence of the [[magnetic susceptibility]] as temperature tends to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deguchi|first=Kazuhiko|last2=Matsukawa|first2=Shuya|last3=Sato|first3=Noriaki K.|last4=Hattori|first4=Taisuke|last5=Ishida|first5=Kenji|last6=Takakura|first6=Hiroyuki|last7=Ishimasa|first7=Tsutomu|title=Quantum critical state in a magnetic quasicrystal|journal=Nature Materials|doi=10.1038/nmat3432|year=2012|pmid=23042414|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1013–6|arxiv=1210.3160|bibcode=2012NatMa..11.1013D}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the electronic system of some quasicrystals is located at [[quantum critical point]] without tuning, while quasicrystals exhibit the typical [[scaling behaviour]] of their [[thermodynamic properties]] and belong to the famous family of [[heavy-fermion]] metals.

Since the original discovery by [[Dan Shechtman]], hundreds of quasicrystals have been reported and confirmed. Undoubtedly, the quasicrystals are no longer a unique form of solid; they exist
universally in many metallic alloys and some polymers. Quasicrystals are found most often in aluminium alloys (Al-Li-Cu, Al-Mn-Si, Al-Ni-Co, Al-Pd-Mn, Al-Cu-Fe, Al-Cu-V, etc.), but numerous other compositions are also known (Cd-Yb, Ti-Zr-Ni, Zn-Mg-Ho, Zn-Mg-Sc, In-Ag-Yb, Pd-U-Si, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/69/2/R03|title=The role of aperiodic order in science and technology|year=2006|last1=MacIá|first1=Enrique|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=69|pages=397–441|bibcode = 2006RPPh...69..397M|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of quasicrystals are known.&lt;ref name="comp"/&gt; The first type, polygonal (dihedral) quasicrystals, have an axis of 8, 10, or 12-fold local symmetry (octagonal, decagonal, or dodecagonal quasicrystals, respectively). They are periodic along this axis and quasiperiodic in planes normal to it. The second type, icosahedral quasicrystals, are aperiodic in all directions.

Quasicrystals fall into three groups of different thermal stability:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/013008|pmc=5099795|title=Icosahedral clusters, icosaheral order and stability of quasicrystals—a view of metallurgy|year=2008|last1=Tsai|first1=An Pang|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=9|issue=1|page=013008|bibcode = 2008STAdM...9a3008T|pmid=27877926}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stable quasicrystals grown by slow cooling or [[casting (metalworking)|casting]] with subsequent [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]],
*Metastable quasicrystals prepared by [[melt spinning]], and
*Metastable quasicrystals formed by the [[crystallization]] of the [[amorphous]] phase.

Except for the Al–Li–Cu system, all the stable quasicrystals are almost free of defects and disorder, as evidenced by [[X-ray diffraction|X-ray]] and [[electron diffraction]] revealing peak widths as sharp as those of perfect crystals such as Si. Diffraction patterns exhibit fivefold, threefold, and twofold symmetries, and reflections are arranged quasiperiodically in three dimensions.

The origin of the stabilization mechanism is different for the stable and metastable quasicrystals. Nevertheless, there is a common feature observed in most quasicrystal-forming liquid alloys or their undercooled liquids: a local icosahedral order. The icosahedral order is in equilibrium in the ''liquid state'' for the stable quasicrystals, whereas the icosahedral order prevails in the ''undercooled liquid state'' for the metastable quasicrystals.

A nanoscale icosahedral phase was formed in Zr-, Cu- and Hf-based bulk metallic glasses alloyed with noble metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.matsci.38.060407.130318| title = Formation and Properties of Quasicrystals| journal = Annual Review of Materials Research| volume = 38| pages = 403–423| year = 2008| last1 = Louzguine-Luzgin | first1 = D. V. | last2 = Inoue | first2 = A.|bibcode = 2008AnRMS..38..403L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most quasicrystals have ceramic-like properties including high thermal and electrical resistance, hardness and brittleness, resistance to corrosion, and non-stick
properties.&lt;ref name=mrs&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs.2011.190|title=Sputtering technique forms versatile quasicrystalline coatings|journal=MRS Bulletin|volume=36|issue=8|pages=581|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many metallic quasicrystalline substances are impractical for most applications due to their [[Thermal stability|thermal instability]]; the Al-Cu-Fe ternary system and the Al-Cu-Fe-Cr and Al-Co-Fe-Cr quaternary systems, thermally stable up to 700&amp;nbsp;°C, are notable exceptions.

===Applications===
Quasicrystalline substances have potential applications in several forms.

Metallic quasicrystalline coatings can be applied by [[plasma-coating]] or [[magnetron sputtering]]. A problem that must be resolved is the tendency for cracking due to the materials' extreme brittleness.&lt;ref name=mrs/&gt; The cracking could be suppressed by reducing sample dimensions or coating thickness.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kuczera|first2=Pawel|last3=Sologubenko|first3=Alla|last4=Sumigawa|first4=Takashi|last5=Kitamura|first5=Takayuki|last6=Steurer|first6=Walter|last7=Spolenak|first7=Ralph|year=2016|title=Superior room-temperature ductility of typically brittle quasicrystals at small sizes|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|pages=12261|doi=10.1038/ncomms12261|pmc=4990631|pmid=27515779|last1=Zou|first1=Yu|bibcode=2016NatCo...712261Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies show typically brittle quasicrystals can exhibit remarkable ductility of over 50% strains at room temperature and sub-micrometer scales (&lt;500&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="nature.com" /&gt;

An application was the use of low-friction Al-Cu-Fe-Cr quasicrystals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.5075/epfl-thesis-2707|author=Fikar, Jan |year=2003|title=Al-Cu-Fe quasicrystalline coatings and composites studied by mechanical spectroscopy|publisher=École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne EPFL, Thesis n° 2707 (2002)}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a coating for [[frying pan]]s. Food did not stick to it as much as to [[stainless steel]] making the pan moderately [[non-stick]] and easy to clean; heat transfer and durability were better than [[PTFE]] non-stick cookware and the pan was free from [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA); the surface was very hard, claimed to be ten times harder than stainless steel, and not harmed by metal utensils or cleaning in a [[dishwasher]]; and the pan could withstand temperatures of {{Convert|1000|C|sigfig=2}} without harm. However, cooking with a lot of salt would etch the quasicrystalline coating used, and the pans were eventually withdrawn from production. Shechtman had one of these pans.&lt;ref name=mitrev&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/425729/the-quasicrystal-laureate/ |title=The Quasicrystal Laureate |newspaper=MIT Technology Review|date=12 October 2011  |author=Kalman, Matthew |accessdate= 12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel citation said that quasicrystals, while brittle, could reinforce steel "like armor". When Shechtman was asked about potential applications of quasicrystals he said that a precipitation-hardened stainless steel is produced that is strengthened by small quasicrystalline particles. It does not corrode and is extremely strong, suitable for razor blades and surgery instruments. The small quasicrystalline particles impede the motion of dislocation in the material.&lt;ref name=mitrev/&gt;

Quasicrystals were also being used to develop heat insulation, [[LED]]s, diesel engines, and new materials that convert heat to electricity. Shechtman suggested new applications taking advantage of the low coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials, for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong, hard-wearing, low-friction plastic gears. The low heat conductivity of some quasicrystals makes them good for heat insulating coatings.&lt;ref name=mitrev/&gt;

Other potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion, broad-wavelength reflectors, and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility, low friction and corrosion resistance are required. Magnetron sputtering can be readily applied to other stable quasicrystalline alloys such as Al-Pd-Mn.&lt;ref name=mrs/&gt;

While saying that the discovery of icosahedrite, the first quasicrystal found in nature, was important, Shechtman saw no practical applications.

:&lt;math&gt;x_ny_1 + \cdots + x_1y_n
\le x_{\sigma (1)}y_1 + \cdots + x_{\sigma (n)}y_n
\le x_1y_1 + \cdots + x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;

for every choice of [[real number]]s

:&lt;math&gt;x_1\le\cdots\le x_n\quad\text{and}\quad y_1\le\cdots\le y_n&lt;/math&gt;

and every [[permutation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\sigma(1)},\dots,x_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;

of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. If the numbers are different, meaning that

:&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;\cdots&lt;x_n\quad\text{and}\quad y_1&lt;\cdots&lt;y_n,&lt;/math&gt;

then the lower bound is attained only for the permutation which reverses the order, i.e. σ(''i'')&amp;nbsp;= ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;= 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', and the upper bound is attained only for the identity, i.e. σ(''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;= 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Note that the rearrangement inequality makes no assumptions on the signs of the real numbers.

==Applications==

Many important inequalities can be proved by the rearrangement inequality, such as the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means|arithmetic mean – geometric mean inequality]], the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], and [[Chebyshev's sum inequality]].

==Proof==

The lower bound follows by applying the upper bound to

:&lt;math&gt;-x_n\le\cdots\le-x_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it suffices to prove the upper bound. Since there are only finitely many permutations, there exists at least one for which

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\sigma (1)}y_1 + \cdots + x_{\sigma (n)}y_n&lt;/math&gt;

is maximal. In case there are several permutations with this property, let σ denote one with the highest number of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]].

We will now [[reductio ad absurdum|prove by contradiction]], that σ has to be the identity (then we are done). Assume that σ is {{em|not}} the identity. Then there exists a ''j'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1} such that σ(''j'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''j'' and σ(''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' for all ''i'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}. Hence σ(''j'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''j'' and there exists a ''k'' in {''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} with σ(''k'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''j''. Now

:&lt;math&gt;j&lt;k\Rightarrow y_j\le y_k
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
j&lt;\sigma(j)\Rightarrow x_j\le x_{\sigma(j)}.\quad(1)&lt;/math&gt;
 
Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;0\le(x_{\sigma(j)}-x_j)(y_k-y_j). \quad(2)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding this product and rearranging gives

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\sigma(j)}y_j+x_jy_k\le x_jy_j+x_{\sigma(j)}y_k\,, \quad(3)&lt;/math&gt;

hence the permutation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau(i):=\begin{cases}i&amp;\text{for }i\in\{1,\ldots,j\},\\
\sigma(j)&amp;\text{for }i=k,\\
\sigma(i)&amp;\text{for }i\in\{j+1,\ldots,n\}\setminus\{k\},\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which arises from σ by exchanging the values σ(''j'') and σ(''k''), has at least one additional fixed point compared to σ, namely at ''j'', and also attains the maximum. This contradicts the choice of σ.

If

:&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;\cdots&lt;x_n\quad\text{and}\quad y_1&lt;\cdots&lt;y_n,&lt;/math&gt;

then we have strict inequalities at (1), (2), and (3), hence the maximum can only be attained by the identity, any other permutation σ cannot be optimal.

==Proof by induction==
Observe first that 
:&lt;math&gt; x_1 &gt; x_2 \quad\text{and}\quad y_1 &gt; y_2 &lt;/math&gt;
implies 
:&lt;math&gt; (x_1-x_2)(y_1-y_2) &gt; 0 \quad \text{or}\quad x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 &gt; x_2y_1 + x_1y_2,&lt;/math&gt;
hence the result is true if ''n'' = 2. 
Assume it is true at rank ''n-1'', and let 
:&lt;math&gt;x_1&gt;\cdots&gt;x_n,\quad \text{and}\quad y_1&gt;\cdots&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt;.
Choose a permutation σ for which the arrangement gives rise a maximal result.

If σ(''n'') were different from ''n'', say σ(''n'') = ''k'', 
there would exist ''j'' &lt; ''n'' such that σ(''j'') = ''n''. 
But  
:&lt;math&gt; x_n &gt; x_k \quad\text{and}\quad y_n &gt; y_j, \quad\text{hence}\quad  x_ny_n + x_ky_j &gt; x_ky_n + x_ny_j &lt;/math&gt;
by what has just been proved.
Consequently, it would follow that the permutation τ coinciding with σ, except at ''j'' and ''n'', where 
τ(''j'') = ''k'' and τ(''n'') = ''n'', gives rise a better result. This contradicts the choice of σ.
Hence σ(''n'') = ''n'', and from the induction hypothesis, σ(''i'') = ''i'' for every ''i'' &lt; ''n''.

The same proof holds if one replace strict inequalities by non strict ones.

==Generalization==
A Generalization of the Rearrangement inequality states that for all [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt; x_1\le\cdots\le x_n &lt;/math&gt; and any choice of functions &lt;math&gt; f_i: [x_1,x_n]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, i=1,2,...,n &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; f'_1(x) \le f'_2(x) \le ...\le f'_n(x) \quad \forall x\in [x_1,x_n] &lt;/math&gt;

the inequality

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_{n-i+1}) \le \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_{\sigma(i)}) \le \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i) &lt;/math&gt;

holds for every [[permutation]] &lt;math&gt; x_{\sigma(1)},\dots,x_{\sigma(n)} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x_1,\dots,x_n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2017 | last=Holstermann | first=Jan | title=A Generalization of the Rearrangement Inequality | periodical=Mathematical Reflections | issue = 5 (2017) | url=https://www.awesomemath.org/wp-pdf-files/math-reflections/mr-2017-05/rearrangement_inequality.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], and in [[algebra]], the '''reduced product''' is a construction that generalizes both [[direct product]] and [[ultraproduct]].

Let {''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''} be a family of [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] of the same [[signature (logic)|signature]] σ indexed by a set ''I'', and let ''U'' be a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] on ''I''. The domain of the reduced product is the [[quotient set|quotient]] of the Cartesian product

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} S_i &lt;/math&gt;

by a certain equivalence relation&amp;nbsp;~: two elements (''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') of the Cartesian product are equivalent if

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ i \in I: a_i = b_i \right\}\in U &lt;/math&gt;

If ''U'' only contains ''I'' as an element, the equivalence relation is trivial, and the reduced product is just the original Cartesian product.  If ''U'' is an [[ultrafilter]], the reduced product is an ultraproduct.

Operations from σ are interpreted on the reduced product by applying the operation pointwise. Relations are interpreted by

:&lt;math&gt;R((a^1_i)/{\sim},\dots,(a^n_i)/{\sim}) \iff \{i\in I\mid R^{S_i}(a^1_i,\dots,a^n_i)\}\in U. &lt;/math&gt;

For example, if each structure is a [[vector space]], then the reduced product is a vector space with addition defined as (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and multiplication by a scalar ''c'' as (''ca'')&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''c&amp;nbsp;a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In [[mathematics]], a '''period''' is a [[number]] that can be expressed as an [[integral]] of an [[algebraic function]] over an algebraic domain. Sums and products of periods [[Closure (mathematics)|remain]] periods, so the periods form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].

{{harvs|txt|first=Maxim|last= Kontsevich|authorlink=Maxim Kontsevich|first2=Don |last2=Zagier|author2-link=Don Zagier|year=2001}} gave a survey of periods and introduced some conjectures about them.

==Definition==
A real number is called a period if it is the difference of volumes of regions of Euclidean space given by [[polynomial]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] with rational coefficients. More generally a complex number is called a period if its real and imaginary parts are periods. 

The values of [[absolutely convergent]] integrals of [[rational function]]s with algebraic coefficients, over domains in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; given by [[polynomial]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] with algebraic coefficients are also periods, since integrals and irrational algebraic numbers  are expressible in terms of areas of suitable domains.

==Examples==

Besides the algebraic numbers, the following numbers are known to be periods:
* The [[natural logarithm]] of any algebraic number
* [[π]]
* [[Elliptic integral]]s with rational arguments
* All [[zeta constant]]s (the [[Riemann zeta function]] of an integer) and [[multiple zeta value]]s
* Special values of [[hypergeometric function]]s at algebraic arguments
* [[gamma function|Γ]](''p''/''q'')&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; for natural numbers ''p'' and ''q''.

An example of real number that is not a period is given by [[Chaitin's constant Ω]]. Currently there are no natural examples of [[computable number]]s that have been proved not to be periods, though it is easy to construct artificial examples using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. Plausible candidates for numbers that are not periods include ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'', 1/π, and [[Euler–Mascheroni constant γ]].

==Purpose of the classification==

The periods are intended to bridge the gap between the [[algebraic number]]s and the [[transcendental numbers]]. The class of algebraic numbers is too narrow to include many common [[mathematical constant]]s, while the set of transcendental numbers is not [[countable]], and its members are not generally [[computable number|computable]]. The set of all periods is countable, and all periods are computable&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Katrin |last=Tent|first2=Martin |last2=Ziegler|title=Computable functions of reals|journal=Münster Journal of Mathematics|volume=3|year=2010|pages=43–66|url=http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/mjm/vol_3/mjm_vol_3_04.pdf|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in particular [[definable number|definable]].

==Conjectures==

Many of the constants known to be periods are also given by integrals of [[transcendental function]]s. Kontsevich and Zagier note that there "seems to be no universal rule explaining why certain infinite sums or integrals of transcendental functions are periods".

Kontsevich and Zagier conjectured that, if a period is given by two different integrals, then each integral can be transformed into the other using only the linearity of integrals, [[change of variables|changes of variables]], and the [[fundamental theorem of calculus|Newton&amp;ndash;Leibniz formula]]

: &lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a) &lt;/math&gt;

(or, more generally, the [[Stokes' theorem|Stokes formula]]).

A useful property of algebraic numbers is that equality between two algebraic expressions can be determined algorithmically. And the conjecture of Kontsevich and Zagier would imply that equality of periods is also decidable: [[Computable_number#Non-computability_of_the_ordering| inequality of computable reals]] is known [[recursively enumerable]]; and conversely if two integrals agree, then an algorithm could confirm so by trying all possible ways to transform one of them into the other one.

It is not expected that [[Euler's number]] ''e'' and [[Euler&amp;ndash;Mascheroni constant]] γ are periods. The periods can be extended to ''exponential periods'' by permitting the product of an algebraic function and the [[exponential function]] of an algebraic function as an integrand. This extension includes all algebraic powers of ''e'', the gamma function of rational arguments, and values of [[Bessel function]]s. If, further, Euler's constant is added as a new period, then according to Kontsevich and Zagier "all classical constants are periods in the appropriate sense".

In [[mathematics]], a '''stunted projective space''' is a construction on a [[projective space]] of importance in [[homotopy theory]], introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=James|year=1959|authorlink=Ioan James}}. Part of a conventional projective space is collapsed down to a point.

More concretely, in a [[real projective space]], [[complex projective space]] or [[quaternionic projective space]]

:''KP''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,

where ''K'' stands for the [[real number]]s, [[complex number]]s or [[quaternion]]s, one can find (in many ways) copies of

:''KP''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;,

where ''m'' &lt; ''n''. The corresponding stunted projective space is then

:''KP''&lt;sup&gt;''n,m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''KP''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''KP''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;,

where the notation implies that the ''KP''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; has been identified to a point. This makes a [[topological space]] that is no longer a [[manifold]]. The importance of this construction was realised when it was shown that real stunted projective spaces arose as [[Spanier–Whitehead dual]]s of spaces of [[Ioan James]], so-called ''quasi-projective spaces'', constructed from [[Stiefel manifold]]s. Their properties were therefore linked to the construction of [[frame field]]s on [[sphere]]s.

In this way the [[vector fields on spheres]] question was reduced to a question on stunted projective spaces: for '''R'''''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n,m''&lt;/sup&gt;, is there a [[degree of a mapping|degree one]] mapping on the 'next cell up' (of the first dimension not collapsed in the 'stunting') that extends to the whole space? [[Frank Adams]] showed that this could not happen, completing the proof.

In later developments spaces ''KP''&lt;sup&gt;∞,''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and stunted [[lens space]]s have also been used.

In [[mathematics]], the '''symbolic method''' in [[invariant theory]] is an [[algorithm]] developed by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Arthur Cayley|last=Cayley|year=1846}}, {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold|first=Siegfried Heinrich |last=Aronhold|year=1858}},  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Alfred  Clebsch|last=Clebsch|first=Alfred|year=1861}}, and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Paul Gordan|first=Paul |last=Gordan|year=1887}} in the 19th century for computing  [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s of [[algebraic form]]s. It is based on treating the form as if it were a power of a degree one form, which corresponds to embedding a symmetric power of a vector space into the symmetric elements of a [[tensor product]] of copies of it.

==Symbolic notation==

The symbolic method uses a compact, but rather confusing and mysterious notation for invariants, depending on the introduction of new symbols ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ...  (from which the symbolic method gets its name) with apparently contradictory properties.

===Example: the discriminant of a binary quadratic form===
These symbols can be explained by the following example from {{harv|Gordan|1887|loc=v. 2, p.g. 1-3}}. Suppose that 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  f(x) = A_0x_1^2+2A_1x_1x_2+A_2x_2^2&lt;/math&gt;
is a binary quadratic form with an invariant given by the discriminant
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta=A_0A_2-A_1^2.&lt;/math&gt;
The symbolic representation of the discriminant is 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\Delta=(ab)^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are the symbols. The meaning of  the expression (''ab'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is as follows. First of all, (''ab'') is a shorthand form for the determinant of a matrix whose rows are ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (ab)=a_1b_2-a_2b_1.&lt;/math&gt;
Squaring this we get
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (ab)^2=a_1^2b_2^2-2a_1a_2b_1b_2+a_2^2b_1^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Next we pretend that
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2)^2=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  A_i=a_1^{2-i}a_2^{i}= b_1^{2-i}b_2^{i}&lt;/math&gt;
and we ignore the fact that this does not seem to make sense if ''f'' is not a power of a linear form. 
Substituting these values gives
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (ab)^2= A_2A_0-2A_1A_1+A_0A_2 = 2\Delta.&lt;/math&gt;

===Higher degrees===
More generally if 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  f(x) = A_0x_1^n+\binom{n}{1}A_1x_1^{n-1}x_2+\cdots+A_nx_2^n&lt;/math&gt;
is a binary form of higher degree, then one introduces new variables ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with the properties
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2)^n=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2)^n=(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)^n=\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

What this means is that the following two vector spaces are naturally isomorphic:
*The  vector space of homogeneous polynomials in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of degree ''m''
*The vector space of  polynomials in 2''m'' variables ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... that have degree ''n'' in each of the ''m'' pairs of variables (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),  (''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ... and are symmetric under permutations of the ''m'' symbols ''a'', ''b'', ....,
The isomorphism is given by mapping ''a''{{su|p=''n''&amp;minus;''j''|b=1}}''a''{{su|p=''j''|b=2}}, ''b''{{su|p=''n''&amp;minus;''j''|b=1}}''b''{{su|p=''j''|b=2}}, .... to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. This mapping does not preserve products of polynomials.

===More variables===
The extension to a form ''f'' in more than two variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,... is similar: one introduces symbols ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on  with the properties
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+\cdots)^n=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_3+\cdots)^n=(c_1x_1+c_2x_2+c_3x_3+\cdots)^n=\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

==Symmetric products==

The rather mysterious formalism of the symbolic method corresponds to embedding a symmetric product S&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') of a vector space ''V'' into a tensor product of ''n'' copies of ''V'', as the elements preserved by the action of the symmetric group. In fact this is done twice, because the invariants of degree ''n'' of a quantic of degree ''m'' are the invariant elements of S&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), which gets embedded into a tensor product of ''mn'' copies of ''V'', as the elements invariant under a wreath product of the two symmetric groups. The brackets of the symbolic method are really invariant linear forms on this tensor product, which give invariants of S&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') by restriction.

Dr. [[Lillian Rosanoff Lieber]] wrote this treatise on mathematical thinking in twenty chapters. The writing took a form that resembled free-verse poetry, though Lieber included an introduction stating that the form was meant only to facilitate rapid reading, rather than emulate free-verse. Lieber's husband, a fellow professor at [[Long Island University]], Hugh Gray Lieber, provided illustrations for the book.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Lieber, ''The Education of T.C. MITS'' (Philadelphia:  Paul Dry Books Incorporated, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the book was meant to emphasize that mathematics can be understood by anyone, which was further shown when a special "Overseas edition for the Armed Forces" was published in 1942, and approved by the [[Council on Books in Wartime]] to be sent to American troops fighting in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Mazur.

The '''triple product rule''', known variously as the '''cyclic chain rule''', '''cyclic relation''', '''cyclical rule''' or '''Euler's chain rule''', is a formula which relates [[partial derivative]]s of three interdependent variables.  The rule finds application in [[thermodynamics]], where frequently three variables can be related by a function of the form ''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0, so each variable is given as an implicit function of the other two variables.  For example, an [[equation of state]] for a [[fluid]] relates [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[volume]] in this manner.  The triple product rule for such interrelated variables ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' comes from using a [[Inverse functions and differentiation|reciprocity relation]] on the result of the [[implicit function theorem]] and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y = -1.&lt;/math&gt;
::Note: In each factor the variable in the numerator is considered to be an implicit function of the other two. In each factor the subscripted variable is being held constant.

Here the subscripts indicate which variables are held constant when the partial derivative is taken.  That is, to explicitly compute the partial derivative of ''x'' with respect to ''y'' with ''z'' held constant, one would write ''x'' as a function of ''y'' and ''z'' and take the partial derivative of this function with respect to ''y'' only.

The advantage of the triple product rule is that by rearranging terms, one can derive a number of substitution identities which allow one to replace partial derivatives which are difficult to analytically evaluate, experimentally measure, or integrate with quotients of partial derivatives which are easier to work with.  For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z = - \frac{\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)_x}{\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y}&lt;/math&gt;

Various other forms of the rule are present in the literature; these can be derived by permuting the variables {''x'', ''y'', ''z''}.

== Derivation ==

An informal derivation follows.  Suppose that ''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0.  Write ''z'' as a function of ''x'' and ''y''.  Thus the [[total differential]] ''dz'' is

:&lt;math&gt;dz = \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y dx + \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)_x dy&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that we move along a curve with ''dz'' = 0, where the curve is parameterized by ''x''.  Thus ''y'' can be written in terms of ''x'', so on this curve

:&lt;math&gt;dy = \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_z dx&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the equation for ''dz'' = 0 becomes

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y \, dx + \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)_x \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_z \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

Since this must be true for all ''dx'', rearranging terms gives

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y = -\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)_x \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_z&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by the derivatives on the right hand side gives the triple product rule

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y = -1&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this proof makes many implicit assumptions regarding the existence of partial derivatives, the existence of the [[exact differential]] ''dz'', the ability to construct a curve in some [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] with ''dz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and the nonzero value of partial derivatives and their reciprocals.  A formal proof based on [[mathematical analysis]] would eliminate these potential ambiguities.

=== Alternative derivation ===
Suppose a function ''f(x,y,z)=0'', where ''x'',''y'' and ''z'' are functions of each other. Write the [[Exact differential|total differentials]] of the variables
:&lt;math&gt;dx = \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z dy + \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}\right)_y dz&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dy = \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_z dx + \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x dz&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute ''dy'' into ''dx''
:&lt;math&gt;dx = \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z \left[ \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_z dx + \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x dz\right] + \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}\right)_y dz&lt;/math&gt;
By using the [[chain rule]] one can show the coefficient of ''dx'' is equal to one, thus the coefficient of ''dz'' must be zero
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x + \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}\right)_y  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Subtracting the second term and multiplying by its inverse gives the triple product rule
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Deriving Wave Velocity using the Triple Product Rule.png|thumb|The profile of a traveling wave at time ''t'' (solid line) and ''t+Δt'' (dashed line). In the time interval ''Δt'', the point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will rise up to the same height that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; had at time ''t''.]]

A geometric realization of the triple product rule can be found in its close ties to the velocity of a traveling wave 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x,t) = A \cos (kx - \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;
shown on the right at time ''t'' (solid blue line) and at a short time later ''t+Δt'' (dashed). The wave maintains its shape as it propagates, so that a point at position ''x'' at time ''t'' will correspond to a point at position ''x+Δx'' at time ''t+Δt'',
:&lt;math&gt;A \cos (kx - \omega t) = A \cos (k (x + \Delta x) - \omega (t + \Delta t)). &lt;/math&gt;
This equation can only be satisfied for all ''x'' and ''t'' if ''kΔx-ωΔt=0'', resulting in the formula for the [[phase velocity]]
:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega}{k}. &lt;/math&gt;

To elucidate the connection with the triple product rule, consider the point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at time ''t'' and its corresponding point (with the same height) ''p̄''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at ''t+Δt''. Define ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the point at time ''t'' whose x-coordinate matches that of ''p̄''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and define ''p̄''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be the corresponding point of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as shown in the figure on the right. The distance ''Δx'' between ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p̄''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as the distance between ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p̄''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (green lines), and dividing this distance by ''Δt'' yields the speed of the wave.

To compute ''Δx'', consider the two partial derivatives computed at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \right)_x \Delta t = \text{rise from }p_2\text{ to }\bar{p}_1\text{ in time }\Delta t\text{ (gold line)} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \right)_t = \text{slope of the wave (red line) at time }t. &lt;/math&gt;
Dividing these two partial derivatives and using the definition of the slope (rise divided by run) gives us the desired formula for 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta x = - \frac{\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \right)_x \Delta t}{\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \right)_t}, &lt;/math&gt;
where the negative sign accounts for the fact that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; lies behind ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relative to the wave's motion. Thus, the wave's velocity is given by
:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = - \frac{\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \right)_x}{\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \right)_t}.&lt;/math&gt;
For infinitesimal ''Δt'', &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \left( \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \right)_\phi&lt;/math&gt; and we recover the triple product rule
:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = - \frac{\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \right)_x}{\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \right)_t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Vanna–Volga method''' is a mathematical tool used in [[finance]]. It is a technique for pricing first-generation [[exotic option]]s in [[foreign exchange market]] (FX) [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]].

==Description==
It consists of adjusting the [[Black–Scholes]] theoretical value (BSTV)
by the cost of a portfolio which hedges three main risks
associated to the volatility of the option: the [[Greeks (finance)|Vega]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;, the Vanna
and the Volga. 
The Vanna is the sensitivity of the Vega with respect to a change in the spot FX rate:

&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Vanna} = \frac{\partial
\mathcal{V}}{\partial S}&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the Volga is the sensitivity
of the Vega with respect to a change of the [[implied volatility]]
&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Volga}= \frac{\partial \mathcal{V}}{\partial \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we consider a [[Volatility smile|smile volatility term structure]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma(K)&lt;/math&gt; with ATM strike &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt;, ATM volatility &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;, and where &lt;math&gt;K_{c/p}&lt;/math&gt; are the 25-Delta
call/put strikes (obtained by solving the equations &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{
call}(K_c,\sigma_0)=1/4&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{
put}(K_p,\sigma_0)=-1/4&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{call/put}(K,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the
[[Greeks (finance)|Black–Scholes Delta sensitivity]]) then the hedging portfolio
will be composed of the ''at-the-money'' (ATM), ''risk-reversal'' (RR) and ''butterfly'' (BF)
strategies:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textrm{ATM}(K_0) &amp;= \frac12 \left(\textrm{Call}(K_0,\sigma_0) + \textrm{Put}(K_0,\sigma_0)\right) \\
\textrm{RR}(K_c,K_p) &amp;=  \frac{}{}\textrm{Call}(K_c,\sigma(K_c))-\textrm{Put}(K_p,\sigma(K_p)) \\
\textrm{BF}(K_c,K_p) &amp;= \frac12 \left(\textrm{Call}(K_c,\sigma(K_c)) + \textrm{Put}(K_p,\sigma(K_p))\right)- \textrm{ATM}(K_0)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Call}(K,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Black–Scholes#Black.E2.80.93Scholes formula|Black–Scholes price]]  of a call option (similarly for the put).

The simplest formulation of the Vanna–Volga method suggests that the
Vanna–Volga price &lt;math&gt;X^{VV}&lt;/math&gt; of an exotic instrument &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is
given by

&lt;math&gt;
X^{\rm VV} = X ^{BS} + \underbrace{\frac{\textrm{X}_{vanna}}{\textrm{RR}_{vanna}}}_{w_{RR}} {RR}_{cost} +
\underbrace{\frac{\textrm{X}_{volga}}{\textrm{BF}_{volga}}}_{w_{
BF}} {BF}_{cost} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where by &lt;math&gt;X^{ BS}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Black–Scholes price of the
exotic and the Greeks are calculated with ATM volatility and

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
RR_{cost} &amp;=\left[ \textrm{Call}(K_c,\sigma(K_c))-\textrm{Put}(K_p,\sigma(K_p)) \right] - \left[ \textrm{Call}(K_c,\sigma_0)-\textrm{Put}(K_p,\sigma_0) \right] 
\\
BF_{cost} &amp;= \frac12 \left[ 
\textrm{Call}(K_c,\sigma(K_c))+\textrm{Put}(K_p,\sigma(K_p)) \right] - \frac12 \left[ \textrm{Call}(K_c,\sigma_0)+\textrm{Put}(K_p,\sigma_0) \right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

These quantities represent a ''smile cost'', namely the
difference between the price computed with/without including the
smile effect.

The rationale behind the above formulation of the Vanna-Volga price is that one can extract
the ''smile cost'' of an exotic option by measuring the
''smile cost'' of a portfolio designed to hedge its Vanna and
Volga risks. The reason why one chooses the strategies BF and RR
to do this is because they are liquid FX instruments and they
carry mainly Volga, and respectively Vanna risks. The weighting
factors &lt;math&gt;w_{RR}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_{BF}&lt;/math&gt; represent
respectively  the amount of RR needed to replicate the option's
Vanna, and the amount of BF needed to replicate the option's
Volga. The above approach ignores the small (but non-zero)
fraction of Volga carried by the RR and the small fraction of
Vanna carried by the BF. It further neglects the cost of hedging
the Vega risk. This has led to a more general formulation of the
Vanna-Volga method in which one considers that within the Black–Scholes
assumptions the exotic option's Vega, Vanna and Volga can be
replicated by the weighted sum of three instruments:

&lt;math&gt;
X_i = w_{ ATM}\, { ATM_i}  + w_{  RR}\, {RR_i} +
w_{BF}\, {BF_i} \, \, \, \, \, i\text{=vega, vanna, volga}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the weightings are obtained by solving the system:
&lt;math&gt;
\vec{x} = \mathbb{A} \vec{w}
&lt;/math&gt;

with

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{A} =  \begin{pmatrix}
ATM_{vega} &amp;  RR_{vega} &amp; BF_{vega} \\
ATM_{vanna} &amp;  RR_{vanna} &amp; BF_{vanna} \\
ATM_{volga} &amp;  RR_{volga} &amp; BF_{volga}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
\vec{w}= \begin{pmatrix} w_{ATM} \\
w_{RR} \\ w_{BF}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}= \begin{pmatrix} X_{vega} \\
X_{vanna} \\ X_{volga}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Given this replication, the Vanna–Volga method adjusts the BS
price of an exotic option by the ''smile cost'' of the above
weighted sum (note that the ATM smile cost is zero by
construction):

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} X^{\rm VV} &amp;= X^{BS} + w_{RR} ({RR}^{mkt}-{RR}^{BS}) +
w_{BF} ({BF}^{mkt}-{BF}^{BS}) \\
 &amp;= X ^{BS} + \vec{x}^T(\mathbb{A}^T)^{-1}\vec{I} \\
&amp; = X ^{BS} +
X_{vega} \, \Omega_{vega}+ X_{vanna} \, \Omega_{vanna} + X_{volga} \, \Omega_{volga} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{I} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
{RR}^{mkt} - {RR}^{BS}\\
{BF}^{mkt} - {BF}^{BS}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
\Omega_{vega} \\
\Omega_{vanna} \\
\Omega_{volga}
\end{pmatrix} = (\mathbb{A}^T)^{-1}\vec{I}
&lt;/math&gt;

The quantities &lt;math&gt;\Omega_i&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the
market prices attached to a unit amount of Vega, Vanna and Volga,
respectively. The resulting correction, however, typically turns
out to be too large. Market practitioners thus modify
&lt;math&gt;X^{VV}&lt;/math&gt; to

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
X^{\rm VV} &amp;= X ^{BS} + p_{vanna} X_{vanna}
\Omega_{vanna} + p_{volga} X_{volga} \Omega_{volga} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Vega contribution turns out to be
several orders of magnitude smaller than the Vanna and Volga terms
in all practical situations, hence one neglects it.

The terms &lt;math&gt;p_{vanna}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{
volga}&lt;/math&gt; are put in by-hand and represent factors that ensure the correct behaviour of the price of an exotic option near a barrier:
as the knock-out barrier level &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of an option
is gradually moved toward the spot level &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt;, the BSTV price of a
knock-out option must be a monotonically decreasing function, converging
to zero exactly at &lt;math&gt;B=S_0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the Vanna-Volga method is a
simple rule-of-thumb and not a rigorous model, there is no
guarantee that this will be a priori the case. The attenuation factors are of a different from for the Vanna or the Volga
of an instrument. This is because for barrier values close to the spot they behave differently: the Vanna becomes large while,
on the contrary, the Volga becomes small. Hence the
attenuation factors take the form:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p_{\rm vanna} &amp;= a \, \gamma  \\ p_{\rm volga} &amp;= b + c 
\gamma 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; represents some measure of the barrier(s)
vicinity to the spot with the features

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\gamma=0 \ \ &amp;{for}\ \ S_0\to B \\
\gamma=1 \ \ &amp;{for}\ \ |S_0-B|\gg 0 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; are found through calibration of the model to ensure that it reproduces the vanilla smile. Good candidates for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; that ensure the appropriate behaviour close to the barriers are the ''survival probability'' and the ''expected first exit time''. Both of these quantities offer the desirable property that they vanish close to a barrier.

==Survival probability==
The survival probability  &lt;math&gt;p_{surv}\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; refers to the
probability that the spot does not touch one or more barrier
levels &lt;math&gt;\{B_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, for a single barrier option we have

&lt;math&gt;
p_{surv} = \mathbb{E}[ 1_{S_t&lt;B, t_{\textrm{tod}}&lt;t&lt;t_{\textrm{mat}}}] = \mathrm{NT}(B) / \mathrm{DF}(t_{\textrm{tod}},t_{\textrm{mat}}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NT}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of a ''no-touch'' option and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{DF}(t_{\textrm{tod}},t_{\textrm{mat}})&lt;/math&gt; the discount factor between today and maturity. Similarly, for options with two barriers
the survival probability is given through the undiscounted value
of a double-no-touch option.

==First-exit time==
The first exit time (FET) is the minimum between: (i) the time in
the future when the spot is expected to exit a barrier zone before
maturity, and (ii) maturity, if the spot has not hit any of the
barrier levels up to maturity. That is, if we denote the FET by
&lt;math&gt;u(S_t,t)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;u(S_t,t)=&lt;/math&gt;min&lt;math&gt;\{\phi,T\}&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;\phi=\textrm{inf}\{\ell\in [0,T)\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;S_{t+\ell} &gt; H &lt;/math&gt; or
&lt;math&gt;S_{t+\ell}&lt;L&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L,H&lt;/math&gt; are the 'low' vs 'high' barrier levels and
&lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; the spot of today.

The first-exit time is the solution of the following PDE

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial
u(S,t) }{\partial t} + \frac12\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 u(S,t) }{\partial
S^2} + \mu S \frac{\partial u(S,t) }{\partial S} =0
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is solved backwards
in time starting from the terminal condition &lt;math&gt;u(S,T) = T&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the time to maturity and
boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;u(L,t')=u(H,t')=t'&lt;/math&gt;. In case of a single
barrier option we use the same PDE with either &lt;math&gt;H\gg S_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L\ll
S_0&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; represents the risk-neutral drift of the underlying stochastic process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9441">In [[descriptive set theory]], '''Wadge degrees'''&lt;!-- , named after [[XXXX Wadge]] (date of birth&amp;nbsp;– date of death), --&gt; are levels of complexity for sets of reals. Sets are compared by continuous reductions. The '''Wadge hierarchy''' is the structure of Wadge degrees.

== Wadge degrees ==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are subsets of [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''Wadge reducible''' to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ≤&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- : &lt;math&gt;A\le_W B&lt;/math&gt; --&gt; if there is a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A = f^{-1}[B]&lt;/math&gt;. The '''Wadge order''' is the [[preorder]] or [[quasiorder]] on the subsets of Baire space. [[Equivalence class]]es of sets under this preorder are called '''Wadge degrees''', the degree of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by [&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;. The set of Wadge degrees ordered by the Wadge order is called the '''Wadge hierarchy'''.

Properties of Wadge degrees include their consistency with measures of complexity stated in terms of definability. For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ≤&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a countable intersection of [[open set]]s, then so is &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The same works for all levels of the [[Borel hierarchy]] and the [[difference hierarchy]]. The Wadge hierarchy plays an important role in models of the [[axiom of determinacy]]. Further interest in Wadge degrees comes from computer science, where some papers have suggested Wadge degrees are relevant to [[Computational complexity theory|algorithmic complexity]].

== Wadge and Lipschitz games ==

The '''Wadge game''' is a simple infinite [[game theory|game]] discovered by William Wadge (pronounced "wage"). It is used to investigate the notion of continuous reduction for subsets of Baire space. Wadge had analyzed the structure of the Wadge hierarchy for Baire space with games by 1972, but published these results only much later in his PhD thesis. In the Wadge game &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)&lt;/math&gt;, player I and player II each in turn play integers which may depend on those played before. The outcome of the game is determined by checking whether the sequences x and y generated by players I and II are contained in the sets A and B, respectively. Player II wins if the outcome is the same for both players, i.e. &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Player I wins if the outcome is different. Sometimes this is also called the ''Lipschitz game'', and the variant where player II has the option to pass (but has to play infinitely often) is called the Wadge game.

Suppose for a moment that the game is [[determinacy|determined]]. If player I has a winning strategy, then this defines a continuous (even [[Lipschitz continuous|Lipschitz]]) map reducing &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and if on the other hand player II has a winning strategy then you have a reduction of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. For example, suppose that player II has a winning strategy. Map every sequence x to the sequence y that player II plays in &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; if player I plays the sequence x, where player II follows his or her winning strategy. This defines a is a continuous map f with the property that x is in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if f(x) is in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Wadge's lemma''' states that under the [[axiom of determinacy]] ([[axiom of determinacy|AD]]), for any two subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; of Baire space, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ≤&lt;sub&gt;W &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ≤&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;–&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The assertion that the Wadge lemma holds for sets in Γ is the ''semilinear ordering principle'' for Γ or SLO(Γ). Any {{visible anchor|semilinear order}} defines a linear order on the equivalence classes modulo complements. Wadge's lemma can be applied locally to any [[pointclass]] Γ, for example the Borel sets, '''Δ'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; sets, '''Σ'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; sets, or '''Π'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; sets. It follows from determinacy of differences of sets in Γ. Since [[determinacy|Borel determinacy]] is proved in [[ZFC]], ZFC implies Wadge's lemma for Borel sets.

== Structure of the Wadge hierarchy ==

[[Donald A. Martin|Martin]] and Monk proved in 1973 that [[axiom of determinacy|AD]] implies the Wadge order for Baire space is well founded. Hence under AD, the Wadge classes modulo complements form a wellorder. The '''Wadge rank''' of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the set of Wadge degrees modulo complements strictly below [&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;. The length of the Wadge hierarchy has been shown to be [[Θ (set theory)|Θ]]. Wadge also proved that the length of the Wadge hierarchy restricted to the Borel sets is φ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(1) (or φ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(2) depending on the notation), where φ&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; is the γ&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Veblen function]] to the base ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (instead of the usual ω).

As for the Wadge lemma, this holds for any pointclass Γ, assuming the [[axiom of determinacy]]. If we associate with each set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the collection of all sets strictly below &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on the Wadge hierarchy, this forms a pointclass.  Equivalently, for each ordinal α≤θ the collection W&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of sets which show up before stage α is a [[pointclass]]. Conversely, every pointclass is equal to some &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;. A pointclass is said to be ''self-dual'' if it is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under complementation. It can be shown that W&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is self-dual if and only if α is either 0, an [[even ordinal|even]] [[successor ordinal]], or a [[limit ordinal]] of [[countable]] [[cofinality]].

== Other notions of degree ==

Similar notions of reduction and degree arise by replacing the continuous functions by any class of functions ''F'' which contains the identity function and is closed under composition. Write &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ≤&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A = f^{-1}[B]&lt;/math&gt; for some function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in ''F''. Any such class of functions again determines a [[preorder]] on the subsets of Baire space. Degrees given by [[Lipschitz function]]s are called ''Lipschitz degrees'', and degrees from [[Borel function]]s ''Borel-Wadge degrees''.

'''Étienne Bézout''' ({{IPA-fr|bezu|lang}}; 31 March 1730 – 27 September 1783) was a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] who was born in [[Nemours]], [[Seine-et-Marne]], [[France]],  and died in [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] (near [[Fontainebleau]]), France.

==Work==
In 1758 Bézout was elected an adjoint in mechanics of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].
Besides numerous minor works, wrote a ''Théorie générale des équations algébriques'', published at Paris in 1779, which in particular contained much new and valuable matter on the [[elimination theory|theory of elimination]] and symmetrical functions of the roots of an equation: he used [[determinant]]s in a paper in the ''Histoire de l'académie royale'', 1764, but did not treat the general theory.
