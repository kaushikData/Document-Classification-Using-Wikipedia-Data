'''''A Song for Ella Grey''''' is a 2014 young adult novel, written by [[David Almond]] and illustrated by Karen Radford. It is based on the legend, [[Orpheus and Eurydice]].

==Reception==
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', in a starred review of ''A Song for Ella Grey'', wrote "Like Orpheus’s music, Almond’s lyrical narrative will sweep readers on a journey to unearthly, mysterious realms and back. Mythological characters come to life while remaining enigmatic enough to set imaginations spinning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-553-53359-0 |title=A Song for Ella Grey |date=27 July 2015 |website=Publishers Weekly |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote "Almond brings his hypnotic lyricism to this darkly romantic tale that sings of the madness of youth, the ache of love, and the near-impossibility of grasping death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-almond/a-song-for-ella-grey/|title=A Song for Ella Grey |date=27 July 2015 |website=Kirkus Reviews |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "a beautiful book that works on several levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sedgwick |first=Marcus |date=11 October 2014 |title=A Song for Ella Grey by David Almond – a triumph |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/11/a-song-for-ella-grey-david-almond-review-triumph |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmad al-Hassan''', full name '''Ahmad bin Ismail bin Saleh bin Hussain bin Salman''' ({{lang-ar|احمد بن اسماعيل بن صالح بن الحسين بن سلمان}},  born in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]]) is the leader of the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Iraqi movement [[Ansar of Imam al-Mahdi]] who claims to be the savior of mankind.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saviorofmankind.com/homepage/86-english-uk/slideshow/97-glad-tidings|title=Glad Tidings |work=saviorofmankind.com |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started claiming to be the messenger of the messianic figure the [[Imam Mahdi]], after he had a vision in which Imam Mahdi told him to enroll in the religious institute [[Hawza#Hawza .27Ilmiyya Najaf|Hawza Ilmiya]] in [[Najaf]], Iraq. Ahmad al-Hassan isolated himself at home to learn the sciences of the Hawza with an attempt of reforming it as he claims it to be disordered. He later formed a group called the Ansar. His followers believe him to be '''[[Al-Yamani (Shiism)|al-Yamani]]''', the eschatological Yamani leader who will precede the return of the Imam due to his claim of being al-Yamani.

According to Iraqi Basra police, investigations conducted revealed that his ancestry does not go back to the prophet. He uses the [[Star of David]] as his logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/02/04/45160.html |title=Iraqi police expose doomsday cult chief |date=4 February 2008 |work=[[Al Arabiya]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle Muhsin ibn Saleh, Sayyed Hasan bin Muhammad Ali al-Hamami (son of the late [[Marja']] Sayed Muhammad Ali Musawi al-Hamami), a tribal leader from Bani Abas and 2 other regional clerics have attested that his family tree traces back to [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.saviorofmankind.com/about/|title=ABOUT - Savior of Mankind|work=Savior of Mankind|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2017}}

== Claims ==
Ahmad al-Hassan makes a number of claims, which include that he is the son, messenger, vicegerent, and executor of the affairs of Imam Mahdi, al-Yamani, an infallible Imam, the first of 12 Mahdis, a messenger of the prophets [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] and [[Elijah]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Religious call ==
Ahmad al-Hassan started his religious call privately, only first announcing it publicly in 2002, during the last months of Saddam’s rule, after his attempted Hawza reformations.

Regarding the purposes of his movement, he claimed:
{{Cquote | The goal of my message is the goal of the Prophets: Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, which is to spread the true monotheism with which God is satisfied, and for the earth to be filled with peace and justice after it had been filled with oppression and injustice."&lt;ref name="Zyad interview"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://the-savior.com/home/index.php/79-slideshow/108-interview.html | title = Interview with Ahmad al-Hassan by independent journalist Zyad Qasim Al-Zubaidi | accessdate = 2012-05-13 | work = the-savior.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120410083200/http://www.the-savior.com/home/index.php/79-slideshow/108-interview.html | archive-date = 2012-04-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed, "I am the Messenger of Imam [[Mahdi]], and I am his vicegerent, and I am the first of the twelve Mahdis from the sons of Imam [[Mahdi]].&lt;ref name="بيان الحق والسداد  الجزء الثاني"&gt;{{cite book|last=الحسن|first=احمد|title=بيان الحق والسداد|year=2006 |pages=16 |url=http://www.almahdyoon.org/arabic/documents/books-saed/Bayan-l7a9-al2a3dad-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His followers have described his call as being universal,&lt;ref name="Mahdiwatch Questions"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.mahdiwatch.org/2008.03.01_arch.html#1205465357892 | title = Questions sent to Ahmad al-Hassan followers (Ansars) | date = 2008-03-13 | accessdate = 2012-07-30 | publisher = Dr. Timothy Furnish | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120418071841/http://www.mahdiwatch.org/2008.03.01_arch.html#1205465357892 | archive-date = 2012-04-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MERIP"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.merip.org/mer/mer242/basra-reluctant-seat-shiastan | title = MERIP Basra analysis | date = 2008-03-13 | accessdate = 2012-07-30 | publisher = Dr. Reidar Visser }}&lt;/ref&gt;  because his preaching addresses Muslims, Christians, Jews, and all of mankind.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The adherents of Ahmad al-Hassan collectively identify themselves as ''Ansar of Imam al-Mahdi'' ("Supporters of the [[Imam Mahdi]]"), or ''Ansars''. While many of his supporters are in Iraq, he has followers outside of Iraq as well, largely due to dissemination of his teachings through English websites.

[[Middle East Research and Information Project]] has reported that "the majority of his public affrays—they often take the form of theological duels known as munazarat—have been with Sadrist followers."&lt;ref name="MERIP"/&gt; He was claimed to have been involved in the Najaf clashes,{{clarify|date=August 2012}} though he denied any such involvement.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.aljazeera.net/news/pages/f6809ee2-a5d0-4b3e-809f-a2f1dd802229 | title = Article name: Bloody Ashura and a Shia Group which denies having a connection to the Battle of Najaf. Translation of second paragraph under 'Battle of Najaf'(in bold): The adherents of Ahmad Hassan AlYamani - who describes himself as the Messenger of awaited Imam Mahdi - say that their movement is peaceful and has no connection with the group known by the name "Soldiers of Heaven" which participated in the battle; and that the Iraqi authorities falsely accused their leader (Ahmad AlHassan) of being involved in the fight. | date = 2008-03-13 | accessdate = 2012-08-01 | work = AlJazeera }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written some books, as well as having a section on his website dedicated to answering questions sent to him.

He claims that Shia Muslims are being "deceived" by the [[Marja']]. He claims that imitating a scholar is not obligatory for Muslims, and it is considered ''Shirk'' to  blindly follow a scholar.

== Controversies ==
=== Mahdi claim ===
The ''Yamani'' is one of the major signs that is awaited by Shi'a Muslims before the appearance of the 12th Imam [[Mahdi]]. The Shia clerics that are informed about Ahmad al-Hassan's call have largely condemned him, and issued corresponding ''[[fatwa]]''s classifying Ahmad al-Hassan as an impostor, a fabricator, a deceiver, an innovator, and a liar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqaed.com/faq/6586/|title=»الإجابة على الأسئلة العقائدية »مركز الأبحاث العقائدية|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sh-alsagheer.com/index.php?show=news&amp;action=article&amp;id=677|title=سماحة الشيخ جلال الدين الصغير - الموقع الرسمي|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'a Muslim scholars such as Sheikh [[Ali al-Korani]] and [[Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir]] have expressed their negative views of al-Hassan's claims in numerous TV broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alameli.net/|title=جديد مكتبة الوسائط |work=alameli.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Najaf ===
Shortly after the January 2007 [[Battle of Najaf (2007)|Battle of Najaf]], conflicting reports and news coverage emerged as to who exactly was involved in the clashes.

The ''Times'' article also reported that Diyah Abdul Zahraa Khadom was the same person as Ahmad Hassan al-Yamani, and whose alleged role was deputy of the group, not the leader.&lt;ref name="NY times"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html?_r=3 | title = Mystery Arises Over Identity of Militia Chief in Najaf Fight| date = 2007-02-01 | accessdate = 2012-05-19 | first = Damien |last=Cave |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Saadiq al-Hasnawi, who is a teacher in the Scientific Hawza of Honorable Najaf says, "This movement (Soldiers of Heaven), we have never heard about it before, and we used to guess that the leader of it is Sayed Ahmad al-Yamani, and they told me about the book Qathi al-Sama which was spread around in multitudes and by anonymous people, and when I read the content of the book I was shocked in its strange ideas completely, over the method of Ahmad son of al-Hassan al-Yamani."&lt;ref name="Akhbaar"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.akhbaar.org/home/2007/02/24518.html | title = Sheikh al-Hasnawi on Soldiers of Heaven | date = 2007-02-01 | accessdate = 2018-01-10 | work=akhbaar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sayyed Hasan bin Muhammad Ali al-Hamami (son of the late Marja Sayed Muhammad Ali Musawi al-Hamami) states that Soldiers of Heaven was led by Dhiyaa' [Abdul-Zahra] Al-Qara'wi, who had rejected the 12 Imams of Shia Islam, had claimed to be the 12th Imam Mahdi himself, and had later died in the battle.&lt;ref name="8 hamami"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfePFfJ0POA | title = Interview with the son of the late Marja Sayed Muhammad Ali Musawi Alhammamy | accessdate = 2012-05-19 | publisher = Ansar Imam Mahdi |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Messenoire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''The Guibourg Mass'' by Henry de Malvost, in the book ''Le Satanisme et la magie'' by [[Jules Bois]], Paris, 1903.]]
A '''Black Mass''' is a [[ritual]] characterized by the inversion of the [[Tridentine Mass|Traditional Latin Mass celebrated by the Roman Catholic Church]].

In the 19th century the Black Mass became popularized in French literature, in books such as ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft (book)|Satanism and Witchcraft]]'', by [[Jules Michelet]], and ''[[Là-bas (novel)|Là-bas]]'', by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]].

Modern revivals began with H. T. F. Rhodes' book, ''The Satanic Mass'' published in London in 1954, and there is now a range of modern versions of the Black Mass performed by various groups.

== Origins and history of the Black Mass ==

=== Early Christianity ===
The [[Catholic Church]] regards the Mass as its most important ritual, going back to [[12 apostles|apostolic]] times. In general, its various [[liturgy|liturgies]] followed the outline of Liturgy of the Word, Offertory, Liturgy of the Eucharist, and Benediction, which developed into what is known as the [[Tridentine Mass|Mass]]. However, as [[early Christianity]] became more established and its influence began to spread, the early [[Church Fathers]] began to describe a few heretical groups practicing their own versions of Masses. Some of these rituals were of a bizarre sexual nature.&lt;ref&gt;Zacharias discusses some of these in the first part of his book.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth-century AD heresiologist [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], for instance, claims that a libertine [[Gnostic]] sect known as the [[Borborites]] engaged in a version of the Eucharist in which they would smear their hands with menstrual blood and semen and consume them as the blood and body of Christ respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraff|first1=Wouter J.|last2=Kripal|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism|date=2011|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC0mY_XEIU0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I4pf5o87vB&amp;sig=9bjbHdJVAT_0pedXuDGQuRCGmG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also alleges that, whenever one of the women in their church was experiencing her period, they would take her menstrual blood and everyone in the church would eat it as part of a sacred ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraff|first1=Wouter J.|last2=Kripal|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism|date=2011|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC0mY_XEIU0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I4pf5o87vB&amp;sig=9bjbHdJVAT_0pedXuDGQuRCGmG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Roman Catholic parodies and additions to the Mass ===
[[File:Black mass 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sixteenth century woodcut depicting black mass.]]
Within the Church, the rite of the Mass was not completely fixed, and there were places at the end of the [[Offertory]] for the ''[[Secret (liturgy)|Secret]]'' prayers, when the priest could insert private prayers for various personal needs. These practices became especially prevalent in France (see [[Pre-Tridentine Mass#Middle Ages|Pre-Tridentine Mass]]). As these types of personal prayers within the Mass spread, the institution of the [[Low Mass]] became quite common, where priests would perform various Masses for the needs of their parishioner as The Mass is considered the highest form of prayer. In the 12th and 13th centuries there was a great surplus of clerics and monks who might be inclined to perform these Masses, as younger sons were often sent off to religious universities, and after their studies, needed to find a livelihood. 

Another result of the surplus of (sometimes disillusioned) clerical students was the appearance of the Latin writings of the [[Goliard]]s and wandering clerics ([[clerici vagantes]]). Some of the earliest of these Latin parody works are found in the medieval Latin collection of poetry, ''[[Carmina Burana]]'', written around 1230. At the time these wandering clerics were spreading their Latin writings and parodies of the Mass, the [[Cathars]], who also spread their teachings through wandering clerics, were also active. Due to the proximity in time and location of the Golliards, the Cathars, and the witches, all of whom were seen as threatening the authority of the Roman Catholic Church and the Papal Authority in Rome, some historians have postulated that these wandering clerics may have at times offered their services for performing heretical, or "black" Masses on various occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat: A Discussion of Certain Problems in the History of Witchcraft and Diabolism'', Toronto, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further source of late Medieval and Early Modern involvement with parodies and alterations of the Mass, were the writings of the European [[witch-hunt]], which saw witches as being agents of the Devil, who were described as inverting the Christian Mass and employing the stolen [[Eucharist|Host]] for [[host desecration|diabolical ends]]. Witch-hunter's manuals such as the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1487) and the ''[[Compendium Maleficarum]]'' (1608) allude to these supposed practices.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Montague, translator, ''The Malleus Maleficarum of Kramer and Sprenger'', 1948. (Originally published in Germany, in Latin, 1487.)&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete depiction of a blasphemy of the Mass in connection with the [[witches' sabbath]],&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in the Appendix on the Black Mass in: Medway, Gareth J. ''Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt; was given in [[Florimond de Raemond]]'s 1597 French work, ''The Antichrist'' (written as a Catholic response to the  [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation#Antichrist|Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist]]). He uses the following description of a witches' meeting as a sign that Satanic practices are prevalent in the world, and a sign that the Antichrist's power is on the rise:

{{quote|An Italian man took her [Jeanne Bosdeau] to a field on [[Saint John's Eve]]. The man  made a large ring with a rod of holly, muttering a few words which he read from a black book. Thereupon appeared a large, horned goat, all black, accompanied by two women, as well as a man dressed as a priest. The goat asked the Italian who this girl was, and having replied that he had brought her to be his, the goat made him make the sign of the cross with his left hand. Then he commanded all of them to come and greet him, which they did, kissing his rear. The goat had a lighted black candle between his two horns, from which the others lit their own candles. The goat took the woman aside, laid her in the woods, and carnally knew her, to which she took an extreme displeasure, suffered much pain, and felt his seed as cold as ice. Every Wednesday and Friday of each month the general meeting was held, where she went numerous times, with more than sixty other persons, all of whom carried a black candle, lighted from the candle that the goat had between his horns. After that they all began to dance in circles, their backs turned to one another. The person who was performing the service was clothed in a black robe without a cross. He raised a round slice of turnip, dyed black, instead of the Host, and cried at the [[Elevation (liturgy)|Elevation]]: ''Master, help us''. Water was put in the chalice instead of wine, and to make [[Holy Water]], the goat urinated into a hole on the ground, and the person who was performing the service asperged the attendants with a black [[asperges]] (sprinkling of water). In this group they performed the practices of witchcraft, and every one gave a story of what they had done. They were to poison, to bewitch, to bind, to cure illnesses with charms, to make waste the fruits of the earth, and other such maladies.&lt;ref&gt;Original source here, p. 103: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nds7AAAAcAAJ l'Antichrist]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Early modern France ===
[[File:Justine_ou_les_Malheurs_de_la_vertu_(orgy_with_a_monk_2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Engraving from a 1797 edition of [[Justine_(de_Sade_novel)|Justine]], by the [[Marquis de Sade]].]]
Between the 16th and the 19th centuries, many examples of interest in the Black Mass come from France.

* '''16th century''': [[Catherine de' Medici]], the Queen of France, was said by [[Jean Bodin]] to have performed a Black Mass, based on a story in his 1580 book on witchcraft ''De la démonomanie des sorciers''. In spite of its lurid details, there is little outside evidence to back up his story.
* '''17th century''': [[Catherine Monvoisin]] and the priest [[Étienne Guibourg]] performed "Black Masses" for [[Madame de Montespan]], the mistress of King [[Louis XIV of France]]. Since a criminal investigation — ''[[Affair of the Poisons|L'affaire des poisons]]'' (''"Affair of the Poisons"'') — was launched (resulting in the execution of Monvoisin and the imprisonment of Guibourg) many details of their Black Mass have come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Ravaisson, François ''Archives de la Bastille'' (Paris, 1866-1884, volumes IV, V, VI, VII)&lt;/ref&gt; It was a typical Roman Catholic Mass, but modified according to certain formulas (some reminiscent of the Latin ''[[The Sworn Book of Honorius|Sworn Book of Honorius]]'', or its French version, ''[[The Grimoire of Pope Honorius]]'') and featuring the King's mistress (the [[Marquise de Montespan]]) as the central [[altar]] of worship, lying naked upon the altar with the chalice on her bare stomach, and holding two black candles in each of her outstretched arms. The Host was consecrated on her body, and then used in love potions designed to gain the love of the King (on account of the magical power believed to be in the consecrated Host). From these images of the Guibourg mass, further developments of the Black Mass derived.&lt;ref name=summers&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uV_kQksWgCoC&amp; ''Geography of Witchcraft''] by [[Montague Summers]] (1927; reprint [[Kessinger Publishing]], 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''18th century''': The [[Marquis de Sade]], in many of his writings, places the host and the Mass, monks, priests and the Pope himself ([[Pope Pius VI]] in ''[[Juliette (novel)|Juliette]]'') in blasphemous sexual settings.
* '''19th century''': [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] wrote the classic novel of French Satanism, ''[[Là-bas (novel)|Là-bas]]'' (1891). The characters in the novel have long discussions on the history of French Satanism up to their time, and eventually one of them is invited to participate in a Black Mass, the type of which Huysmans claimed was practised in Paris in those years. Although a work of fiction, Huysmans' description of the Black Mass remained influential simply because no other book went into as much detail. However, the actual text which Huysmans' satanic "priest" recites is nothing more than a long diatribe in French, praising Satan as the god of reason and the opponent of Christianity. In this way, it resembles the French poetry of [[Charles Baudelaire]] (in particular ''[[Les Litanies de Satan]]''), more than it resembles an inversion of the Roman Catholic Mass.

=== Late 19th century and early 20th century scholarly interest in the Black Mass ===

Scholarly studies on the Black Mass relied almost completely on French and Latin sources (which also came from France):

* The French historian [[Jules Michelet]] was one of the first to analyze and attempt to understand the Black Mass, and wrote two chapters about it in his classic book, ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft (book)|Satanism and Witchcraft]]'' (1862).
* [[James George Frazer|J. G. Frazer]] included a description of the [[The Mass of Saint-Sécaire|Mass of Saint-Sécaire]], an unusual French legend with similarities to the Black Mass, in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890). Frazer was recounting material already found in an 1883 French book entitled ''Quatorze superstitions populaires de la Gascogne''&lt;ref&gt;Bladé, Jean-François. ''Quatorze superstitions populaires de la Gascogne'', 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; (''"Fourteen Popular Superstitions of Gascony"''), by [[:fr:Jean-François Bladé|Jean-François Bladé]]. This Mass was said to be employed as a method of assassination by supernatural means, allowing the supplicant to avenge himself if he was wronged by someone.
* [[Montague Summers]] discussed many classic portrayals of the Black Mass in a number of his works (especially in ''The History of Witchcraft and Demonology'' (1926), ch. IV, ''The Sabbat'', with extensive quotations from the original French and Latin sources&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;Summers, Montague, ''The History of Witchcraft'', 1926, ch. IV, ''The Sabbat''&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== 20th century ===

* H. T. F. Rhodes' popular book, ''The Satanic Mass'',&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;Rhodes, H.T.F. ''The Satanic Mass'', Rider &amp; Company, London, 1954, Citadel Press, USA, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; published in London in 1954 (American edition in 1955), was a major inspiration for modern versions of the Black Mass, when they finally appeared. Rhodes claimed that, at the time of his writing, there did not exist a single first hand source which actually described the rites and ceremonies of a Black Mass.
* Gerhard Zacharias&lt;ref name="Zacharias"&gt;Zacharias, Gerhard. ''Der dunkle Gott: Satanskult und Schwarze Messe'', München, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]],&lt;ref name="Cavendish"&gt;Cavendish, Richard. ''The Black Arts'', 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; both writing in the middle of the 1960s, while presenting detailed studies of source material, offer no new sources for a Black Mass, relying solely on material that was already known to Rhodes.
* When [[Anton Szandor LaVey]] published his ''[[Satanic Bible]]'' in 1969, he wrote that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The usual assumption is that the Satanic ceremony or service is always called a Black Mass. A Black Mass is ''not'' the magical ceremony practiced by Satanists. The Satanist would only employ the use of a Black Mass as a form of [[psychodrama]]. Furthermore, a Black Mass does not necessarily imply that the performers of such are Satanists. A Black Mass is essentially a [[parody]] on the religious service of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but can be loosely applied to a [[satire]] on any religious ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton. ''The Satanic Bible'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He went on in the ''[[The Satanic Rituals|Satanic Rituals]]'' (1972) to present it as the most representatively satanic ritual in the book.&lt;ref&gt;''"The Original Psychodrama&amp;nbsp;— Le Messe Noir"'', in LaVey, Anton.

== The Modern Black Mass ==
In spite of the huge amount of French literature discussing the Black Mass (Messe Noire) at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, no set of written instructions for performing one, from any purported group of Satanists, turned up in writing until the 1960s, and appeared not in France, but in the United States. As can be seen from these first ''Black Masses'' and ''Satanic Masses'' appearing in the U.S., the creators drew heavily from occult novelists such as [[Dennis Wheatley]] and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], and from non-fiction occult writers popular in the 1960s, such as Grillot de Givry, author of the popular illustrated book ''Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy'', and H. T. F. Rhodes, who provided a title for the satanic ritual in his 1954 book ''The Satanic Mass''.&lt;ref&gt;Note that throughout his book, Rhodes uses the term "Black Mass", and not "Satanic Mass". "The Satanic Mass" only appears as the title and nowhere else, perhaps because it is a less ambiguous and more suitable book title.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Sloane, the founder of an early Satanist group, the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]], speaks of Satanists performing the ritual of the "Satanic Mass" in a letter he wrote in 1968 (see the article on his group), and in 1968 and 1969 also appeared the first two recordings of Satanic rituals, both entitled the "Satanic Mass":

* The first was a 13-minute recording of a full-length "Satanic Mass" made by the U.S. band [[Coven (band)|Coven]]. Coven's Satanic Mass, part of their stage show beginning in 1967, was expanded and included on their 1969 record album ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coven, ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls]]'', LP (Dunwich Productions/Mercury Records, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; together with the full published text. On the album cover, it is stated that they spent a long time researching the material, and to their knowledge it was the first Black Mass published in any language. The result was eclectic, drawing chants and material from numerous sources, including two medieval French [[miracle plays]], ''[[Le Miracle de Théophile]]'' and ''[[Jean Bodel|Jeu de Saint Nicolas]]'', which both contain invocations to the Devil in an unknown language.&lt;ref&gt;discussed in: Grillot de Givry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fzVYG-bWNssC ''Witchcraft, magic &amp; alchemy''], Courier Dover Publications, 1971, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; These chants, along with other material on the album, could be found in books on witchcraft popular in the 60s, notably Grillot de Givry's ''Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy'' (originally published in France in 1929).&lt;ref&gt;English translation: Grillot de Givry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fzVYG-bWNssC ''Witchcraft, magic &amp; alchemy''], Courier Dover Publications, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of the English dialogue was taken verbatim from [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s 1960 occult novel, ''[[The Satanist (Wheatley novel)|The Satanist]]'', in which the female protagonist is initiated into a Satanic cult. Additionally, the recording, while using a couple of the Latin phrases the Church of Satan was already making popular, also added a substantial amount of church Latin, in the form of [[Gregorian chants]] sung by the band, to create the genuine effect of the Catholic Latin Mass being inverted and sung to Satan.
* The second was a record album of readings in Satanic ritual and philosophy by the [[Church of Satan]], called "[[The Satanic Mass]]",&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton, ''The Satanic Mass'', LP (Murgenstrumm Records, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; which contained material later to appear in their ''[[Satanic Bible]]'' (published in 1969). In spite of the title and a few phrases in Latin, this album did not deal with the traditional Black Mass.

Soon after Coven created their Satanic Mass recording, the Church of Satan began creating their own Black Masses, two of which are available to the public. The first, created for the Church of Satan by Wayne West in 1970, was entitled "Missa Solemnis" (named after the [[Solemn Mass|Missa Solemnis]] version of the Latin Mass; originally published only in pamphlet form, later published in Michael Aquino's history of ''The Church of Satan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aquino |first=Michael |title=The Church of Satan |url=http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/COS.pdf |year=2002 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712000522/http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/COS.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-12 |df= }}, Appendix 7.&lt;/ref&gt;), and the second, created by an unknown author, was entitled "Le Messe Noir" (published in [[Anton LaVey]]'s 1972 book ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]'').

All three of these newly created Black Masses (the one by Coven and the two by the Church of Satan) contain the Latin phrase "In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi" &lt;ref&gt;This phrase undoubtedly is related to almost exactly the same phrase appearing 30 years earlier in an inversion of the Latin Mass (a "Luciferian Mass") led by a former Catholic priest in Paris, which included the phrase "''In nomine Domini Dei nostri Satanae Luciferi Excelsi''". It was published as ''Messe Luciférienne'', in Pierre Geyraud, ''Les Petites Églises de Paris'', 1937 (Source here: [http://www.angelfire.com/az3/synagogasatanae/geyraud.htm Messe Luciférienne]).&lt;/ref&gt; (In the name of our God, Satan Lucifer of the Most High), as well as the phrases "Rege Satanas" and "Ave Satanas" (which, incidentally, are also the only three Latin phrases which appeared in the Church of Satan's 1968 recording, "The Satanic Mass"). Additionally, all three modify other Latin parts of the Roman Catholic Missal to make them into Satanic versions. The Church of Satan's two Black Masses also use the French text of the Black Mass in Huysmans' ''Là-Bas'' to a great extent. (West only uses the English translation, LaVey publishes also the original French). Thus, the Black Mass found in ''The Satanic Rituals'' is a combination of English, French, and Latin. Further, in keeping with the traditional description of the Black Mass, all three also require a consecrated Host taken from a Catholic church, as a central part of the ceremony.

A writer using the pseudonym "Aubrey Melech" published, in 1986, a Black Mass entirely in Latin, entitled "Missa Niger". (This Black Mass is available on the Internet). Aubrey Melech's Black Mass contains almost exactly the same original Latin phrases as the Black Mass published by LaVey in ''The Satanic Rituals''. The difference is that the amount of Latin has now more than doubled, so that the entire Black Mass is in Latin. Unlike Coven and Wayne West, LaVey and Melech don't give the source for the Latin material in their Black Mass, merely implying that they received it from someone else, without saying who.
{{Wikisourcelang|la|Missa Niger}}

=== The language of the Black Mass ===
The French sections that LaVey published were quotations from Huysmans's ''Là-bas''. The Latin of Melech and LaVey is based on the Roman Catholic [[Tridentine Mass|Latin Missal]], reworded so as to give it a Satanic meaning (e.g. the [[Roman Mass]] starts "''In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, introibo ad altare Dei''", while LaVey's version, printed in the ''[[The Satanic Rituals|Satanic Rituals]]'', starts "''In nomine magni dei nostri Satanas, introibo ad altare Domini Inferi''"). There is a small amount of copyist and grammatical errors. For example, "''dignum''" from the Mass, is once incorrectly spelled "''clignum''", in the printed ''[[The Satanic Rituals|Satanic Rituals]]''. Another example, also appearing once, is "''laefificat''" instead of "''laetificat''". One of the more obvious grammatical errors is "''ego vos benedictio''", "I bless you", which should have been "''ego vos benedico''". Another grammatical peculiarity is that, throughout his version of the Mass, LaVey does not [[declension|decline]] the name Satanas, as is typically done in Latin if the endings are used, but uses only the one form of the word regardless of the [[case (grammar)|case]].&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton. ''The Satanic Rituals'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Melech uses ''Satanus''. "Satanas" as a name for Satan appears in some examples of Latin texts popularly associated with satanism and witchcraft, such as the middle age [[pact with the Devil]] supposedly written by [[Urbain Grandier]]. Both Black Masses end with the Latin expression "[[Hail Satan#Cultural history|Ave, Satanas]]!" — Meaning either "Welcome, Satan!", or "Hail Satan!" (expressing the opposite sentiments of the similar statement made by Jesus to Satan in the [[Latin Vulgate]] Bible (Latin Vulgate, Matthew 4:10),&lt;ref&gt;''Biblia Sacra Vulgata'' (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, 1994), Matt. 4:10: ''Tunc dicit ei Iesus, "Vade Satanas! Scriptum est Dominum Deum tuum adorabis et illi soli servies."''&lt;/ref&gt; "Vade, Satanas!" - "Go away, Satan!").

The '''BrahmaKshatriya''', also known as [[Kshatriya]] or [[Khatri]], are a [[Hindu]] [[Caste system in India|caste]] residing in the [[Indian people|Indian]] [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Gujarat]].

== Origin ==

The BrahmaKshatriys are considered a subcaste of the Kshatriya [[Khatri]] caste.

Robert Vane Russell in his book The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 3, considers the [[Khatris]]  of Punjab and [[BrahmaKshatriyas]]  of Gujarat to be one and the same caste.
 
They have five endogamous groups based on territorial divisions. They are the Punjabi Brahma Kshatri( Narula ), Sorathia Brahma Kshatri, Ahmedabad Brahma Kshatri and Kutch Brahma Kshatri. The Brahma Kshatri have a further six divisions, the Brahma Kshatri proper, the Chudgor, Dakhani, Dasa, Natravala, and Panch. Only the Brahma Kshatri proper and Dakhani interdine and intermarry.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 266 to 271 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present Circumstances ==

The Brahma Kshatri are strictly endogamous, and practice clan exogamy. They originally consisted of nine clans, which over time expanded to over ninety six clans. The original nine clans were the Bosmia, [[Padia]], [[Jogi]], Jagad, Garach, Bhojani, Nirmal, Chhuncha, Varde, Bhoot , Kaku, Ashara,Kakkad,Jada.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 266 to 271 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

The BrahmaKshatriyas like all other subcastes of the [[Khatris]]  Worship Mata Hinglaj or Hingulamba as Kuladevi.  The BrahmaKshatriya caste is also known as real worrior. 

JAY MATAJI 

A considerable number of Brahma Kshatriya have migrated to [[East Africa]], USA, UK and the [[Persian Gulf]] states. The majority of the community are now skilled traders.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 266 to 271 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chinese Baptist Convention''' ([[Abbr]]: CBC; {{zh|t=中華基督教浸信會聯會|p=zhōnghuá jīdū jiào jìnxìn huì liánhuì|w=chung hua chi tu chiao chin hsin hui lien hui}}) is a cooperative association of Baptist churches in [[Taiwan]] and the territories administered by the [[Republic of China]].

== History ==

=== Background ===

Similar to the [[Baptist Convention of Hong Kong]] and the [[Macau Baptist Convention]], the CBC traces its origins from the original missionaries sent by the [[Triennial Convention]] to [[China]]. The Revd. [[John William Shuck]] and his wife, [[Henrietta Shuck]], established their work in [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ruled [[Macau]] in 1835 whereas Dr. and Mrs. [[William Dean (missionary)|William Dean]] began work at the same time among [[Teochew dialect|Chaozhou]] speaking Chinese in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="American Mission"&gt;Hong Kong American Baptist Mission: [http://www.abmhk.org.hk/briefhist.html Our Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623192223/http://www.abmhk.org.hk/briefhist.html |date=2008-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mission Story"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of Our Baptist Missionary Work |last=Bushnell |first=Lorilla E. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1909 |publisher=American Baptist Publication Society |location=Philadelphia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was relocated to [[Hong Kong]] in 1842 where both the Shucks and the Deans worked with the [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] and Chaozhou speaking Chinese respectively. They were joined by other missionaries, including [[Issachar Jacox Roberts]], who began mission work in Canton (present day [[Guangzhou]]) in 1844, becoming one of the first Western missionary to work outside the relative safety of the protected European factories and the Deans relocated their mission headquarters to [[Swatow]] (present day Shantou) in 1860.&lt;ref name="American Mission" /&gt;

By 1949, the [[American Southern Baptist Mission]] in China had 220 missionaries working in 392 congregations, 410 outreach points, serving a total of 123,000 Baptist Christians.&lt;ref name="ROC Civil Affairs"&gt;ROC Department of Civil Affairs: [http://www.moi.gov.tw/dca/religion01_04_03.asp 台灣地區宗教簡介 - 基督教 - 浸信會] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the work was located in the [[Province of China|provinces]] of [[Kwangtung]], [[Kwangsi]], [[Kiangsu]], [[Honan]], [[Ahnwei]], and [[Shantung]] and it included institutions like hospitals, schools, and colleges in [[Pingtu]], [[Longkow]], [[Kweilin]], [[Yangchow]], [[K'aifeng]], and a few other cities and towns.&lt;ref name="Lalu"&gt;Lalulalu.com: [http://www.lalulalu.com/viewthread.php?tid=598417 中華基督教浸信會聯會] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951, most foreign missionaries were expelled from mainland China with the establishment of the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]].

=== Work in Taiwan ===

In October 1936, a resolution was passed during the centenary celebrations of the Baptist mission in China to engage in the extension of work to the frontier regions, which then included Taiwan which was a part of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. With the [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] to China following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, plans were made to expand the mission to Taiwan. A visit was made by a Shanghai missionary, [[Lila Florence Watson]], in February 1948.

In 1948, the '''National Baptist Convention of China''' was established in [[Shanghai]] and [[Yang Mei Chai (missionary)|Yang Mei Chai]] (楊美齋) was sent to Taiwan to establish a frontier mission in June of the same year. Yang was also appointed the head of the Taiwan district of the national convention. [[Bertha Smith]] of the American Southern Baptist Mission in Shantung arrived in Taiwan on October 19, 1948 and the first church was inaugurated on December 26 of the same year.&lt;ref name="ROC Civil Affairs" /&gt;

=== Local ministry ===

In the 1950s, the CBC saw an influx of missionaries and refugees from the mainland. This led to the rapid growth of the church particularly in the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] language ministry with significant support from the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in the [[United States]]. The first [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] service was conducted in at the Amoy Street Baptist Church (廈門街浸信會). In February 1957, the first Taiwanese congregation was established as the Mu Yi Church (慕義堂).

Work among the [[Hakka people|Hakka]]s began in 1958 in [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]] and further work was planted in [[Pingtung City|Pingtung]]. Work began with the [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal peoples]] of Taiwan as early as 1951 in [[Liouguei, Kaohsiung]] with the establishment of the Liouguei Baptist Church (六龜浸信會). Work in languages apart from Mandarin was however generally slow due to the lack of standard materials and work among the aboriginal people was not significant until the first [[Amis people|Ami]] pastor graduated from the [[Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Taiwan Baptist History"&gt;Chinese Baptist Convention: [http://www.twbap.org.tw/history/ 從邊疆到福爾摩沙] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503091954/http://www.twbap.org.tw/history/ |date=2008-05-03 }} (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later developments ===

From the period of 1948 to 1954, a total of 11 churches and 22 outreach points had been established by Baptist missionaries and workers. On July 5, 1954, the '''Taiwan Baptist Association''' (台灣浸信會聯) was established. It was later renamed the '''Chinese Baptist Church, Taiwan Province Convention''' and the '''Chinese Baptist Church, Taiwan Convention''' before assuming its current name in 1972.&lt;ref name="Taiwan Baptist History" /&gt;

Similar to Baptist churches elsewhere, churches affiliated with the CBC are autonomous and self-governed and the CBC doesn't exercise any executive authority. The CBC's role is primarily in the coordination of work among the associated churches and the management of inter-church institutions.&lt;ref name="Lalu" /&gt;

== Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary ==

The seminary was established in 1952 for the training of national workers.&lt;ref name="Taiwan Baptist History" /&gt; Until recently the seminary had faced problems from the authorities as it was an unrecognized institution and had faced accusations of awarding fraudulent academic degrees in the past. In 2005, the [[Legislative Yuan]] passed a resolution to provide for the framework of recognition of religious academic institutions and seminaries allowing the seminary to initiate the procedure of gaining full recognition from the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary: [http://www.tbtsf.org.tw/FINAL%20REVISED%20English%20Web/MOE%20full%20version.pdf Why would TBTS Apply for Registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105231040/http://www.tbtsf.org.tw/FINAL%20REVISED%20English%20Web/MOE%20full%20version.pdf |date=2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliations ==

The CBC is a member of the [[Baptist World Alliance]] and the [[Asia Pacific Baptist Federation]].

[[Image:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Paradiso (Dante)#The Empyrean|''Divine Comedy''{{'}}s Empyrean]], illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

In ancient [[cosmology|cosmologies]], the '''Empyrean Heaven''', or simply the '''Empyrean''', was the place in the [[heavenly sphere|highest heaven]], which was supposed to be occupied by the element of [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (or [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] in [[Aristotle]]'s natural philosophy). The word derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''empyreus'', an adaptation of the [[Ancient Greek]] ἔμπυρος, ''empyrus'', meaning "in or on the [[fire]] (''pyr'')".

The Empyrean was thus used as a name for the [[firmament]], and in [[Christian literature]] for the dwelling-place of God, the blessed, celestial beings so divine they are made of pure light, and the source of light and creation. Notably, at the very end of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Paradiso_(Dante)#The_Empyrean|Paradiso]]'', Dante visits God in the Empyrean.

The word is used both as a noun and as an adjective, but ''empyreal'' is an alternate adjective form. The scientific words ''empyreuma'' and ''empyreumatic'', applied to the characteristic smell of the burning or charring of vegetable or animal matter, have the same Greek origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2603">The '''Fraternity of the Inner Light''' is a magical society and [[Western mystery tradition|Western Mystery School]] founded by [[Dion Fortune]] in 1924. It operates from London and accepts pupils.

==History==
In 1922, after a falling-out with [[Moina Mathers]]&lt;ref&gt;King, 1989, page 144&lt;/ref&gt; and with Moina's consent, Dion Fortune left the [[Alpha et Omega]] to form an offshoot organization.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Alan, ''The Magical Life of Dion Fortune'', Aquarian Press, 1991, {{ISBN|1-85538-051-X}}, p117,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Gareth; "Dion Fortune and the Inner Light", Thoth Publications, 2000, {{ISBN|1-870450-45-0}}, pp 138-139.&lt;/ref&gt; This indirectly brought new members to the Alpha et Omega.&lt;ref&gt;King, 1989, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; Fortune's group was later renamed "The Fraternity of the Inner Light", and was, later still, renamed "The Society of the Inner Light".

==Teachings==
Fortune gave her followers preliminary training by means of correspondence courses, on successful completion of which aspirants were [[Initiation|initiated]] into the so-called ''Lesser Mysteries'', then onto ''Greater Mysteries''.&lt;ref name="coffee"&gt;King, 1989, page 156&lt;/ref&gt; These lesser mysteries were roughly equivalent the Outer [[Order of the Golden Dawn]], and the greater mysteries were roughly equivalent to the old Inner Order of the Rosae Rubae et Aureae Crucis ("Ruby Rose and Golden Cross", or the RR et AC).&lt;ref name="coffee"/&gt;

During its early years, the Fraternity of the Inner Light used many unchanged versions of the Golden Dawn initiation rituals which, as [[Francis X. King|Francis King]] notes, had a "semi-amicable relationship" with the [[Stella Matutina]].&lt;ref name="cigs"&gt;King, 1989, page 157&lt;/ref&gt; However, alterations were introduced and eventually the ceremonies used bore no resemblance to those of the Golden Dawn, with the exception that they were constructed on the same principles.&lt;ref name="cigs"/&gt;

The name ''Fraternity....'' referred to the inner plane group, and the word ''Society....'' referred to the physical plane group and those members currently incarnated.   Thus the group considered 'Fraternity' to be the more senior than the 'Society'.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The law at all levels protects this right in full against [[Religious intolerance|abuse]], either by governmental or private actors. The government generally respects religious freedom in practice; however, it occasionally fails to enforce religious freedom laws when abuses occurred. There were some reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice; however, prominent societal leaders took positive steps to promote religious freedom.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108535.htm "Paraguay"]. ''[[International Religious Freedom Report]] 2008''.  [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (September 19, 2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Paraguay}}
The country has an area of 406,752 square kilometres and a population of 6.3 million. According to the 2002 national census, 89.6 percent of the population is [[Roman Catholic]], and 6.2 percent is [[evangelical Protestant]]. Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Judaism|Jews]] (Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), [[Mennonites]], [[Muslims]], and [[Baha'is]]. A 2006 survey indicates similar results; however, 84.7 percent of respondents consider themselves Catholic, a decrease from 2002.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Native-born citizens tend to be Catholic, while immigrants generally belong to other religious groups. The eastern department of [[Alto Paraná Department|Alto Parana]] has a large Muslim community due to substantial immigration from the Middle East, particularly [[Lebanon]]. A large Mennonite community flourishes in the western department of [[Boquerón Department|Boquerón]]. Members of other religious groups are concentrated in the largest cities, including [[Asunción]], [[Ciudad del Este]], and [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]]. Non-Catholic immigrant groups tend to have a higher per capita income than the primarily Catholic, native-born citizens. Membership in religious groups is high.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Legal/policy framework==
The Constitution protects Paraguayans' right to freedom of religion. It and other laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion and impose few legal restrictions on religious expression or speech. The Constitution and other laws also protect the right of individuals to choose, change, and freely practice their religion; provide legal protections covering discrimination and persecution; and offer remedies for the violation of religious freedom.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The Constitution recognizes the historical role of the [[Catholic Church]] (the dominant religion). Although the government is secular in name and practice, most government officials are Catholic, and Catholic clergy occasionally speak during official government events. There have been several senior officials who were Mennonites. Former President [[Fernando Lugo]] was a retired Catholic bishop, and a member of the [[Christian Democratic Party (Paraguay)|Christian Democratic Party]], a Catholic party.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The government observes [[Maundy Thursday|Maundy (Holy) Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], the [[Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], Virgin of [[Caacupé]] Day, and [[Christmas]] as national holidays.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The Constitution provides for [[conscientious objection]] to military service. The armed forces have an extensive Catholic [[chaplain]] program supported by the government. The Catholic Church considers this chaplaincy to be a diocese and appoints a bishop to oversee the program on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Although the Government does not place restrictions on religious publishing or other religious media, such publications are subject to libel law. The law does not prohibit, restrict, or punish the importation, possession, or distribution of religious literature, clothing, or symbols.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

All churches and religious organizations are required to register with the Ministry of Education and Culture. Registration includes completing required paperwork, obtaining certification as a nonprofit organization, passing financial and criminal background checks, and paying a small fee. The government imposes few controls on religious groups, and many remain unregistered, typically evangelical churches with few members. The government does not place restrictions on foreign missionaries; however, the process to obtain temporary or permanent residency is opaque and requires applicants, including missionaries, to pay fees in excess of $100 (400,000 guaraníes) per transaction and spend months or even years to obtain residency.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The government permits, but does not require religious instruction in public schools. Parents are permitted to [[homeschool]] or send their children to the school of their choice without sanction or restriction.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Restrictions on and abuses of religious freedom==

President Duarte and some of his supporters promoted intolerance toward the Catholic Church during the 2007-2008 presidential election campaign. In 2007 then-President Duarte made several discriminatory remarks against the Catholic clergy in an attempt to discredit candidate Fernando Lugo, a resigned Catholic bishop, who won the election.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to give permission for blood transfusions reported that authorities challenged their "right to bodily self-determination." In January 2007 police in [[Horqueta]], [[Concepción Department (Paraguay)|Concepción Department]], arrested Jehovah's Witness Pastor Juan Gill and four members of his congregation for refusing to authorize a blood transfusion for Gill's son, Magno Gill Bazan. In June 2007 a court found them innocent. In September 2007 police arrested Jehovah's Witnesses José Ortega and Asunción Bernarda Ortega Gaona for refusing to allow doctors to give their daughter blood transfusions. Doctors at the hospital administered the blood transfusion after obtaining a court order. Ten days after their arrest, the Ortegas were released from prison on bail; their case remained under investigation at the end of the period covered by this report.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

In May 2007 the [[Supreme Court of Paraguay|Supreme Court]] ruled that the government's [[eminent domain|expropriation]] in 2005 of approximately {{convert|319000|acre|km2}} of land in [[Puerto Casado]] owned by [[Sun Myung Moon|Reverend Sun Myung Moon's]] [[Unification Church]] was unconstitutional. In August 2007 the government and the Unification Church agreed to a donation of {{convert|74130|acre|km2}} for distribution to local farmers. Thereafter, the Government granted the Church access to its remaining land holdings, and the Church remains active in the country.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

There are no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the Paraguay.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The government generally takes steps to promote tolerance for religions or religious beliefs. On April 23, 2008, the government opened an investigation against [[anti-Semitic]] and pro-[[Nazi]] activist Ramon Dardo Casteluccio for threatening violence against members of a local human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO).&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Societal abuses and discrimination==

There were some reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice; however, prominent societal leaders took positive steps to promote religious freedom. The government investigated these cases but lacked adequate resources to resolve them.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages and symbols, including graffiti, appear sporadically. The government investigated but did not identify suspects. In July 2007 the newspaper [[ABC Color]] published an anti-Semitic article. Representatives of B'nai B'rith met with the publisher to express their concern.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

On November 9, 2007, then-presidential candidates Fernando Lugo and [[Lino Oviedo]] attended a memorial event honoring Jews persecuted and killed in 1938 by the Nazis on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] (Kristallnacht). The government permitted an interfaith [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] to host a memorial event on September 11, 2007, at the [[National Congress of Paraguay|National Congress]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2693">'''Fubao''' ({{zh|t=附寶}}), a woman from the {{ill|Youjiao Tribe|zh|有蟜氏}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Etudes chinoises: bulletin de l'Association française d'études chinoises|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kyuFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Fubao+Youjiao|year=1990|publisher=Association française d'études chinoises|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; was according to some [[Chinese mythology]] sources the mother-in-law of the inventor of silk, [[Leizu]]; mother of Huang Di the [[Yellow Emperor]] and of [[Yan Di]] the Flame Emperor; and, wife of [[Shaodian]]. However, the mythological genealogy varies. Fubao is viewed as ancestress to the [[Han people]] who form the majority of the population of [[China]].

==Daughter-in-law Leizu==
{{Main|Leizu}}

Fubao was mother-in-law to [[Leizu]], who was the inventor of [[sericulture]], the art of [[silk]] production, according to [[Chinese mythology]]. Silk and fabrics made from silk is one of the world's important textiles (Uschan 2014, 33). Silk is believed to have been produced since neolithic times in China. The "[[Silk Road]]" was named after the trade in silk across Eurasia.

==Husband==
{{Further|Shaodian}}
According to mythology, Fubao married [[Shaodian]], sometimes father of Huang Di.

==Son, Huang Di==
[[File:Ursa Major Łazy.jpg|thumb|Ursa Major, the Great Bear or Big Dipper]]
{{Main|Yellow Emperor}}

Fubao was the mother of Huang Di, also called the Yellow Emperor. According to [[Chinese mythology]], the birth was miraculous. Fubao is said to have seen a bolt of lightning circling around one of the stars of the Great Bear ([[Big Dipper]]). The light was very bright, and she got pregnant. Twenty-four months later Fubao was said to have given birth to Huang Di (Yang ''et al'' 2005, 138).

==Son, Yan Di==
{{Main|Yan Di}}

Fubao is also sometimes said to be mother or otherwise ancestral to Yandi ([http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Myth/personsyandi.html http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Myth/personsyandi.html]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Hermotimus of Clazomenae''' ({{lang-el|Ἑρμότιμος}}; c. 6th century BCE), called by [[Lucian]] a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]], was a philosopher who first proposed, before [[Anaxagoras]] (according to [[Aristotle]]) the idea of mind being fundamental in the cause of change.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''The Metaphysics'' 984b20, trans. by Hugh Lawson-Tancred. London, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposed that physical entities are static, while reason&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46634018|title=The basic works of Aristotle|last=Aristotle.|first=|date=2001|publisher=Modern Library|others=McKeon, Richard (Richard Peter), 1900-1985.|year=|isbn=0375757996|location=New York|pages=696 (Metaphysics, Book 1, Chapter 3)|oclc=46634018}}&lt;/ref&gt; causes the change. [[Sextus Empiricus]] places him with [[Hesiod]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Empedocles]], as belonging to the class of philosophers who held a dualistic theory of a material and an active principle being together the origin of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''adv. Math.'' ix., ''ad Phys.'' i. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]] relates a story about Hermotimus (which he does not appear to believe).&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''De Anima'' (''On the Soul'') (Chapter 44), trans. by Peter Holmes, D.D., Anti-Nicene Fathers Vol. 3, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this story, Hermotimus' soul would depart his body during sleep, as if on a trip. His wife betrayed the oddity and his enemies came and burned his body while he was asleep, his soul returning too late.  The people of Clazomenae erected a temple for Hermotimus, disallowing women because of his wife's betrayal. This story and others about Hermotimus are found in [[Pliny The Elder]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Hist. Nat.'' vii. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Encom. Musc.'' 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonius of Aphrodisias|Apollonius]], and [[Plutarch]].

[[Diogenes Laertius]] records a story that Pythagoras remembered his earlier lives, one being Hermotimus, who had validated his own claim to recall earlier lives by recognizing the decaying shield of Menelaus in the temple of Apollo at Branchidae.&lt;ref&gt;Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, Bk.8: Pythagoras&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hinduism Today''''' is a quarterly magazine published by the Himalayan Academy, a nonprofit educational institution, in [[Kapaʻa, Hawaiʻi]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondotimes.com/2/topics/5/society/97/1772 ''Hinduism Today'' ] mondotimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is distributed throughout the United States and internationally, currently in 60 nations. Founded by [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] in 1979, it is a public service of his monastic order to promote an understanding of the [[Hindu]] faith, culture, and traditions.

==History and topics==
[[Image:Gurudeva celebrating Hinduism Today.jpg|255px|thumb|left|1991: The founder, [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], celebrating the magazine with followers in [[Malaysia]].]][[File:2016_Hinduism_Today_face_page.jpg|140px|thumb|left|25 years later: January 2016 issue of ''Hinduism Today'']]''Hinduism Today'' was launched in 1979 by [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] (Gurudeva), published by his non-profit organization Himalayan Academy. Originally ''The New [[Saivite]] World'', the magazine was a small black-and-white periodical without a fixed publication schedule. The first issue appeared February 1979, with the goal of giving a voice to Gurudeva's worldwide fellowship in a way that was easy to read, simple to produce, mail and handle. The newsletter was to be a people-oriented paper, not so much devoted to philosophy or teaching since the Himalayan Academy was publishing books on Hindu-related [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] topics as early as 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/category.php?categoryid=160 ''Hinduism Today'', February 1979 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ''Hinduism Today'' has evolved to embrace everything of interest to a Hindu. In 1996, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami upgraded the newspaper ''Hinduism Today'' to a magazine. Recently, another milestonewas reached when the magazine became available online. The physical magazine now utilizes high-grade printing material, which is dipped in an attractive [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]. Photographs, drawings, and the magazine's aesthetically tuned interior design further add to the magazine's unique ability to convey the sensibilities of an entire culture through the print medium. Advertisements are designed and placed together at the end of each issue so as to avoid any hindrance to the reading experience. The over 275,000 readers of the magazine primarily reside in North America, Europe, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Africa and Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-zine-list.com/ezines/002/1742.shtml/ John Labovitz's eZine list] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040926233140/http://www.e-zine-list.com/ezines/002/1742.shtml/ |date=2004-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine presents through a Hindu perspective a wide range of topics, pressing both to society and the individual. These topics include, but are not limited to, the following: education, culture, cosmology, philosophy, ethics, sociology, film, music, spirituality, food, and travel. The profound, yet simple writings of the magazine's contributors offer a sensible and inspiring variety of topics encompassing the influence of every sphere of Hindu culture and religion. In addition to regular writers, contributors include the magazine’s readers as well as the collective wisdom of major thinkers of both the eastern and western traditions, as captured in the magazine's regularly included quotations section. Informative articles also offer profound insights into modern life, with topics such as [[yoga]], [[vegetarianism]], [[meditation]], [[nonviolence]], environmental ethics and family life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newpages.com/magazineguide/hinduism_today.htm/ Newspages.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ram Swarup]] (1920-1998), founder of the [[Voice of India]], explains: "''Hinduism Today'' is international in thought and spiritual sensibility. It presents Hinduism's new global face. It takes a strategic lead in the effort to overcome the problem of self-alienation and growing illiteracy among the Hindus of their heritage. In the eyes of many Hindus who are concerned with the problems of Hindu renaissance, ''Hinduism Today'' is easily the best magazine Hindus have."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Service to Hindu spirituality==
[[File:Media Studio.JPG|340px|thumb|right|Inside the Media Studio, the headquarters for ''Hinduism Today'' on the island of Kauai.]]Observes Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (Gurudeva): "''Hinduism Today'' was created to strengthen all the many diverse expressions of Hindu [[spirituality]], to give them a single, combined voice because everywhere else their voices were individualized. There was nothing that encompassed the whole Hindu experience around the world. Every religious order has a mission and instead of starting an eye-clinic or an orphanage, we created a global publication to advance the cause of Hindu [[Dharma]]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/wfchannel/index.php?wfc_cid=11 The Story of ''Hinduism Today''] by Lavina Melwani&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hindus living in India are surrounded by their culture and faith, ''Hinduism Today''{{'}}s mandate is to also reach the millions of Hindus who are trying to keep their faith alive in far-off places surrounded by different cultures. Specific goals of the magazine include:
*1. To foster Hindu solidarity as a unity in diversity among all sects and [[Hindu denominations|lineage]]s;
*2. To inform and inspire Hindus worldwide and people interested in Hinduism;
*3. To dispels myths, illusions and misinformation about Hinduism;
*4. To protect, preserve and promote the sacred [[Vedas]] and the Hindu religion;
*5. To nurture and monitor the ongoing spiritual Hindu renaissance;
*6. To publish a resource for Hindu leaders and educators who promote [[Sanatana Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/wfchannel/index.php?wfc_cid=18 Mission of ''Hinduism Today'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly objective magazine with such a diverse presentation of thought, its appeal extends far beyond the Hindu community, especially to those interested in its portrayal of Hindu culture, as well as the thought processes and sentiment used to convey this content.

The history of '''Hinduism in Madagascar''' began with the arrival of primarily [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] from the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of [[India]] as far back as 1870, at which time [[Madagascar]] was a [[French colony]] known as Malagache. These were predominantly [[Muslim]] ([[Khoja]]s, [[Ismaili]]s and Daoudi [[Dawoodi Bohra|Bohras]]), but a small number were [[Hindu]]s.&lt;ref name="id"&gt;[http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf NRI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206063957/http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The International Religious Freedom Report 2006 reported that there is a small Hindu presence in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71310.htm "International Religious Freedom Report 2006"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64rJD9LRN?url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71310.htm |date=2012-01-21 }} at the U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are business owners, or IT professionals who have lived in the country for generations. The majority speak [[Hindi]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], although some other Indian languages are spoken. Nowadays, younger generations speak at least three languages, including [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]].

The '''history of popular religion in Scotland''' includes all forms of religion outwith the formal theology and structures of institutional religion,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Santana, Gregory Erickson, ''Religion and Popular Culture: Rescripting the Sacred'' (London: McFarland, 2008), {{ISBN|0786435534}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; between the earliest times of human occupation of what is now Scotland and the present day. Very little is known about religion in Scotland before the arrival of Christianity. It is generally presumed to have resembled [[Celtic polytheism]] and there is evidence of the worship of spirits and wells. The Christianisation of Scotland was carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England, from the sixth century. Elements of paganism survived into the Christian era. Most early evidence of religious practice is heavily biased towards monastic life. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials, prayed for the dead and offered sermons. The church dictated in moral and legal matters and impinged on other elements of everyday life through its rules on fasting, diet, the slaughter of animals and rules on purity and ritual cleansing. One of the main features of Medieval Scotland was the [[Saint|Cult of Saints]], with shrines devoted to local and national figures, including [[St Andrew]], and the establishment of pilgrimage routes. Scots also played a major role in the [[Crusades]]. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in the late medieval period. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of [[mendicant]] orders of [[friar]]s in the later fifteenth century. As the doctrine of [[Purgatory]] gained importance the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within parish churches grew rapidly. New "international" cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the [[Virgin Mary]] began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century. Heresy, in the form of [[Lollard]]ry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early fifteenth century, but did not achieve a significant following.

The [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], carried out in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily influenced by [[Calvinism]], amounted to a revolution in religious practice. Sermons were now the focus of worship. The [[Witchcraft Act 1563]] made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes. There were major series of trials in [[North Berwick witch trials|1590–91]], [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597|1597]], 1628–31, [[Great Scottish witch hunt of 1649-50|1649–50]] and [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–1662|1661–62]]. Prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women and modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed across the whole period. Scottish Protestantism in the seventeenth century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the mid-seventeenth century Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to maintain until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century with the adoption of the [[Westminster Directory]] in 1643. The seventeenth century saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline, with kirk sessions able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. Kirk sessions also had an administrative burden in the system of poor relief and a major role in education. In the eighteenth century there were a series of reforms in church music. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted at most once a year, sometimes in outdoor ''holy fairs''.

[[Industrial Revolution in Scotland|Industrialisation]], urbanisation and the [[Disruption of 1843]] all undermined the tradition of parish schools. Attempts to supplement the parish system included [[Sunday schools]]. By the 1830s and 1840s these had widened to include [[mission school]]s, [[ragged schools]], [[Bible society|Bible societies]] and improvement classes. After the [[Great Disruption]] in 1843, the control of relief was removed from the church and given to parochial boards. The [[temperance movement]] was imported from America and by 1850 it had become a central theme in the missionary campaign to the working classes. Church attendance in all denominations declined after World War I. It increased in the 1950s as a result of revivalist preaching campaigns, particularly the 1955 tour by [[Billy Graham]], and returned to almost pre-war levels. From this point there was a steady decline that accelerated in the 1960s. Sectarianism became a serious problem in the twentieth century. This was most marked in Glasgow in the traditionally Roman Catholic team, [[Celtic FC|Celtic]], and the traditionally [[Protestant]] team, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Relations between Scotland's churches steadily improved during the second half of the twentieth century and there were several initiatives for cooperation, recognition and union. The foundation of the [[ecumenical]] [[Iona Community]] in 1938 led to a highly influential form of music, which was used across Britain and the US. The Dunblane consultations in 1961–69 resulted in the British "Hymn Explosion" of the 1960s, which produced multiple collections of new hymns. In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through immigration, including [[Islam in Scotland|Islam]], [[Hinduism in Scotland|Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. Other minority faiths include the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and small [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] groups. There are also various organisations which actively promote [[humanism]] and [[secularism]].

Very little is known about religion in Scotland before the arrival of Christianity. The lack of native written sources among the [[Picts]] means that it can only be judged from parallels elsewhere, occasional surviving archaeological evidence and hostile accounts of later Christian writers. It is generally presumed to have resembled [[Celtic polytheism]]. The names of more than two hundred Celtic deities have been noted, some of which, like [[Lugh]], [[The Dagda]] and [[The Morrigan]], come from later Irish mythology, whilst others, like [[Teutatis]], [[Taranis]] and [[Cernunnos]], come from evidence from [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Cunliffe, ''The Ancient Celts'' (Oxford, 1997), {{ISBN|0-14-025422-6}}, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtic pagans constructed temples and shrines to venerate these gods, something they did through [[votive offerings]] and performing sacrifices, possibly including [[human sacrifice]]. According to Greek and Roman accounts, in Gaul, Britain and Ireland, there was a priestly caste of "magico-religious specialists" known as the [[druids]], although very little is definitely known about them.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain'' (Yale University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-300-14485-7}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish legends about the origin of the Picts and stories from the life of [[Saint Ninian|St. Ninian]], associate the Picts with druids. The Picts are also associated in Christian writing with "demon" worship and one story concerning [[St. Columba]] has him exorcising a demon from a well in Pictland, suggesting that the worship of well spirits was a feature of Pictish paganism. Roman mentions of the worship of the Goddess [[Minerva]] at wells, and a Pictish stone associated with a well near [[Dunvegan Castle]] on Skye, have been taken to support this case.&lt;ref&gt;P. Dunbavin, ''Picts and Ancient Britons: an Exploration of Pictish Origins'' (Third Millennium Publishing, 1998), {{ISBN|0-9525029-1-7}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christianisation of Scotland was carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England from the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Fletcher, ''The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity'' (University of California Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0520218590}}, pp. 231–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement is traditionally associated with the figures of [[St Ninian]], [[St Kentigern]] and [[St Columba]].&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Fletcher, ''The Barbarian Conversion: from Paganism to Christianity'' (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0520218590}}, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. O. Clancy, "The real St Ninian", ''The Innes Review'', 52 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of paganism survived into the Christian era. Sacred wells and springs became venerated as sites of pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="Markus2001pp509-10"/&gt;

Most evidence of Christian practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From this can be seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the [[tuath]], ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. The church encouraged alms giving and hospitality. It also dictated in moral and legal matters, including marriage and inheritance. It also impinged on other elements of everyday life through its rules on fasting, diet, the slaughter of animals and rules on purity and ritual cleansing.&lt;ref name="Markus2001pp509-10"/&gt;

Early local churches were widespread, but since they were largely made of wood,&lt;ref name="Markus2001pp509-10"&gt;G. Markus, "Religious life: early medieval", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 509–10.&lt;/ref&gt; like that excavated at [[Whithorn]],&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Hume, ''Scotland's Best Churches'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2179-2}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including ''cill, both, eccles'' and ''annat'', but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials.&lt;ref name="Markus2001pp509-10" /&gt; Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings. Many of these were built by local lords for their tenants and followers, but often retaining a close relationship with monastic institutions.&lt;ref name="Maxwell2005pp22-3"&gt;I. Maxwell, ''A History of Scotland's Masonry Construction'' in P. Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), {{ISBN|1-904320-02-3}}, pp. 22–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viking raids began on monasteries like Iona and Lindisfarne began in the eighth century. [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]], [[Shetland Isles|Shetland]] and the Western Isles eventually fell to the Norsemen.&lt;ref&gt;W. E. Burns, ''A Brief History of Great Britain'' (Infobase Publishing, 2009), {{ISBN|0816077282}}, pp. 44–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is evidence of varying burial rites practised by Norse settlers in Scotland, such as grave goods found on [[Colonsay]] and [[Westray]], there is little that enables a confirmation that the Norse gods were venerated prior to the reintroduction of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jensen, "The Norse gods in Scotland" in A. Woolf, ed., ''Scandinavian Scotland – Twenty Years After'' (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-9512573-7-1}} pp. 52 and 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standing Stones of Stenness|Odin Stone]] has been used as evidence of [[Odin]]ic beliefs and practices but the derivation may well be from "oathing stone".&lt;ref&gt;J. Jensen, "The Norse gods in Scotland" in A. Woolf, ed., ''Scandinavian Scotland – Twenty Years After'' (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-9512573-7-1}} p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A few Scandinavian poetic references suggest that Orcadian audiences understood elements of the Norse [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], although this is hardly conclusive proof of active beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jensen, "The Norse gods in Scotland" in A. Woolf, ed., ''Scandinavian Scotland – Twenty Years After'' (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-9512573-7-1}} pp. 54 and 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it is likely that pagan practices existed in early Scandinavian Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jensen, "The Norse gods in Scotland" in A. Woolf, ed., ''Scandinavian Scotland – Twenty Years After'' (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-9512573-7-1}}, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brecbennoch.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Monymusk Reliquary]], or ''Brecbennoch'', said to house the bones of [[Columba]]]]
One of the main features of Medieval Scotland was the [[Saint|Cult of Saints]]. Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called [[Fillan|St Faelan]] and [[St. Colman (disambiguation)|St. Colman]], and saints [[Finbarr of Cork|Findbar]] and [[Finan]].&lt;ref&gt;G. W. S. Barrow, ''Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000–1306'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), {{ISBN|074860104X}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Columba remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation was endowed by [[William I of Scotland|William I]] (r. 1165–1214) at [[Arbroath Abbey]]. His relics, contained in the [[Monymusk Reliquary]], were handed over to the Abbot's care.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp52-3&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0333567617}}, pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional saints remained important to local identities. In Strathclyde the most important saint was St Kentigern, whose cult (under the pet name St. Mungo) became focused in Glasgow.&lt;ref name=Macquarrie2004p46&gt;A. Macquarrie, ''Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation'' (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7509-2977-4}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lothian it was [[St Cuthbert]], whose relics were carried across the Northumbria after Lindisfarne was sacked by the Vikings before being installed in Durham Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lawrence-Mathers, ''Manuscripts in Northumbria in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries'' (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2003), {{ISBN|0859917657}}, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; After his [[martyr]]dom around 1115, a cult emerged in Orkney, Shetland and northern Scotland around [[Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Antonsson, ''St. Magnús of Orkney: A Scandinavian Martyr-Cult in Context'' (Leiden: Brill, 2007), {{ISBN|9004155805}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important cults in Scotland, that of [[St Andrew]], was established on the east coast at Kilrymont by the Pictish kings as early as the eighth century.&lt;ref name=Barrow2005p11&gt;G. W. S. Barrow, ''Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 4th edn., 2005), {{ISBN|0748620222}}, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine, which from the twelfth century was said to have contained the relics of the saint brought to Scotland by [[Saint Regulus]],&lt;ref name=Webster1997p55&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0333567617}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; began to attract pilgrims from across Scotland, but also from England and further away. By the twelfth century the site at Kilrymont had become known simply as [[St. Andrews]] and it became increasingly associated with Scottish national identity and the royal family.&lt;ref name=Barrow2005p11/&gt; The site was renewed as a focus for devotion with the patronage of Queen Margaret,&lt;ref name=Lynch2005p11&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (Random House, 2011), {{ISBN|1446475638}}, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; who also became important after her canonisation in 1250 and after the ceremonial transfer of her remains to [[Dunfermline Abbey]], as one of the most revered national saints.&lt;ref name=Barrow2005p11/&gt;

Pilgrimage was undertaken to local, national and international shrines for personal devotion, as penance imposed by a priest, or to seek cures for illness or infirmity.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|052158602X}}, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Written sources and [[pilgrim badge]]s found in Scotland, of clay, jet and pewter, indicate journeys undertaken to Scottish shrines and further afield.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Stevenson, ''Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424–1513'' (Boydell Press, 2006), {{ISBN|1843831929}}, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scots also played a role in the [[Crusades]]. Crusading was preached by friars and special taxation was raised from the late twelfth century.&lt;ref name="Foggie2001pp80-2"&gt;J. Foggie, "Church institutions: medieval", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 80–2.&lt;/ref&gt; A contingent of Scots took part in the [[First Crusade]] (1096–99). Significant numbers of Scots participated in the Egyptian crusades and the [[seventh crusade|seventh]] (1248–54) and [[eighth crusade]]s (1870), led by [[Louis IX of France]]. A later commentator indicated that many of these were ordinary Scotsmen. Many died of disease, including the leaders and Louis himself. This was the last great crusade, although the ideal remained a major concern of late medieval kings, including Robert I and James IV.&lt;ref name="Macquarrie2001pp115-16"&gt;A. Macquarrie, "Crusades", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian calendar incorporated elements of existing practice and dominated the social life of communities. Fairs were held at [[Whitsun]] and [[Martinmas]], at which people traded, married, moved house and conducted other public business. The mid-Winter season of [[Yule]] involved two weeks of revels in which even the clergy joined in. The feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], focused on the body of Christ and held in June, grew in importance throughout the period. The central occasion of the Christian calendar was Easter. It was preceded by the 40 days of fasting of [[Lent]], during which preachers urged full confession, which took place in church aisles to by priests and friars. It cumulated in Easter Sunday, when most parishioners received their annual communion.&lt;ref name="Foggie2001pp80-2"/&gt;

Traditional Protestant historiography tended to stress the corruption and unpopularity of the late Medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated the ways in which it met the spiritual needs of different social groups.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp75-87"&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, pp. 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser, ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600–1540'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0521444616}}, pp. 349–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in this period, with many religious houses keeping smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. The rate of new monastic endowments from the nobility also declined in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp75-87"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrell2000p246&gt;Andrew D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|052158602X}}, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of [[mendicant]] orders of [[friar]]s in the later fifteenth century, who, unlike the older monastic orders, placed an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of [[Franciscan|Observant Friar]]s were organised as a Scottish [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] from 1467 and the older Franciscans and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp75-87"/&gt;

In most Scottish [[burgh]]s, in contrast to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church,&lt;ref name=Bawcutt&amp;Williams2006pp26-9/&gt; but as the doctrine of [[Purgatory]] gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed to speed the passage of souls to Heaven, grew rapidly.&lt;ref name=Barrell2000p254&gt;Andrew D. M.

Heresy, in the form of [[Lollard]]ry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early fifteenth century. Lollards were followers of [[John Wycliffe]] (c. 1330–84) and later [[Jan Hus]] (c. 1369–1415), who called for reform of the Church and rejected its doctrine on the [[Eucharist]]. Despite evidence of a number of burnings of heretics and limited popular support for its anti-sacramental elements, it probably remained a small movement.&lt;ref name=Barrell2000p2547&gt;Andrew D. M.

The Reformation, carried out in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily influenced by [[Calvinism]], amounted to a revolution in religious practice. It led to the abolition of [[Confession (religion)|auricular confession]], the wafer in mass, which was no longer seen as a "work", Latin in services, prayers to Mary and the Saints and the doctrine of Purgatory. The interiors of churches were transformed, with the removal of the [[High Altar]], [[altar rail]]s, [[rood screen]]s, [[choir stall]]s, side altars, statues and images of the saints. The colourful paintwork of the late Middle Ages was removed, with walls whitewashed to conceal murals. In place of all this were a plain table for communion, pews for the congregation, pulpits and lecterns for the sermons that were now the focus of worship. Printed sermons indicate that they could be as long as three hours. Until the 1590s most parishes were not served by a minister, but by readers, who could not preach or administer the sacraments. As a result, they might only hear a sermon once every two weeks and communion was usually administered once a year on Easter Sunday.&lt;ref name="Lynch2001pp512-13"&gt;M.

In the late Middle Ages there had been a handful of prosecutions for harm done through witchcraft, but the passing of the [[Witchcraft Act 1563]] made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Edwards, "Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart Scotland", in K.

Keay and J.

An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people, mostly from the [[Scottish Lowlands]], were tried for witchcraft in this period; a much higher rate than for neighbouring England. There were major series of trials in [[North Berwick witch trials|1590–91]], [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597|1597]], 1628–31, [[Great Scottish witch hunt of 1649-50|1649–50]] and [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–1662|1661–62]]. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women and the hunt has been seen as a means of controlling women. Modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed across the whole period.&lt;ref name=Brown2012p81&gt;S. J. Brown, "Religion and society to c. 1900", T. M. Devine and J.

Scottish Protestantism in the seventeenth century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the early part of the century the [[Geneva Bible|Genevan translation]] was commonly used.&lt;ref name=Henderson2011p1-4&gt;G. D.

It was in the mid-seventeenth century that Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to maintain until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century. The adoption of the [[Westminster Directory]] in 1643 meant that the Scots adopted the English [[Puritan]] dislike of set forms of worship. The recitation of [[the Creed]], [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Doxology]] were abandoned in favour of the lengthy sermon of the lecture. The centrality of the sermon meant that services tended to have a didactic and wordy in character. The only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms.&lt;ref name=Mirray2001pp513-4&gt;D. Murray, "Religious life: 1650–1750" in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 513–4.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late seventeenth century the common practice was [[lining out]], by which the [[precentor]] sang or read out each line and it was then repeated by the congregation.&lt;ref name=Spinks2009pp143-4/&gt;

The seventeenth century saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.&lt;ref name="A. Houston, I. D 2005 p. 30"&gt;R. A. Houston, I.

Statutes passed in [[School Establishment Act 1616|1616]], [[Education Act 1633|1633]], [[Education Act 1646|1646]] and [[Education Act 1696|1696]] established a parish school system, paid for by local heritors and administered by  ministers and local [[Presbyterian polity|presbyteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |title=School education prior to 1873 |journal=Scottish Archive Network |year=2010 |url=http://www.scan.org.uk/knowledgebase/topics/education_box1.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zt4xQMkX?url=http://www.scan.org.uk/knowledgebase/topics/education_box1.htm |archivedate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003&gt;R.

In the seventeenth century the pursuit of witchcraft was largely taken over by the kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society.&lt;ref name=Brown2012p81/&gt; The most intense [[The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–1662|witch hunt]] was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. There may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Levak, "The decline and end of Scottish witch-hunting", in J.

The kirk had considerable control over the lives of the people. It had a major role in the [[Old Scottish Poor Law|Poor Law]] and schools, which were administered through the parishes, and over the morals of the population, particularly over sexual offences such as adultery and fornication. A rebuke was necessary for moral offenders to "purge their scandal". This involved standing or sitting before the congregation for up to three Sundays and enduring a rant by the minister. There was sometimes a special repentance stool near the pulpit for this purpose. In a few places the subject was expected to wear [[sackcloth]]. From the 1770s private rebukes were increasingly administered by the [[kirk session]], particularly for men from the social elites, while until the 1820s the poor were almost always give a public rebuke.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Brown, ''Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0748608869}}, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the century the kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, attempted to suppress dancing and events like [[penny wedding]]s at which secular tunes were played.&lt;ref name=Porterp22&gt;J. Porter, "Introduction" in J. Porter, ed., ''Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century'' (Peter Lang, 2007), {{ISBN|3-03910-948-0}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gardiner,''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|978-0748620272}}, pp. 193–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that lining out should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing the psalms stanza by stanza.&lt;ref name=Spinks2009pp143-4&gt;B. D. Spinks, ''A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons'' (Scarecrow Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0810869810}}, pp. 143–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the  century these innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.&lt;ref name=Spinks2009p26&gt;B.

Among Episcopalians, [[Qualified Chapel]]s used the English ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. They installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches, singing in the liturgy as well as metrical psalms, while the non-jurors had to worship covertly and less elaborately. When the two branches united in the 1790s, the non-juring branch soon absorbed the musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Wilson, ''Anglican Chant and Chanting in England, Scotland, and America, 1660 to 1820'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), {{ISBN|0198164246}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic worship was deliberately low key, usually in the private houses of recursant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and [[Low Mass]] in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.&lt;ref&gt;N. Yates, ''Preaching, Word and Sacrament: Scottish Church Interiors 1560–1860'' (A&amp;C Black, 2009), {{ISBN|0567031411}}, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the [[Westminster Shorter Catechism|Shorter Catechism]]. They were then given [[communion tokens]] that entitled them to take part in the ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by [[Robert Burns]] in the poem ''Holy Fair''. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.&lt;ref name=Mirray2001pp513-4/&gt;

The rapid population expansion in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, particularly in the major urban centres, overtook the system of parishes on which the established church depended, leaving large numbers of "unchurched" workers, who were estranged from organised religion. The Kirk began to concern itself with providing churches in the new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Chaired by [[Thomas Chalmers]], by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription.&lt;ref name=Brooks1995pp17-18&gt;C. Brooks, "Introduction", in C.

Industrialisation, urbanisation and the [[Disruption of 1843]] all undermined the tradition of parish schools.&lt;ref name=Devine2001pp91-100&gt;T. M.

Originally begun in the 1780s by town councils, they were adopted by all religious denominations in the nineteenth century. By the 1830s and 1840s these had widened to include [[mission school]]s, [[ragged schools]], [[Bible society|Bible societies]] and improvement classes, open to members of all forms of Protestantism and particularly aimed at the growing urban working classes. By 1890 the Baptists had more Sunday schools than churches and were teaching over 10,000 children. The number would double by 1914.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p403"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of a rapidly growing industrial workforce meant that the [[Old Scottish Poor Law|Old Poor Law]], based on parish relief administered by the church, had broken down in the major urban centres. Thomas Chambers, who advocated self-help as a solution, lobbied forcibly for the exclusion of the able bodied from relief and that payment remained voluntary, but in periods of economic downturn genuine suffering was widespread. After the Disruption in 1845 the control of relief was removed from the church and given to parochial boards, but the level of relief remained inadequate for the scale of the problem.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp392-3"&gt;M.

The beginnings of the [[temperance movement]] can be traced to 1828–29 in [[Maryhill]] and [[Greenock]], when it was imported from America. By 1850 it had become a central theme in the missionary campaign to the working classes. A new wave of temperance societies included the [[Independent Order of Rechabites|United Order of Female Rechabites]] and the [[Independent Order of Good Templars]], which arrived from the US in 1869&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p403"/&gt; and within seven years had 1,100 branches in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Reasons that have been suggested for this change include the growing power of the nation state, socialism and scientific rationalism, which provided alternatives to the social and intellectual aspects of religion. By the 1920s roughly half the population had a relationship with one of the Christian denominations. This level was maintained until the 1940s when it dipped to 40 per cent during World War II, but it increased in the 1950s as a result of revivalist preaching campaigns, particularly the 1955 tour by [[Billy Graham]], and returned to almost pre-war levels. From this point there was a steady decline that accelerated in the 1960s. By the 1980s it was just over 30 per cent. The decline was not even geographically, socially, or in terms of denominations. It most affected urban areas and the traditional skilled working classes and educated middle classes, while participation stayed higher in the Catholic Church than the Protestant denominations.&lt;ref name=Finley2001pp516-17&gt;R. J. Finley, "Secularization" in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 516–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sectarianism became a serious problem in the twentieth century. In the interwar period religious and ethnic tensions between Protestants and Catholics were exacerbated by [[Great depression|economic depression]].&lt;ref name=Finley2001pp516-17/&gt; The Orange Order was still dominated by Irish Protestants and became a focus for Anti-Catholic feeling. It appealed strongly to working class Protestants and organised parades and carnivalesque commemorations of the [[Battle of the Boyne]] that veered into riotous behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;G. Walker, "The religious factor" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0191624330}}, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions were heightened by the leaders of the Free Church and Church of Scotland and later the reunified church, who orchestrated a racist campaign against the Catholic Irish in Scotland. Key figures leading the campaign were [[George Malcolm Thomason (Scottish politician)|George Malcolm Thomson]] and [[Andrew Dewar Gibb]]. This focused on the threat to the "Scottish race" based on spurious statistics that continued to have influence despite being discredited by official figures in the early 1930s. This created a climate of intolerance that led to calls for jobs to be preserved for Protestants.&lt;ref name=Finley2001pp516-17/&gt; After the Second World War the Church became increasingly liberal in attitude and moved away from hostile attitudes. Sectarian attitudes continued to manifest themselves in [[Soccer|football]] rivalries between Protestant and Catholic supporters. This was most marked in Glasgow in the traditionally Roman Catholic team, [[Celtic FC|Celtic]], and the traditionally [[Protestant]] team, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Celtic employed Protestant players and managers, but Rangers have had a tradition of not recruiting Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;C.

At the same time there were moves towards creating links between the various denominations. The Scottish Council of Churches was formed as an ecumenical body in 1924.&lt;ref name="wcc2006.info"&gt;B. Talbot, [http://wcc2006.info/fileadmin/files/edinburgh2010/files/pdf/Talbot_Baptists.pdf 1 "Baptists and other Christian Churches in the first half of the Twentieth Century"] (2009), retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century the Catholic Church in Scotland formalised the use of hymns, with the publication of ''The Book of Tunes and Hymns'' (1913), the Scottish equivalent of the ''[[Westminster Hymnal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Muir, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=odKhAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT170&amp;dq ''Roman Catholic Church Music in England, 1791–1914: A Handmaid of the Liturgy?''] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2013), {{ISBN|1409493830}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of the [[ecumenical]] [[Iona Community]] in 1938, on the island of Iona off the coast of Scotland, led to a highly influential form of music, which was used across Britain and the US. Leading musical figure [[John L. Bell|John Bell]] (b. 1949) adapted folk tunes or created tunes in a folk style to fit lyrics that often emerged from the spiritual experience of the community.&lt;ref&gt;D. W.

Relations between Scotland's churches steadily improved during the second half of the twentieth century and there were several initiatives for cooperation, recognition and union. The Scottish Council of Churches was formed as an ecumenical body in 1924.&lt;ref name="wcc2006.info"/&gt; Proposals in 1957 for union with the Church of England were rejected over the issue of bishops and were severely attacked in the Scottish press. The Scottish Episcopal church opened the communion table up to all baptised and communicant members of all the [[trinitarian]] churches and church canons were altered to allow the interchangeability of ministers within specific local ecumenical partnerships.&lt;ref name=Markhametal2013/&gt; The Dunblane consultations, informal meetings at the ecumenical Scottish Church House in Dunblane in 1961–69, attempted to produce modern hymns that retained theological integrity. They resulted in the British "Hymn Explosion" of the 1960s, which produced multiple collections of new hymns.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Music, ''Christian Hymnody in Twentieth-Century Britain and America: an Annotated Bibliography'' (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001), {{ISBN|0313309035}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Scottish Churches' Council was dissolved and replaced by [[Action of Churches Together in Scotland]] (ACTS), which attempted to bring churches together to set up ecumenical teams in the areas of prisons, hospitals, higher education and social ministries and inner city projects.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Lodwick, ''Remembering the Future: The Challenge of the Churches in Europe'' (Friendship Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0377002909}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the twentieth century the Scottish Churches Initiative for Union (SCIFU), between the Episcopal Church, the Church of Scotland, the Methodist Church and the United Reformed Church, put forward an initiative whereby there would have been mutual recognition of all ordinations and that subsequent ordinations would have satisfied episcopal requirements, but this was rejected by the General Assembly in 2003.&lt;ref name=Markhametal2013&gt;Ian S. Markham, J. Barney Hawkins, IV, Justyn Terry, Leslie Nuñez Steffensen, eds, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rbwKNhBueasC&amp;pg=PT516&amp;dq ''The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to the Anglican Communion''] (Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013), {{ISBN|1118320867}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in religious affiliation continued in the early twenty-first century. In the 2001 census, 27.5 per cent who stated that they had no religion (which compares with 15.5 per cent in the UK overall) and 5.5 per cent did not state a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |title=Analysis of Religion in the 2001 Census |journal=The Scottish Government |date=17 May 2006 |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53570 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zFDvPpbp?url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53570 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |title=Religious Populations |journal=Office for National Statistics |date=11 October 2004 |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53570 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zFDlspeL?url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=954 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 census roughly 54 per cent of the population identified with a form of Christianity and 36.7 per cent stated they had no religion.&lt;ref name="2011census"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/censusresults/release2a/scotland/KS209SCb.pdf |title=Scotland's Census 2011&amp;nbsp;– Table KS209SCb |publisher=scotlandscensus.gov.uk |accessdate=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest that those not identifying with a denomination or who see themselves as non-religious may be much higher at between 42 and 56 per cent, depending on the form of question asked.&lt;ref&gt;J.

'''Joaquim Alberto Chissano''' (born 22 October 1939) is a politician who served as the second [[Heads of state of Mozambique|President of Mozambique]], from 1986 to 2005. He is credited with transforming the war-torn country of Mozambique into one of the most successful African democracies.&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; After his presidency, Chissano became an elder statesman, envoy and diplomat for both his home country and the United Nations. Chissano also served as [[Chairperson of the African Union]] from 2003 to 2004.

==Early life==
[[File:Joaquim Chissano (1972).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chissano in 1972]]
Joaquim Chissano was born in the remote village of Malehice, [[Chibuto|Chibuto district]], [[Gaza Province]] of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] of Mozambique (then called [[Portuguese East Africa]]). Chissano was the first [[black people|black]] student to attend the only high school in the colony, [[Liceum#Portugal|Liceu]] [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] in Lourenço Marques (present-day [[Maputo]]).&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; After leaving secondary school, he went to Portugal to study medicine&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; at the [[University of Lisbon#Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  However, his political leanings caused him problems and he moved to France where he continued his studies at the [[University of Poitiers]]. In 1962, he went to [[Tanzania]] where he participated on the political movement that resulted in the foundation of the Mozambique Liberation Front ([[FRELIMO]]) and a year later he abandoned his studies to move to [[Tanzania]] in orded to serve on the fight for the independence of [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt;

==Career==
Chissano became "one of the founding members" of the Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo), which demanded autonomy from [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; Later, Chissano played a fundamental role in the negotiation of the [[Lusaka Accord]] of 1974, which paved the way for the country's independence in 1975.&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; The new President of Mozambique, [[Samora Machel]], appointed him as [[foreign minister|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt;

===President of Mozambique===
Chissano succeeded to the presidency and became Frelimo party leader in 1986 when Samora Machel's presidential aircraft crashed in mountainous terrain in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite book|last=Unknown author|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.|year=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 air disaster]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chissano ended the [[Mozambican Civil War]] in 1992 by negotiating a [[Rome General Peace Accords|peace treaty]] with the rebel forces that "promised no prosecutions or punishments" and gave them 50% of the positions in the Mozambican army.&lt;ref name="Pych Today"&gt;Taylor, Steve (10 December 2012) [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/out-the-darkness/201212/can-meditation-change-the-world Can Meditation Change the World? The amazing story of the 'meditating president] Psychology Today, accessed 31 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Renamo]] rebels later established their own political party. 

In 1992, Chissano learned the [[Transcendental Meditation technique]] and introduced it to other government officials and their families.&lt;ref name="Keller NYT"/&gt; Two years later, Chissano and his generals ordered all police and military to "meditate twice a day for 20 minutes."&lt;ref name=Astill/&gt; In addition, 16,000 soldiers and 30,000 civilians were taught Transcendental Meditation and its advanced technique of [[Yogic Flying]].

[[File:LulaChissano.jpg|thumb|Chissano meets the [[President of Brazil]], [[Lula da Silva]] in 2004.]]
Chissanno was reelected to the presidency in 1994 and again in 1999, when he defeated the former rebel leader, [[Afonso Dhlakama]].&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; After winning re-election Chissano's priority became poverty eradication but his efforts were complicated by a [[2000 Mozambique flood|severe flood in 2000]].&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; However, Chissano had a fundamental role in convincing the [[G8]] to write off £22 billion of Mozambique's debt in 2005.&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; Chissano chose not to run for a third term in the elections of 2004, although the constitution would have allowed him to do so.&lt;ref name="Pych Today"/&gt; During Chissano's presidency, almost 3 million people, about 15% of the country's citizens, were removed from "extreme poverty"&lt;ref name="Pych Today"/&gt; and the country achieved an economic growth rate of eight percent.&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt; In addition, child mortality rates for children under age five decreased by 35% and there was a 65% increase in primary school attendance.&lt;ref name="Pych Today"/&gt;

===Post presidency===

Since leaving the presidency Chissano has assumed the role of elder statesman and has campaigned for peace through his work as an envoy and peace negotiator for the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Pych Today"/&gt; Chissano served as [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson of the]] [[African Union]] from July 2003 to July 2004. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}} On 4 December 2006, the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] appointed Chissano the [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General]] to Northern Uganda and [[Southern Sudan]], to resolve the conflict with the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA).  On Chissano's 68th birthday in 2007, he was awarded the inaugural [[USD|$5 million]] [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation#Prize for Achievement in African Leadership|Prize for Achievement in African Leadership]] awarded by the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Pych Today"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org|title=2018 Ibrahim Governance Weekend - Mo Ibrahim Foundation|website=Mo Ibrahim Foundation|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7056159.stm|title=Mozambique ex-leader wins prize|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=22 October 2007|accessdate=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chissano was absent from the award ceremony because he was still working on his United Nations mission in southern Sudan.&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Soares|first=Claire|title=Joaquim Chissano: Democrat among the despots|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/joaquim-chissano-democrat-among-the-despots-397608.html|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the award's judges "Mr Chissano's decision not to seek a third presidential term reinforced Mozambique's democratic maturity and demonstrated that institutions and the democratic process were more important than the person".&lt;ref name="Independent 2007"/&gt;

In 2010, Chissano wrote an article for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' about [[water scarcity in Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joaquim-chissano/world-water-day_b_508348.html "For Africa, Water Is Life"], 22 March 2010, ''Huffington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Chissano is a member of the [[Fondation Chirac]]'s honour committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/foundation/honour-committee/|title=Honor Committee|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an independent non-executive director at [[Harmony Gold Mining]], a South African underground and surface gold mining company,&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.forbes.com/profile/joaquim-chissano/39418 Joaquim Chissano on Forbes], ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an Eminent Member of the [[Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[Inuit mythology]], '''Ka-Ha-Si''' was a lazy Inuit boy who was shunned by his tribe for his constant sleeping.  In a [[dream]], a [[loon]] spoke to him and said he had to save his tribe from a [[famine]] because the hunters had been unable to find game.  Ka-Ha-Si tricked a group of [[walrus]]es into killing each other, but his fame for saving the tribe quickly evaporated.  And he was once again teased for his laziness.  The same dream recurred and Ka-Ha-Si fought a giant the next day, who had been beating all the men of his tribe in wrestling matches.  Ka-Ha-Si ended up becoming a wise and well-respected [[shaman]].

This has become more difficult by the people's encounter with the modernity of [[Israel]], where most of the Ethiopian Jewish people now live.&lt;ref&gt;Shai Afsai, “Past in the Present: An inside look at Sigd — the holiday of Ethiopian Jewry — and the struggle to secure its survival”, ''AMI Magazine'', December 5, 2012, pp. 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The high priest ({{lang|gez|ሊቀ ካሀንት}} ''liqa kahən'', plural {{lang|gez|ሊቃነ ካህናት}} ''liqanä kahhənat'') is the leader of the priests in a certain area.

An aspiring kahen must spend time studying as a [[debtera]] before being ordained. As a debtera, he will be closer to the laypeople and serve as an intermediary between them and the clergy.  Upon becoming a kahen, he will no longer perform the services of a debtera, though he may take them up again if he gives up his position or is deposed.&lt;ref name="Greenfield"&gt;Isaac Greenfield, "The Debtera and the education among Ethiopian Jewry until the arrival of Dr. Faitlovitch" in Menachem Waldman (ed.), ''Studies in the History of Ethiopian Jews'', Habermann Institute for Literary Research, 2011, pp. 109–135 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''qäsis'' ({{lang-gez|ቀሲሰ}}, {{lang-am|ቀሰ}} ''qəs''; {{lang-ti|ቀሺ}} ''qäši''),&lt;ref&gt;plural, Ge'ez: ''qesawast'', Tigrinya: ''qesawasti'', Amharic: ''qesoch''&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to married priest in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]es, is a synonym for kahen, an unmarried priest, among the Beta Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Fritsch, "Qäsis" in Siegbert Uhlig (ed.), ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: O-X'', Harrassowitz, 2010, {{ISBN|3447062460}}, pp. 262-264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenfield" /&gt; With [[Aliyah from Ethiopia|the aliyah of Beta Israel]] to Israel the Amharic "qəs" [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraized]] was translated as ''kes'' ({{lang-he|קס}} or {{lang|he|קייס}}, plural {{lang|he|קסים}}  or {{lang|he|קייסים}} ''kesim'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1336">'''Kalonymus Haberkasten''' was a [[rabbi]] and [[Talmudist]] in sixteenth century [[Poland]]. He is well known as the [[rosh yeshiva]] of many great rabbis including Rabbi [[Solomon Luria]], who married his daughter Lipka.

Haberkasten was rosh yeshiva in [[Lviv]], and was later the first rabbi of the city of [[Ostroh]], [[Volhynia]]. He left Ostroh to assume the position of rosh yeshiva in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and Luria succeeded him in Ostroh. Haberkasten then went to [[Eretz Yisroel]], in about 1560.

Haberkasten was also a [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]]; and he is known to have made the acquaintance of the great Kabbalists in the Holy Land, including Rabbi [[Chaim Vital]].

'''''Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā''''' (in both [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]]) is generally translated as [[compassion]].&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the Sanskrit word, see Monier-Williams (1899), p. 255, entry for "karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā" (retrieved at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0255-karaTa.pdf), where the noun form of the word is defined as "pity, compassion". For the Pali word, see Rhys, Davids &amp;amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 197, entry for "Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā" (retrieved at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:356.pali{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), where it is defined as "pity, compassion".  In general, contemporary scholars, translators and interpreters have consistently translated the word as "compassion," not "pity."  This can be seen, for instance, in (listed chronologically) [[A. K. Warder|Warder]] (1970/2004, p. 95), [[Nanamoli Bhikkhu|Ñāṇamoli]] (Buddhaghosa &amp; Ñāṇamoli, 1975/1991, [[Visuddhimagga|Vsm.]] IX.77ff., pp. 306ff.), [[Hammalawa Saddhatissa|Saddhatissa]] (1985/1994, p. 3, [[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 3.39), [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Thanissaro]] (1994, [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65), [[Sharon Salzberg|Salzberg]] (1995, pp. 102ff.), [[Rupert Gethin|Gethin]] (1998, p. 187), and [[Bhikkhu Bodhi|Bodhi]] (2000, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 41.7, p. 1325).&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the spiritual path of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

==Buddhism==
Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is important in all schools of Buddhism.  For [[Theravāda]] Buddhists, dwelling in karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is a means for attaining a happy present life and heavenly rebirth.  For [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhists, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is a co-requisite for becoming a [[Bodhisattva]].

===Theravada Buddhism===
In Theravāda Buddhism, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is one of the four "divine abodes" (''[[Brahmavihara|brahmavihāra]]''), along with loving kindness ([[Pāli]]: ''[[mettā]]''), sympathetic joy (''[[mudita]]'') and equanimity (''[[upekkha]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp.186-187; and, Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, [https://archive.is/20120711002204/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:356.pali ''op. cit.'']&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Pali canon]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] recommends cultivating these four virtuous mental states to both [[householder (Buddhism)|householders]] and [[bhikkhu|monastics]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in the ''Kālāmā Sutta'' ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65), the Buddha speaks of all Noble Disciples (''ariya-[[savaka]]'') developing the brahmaviharas  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html (Thanissaro, 1994).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181109/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html |date=2011-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When one develops these four states, the Buddha counsels radiating them in all directions, as in the following stock canonical phrase regarding karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā:
{{quote|He keeps pervading the first direction—as well as the second direction, the third, and the fourth—with an awareness imbued with compassion. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with compassion: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.&lt;ref&gt;''Kālāmā Sutta'' ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65), trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html Thanissaro (1994).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181109/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html |date=2011-10-06 }} The "four directions" refer to east, south, west and north.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Such a practice purifies one's mind, avoids evil-induced consequences, leads to happiness in one's present life and, if there is a future [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], it will be in a [[Buddhist cosmology|heavenly realm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.65 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html (Thanissaro, 1994).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181109/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html |date=2011-10-06 }}  In regards to in which heavenly realm a frequent karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā dweller will be reborn, [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.125 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html (Thanissaro, 2006)] identifies it as the realm of radiant (''abhassara'') devas, whose lifespans last two eons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] distinguish between karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā and [[mettā]] in the following complementary manner:  Karuna is the desire to remove harm and suffering (''ahita-[[dukkha]]-apanaya-kāmatā'') from others; while mettā is the desire to bring about the well-being and happiness (''hita-[[sukha]]-upanaya-kāmatā'') of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sutta Nipata|Sn]]-[[Atthakatha|A]] 128 (cited by Rhys Davids &amp;amp; Stede, 1921–25, ''op. cit.''); see also, [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm BDEA &amp; BuddhaNet (n.d.).]  Similarly, the post-canonical [[Visuddhimagga]], chapter IX, vv. 105-109, provides further elucidation, such as with a metaphor describing ''mettā'' as a mother's wish for her (healthy) child to grow up and ''karuṇā'' as a mother's wish for her sick child to get well (Buddhaghosa &amp; Nanamoli, 1975/99, pp. 313-4).&lt;/ref&gt;
The "far enemy" of karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is [[cruelty]], a mind-state in obvious opposition. The "near enemy" (quality which superficially resembles karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it), is  (sentimental) [[pity]]: here too one wants to remove suffering, but for a partly selfish (attached) reason hence not the pure motivation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/PathofPurification2011.pdf Buddhagosha, 'Vishudimagga'] Section 2.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/dhamma-lists/] &lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}
In the Pali Canon, buddhas are also described as choosing to teach "out of compassion for beings."&lt;ref&gt;In Pali, ''sattesu ... kāruññataṃ paṭicca'', found in [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 3.6 (regarding [[Vipassī Buddha]]), [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 26.21 and SN 6.1 (see, e.g., Bodhi, 2000, pp. 233, 430, ''n''. 362; and Thanissaro, 1997).  It is worthwhile noting as well that several other references in the Pali Canon to the Buddha's acting out of "compassion" are not related directly to ''karuṇā'' but to the synonymous ''anukampā'' (which is also defined as "mercy" in Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921-25, p. 34).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana Buddhism===
In Mahāyāna Buddhism, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is one of the two qualities, along with enlightened wisdom ([[Sanskrit]]: ''[[prajña]]''), to be cultivated on the [[bodhisattva]] path.  According to scholar [[Rupert Gethin]], this elevation of karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā to the status of [[prajña]] is one of the distinguishing factors between the Theravāda [[arahant]] ideal and the Mahāyāna bodhisattva ideal:
{{quote|For the Mahāyāna ... the path to arhatship appears tainted with a residual selfishness since it lacks the motivation of the great compassion (''mahākaru{{IAST|ṇ}}ā'') of the bodhisattva, and ultimately the only legitimate way of Buddhist practice is the bodhisattva path.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1999), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the Mahāyāna world, [[Avalokiteśvara]] (Sanskrit; Chinese: [[Guan Yin]]; Japanese: [[Kannon]]; Tibetan: Chenrezig) is a bodhisattva who embodies karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā.

In the Intermediate section of the ''Stages of Meditation'' by [[Kamalaśīla]], he writes:
{{quote|Moved by compassion[karunā], Bodhisattvas take the vow to liberate all sentient beings. Then by overcoming their self-centered outlook, they engage eagerly and continuously in the very difficult practices of accumulating merit and insight. Having entered into this practice, they will certainly complete the collection of merit and insight. Accomplishing the accumulation of merit and insight is like having omniscience itself in the palm of your hand. Therefore, since compassion is the only root of omniscience, you should become familiar with this practice from the very beginning."&lt;ref&gt;''Stages of Meditation'' by H.H The Dalai Lama, Root Text by Kamalashila. Snow Lion Publications. Page 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], one of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the ''[[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]]'' by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled ''Meditative Concentration'', Shantideva describes meditation on Karunā as thus:

{{quote|Strive at first to meditate upon the sameness of yourself and others. In joy and sorrow all are equal; Thus be guardian of all, as of yourself. The hand and other limbs are many and distinct, But all are one--the body to kept and guarded. Likewise, different beings, in their joys and sorrows, are, like me, all one in wanting happiness. This pain of mine does not afflict or cause discomfort to another's body, and yet this pain is hard for me to bear because I cling and take it for my own. And other beings' pain I do not feel, and yet, because I take them for myself, their suffering is mine and therefore hard to bear. And therefore I'll dispel the pain of others, for it is simply pain, just like my own.  And others I will aid and benefit, for they are living beings, like my body. Since I and other beings both, in wanting happiness, are equal and alike, what difference is there to distinguish us, that I should strive to have my bliss alone?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of the Bodhisattva'' by Shantideva.  Shambhala Publications.  Page 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Jainism==
Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is associated with the Jain practice of compassion.  For instance, karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is one of the four reflections of universal friendship &amp;mdash; along with amity (Sanskrit: ''[[Mettā|maitri]]''), appreciation (''pramoda'') and equanimity (''madhyastha'')—used to stop (''[[samvara]]'') the influx of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/9tattva.htm Shah (n.d.).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605003634/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/9tattva.htm |date=2009-06-05 }}  Regarding ''samvara'', see [[Karma_in_Jainism#Release_from_karmas|"Release from karmas"]]. From a comparative religion perspective, cf. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]]; for instance, ''maitri'' is often identified as a Sanskrit correlate of the Pali ''mettā'' (Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921-5, p. 540, entry for "Mettā," retrieved at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:177.pali{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
Karu{{IAST|ṇ}}ā is a common first name throughout [[India]], used for both genders.

Lithuanian "karūna" means "crown", possible relation of meaning of qualities of crown owners.

Other common names include '''throw-wort''', '''lion's ear''', and '''lion's tail'''. Lion's tail also being a common name for ''[[Leonotis leonurus]]'', and lion's ear, a common name for ''[[Leonotis nepetifolia]]''. Originally from [[Central Asia]] and southeastern Europe, it is now found worldwide, spread largely due to its use as a [[herbalism|herbal remedy]].

==Description==
''Leonurus cardiaca'' has a squarish stem which is clad in short hairs and is often purplish, especially near the nodes. The [[opposite leaves]] have serrated margins and are palmately lobed with long [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]; basal leaves are wedge shaped with three points while the upper leaves have five. They are slightly hairy above and greyish beneath. Flowers appear in leaf axils on the upper part of the plant and have three-lobed bracts. The [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] of each flower is bell-shaped and has five lobes. The [[corolla (flower)|corolla]] is irregular, {{convert|8|to|12|mm|1|abbr=on}} long, fused, long-tubed with two lips. The upper lip is convex and covered with white hairs and the lower lip is three-lobed and downward-curving and spotted with red. The flowers are pink to lilac in colour often with furry lower lips. There are four stamens, two short and two longer, and the fruit is a four-chambered [[schizocarp]]. The plant grows to about {{convert|60|to|100|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height and blooms during July and August.&lt;ref name=NatureGate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/kukkakasvit/motherwort |title=Motherwort: ''Leonurus cardiaca'' |publisher=NatureGate |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
Motherwort is probably native to the southeastern part of Europe and central Asia where it has been cultivated since ancient times. Its natural habitat is beside roadsides, in vacant fields, waste ground, rubbish dumps and other disturbed areas. This plant prefers well drained soil and a partly shady location. Introduced to North America as a [[Forage (honey bee)|bee foraging plant]] and to attract [[bumble bee]]s, this perennial herb is now considered [[invasive species|invasive]]. It is hardy in [http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ USDA climate zones] 4–8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=LECA2  Leonurus cardiaca L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6660">'''Lestovka''' ({{lang-ru|лeстовка}}) is a special type of [[prayer rope]] made of leather, once in general use in old Russia, and is still used by Russian [[Old Believers]] today, such as the [[Russian Orthodox Oldritualist Church]], [[Pomorian Old-Orthodox Church]] and [[Edinoverie|edinoverians]].

[[Image:Поморская_лестовка.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A lestovka; the ''lapostki'' are decorated with little beads]]

[[Image:lestovka.jpg|thumb|250px|Sketch of a lestovka made by a Russian ethnographer.]]

==Form and symbolism==
The lestovka is traditionally constructed of leather, with "steps" made by looping leather around small twig sections. It has a total of 109 "steps"&amp;nbsp;– small loops or knots, unevenly grouped. Lestovkas produced today are often made of vinyl or PVC, and the twig sections are today often replaced with rolls of paper, rubber or even plastic. Most lestovkas are joined to form a large loop, but the older variant, which is a simple rope unjoined at the ends, may still occasionally be found.

{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar}}

At the bottom of the lestovka hang four ''lapostki'', which are flaps, usually triangular, but such variations as bell or oak-leaf shapes are not uncommon. These represent the four [[Gospels]], and sometimes have icons, crosses, religious symbols or scripture verses printed or stitched on them, the stitching around these leaves symbolising the teaching of the Gospels. Simpler lestovkas will have the lapostki covered with [[silk]] [[brocade (fabric)|brocade]] or [[velvet]], and this is a traditional way of reusing church fabrics, either of [[vestments]] that have become too worn out for clergy to wear, or of altar-coverings and similar fabrics.

Between these lapostki are seven small movable pieces, usually tucked in securely and not visible unless the stitching between the lapostki is undone. These seven pieces represent the seven Mysteries ([[Sacraments]]) of the Church, their location between the leaves of the ''lapostki'' indicating their origin in and central relation to the Gospels.

Next, the main loop will have three large ''steps'' on either side where it joins the lapostki (in lestovkas that are joined together), and on the Lestovka itself are three more large ''steps'', giving a total of nine, representing the nine months in which [[Christ]] was in the womb of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Blessed Virgin Mary]]), and also for the nine choirs of [[angels]].

After the three large ''steps'' on either side is a space, representing the heavens and the earth.

Coming to the main set of counters, one finds twelve small ''babochki'' (rungs, steps), signifying the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Then are thirty-eight small counters, representing the thirty-six weeks and two days during which the Theotokos carried Christ in her womb. Next, thirty-three small counters for the number of years Christ lived on earth, followed by seventeen small counters for the seventeen [[Old Testament]] prophets plus St [[John the Baptist]] who prophesied about the coming of Christ.

==Usage==

If one is unable to attend services in church for whatever reasons, it is considered commendable to pray on the lestovka, using a number of repetitions of the [[Jesus prayer]] combined with specific bows and [[poklon|prostrations]].

When using the lestovka as part of a rule of prayer, the three counters at either end are used for the following prayers (accompanied by bows) at the end and beginning of the prayer session:

:Боже, милостивъ бѹди мне грѣшномѹ. (грѣшнѣй if one is female)
:Создави мѧ, Господи, помилѹй мѧ.
:Безъ числа согрѣшихъ, Господи, прости мѧ.
::God be merciful to me a sinner. (''bow'')
::Thou hast created me; Lord, have mercy on me. (''bow'')
::I have sinned immeasurably; Lord, forgive me. (''bow'')
:Some say, at the last line, "помилѹй и прости мѧ грѣшнаго/грѣшнѹю" (have mercy and forgive me a sinner) instead of "прости мѧ" (forgive me).

The remaining one hundred small counters are used for the repetition of the [[Jesus prayer]], with bows and prostrations.

Other uses of the lestovka include counting the twelve or forty repetitions of [[Kyrie|Lord have mercy]] used as responses at the [[Divine Liturgy]] and [[Canonical hours]]. The seventeen counters are also used to count the number of bows during the [[Prayer of Saint Ephrem]].

Occasionally, some Old Rite bishops will use lestovkas (with the lapostki cut off) in place of a chain for wearing pectoral crosses and panagias.

==Outside of Old Belief==

The lestovka is rare outside of the communities that adhere to the liturgical practices of the [[Old Believers]], but [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians who are knowledgeable about Slavic traditions of the [[Byzantine rite]] will sometimes possess and use them.  Members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] usually use a [[prayer rope]] today. A rare example of a Russian Orthodox saint who is depicted with a lestovka is St [[Seraphim of Sarov]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.catherinedoherty.org/cause/images/Seraphim-of-Sarov.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040320/http://www.catherinedoherty.org/cause/images/Seraphim-of-Sarov.jpg |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}, [http://www.fmi.uni-stuttgart.de/szs/people/stefanescu/Icons/serafim.jpg], {{cite web |url=http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/Ikons/St_Serafim.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821082642/http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/Ikons/St_Serafim.jpg |archivedate=2006-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was not an Old Believer.

|"An atheist from at least his student years, he became an honorary associate of the Rationalist Press Association in 1952. An Oxford student remembered him as 'somewhat assertive in his arguments against religion' (C. Fuller, 'An interview with M. N. Srinivas', ''Anthropology Today'', 15/5, 1999, 5), but the nearest he came to showing it in print was the suggestion that religion is a source of 'fears and anxieties from which [men] would otherwise be free—the fear of black magic or of spirits, fear of God, of the Devil, of Hell' (Radcliffe-Brown, Structure, 149). [...] His restraint may have sprung from an austere conception of science or from the functionalist fear that destroying a people's beliefs will undermine their social system."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maddock: Brown, Alfred Reginald Radcliffe- (1881–1955)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37877 oxforddnb.com] (accessed 30 April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

|"As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist... None of us would seriously consider the possibility that all the gods of Homer really exist, and yet if you were to set to work to give a logical demonstration that Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and the rest of them did not exist you would find it an awful job. You could not get such proof. Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luminary.us/russell/atheist_agnostic.html Am I an Agnostic or an Atheist?], from ''Last Philosophical Testament 1943&amp;ndash;1968'', (1997) Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-09409-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"....I used to lay myself open to visions of God, but I never had any. I come from a religious family, and there have been moments when I've felt the oneness of things, but they never last, they fade away, leaving me with the belief that it's only fear that drives people to religion.

'''Choral synagogues''' ({{lang-yi|Khorshul}}) were built in Eastern Europe, from Hungary to Russia.&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt; These synagogues represented the ideas of Jewish Enlightenment (''[[Haskalah]]'') and made certain reforms to the traditional Jewish customs (''[[minhag]]'').&lt;ref name=meir/&gt; Often, they featured male choruses, conducted sermons in local languages (German, Russian, etc.), enforced order during services, decorated their interior, and placed [[pew]]s facing eastern wall where the [[Torah ark]] was displayed (in traditionalist synagogues, the ark and [[Bema|bimah]] stood in the center of the room).&lt;ref name=yivo/&gt;&lt;ref name=meir/&gt; However, the changes did not extend to religious beliefs and customs. Therefore, the differences between choral and traditional synagogues are more aesthetic.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;

The Vajrayana Buddhist Council of Malaysia, or VBCM in short, is a council or umbrella body consisting of member organizations which represents all [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist traditions in [[Malaysia]]. It also accepts individuals who are inclined towards Vajrayana [[Buddhism]] as associate members.

The VBCM is a council body whereby Buddhist Societies from the four Tibetan Buddhist Traditions in Malaysia work together under one umbrella to co-ordinate the religious activities of Vajrayana Buddhists.

The motto of the council is:

"To UPHOLD the Unity, Harmony and Understanding among Vajrayana 
Buddhist Organisations in Malaysia."

==Background information==
In 1998, with the encouragement of the Malaysian Government, a Malaysian Buddhist Coordinating Committee (MBCC) was formed, consisting of several national Buddhist councils.

At that time, there was no council representing the Vajrayana Buddhist organizations in Malaysia. Hence, a proposal to form a council representing Vajrayana Buddhist organizations was first mooted in 1998. At the same time, the number of Tibetan-based Buddhist organizations had increased and there was a need for a representation of the Vajrayana Buddhist Community in dealing with the Government and other Buddhist umbrella bodies.

After several years of discussion, a pro-tem committee was formed in April 2000. After many rounds of discussions, the formation of the VBCM was finally proposed with more encompassing aims.
  
The VBCM was included as a participating member of the MBCC from 2000. Eventually, the VBCM was also recognized and registered by the Malaysian Registrar of Societies on 12 June 2002. There were 20 founding member organizations in the VBCM.

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Mezentius''' was an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] king, and father of [[Lausus]]. Sent into exile because of his cruelty, he moved to [[Latium]]. He reveled in bloodshed and was overwhelmingly savage on the battlefield, but more significantly to a Roman audience he was a ''contemptor divum'', a "despiser of the gods."

He appears in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', primarily book ten, where he aids [[Turnus]] in a war against [[Aeneas]] and the [[Troy|Trojans]]. While in battle with Aeneas, he is critically injured by a spear blow, but his son [[Lausus]] bravely blocks Aeneas's final blow. Lausus is then killed by Aeneas, and Mezentius is able to escape death for a short while. Once he hears of Lausus' death, he feels ashamed that his son died in his place and returns to battle on his horse Rhaebus in order to avenge him. He is able to keep Aeneas on the defensive for some time by riding around Aeneas and loosing javelins. Eventually, Aeneas kills the horse with a spear and pins Mezentius underneath. He is overcome by Aeneas, but remains defiant and fearless unto his death, not begging for mercy as [[Turnus]] later does, but simply asking that he be buried with his son.

In the traditional myth that predates the Aeneid, Mezentius actually outlived Aeneas, who 'disappeared' into the river which Aeneas became associated with in a hero cult. However, since his benefactor [[Maecenas]] was a native Etruscan, Virgil portrayed Mezentius as a tyrant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Mitzvah tantz''''' (lit. "[[mitzvah]]-dance" in [[Yiddish]]) is the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[minhag|custom]] of the men dancing before the bride on the wedding night, after the wedding feast. Commonly, the bride, who usually stands perfectly still at one end of the room, will hold one end of a long sash or a [[gartel]] while the one dancing before her holds the other end.&lt;ref name="israelnationalnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/153331|title=Nadvorna Rebbe Passes Away, Burial Today on Mt. of Olives|last=Queenann|first=Gavriel|date=March 1, 2012|accessdate=March 19, 2012|work=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are times when one of the leading rabbis, usually her father or grandfather, will dance with her as well. The dance is usually a highly charged emotional moment, wherein the dancer prays silently for the couple's success in life.

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The custom evidently predates Hasidism, being mentioned first in the medieval ''[[Machzor Vitri]]'', and has its basis in the [[Talmud]] ([[Ketubot]]), where there is an expression ''ketsad merakdim lifnei hakallah'' "how does one dance before the bride?" Although most Orthodox groups oppose this practice, Hasidim have maintained a form of this ancient custom and consider a great honor to be able to dance in front of the bride to give her honor on her wedding night, after the guests have departed. Custom dictates that only close relatives would participate in the dance.

==Bride and groom rejoice==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
During the ''mitzvah tantz'', the bride and all the women, are brought to be in the men's section and there is no [[mechitza]] separating them. In some instances the mechitza will be moved aside entirely with all the women present seated facing the men on the other side. If there is a large crowd at a wedding of a notable rabbi, most of the women will be looking down from a higher women's gallery.

The groom and most of his male relatives take turns rejoicing in front of the new bride at the time of the ''mitzvah tantz''. In the case of the marriage of children or grandchildren of notable [[rebbe]]s, this becomes an opportunity for the entire community, followers and admirers of the rabbis involved to watch and rejoice as the ''mitzvah tantz'' is done by the leading rebbes and rabbis in attendance. This may go on all night until dawn.

==Mystical symbolism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The custom of honoring the bride is related to the notion of the Jewish Godhead having both male and female components that seek unification to be united as one, as [[Names of God in Judaism|God]]'s "feminine nature" is called the [[Shekhinah|Shechina]] (which is a feminine noun), and a marriage between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman is regarded as the symbol of a ''yichud'' ("unification") of God's "oneness" with the joining of the bride and the groom. By rejoicing in front of the bride and creating an atmosphere of happiness and joy at that moment in the wedding it is, as it were, as if one were rejoicing before the Shechina and the moment of its highest unification with utmost Godliness, which is a reason for great rejoicing. In addition, a Jewish groom and bride are considered to be as if they were a King and Queen on their marriage day, so by honoring them through dance one is honoring the "Queen" and her "King."

'''Pandit Todarmal''' (1719–1766) was an eminent [[India]]n scholar of [[Jainism]] and writer in [[Jaipur]].&lt;ref&gt;History of the Jaipur City By Ashim Kumar Roy&lt;/ref&gt; He had an organized system for preservation and study of Jain texts. About ten to twelve copyists were engaged to make hand written copies of important texts in different parts of the country. He made unsuccessful efforts to obtain copies of [[Satkhandagama|Dhavala]], Jai Dhavala and other Sidhanta Shastras from [[Karnataka]]. Many of his associates became good Jain scholars. These include Pandits Jaichand Chabra, Daulatram Kasliwal, Sewaram, and Devidas Godha.

According to Pandit Bakhtawar Shah, Todarmal was arrested on a false charge of removing an idol and was executed by the order of a [[Jaipur]] ruler who was under the influence of some staunch anti-Jain individuals in the court, who had become jealous of his influence.

After his death, his son Gumani Ram founded Gumanpanth, a strict sect of Jainism.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Works==

His twelve books include five original works and seven commentaries (Tikas). His five original books, combining both prose and poetry are:&lt;ref&gt;MAHA PANDIT TODARMAL (1719–1766) http://www.jaina.org/educationcommittee/education_material/F10_Jain_Legends/Todamalji%20Pandit_SK%20Jain.doc{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote Tikas in Hindi (in [[Dhundhari]] dialect) on Sanskrit works

* ''Purusharthasidhupaya'' (which could not be completed)

and on Prakrit works
*''Gommatsar Karmakand''
*''Labdhisar''
*''Chhapansar''
*''Triloksar''

''Mokshmarg Prakshak'' is his best-known book. He, however, could not complete it for some unknown reason. If completed, it would have been a large text of five thousand pages.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Even the incomplete work of about five hundred pages is extremely popular. It has been published in Hindi, Marathi and Urdu, and is found in many Digamber Jain temples of the country.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The views of religions and religious believers range widely, from giving sex and sexuality a rather negative connotation to believing that sex is the highest expression of the divine. Some religions distinguish between sexual activities that are practiced for biological reproduction (sometimes allowed only when in formal marital status and at a [[age of consent|certain age]]), and other activities practiced for sexual pleasure, as [[morality|immoral]].

==Overview==
[[Sexual ethics|Sexual morality]] has varied greatly over time and between cultures. A society's [[sexual norm]]s—standards of sexual conduct—can be linked to [[religion|religious]] beliefs, or social and environmental conditions, or all of these. Sexuality and reproduction are fundamental elements in human interaction and society worldwide. Furthermore, "sexual restrictions" is one of the [[cultural universal|universals]] of culture peculiar to all human societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[George P. Murdock]]. "On the universals of culture". In: Linton (ed), ''The Science of Man in the World Crisis'' (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Ann Cleaveland, Jean Craven, Maryanne Danfelser. ''Universals of Culture''. Center for Global Perspectives, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, most religions have seen a need to address the question of a "proper" role for sexuality in human interactions. Different religions have different codes of sexual morality, which regulate sexual activity or assign normative values to certain sexually charged actions or thoughts. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[morality]], [[ethics]] etc. These moral codes seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's [[human sexual activity|sexual activities]] and practices.

===Bahá'í faith===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], sexual relationships are permitted only between a husband and wife. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith in his book of laws, the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], forbids extramarital sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite book |author = Universal House of Justice |year = 1992 |title = The Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 978-0-85398-999-8 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-53.html | page = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiq"&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873 |year = 1992 |title = The Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 978-0-85398-999-8 | page = 26 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-4.html#gr19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baha'i understanding of sex is that [[chastity]] should be practised by both sexes before marriage because it is commendable ethically and that it leads to a happy and successful marital life. The Bahá'í Faith recognizes the value of the sex impulse, but that its proper use is within the institution of [[Bahá'í marriage|marriage]]; Baha'is do not believe in the suppression of the sex impulse but in its regulation and control.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;Letter written on behalf of [[Shoghi Effendi]] September 5, 1938.

====New Testament====
{{Long section|date=August 2018}}
[[Paul the Apostle]] stated in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] that it is good for the unmarried to remain this way, but if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, "To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practicing self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|7:8–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, Paul's view of sex is also that it is actually unnecessary for those with certain gifts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207 1 Corinthians 7:7]&lt;/ref&gt; (presumably [[Celibacy#Christianity|"celibacy"]]).

New Testament scholar [[N. T. Wright]] asserts that Paul absolute forbade fornication, irrespective of a new Christian's former cultural practices.  Wright notes "If a Corinthian were to say, 'Because I'm a Corinthian, I have always had a string of girl-friends I sleep with, that's part of our culture,' Paul would respond, 'Not now you're a Christian you don't.'... When someone disagreed with Paul's clear rules on immorality or angry disputes, the matters he deals with in Colossians 3.5-10, he is... firm, as we see dramatically in 1 Corinthians 5 and 6. There is no place in the Christian fellowship for such practices and for such a person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Communion_Koinonia.htm |title=Communion and Koinonia: Pauline Reflections on Tolerance and Boundaries |website=Ntwrightpage.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that Paul's treatment of sex was influenced by his conviction that the [[Christian eschatology|end of the world]] was imminent. Under this view, Paul, believing that the world would soon end, took it as a corollary that all earthly concerns,&lt;ref name="biblegateway1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207 |title=1 Corinthians 7 - Concerning Married Life - Now for the |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sex, should hold little interest for Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brundage|1987|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]] show far greater concern with sexual issues than the gospel writers attributed to Jesus, since Paul was building Christian communities over decades and responding to various issues that arose.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The theologian Lee Gatiss states that "the word "[[fornication]]" has gone out of fashion and is not in common use to describe non-marital sex. However, it is an excellent translation for [the Biblical term] porneia, which basically referred to any kind of sex outside of marriage... This has been contested... but the overwhelming weight of scholarship and all the available evidence from the ancient world points firmly in this direction. "Flee sexual immorality (porneia) and pursue self-control" (cf. 1 Thess 4:1–8) was the straightforward message to Christians in a sex-crazed world."&lt;ref name="theologian.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Issue of Pre-Marital Sex |author=Lee Gatiss |publisher=The Theologian |year=2005 |url=http://www.theologian.org.uk/pastoralia/premartialsex.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Christianity====
In [[early Christianity]], reflection on scriptural texts introduced an [[eschatological]] [[hermeneutic]] to the reading of the [[Book of Genesis]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] was seen as a normative ideal state to which Christians were to strive; writers linked the future enjoyment of [[Heaven]] to the original blessedness of Adam and Eve in their reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Anderson|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valuation of [[virginity]] in the ancient church brought into relief a tension between the Genesis injunction to "be fruitful and multiply"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|1:28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its understood contextual implication of marriage as a social institution, and the interpretation of the superiority of virginity over marriage, sexual activity and family formation from the Gospel texts [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt+19%3A11-12&amp;version=NIV Matt 19:11-12], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19:29&amp;version=NIV Matt 19:29]. One way patristic thinkers tried to harmonize the texts was through the position that there had actually been no sexual intercourse in Eden: on this reading, sex happened after the [[fall of man]] and the expulsion from Eden, thus preserving virginity as the perfect state both in the historical [[Paradise]] and the anticipated Heaven. [[John Chrysostom]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], and [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] all espoused this view:

*[[Gregory of Nyssa]], ''On Virginity'', 12 "He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture signifies when it said that he knew her not till he was driven forth from the garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2907.htm |title=CHURCH FATHERS: On Virginity (St. Gregory of Nyssa) |website=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Chrysostom]], ''On Virginity'', 14.3 "When the whole world had been completed and all had been readied for our repose and use, God fashioned man for whom he made the world... Man did need a helper, and she came into being; not even then did marriage seem necessary... Desire for sexual intercourse, conception, labor, childbirth, and every form of corruption had been banished from their souls. As a clear river shooting forth from a pure source, so they were in that place adorned by virginity." 15.2 "Why did marriage not appear before the treachery? Why was there no intercourse in paradise? Why not the pains of childbirth before the curse? Because at that time these things were superfluous".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Miller|2005|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Irenaeus]], ''[[Against Heresies]]'', Book 3, ch 22:4 "But Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin (for in Paradise they were both naked, and were not ashamed, inasmuch as they, having been created a short time previously, had no understanding of the procreation of children: for it was necessary that they should first come to adult age, and then multiply from that time onward), having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103322.htm |title=CHURCH FATHERS: Against Heresies, III.22 (St. Irenaeus) |website=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. John Noonan suggests that "if one asks... where the Christian Fathers derived their notions on marital intercourse – notions which have no express biblical basis – the answer must be, chiefly from the [[Stoics]]".&lt;ref name="Noonan_68"&gt;{{harvp|Noonan|1965|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses texts from [[Musonius Rufus]], [[Seneca the Younger]], and [[Ocellus Lucanus]], tracing works of [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]] and [[Jerome]] to the works of these earlier thinkers,&lt;ref name="Noonan_68"/&gt; particularly as pertaining to the permissible use of the sexual act, which in the Stoic model must be subdued, dispassionate, and justified by its procreative [[intent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Noonan|1965|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] had a different challenge: to respond to the errors of [[Manichaeism]].&lt;ref name="Noonan, John Thomas p. 169"&gt;{{harvp|Noonan|1965|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manichees, according to Augustine, were "opposed to marriage, because they are opposed to procreation which is the purpose of marriage".&lt;ref name="Noonan, John Thomas p. 169"/&gt; "The method of [[contraception]] practiced by these Manichees whom Augustine knew is the use of the sterile period as determined by Greek medicine",&lt;ref name="Noonan, John Thomas p. 169"/&gt; which Augustine condemns (this stands in contrast to the contemporarily permitted Catholic use of [[Natural family planning]]).

As monastic communities developed, the sexual lives of monks came under scrutiny from two theologians, [[John Cassian]] and [[Caesarius of Arles]], who commented on the "vices" of the solitary life.  "Their concerns were not with the act of masturbation, but with the monks who vowed chastity. The monks' vow made masturbation an illicit act; the act itself was not considered sinful...  In fact... prior to Cassian, masturbation was not considered a sexual offence for anyone."&lt;ref name="Keenan2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keenan |first=James F. |authorlink=James F.

====Catholicism====

{{See also|Theology of the Body|Religious views on masturbation}}
From the beginning of the thirteenth century, the Catholic Church formally recognized [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit|marriage between a freely consenting, baptized man and woman]] as a [[sacrament]] – an outward sign communicating a special gift of God's love. The [[Council of Florence]] in 1438 gave this definition, following earlier Church statements in 1208, and declared that sexual union was a special participation in the union of Christ in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09707a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Sacrament of Marriage |website=Newadvent.org |date=1910-10-01 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Puritans]], while highly valuing the institution, viewed marriage as a "civil", rather than a "religious" matter, being "under the jurisdiction of the civil courts".&lt;ref name="Feige, Diana 1995 P109"&gt;Feige, Diana, and Franz G M.

P109&lt;/ref&gt; This is because they found no biblical precedent for clergy performing marriage ceremonies. Further, marriage was said to be for the "relief of [[concupiscence]]"&lt;ref name="Feige, Diana 1995 P109"/&gt; as well as any spiritual purpose.

The Catholic moral theologian [[Charles Curran (theologian)|Charles E. Curran]] stated "the fathers of the Church are practically silent on the simple question of masturbation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T08zZBoY7uYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=the+fathers+of+the+Church+are+pratically+silent+on+the+simple+question+of+masturbation#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20fathers%20of%20the%20Church%20are%20pratically%20silent%20on%20the%20simple%20question%20of%20masturbation&amp;f=false |title=Christians, Feminists, and the Culture of Pornography |author=Arthur J.

The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' teaches that "the flesh is the hinge of salvation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art11.htm#1015 |title=Catechism |website=Usccb.org |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Catechism'' indicates that sexual relationships in marriage is "a way of imitating in the flesh the Creator's generosity and fecundity"&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=2335}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists [[fornication]] as one of the "offenses against chastity",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{CCC|pp=2352}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it "an intrinsically and gravely disordered action" because "use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Pope John Paul II]]'s first major teaching was on the [[Catholic theology of the body|theology of the body]], presented in a series of [[Theology of the Body|lectures by the same name]]. Over the course of five years he elucidated a vision of sex that was not only positive and affirming but was about redemption, not condemnation. He taught that by understanding God's plan for physical love we could understand "the meaning of the whole of existence, the meaning of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Audience, 6 |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/jp2tb45.htm |author=Pope John Paul II |date=29 October 1980 |publisher=L'Osservatore Romano |accessdate=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that human beings were created by a loving God for a purpose: to be loving persons who freely choose to love, to give themselves as persons who express their self-giving through their bodies. Thus, sexual intercourse between husband and wife is a [[symbol]] of their total mutual self-donation.{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}}

For John Paul II, "The body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and divine." He says there is no other more perfect [[image]] of the unity and communion of God in mutual love than the sexual act of a married couple, whereby they give themselves in a total way – exclusively to one another, and up to end of their lives, and in a fruitfully generous way by participating in the [[Insemination|creation]] of new human beings. Through this perspective, he understands the immorality of extra-marital sex. It falsifies the language of the human body, a language of total love worthy of persons by using the body for selfish ends, thus treating persons as things and objects, rather than dealing with embodied persons with the reverence and love that incarnate spirits deserve. John Paul II stresses that there is great [[beauty]] in sexual love when done in [[harmony]] with the human values of freely chosen total commitment and self-giving. For him, this sexual love is a form of [[worship]], an experience of the [[sacred]].&lt;ref&gt;Theology of Marriage and Celibacy, Boston, St. Paul Books and Media 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/sexuality/se0055.htmlhttp://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5603 | author=Christopher West | work=Catholic Education Resource Center | title=John Paul II's Theology of the Body | accessdate=2009-09-29 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]] and [[United Church of Christ|United]] churches of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] and in the Netherlands and Switzerland view homosexuality as a violation of the [[Ten Commandments#Division according to different religions|7th commandment]]. In these Lutheran, United and Reformed churches gay ministers are not permitted in ministry and gay couples are not allowed in their churches.

Inside the Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]], the Bishop of Stockholm, [[Eva Brunne]] is a [[lesbian]].&lt;ref name=brunne&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81808_116555_ENG_HTM.htm SWEDEN: Lesbian priest ordained as Lutheran bishop of Stockholm.

In the Anglican church there is a large discussion over the blessing of gay couples and over tolerance of homosexuality. The discussion is more about the aspect of love between two people of the same sex in a relationship than it is about the sexual aspect of a relationship.&lt;ref name="Vernon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=Mark|title=A church at war: Anglicans and homosexuality|journal=Theology &amp; Sexuality|date=January 2006|pages=220–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some dioceses, Anglican (Episcopal) churches in Canada and the USA permit openly gay priests in ministry and allow same-sex blessings, which has drawn much criticism from other parts of the Anglican Communion. Anglican churches in parts of Africa are extremely conservative in their attitude towards homosexuality. Gay priests in most Anglican churches must be celibate if they wish to continue their work as priests.

Within the many branches of [[Mormonism]] the principle denomination [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|the LDS Church]] teaches conservative views around [[sexual ethics]] in their [[Law of Chastity]] which holds that  masturbation, pre- and extra-marital sex, and same-sex sexual activity are sins.

The Mormon religion teaches that marriage should be with a man and a woman. The LDS church teaches its members to obey the law of chastity which says that "sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife". Violations of this code include "adultery, being without natural affection, lustfulness, infidelity, incontinence, filthy communications, impurity, inordinate affection, fornication". The traditional Mormon religion forbids all homosexual behavior, whether it be intra-marriage or extramarital. In Romans 1:24-32, Paul preached to the Romans that homosexual behavior was sinful. In Leviticus 20:13, Moses included in his law that homosexual actions and behaviors were against God's will. In the 1830s, LDS founder Joseph Smith instituted the private practice on polygamy. The practice was defended by the church as a matter of religious freedom. In 1890, the church practice was terminated. Since the termination of polygamy, Mormons have solely believed in marriage between two people, and those two people being a man and a woman. The LDS community states that they still love homosexuals as sons and daughters of the Lord, but if they act upon their inclinations then they are subject to discipline of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Alan|title=Mormon and Queer at the Crossroads|journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|date=2011|volume=44|issue=1|pages=53–84,230|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/858948153?pq-origsite=gscholar|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dehlin|first1=John|last2=Galliher|first2=Renee|last3=Bradshaw|first3=William|last4=Crowell|first4=Katherine|title=Psychosocial Correlates of Religious Approaches to Same-Sex Attraction: A Mormon Perspective|journal=Journal of Gay and Lesbian Mental Health|date=25 April 2014|pages=284–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quran]]ic verses made it legal for Muslim men to marry women from other [[Abrahamic religions]] (i.e. Jews and Christians), provided that the women are faithful (adherent) to their own religious beliefs. Contemporary scholars have upheld this ruling. A Muslim woman, on the other hand, is only allowed to marry a Muslim man because to marry a non-Muslim man would mean that the children would grow up as non-Muslims. A marriage contract between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man is traditionally considered illegal and void, and hence legally an [[adulterous]] affair. Another reason is to insure that the woman's legal rights are fully recognized in a marriage contract.

Most forms of sexual contact within a marriage are allowed. Sex is considered a pleasurable, even spiritual activity, and a duty. At least one [[hadith]] explicitly states that for a married couple to have sex is a good deed rewarded by God. Another hadith suggests that a man should not leave the proverbial bed until the woman is satisfied, a reference many say points to [[orgasm]].

Forbidden sexual contact includes genital contact with a woman while she is [[menstruating]]. In such case, other sexual contact (such as kissing and any sexual activity that does not include vaginal contact) is explicitly allowed. Temporary marriage (''[[Mut'a]]'', marriage designated for a preset period of time) is not allowed by the majority [[Sunni]] schools, but is allowed by [[Shia]] schools. Debate continues on its validity.

[[Adultery]] warrants severe punishment. [[Pre-marital sex]] is also considered sinful, albeit less severe. All [[shari'a]] laws regulating sexual conduct apply to both men and women equally, apart from those concerning [[menstruation]].

There are dissenting [[Islam and masturbation|views on the topic of masturbation]]. While some scholars consider it unlawful and thus prohibited according to Islamic doctrine, others (such as those of the Hanbali doctrine) believe that those who masturbate out of fear of committing fornication or fear for their bodies have done nothing wrong and are not punished if (and only if) they are unable to marry. According to some [[hadith]]s however, men are encouraged to fast in order to avoid fornication and tempting oneself with sexual thoughts or conversations with opposite sex outside marriage is strongly discouraged.

===Judaism===
{{main|Judaism and sexuality}}
{{see also|Homosexuality and Judaism|Judaism and masturbation|Tzniut|Niddah|Yichud|Negiah|Adultery#Judaism}}
In the perspective of traditional [[Judaism]], sex and reproduction are the holiest of acts one can do, the act through which one can imitate God, "The Creator", and in order to preserve its sanctity there are many boundaries and guidelines. Within the boundaries, there are virtually no outright strictures, and it is in fact obligatory. It prohibits sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriage, maintains biblical strictures on relations within marriage including observance of [[niddah]], a prohibition on relations for a period including the menstrual period, and [[tzniut]], requirements of modest dress and behavior. Traditional Judaism views the physical acts of adultery, incest, intentional waste of semen, [[Men who have sex with men|men having anal sex with men]], and male masturbation as grave sins. Judaism permits relatively free divorce, with [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] requiring a [[get (divorce document)|religious divorce]] ceremony for a divorce to be religiously recognized. Worldwide movements in Judaism considered more liberal have rejected Jewish law as binding but rather inspirational and allegorical, so adapted perspectives more consistent with contemporary western general secular culture.

Most of mainstream Judaism does not accept [[polyamory]], although some people consider themselves Jewish and polyamorous.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Krupkin |first=Taly |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.551971 |title=Polyamorous Jews seek acceptance - Jewish World News - Haaretz - Israel News |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2013-10-12 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent rabbi who does accept polyamory is [[Sharon Kleinbaum]] who was ordained in [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] which considers biblical Jewish law as not considered binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary.  She is the senior rabbi at Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York which works independently of any major American Jewish denomination; R Kleinbaum says that polyamory is a choice that does not preclude a Jewishly observant, socially conscious life.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; Some polyamorous Jews also point to biblical patriarchs having multiple wives and concubines as evidence that polyamorous relationships can be sacred in Judaism.&lt;ref name="polyamorous"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavin |first=Talia |url=http://www.jta.org/2013/10/10/news-opinion/united-states/ahava-raba-polyamorous-jews-engage-with-multiple-loves-and-their-jewish-traditions |title=Married and dating: Polyamorous Jews share love, seek acceptance &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |website=Jta.org |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an email list dedicated to polyamorous Jews, called ''AhavaRaba'', which roughly translates to "big love" in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="polyamorous"/&gt; (Its name echoes the [[Ahava rabbah]] prayer expressing thanks for God's "abundant love".)

====Conservative====
[[Conservative Judaism]], consistent with its general view that [[halakha]] (Jewish law) is a binding guide to Jewish life but subject to periodic revision by the Rabbinate, has lifted a number of strictures observed by [[Orthodox Judaism]]. In particular, in December 2006, Conservative Judaism's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] adopted ''[[responsum|responsa]]'' presenting diametrically opposed views on the issue of homosexuality. It adopted an opinion restricting a prior prohibition on homosexual conduct to male-male anal sex only, which it declared to be the only Biblical prohibition, declaring all other prohibitions (e.g. male-male oral sex or lesbian sex) rabbinic, and lifting all rabbinic restrictions based on its interpretation of the Talmudic principle of [[Kevod HaBriyot]] ("human dignity"). While declining to develop a form of religious gay marriage, it permitted blessing lesbian and gay unions and ordaining openly lesbian and gay rabbis who agree not to engage in male-male anal sex.&lt;ref name="rabbinevins-gayjews"&gt;[http://www.rabbinevins.org/HHH%20Dorff%20Nevins%20Reisner%20Final2.pdf Elliott N. Dorff, Daniel Evans, and Avram Reisner. ''Homosexuality, Human Dignity, and Halakha.''

It reflects a profound change from a prior blanket prohibition on male homosexual practices. It acknowledges a sharp divergence of views on sexual matters within Conservative Judaism, such that there is no single Conservative Jewish approach to matters of sexuality. Conservative Judaism currently straddles the divide between liberal and traditional opinion on sexual matters within contemporary American society, permitting both views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ Conservative Panel Votes To Permit Gay Rabbis ''Jewish Daily Forward'', December 7, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208205536/http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ |date=December 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Judaism has maintained on its books a variety of requirements and prohibitions, including a requirement that married women observe the family purity laws and a general prohibition on non-marital heterosexual conduct. The family purity laws require women to be recognize as [[Tumah and taharah|tumah]] or [[niddah]] during their [[menstrual period]]. As a tumah, a woman is to wait 7 days for her menstrual cycle to end and then 7 "clean days" in order to enter the [[mikveh]] and begin sexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Passionate Torah: Sex and Judaism|last=Haviva|first=Ner-David,|publisher=NYU Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=123|quote="clean days"|via=www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgfbf.12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, it is forbidden to have any type of contact with the niddah, thus anything she touches is not to be touched and no physical contact is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/lev/15?lang=eng|title=The Third Book of Moses Called Leviticus|last=|first=|date=2016|website=The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day as the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] released its homosexuality responsa, it released multiple opinions on the subject of niddah including a responsum lifting certain traditional restrictions on husband-wife contact during the niddah period while maintaining a prohibition on sexual relations. The permissive responsum on homosexuality used the Conservative movement's approach to niddah as an analogy for construing the Biblical prohibition against male homosexual conduct narrowly and lifting restrictions it deemed Rabbinic in nature. The responsum indicated it would be making a practical analogy between an approach in which male homosexual couples would be on their honor to refrain from certain acts and its approach to niddah:
{{quote|We expect homosexual students to observe the rulings of this responsum in the same way that we expect heterosexual students to observe the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|CJLS]] rulings on niddah. We also expect that interview committees, administrators, faculty and fellow students will respect the privacy and dignity of gay and lesbian students in the same way that they respect the privacy and dignity of heterosexual students.}}

The responsum enjoined young people not to be "promiscuous" and to prepare themselves for "traditional marriage" if possible, while not explicitly lifting or re-enforcing any express strictures on non-marital heterosexual conduct.&lt;ref name = "rabbinevins-gayjews"/&gt;

Even before this responsum, strictures on pre-marital sex had been substantially ignored, even in official circles. For example, when the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] proposed enforcing a policy against non-marital cohabitation by rabbinical students in the 1990s, protests by cohabiting rabbinical students resulted in a complete rescission of the policy.

Conservative Judaism formally prohibits [[interfaith marriage]] and its standards currently indicate it will expel a rabbi who performs an interfaith marriage. It maintains a variety of formal strictures including a prohibition on making birth announcements in synagogue bulletins for children on non-Jewish mothers and accepting non-Jewish individuals as synagogue members. However, interfaith marriage is relatively widespread among the Conservative laity, and the Conservative movement has recently adapted a policy of being more welcoming of interfaith couples in the hopes of interesting their children in Judaism.

Conservative Judaism, which was for much of the 20th century the largest Jewish denomination in the United States declined sharply in synagogue membership in the United States the 1990s, from 51% of synagogue memberships in 1990 to 33.1% in 2001, with most of the loss going to Orthodox Judaism and most of the rest to Reform. The fracturing in American society of opinion between increasingly liberal and increasingly traditionalist viewpoints on sexual and other issues, as well as the gap between official opinion and general lay practice vis-a-vis the more traditionalist and liberal denominations, may have contributed to the decline.&lt;ref name="icpa-waxman"&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/cjc-waxman-f05.htm Chaim Waxman, Winners and Losers in Denominational Memberships in the United States. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2005]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701162349/http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/cjc-waxman-f05.htm |date=2012-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox====
{{Main|Tzniut}}
There are several levels to the observance of physical and personal modesty (''tzniut''), according to [[Orthodox Judaism]], as derived from various sources in ''[[halakha]]''. Observance of these rules varies from aspirational to mandatory to routine across the spectrum of Orthodox stricture and observance.

Orthodox Judaism also maintains a strong prohibition on interfaith sexual relations and marriage. Orthodox Judaism, alone of all the Jewish denominations, retains relatively mild traditional disabilities on divorce, including a Biblical prohibition on a [[Kohen]] (priestly descendant of [[Aaron]]) marrying a divorcee or a woman who has engaged in certain types of [[sexual misconduct]]. An Orthodox [[get (divorce document)|bill of divorce]] is required for a divorce to be recognized.

====Reform, Reconstructionist and Humanistic====
[[Reform Judaism]], [[Humanistic Judaism]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] do not observe or require traditional sexuality rules and have welcomed non-married and homosexual couples and endorsed homosexual commitment ceremonies and marriages.

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism are more tolerant of interfaith marriage, and many rabbis in both communities will perform one. Humanistic Judaism permits interfaith marriage. Reform, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic Judaism also do not require a religious divorce ceremony separate from a civil divorce.

It has been speculated that the more tolerant attitudes of Reform, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic Judaism towards both sexual diversity and interfaith marriage may have contributed to the rise in their popularity during the 1990s, from about 33% of affiliated households to 38%, making it pass Conservative Judaism as the largest Jewish denomination in the United States.&lt;ref name = "icpa-waxman"/&gt;

==Dharmic religions==

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism and sexuality}}
{{See also|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}
The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics are the [[Five Precepts]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], which say that one should neither be [[Upādāna|attached]] to nor crave sensual pleasure. These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction.

Of the Five Precepts, the third vow is to refrain from sex with others' spouse, someone under age (namely, those protected by their parents or guardians), and who have taken vows of religious celibacy.&lt;ref name="cunda kammaraputta sutta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta|trans-title=To Cunda the Silversmith|others=Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|publisher=Access to Insight|year=1997|id=[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.176|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html| accessdate = 2011-03-14|quote=Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.

[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Buddhist monks and nuns]] of most traditions are expected to refrain from all sexual activity and the [[Sakyamuni Buddha|Buddha]] is said to have admonished his followers to avoid unchastity "as if it were a pit of burning cinders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Saddhatissa | first =Hammalawa | authorlink = | title =Buddhist Ethics: The Path to Nirvana | publisher =Wisdom Pubns; New Ed edition |date=December 1987 | location = | page =88 | url =

===Hinduism===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
{{See also|History of sex in India|Homosexuality and Hinduism}}
Religiously, Hindus begin life at the [[Brahmacharya]] or "student" stage, in which they are directed to chastely advance themselves educationally and spiritually to prepare themselves for a life of furthering their ''[[dharma]]'' (societal, occupational, parental, etc. duties) and ''[[karma]]'' (right earthly actions); only once they reach the [[Grihastya]] or "householder" stage can they seek ''[[kama]]'' (physical pleasure) and [[artha]] (worldly achievement, material prosperity) through marriage and their vocations, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' (Discourse on Kāma) by Vatsayana, widely believed to be just a manual for [[sexual intercourse|sexual congress]], offers an insight into sexual [[mores]], [[sexual ethics|ethics]] and societal rules that were prevalent at that time. Shringara Ras (Romance, one of the nine rasas or emotions). A drama in Sanskrit, Abhigyana Shakuntalam by [[Kālidāsa|Kalidasa]], cited as one of the best examples of Shringara Ras, talks of the love story of [[Dushyanta]] and [[Shakuntala]].&lt;ref&gt;"History of Indian Theatre: Classical theatre", by Manohar Laxman Varadpande, p. 123, {{ISBN|9788170174301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Comprehensive History Of Ancient India (3 Vol. Set) |publisher = Sterling |author = Pran Nath Chopra |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
Most [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religions have the theme of fertility (both physical and creative/spiritual) as central to their practices, and as such encourage what they view as a healthy sex life, consensual sex between adults, regardless of gender.

[[Wicca]], like other religions, has adherents with a broad spectrum of views ranging from conservative to liberal. It is a largely nondogmatic religion and has no prohibitions against sexual intercourse outside of marriage or relationships between members of the same sex. The religion's ethics are largely summed up by the [[Wiccan Rede]]: "An it harm none, do as thou wilt", which is interpreted by many as allowing and endorsing responsible sexual relationships of all varieties. Specifically in the Wiccan tradition of modern witchcraft, one of the widely accepted pieces of [[Craft]] liturgy, the Charge of the Goddess instructs that "...all acts of love and pleasure are [the Goddess'] rituals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Alternative Sexuality | publisher =Tangled Moon Coven |date=2006-08-08 | url =http://www.tangledmoon.org/sexuality.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving validity to all forms of sexual activity for Wiccan practitioners.

In the [[Gardnerian]] and [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian]] forms of Wicca, the "[[Great Rite]]" is a sex ritual much like the [[hieros gamos]], performed by a priest and priestess who are believed to embody the Wiccan God and Goddess. The Great Rite is almost always performed figuratively using the athame and chalice as symbols of the penis and vagina. The literal form of the ritual is always performed by consenting adults, by a couple who are already lovers and in private. The Great Rite is not seen as an opportunity for casual sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Sex, Wicca and the Great Rite | journal =The Blade &amp; Chalice | volume = Spring 1993 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satanism==
[[LaVeyan Satanism]] is critical of Abrahamic sexual mores, considering them narrow, restrictive and hypocritical. Satanists are pluralists, accepting gays, lesbians, bisexuals, BDSM, polyamorists, [[transgender]] people, and [[asexuality|asexuals]]. Sex is viewed as an indulgence, but one that should only be freely entered into with consent. [[LaVeyan Satanism#The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth|The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth]] only give two instructions regarding sex: "Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal" and "Do not harm little children", though the latter is much broader and encompasses physical and other abuse. This has always been consistent part of CoS policy since its inception in 1966, as Peter H. Gillmore wrote in an essay supporting [[same sex marriage]]: "Finally, since certain people try to suggest that our attitude on sexuality is "anything goes" despite our stated base principle of "responsibility to the responsible," we must reiterate another fundamental dictate: The Church of Satan’s philosophy strictly forbids sexual activity with children as well as with non-human animals."&lt;ref name="churchofsatan.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peter |first=Magus |url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/FoundingFamily.html |title=Founding Family |website=Churchofsatan.com |date=2004-03-09 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that essay he also stated: "The Church of Satan is the first church to fully accept members regardless of sexual orientation and so we champion weddings/civil unions between adult partners whether they be of opposite or the same sex. So long as love is present and the partners wish to commit to a relationship, we support their desire for a legally recognized partnership, and the rights and privileges which come from such a union."&lt;ref name="churchofsatan.com"/&gt;

==Unitarian Universalism==
Several UU congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a "[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBTQ persons#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual &amp; transgender (LGBT) members. UU ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church "to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 "Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages"], UPI, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 June 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]] was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—"Standing on the Side of Love." In 2004 UU Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, DC Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]].

[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] is a group within Unitarian Universalism whose vision is "for Unitarian Universalism to become the first [[polyamory|poly]]-welcoming mainstream religious denomination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uupa.org/index#mission|title=Our Mission|website=Uupa.org|accessdate=2017-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918233548/http://www.uupa.org/index#mission|archive-date=2017-09-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western esotericism and occultism==
{{Main|Sex magic}}
[[File:Aleister Crowley, Magus.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Aleister Crowley]] in ceremonial garb, 1912.]]
Sex magic is a term for various types of [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] used in [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]], [[Theurgy|ritualistic]], or otherwise [[Magic (religion)|religious]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] pursuits found within [[Western esotericism]] which is a broad spectrum of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] traditions found in [[Western culture|Western society]], or refers to the collection of the [[mystical]], [[esoteric knowledge]] of the [[Western world]].. One practice of sex magic is using the energy of [[sexual arousal]] or orgasm with visualization of a desired result. A premise of sex magic is the concept that sexual energy is a potent force that can be harnessed to [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]] one's normally perceived [[reality]]. The earliest known practical teachings of sex magic in the Western world come from 19th-century American occultist [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], under the heading of ''The Mysteries of Eulis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Aleister Crowley]] reviewed ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'' in the pages of his journal ''The Equinox'', stating that it was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous.

Aleister Crowley became involved with [[Theodor Reuss]] and [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] following the publication of ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]'' between 1912 and 1913.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, Francis ''The Magical World of Aleister Crowley'' page 80&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crowley's account, Reuss approached him and accused him of having revealed the innermost (sexual) secret of O.T.O. in one of the cryptic chapters of this book. When it became clear to Reuss that Crowley had done so unintentionally, he initiated Crowley into the IX° (ninth degree) of O.T.O. and appointed him "Sovereign Grand Master General of [[Ireland]], Iona and all the Britains."&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;&lt;ref name=urban /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/lib333.htm |title=Book of Lies |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |year=1921 |page=6 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |quote=Shortly after publication [of the ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|Book of Lies]]''], the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the O.T.O.) came to me... He said that since I was acquainted with the supreme secret of the Order, I must be allowed the IX {degree} and obligated in regard to it. I protested that I knew no such secret. He said `But you have printed it in the plainest language'. I said that I could not have done so because I did not know it. He went to the bookshelves; taking out a copy of THE BOOK OF LIES, he pointed to a passage... It instantly flashed upon me. The entire symbolism not only of Free Masonry but of many other traditions blazed upon my spiritual vision. From that moment the O.T.O. assumed its proper importance in my mind. I understood that I held in my hands the key to the future progress of humanity... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the O.T.O. included, from its inception, the teaching of sex [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]] in the highest degrees of the Order, when Crowley became head of the Order, he expanded on these teachings and associated them with different degrees as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;
* VIII°: [[Masturbation|masturbatory]] or autosexual magical techniques were taught, referred as the ''Lesser Work of Sol''
* IX°: [[Sexual intercourse|heterosexual]] magical techniques were taught
* XI°: [[anal intercourse]] magical techniques were taught.

Professor Hugh Urban, Professor of Comparative Religion at [[The Ohio State University]], noted Crowley's emphasis on sex as "the supreme magical power".&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;Urban, Hugh. ''[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeV/Unleashing_the_Beast.htm Unleashing the Beast: [[Aleister Crowley]], [[tantra]] and sex magic in late Victorian England]. [[Ohio State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crowley:
{{quote|''[[The Book of the Law]]'' solves the sexual problem completely. Each individual has an absolute right to satisfy his sexual instinct as is physiologically proper for him. The one injunction is to treat all such acts as sacraments. One should not eat as the brutes, but in order to enable one to do one's will. The same applies to sex. We must use every faculty to further the one object of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley|Crowley, Aleister]] (1970).

The '''See of Sardis''' or '''Sardes''' ({{lang-el|Σάρδεις}}, ''Sardeis'') was an [[episcopal see]] in [[Sardis|the city of that name]]. It was one of the [[Seven churches of Asia|Seven Churches of the Apocalypse]], held by [[metropolitan bishop]]s since the middle to late 1st century,&lt;ref name="otto"&gt;Otto F. A. Meinardus. 1974. "The Christian Remains of the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse." ''The Biblical Archaeologist''. Vol. 37, No. 3. p. 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; with jurisdiction over the province of [[Lydia]], when this was formed in 295. After 1369 it became a [[titular see]] both for the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==History==

After [[Diocletian]] reorganized the region in 295, Sardis became the capital of the [[Roman province|province]] of Lydia, the seat of the governor and of the metropolitan archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Churches of God. "[http://www.originalcatholicchurch.org/english/s/P283.html The Pillars of Philadelphia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929081302/http://www.originalcatholicchurch.org/english/s/P283.html |date=2007-09-29 }}."   No. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one known [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] reference to the see of Sardis, dated to the 5th or 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Buckler and David M. Robinson (eds.). 1932. ''Sardis'', Vol. VII, Part 1, ''Greek and Latin Inscriptions''.  Publications of the American Society for the Excavation of Sardis. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1959 landslide revealed several ecclesiastical artifacts and a throne that archaeologists postulated may have been used by the bishops of Sardis.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. 1859, October 26. "Landslide yields Lydian artifacts." p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The first systemic investigation of the ruins of Sardis came in 1910 with an expedition from [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name= "otto"/&gt; Excavations in 1912 revealed a small "Church M", containing [[coin]]s which were dated to the 5th century and an [[apse]] overhanging one of the earliest known Christian [[altar]]s, near the north eastern corner of the [[Temple of Artemis]].&lt;ref name="otto"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Menologion]]'', Clement, a disciple of [[Paul of Tarsus]] and one of the Seventy ([[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians 4:3]]), was the first bishop of Sardis.&lt;ref name="otto"/&gt; Little is known about the ancient [[bishopric]] of Sardis, with the notable exception of [[Melito of Sardis|Saint Melito]], a contemporary of [[Marcus Aurelius]] from the 2nd century,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Schaff. 1890. ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.ix.xxvi.html NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine]''. New York: Christian Literature Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; whom some sources refer to as the second bishop of Sardis&lt;ref&gt;Steve Smith, 2005. "[http://faithofthefathersearlychurchfathers.blogspot.com/2005/12/saint-melito-of-sardis-early-church.html  Saint Melito of Sardis: Early Church Father, Bishop, and Martyr]."&lt;/ref&gt;—citing the "improbability of seventy years in the episcopate"&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Cushing Richardson et al. 1886. ''The Ante-Nicene Fathers: Translations of the Writings of the Fathers Down to A.D. 325''. C. Scribner's Sons, p. 750.&lt;/ref&gt;—making him the successor to the "[[Seven churches of Asia|angel of the church of Sardis]]" referenced in the [[New Testament]] ([[Book of Revelation|Rev. 3:1-3]]), while other sources regard Melito himself as the "apostle" or "angel of the church of Sardis."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Taylor and Reginald Heber, 1828.  ''The whole works of the Right Rev. Jeremy Taylor, D.D. Lord Bishop of Down, Connor, and Dromore: with A Life of the Author, and a critical examination of his writings by the Right Rev. Reginald Heber, D.D. late Lord Bishop of Calcutta''.  Reginald Heber. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Revelation]], [[John of Patmos|Saint John]] writes a letter to the church of Sardis, reproaching it and its bishop.&lt;ref name="sardescat"/&gt;

[[File:Martyrdom of Euthymius of Sardeis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The martyrdom of [[Euthymius of Sardis]]. From the ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]''.]]
The [[Council of Rimini]] deposed Bishop Hortasius of Sardis in 359 because he had been ordained without the saction of the bishops of Lydia.&lt;ref name="sozomen"&gt;Sozomen et al., Edward Walford (trans.), 1855. ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ecf/202/2020386.htm The Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen: Comprising a History of the Church from A.D. 324 to A.D. 440]''. Henry G. Bohn. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The See had 27 [[suffragan bishop]]s (including the bishop of [[Thyatira]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Thyatira}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ramsay |first=W. M. |authorlink=William Mitchell Ramsay |coauthors= |editor=[[James Hastings]] |encyclopedia=[[Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible|A Dictionary of the Bible]] |title=Philadelphia |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hastings/dictv3/Page_831.html |accessdate= |edition= |year=1900 |month= |publisher= |volume=III |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages=831 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the 7th century, and approximately that number until the end of the 10th century.&lt;ref name="sardescat"/&gt;

[[Arab]]s sacked Sardis in 716, but the city remained a part of a resurgent Roman ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) Empire until the aftermath of the [[battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. [[Euthymius of Sardis|Euthymius]], a Metropolitan Bishop of Sardis, was martyred in 824 in relation to [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclasm]].&lt;ref name="icono"/&gt;

===East-West schism===
In 1118, Byzantine general Philocales recaptured Sardis from the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]]. Andronikos], Bishop of Sardis c. 1283, made several attempts at [[East-West Schism|East-West reunification]].&lt;ref name="sardescat"/&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] captured Sardis in 1306; the city was destroyed by [[Timur]] in 1402.&lt;ref name = "Turkey"&gt;Turkey forYou, 2006. "[http://www.turkeyforyou.com/turkey_sardis_history History of Sardis]."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Metropolitan of Sardis, who had once ranked sixth in precedence in the Eastern church,&lt;ref name="sardescat"/&gt; continued to hold that rank into the 13th century, long after Sardis had shrunk to a village which was no longer a regional locus of power.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, 1985. ''The Great Church in Captivity''. Cambridge University Press. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1369, [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] replaced Sardis as the see of the [[metropolitan bishop]],&lt;ref name="sardescat"/&gt; Sardis having been suppressed by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Howard. 1987. "Some Archaeological Notes on Turkish Sardis." ''Muqarnas'', '''4''': p. 43–58.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a bearer of the title of Metropolitan of Sardis, Dionysius, participated in the [[Council of Florence]] in 1438, but died before its conclusion and thus was not asked to sign its decree.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilii Popov (trans.), 1861. ''The History of the Council of Florence''. J. Masters. p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 17th century, there were appointments of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] archbishops of Sardis as a see ''[[in partibus infidelium]]'', meaning "within territory held by the infidels" (the Muslims), a term replaced in 1882 by that of "titular see".&lt;ref name="sardescat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Diocese}}&lt;/ref&gt; No new such appointments have been made to this eastern see since the [[Second Vatican Council]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3228">'''The Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture''', or '''ARC''', was founded in October 1961 by three people, Alfred Barr, the art critic and founder of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], and Marvin Halverson an American Protestant theologian sometime of the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] and the author of a 1951 booklet, ''Great Religious Paintings''.&lt;ref&gt;Halverson M., [http://lccn.loc.gov/54004313 ''Great Religious Paintings''], New York, H. N. Abrams, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its aims and program are based on the deep and complex relationship between religion and the arts.  Its first board of directors included these three as well as [[Unitarian Universalist]] theologian and parish minister, [[James Luther Adams]]; mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], principal developer of the merger forming the [[United Church of Christ]], [[Truman B. Douglass]]; Congregationalist parish minister and theologian [[Amos Wilder]], and [[Stanley Romaine Hopper]], theologian and co-founder of the first Theology and Literature program in the United States.

Among the more than 300 Fellows of the Society have been [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Sallie McFague]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[John Updike]].

During the late 1960s most of the individuals involved in the published discourse pertaining to the field of [[theopoetics]] were either fellows or members of SARCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keefe-Perry|first=L.

P. Dutton &amp; CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently SARCC sponsors public lectures and currently publishes a newsletter, Seedbed. Previously it has published a periodical entitled "ARC Directions."

The archives of SARCC are maintained at the [[Harvard_Divinity_School#Andover-Harvard_Theological_Library|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]&lt;ref name="Library Holdings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture, 1961-2003|url=http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/bms00555.html|publisher=Andover-Harvard Theological Library|accessdate=26 November 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the talmudic tractate|Soferim (Talmud)}}
[[File:Sofer.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|A sofer finishing the final letters of a [[sefer Torah]]]]
A '''Sofer''', '''Sopher''', '''Sofer SeTaM''', or '''Sofer ST"M''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb:]] "scribe", {{lang-he2|[[w:he:סופר סת"ם|סופר סת״ם]]}}) (female: ''soferet'') is a Jewish [[scribe]] who can transcribe [[sefer Torah|sifrei Torah]], [[tefillin]], and [[Mezuzah|mezuzot]], and other religious writings. ({{anchor|ST_M}}'''ST"M''', {{lang-he2|סת״ם}}, is an abbreviation of these three terms. The plural of sofer is "soferim" {{lang-he2|סופרים}}.)

By simple definition, a sofer is a [[copyist]], but the religious role in [[Judaism]] is much more. Besides sifrei Torah, tefillin, and mezuzot, scribes are also necessary to write the [[Five Megillot]] (scrolls of the [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Ruth]], [[Book of Esther]], [[Ecclesiastes]], and [[Book of Lamentations]]), [[Nevi'im]] (the books of the prophets, used for reading the [[haftarah]]), and for ''[[Get (divorce document)|gittin]]'', divorce documents. Also, many scribes function as calligraphers—writing functional documents such as [[ketubah|''ketubot'']] "marriage contracts", or ornamental and artistic renditions of religious texts, which do not require any scribal qualifications, and to which the rules on lettering and parchment specifications do not apply.

The major [[halakha]] pertaining to ''sofrut'', the practice of scribal arts, is in the [[Talmud]] in the tractate "[[Soferim (Talmud)|Maseket Sofrim]]". In the Torah's [[613 commandments]], the second to last&lt;ref&gt;82nd of the [[613 commandments]] as enumerated by [[Rashi]], and the second to final as it occurs in the text of the Torah, [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 31:19, the final being in Deuteronomy 32:38&lt;/ref&gt; is that every [[Jews|Jew]] should write a Sefer Torah in his lifetime ({{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|31:19|HE}}).

==Qualifications and education==
[[File:Sofer, Jewish scribe.JPG|thumb|A Sofer at work, [[Ein Bokek]], Israel]]
A sofer must be religiously observant, of good character, and knowledgeable about the laws concerning sofrut. It is a common misconception that one has to be a [[rabbi]] in order to become a sofer, which is not required by Jewish law.

People who want to become ritual scribes usually learn from another expert scribe by undergoing Shimush (Apprenticeship), since it would be impossible for someone to be a scribe without any actual practice. The hardest part about learning to be a sofer is not the [[calligraphy]], but, rather, remembering the thousands of laws that apply to sifrei Torah, tefillin, mezuzot, and all the other texts that are written on [[parchment]].

Some people who want to become ritual scribes learn at the ''Vaad Mishmereth STaM'', with the option of receiving a certificate. (This is an international organization whose goal is to protect the halachic and artistic integrity of the scribal arts. It is located in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bnei Brak]] in Israel, as well as in [[Brooklyn]], New York, United States.) Certification of this sort is not a halachic requirement, nor does it necessarily guarantee the quality of a particular sofer's work. This process does however ensure that a certified sofer has received the proper education and is a recognized expert in the field of sofrut.

===Texts teaching sofrut===
[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Torah Scribe.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Torah Scribe'' by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[National Museum, Wrocław]]]]
The main texts from which soferim learn the scribal art include the ''Keset Ha-Sofer'', ''Chasdey David'', [[Mishnah Berurah]] Volume I (B)—The laws of tefillin, Mishneh Torah: Hilchot Tefillin u'Mezuzah v'Sefer Torah. Hilchot Tzitzit, Mishnat Hasofer, Mishnat Sofrim, Likkut Sifrey, Shulchan Aruch HaRav. Stam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofer.co.uk/html/sources.htm |title=sources |publisher=Sofer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and sofrut===
Forming the basis for the discussion of women becoming soferim, Talmud ''Gittin'' 45b states, "Sifrei Torah, tefillin and mezuzot written by a heretic, a star-worshipper, a slave, a woman, a minor, a [[Samaritans|Cuthean]], or an [[apostasy in Judaism|apostate Jew]], are unfit for ritual use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geniza.net/ritual/women.shtml |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019133505/http://www.geniza.net/ritual/women.shtml |archivedate=October 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulings on mezuzot and tefillin are virtually undisputed among those who hold to the [[Talmud]]. While [[Arba'ah Turim]] does not include women in its list of those ineligible to write Sifrei Torah, some see this as proof that women are permitted to write a sefer Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Tur, [[Wikisource:Shulchan Aruch/Orach Chaim/271|Orah Hayyim 271]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, today, virtually all Orthodox (both Modern and Ultra) authorities contest the idea that a woman is permitted to write a sefer Torah. Yet, women are permitted to inscribe [[Ketubah|Ketubot]] (marriage contracts), STaM not intended for ritual use, and other writings of ''sofrut'' beyond simple STaM. In 2003, Canadian [[Aviel Barclay]] became the world's first known traditionally trained female sofer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alice Lowenstein |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/3614/ |title=A Female Scribe's Trailblazing Effort |publisher=Forward.com |date=2005-06-03 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwablog.jwa.org/soferet |title=Simchat Torah with a Soferet's Torah &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwablog.jwa.org |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Jen Taylor Friedman]], a British woman, became the first female sofer to scribe a sefer Torah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leah Hochbaum Rosner |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/11604/ |title=As New Year Dawns, Jewish Women Mark Milestones |publisher=Forward.com |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the first sefer Torah scribed by a group of women (six female sofrim, who were from Brazil, Canada, Israel, and the United States) was completed;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fishkoff |first=Sue |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2010/10/15/2741313/womens-torah-dedicated-in-seattle |title=Women's Torah dedicated in Seattle |publisher=Jta.org |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was known as the [[Women's Torah Project]].&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/59670/cjms-resident-scribe-takes-part-in-group-torah-project-in-seattle/ |title=Julie Seltzer, a female Torah scribe from San Francisco, contributed to the first Torah scroll to be written by a group of women|publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 2010 until spring 2011, [[Julie Seltzer]], one of the female sofrim from the [[Women's Torah Project]], scribed a sefer Torah as part of an exhibition at the [[Contemporary Jewish Museum]] in [[San Francisco]]. This makes her the first American female sofer to scribe a sefer Torah; Julie Seltzer was born in Philadelphia and is non-denominationally Jewish.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecjm.org/index.php?option=com_ccevents&amp;scope=prgm&amp;task=detail&amp;fid=8&amp;oid=563 |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408164017/http://www.thecjm.org/index.php?option=com_ccevents&amp;scope=prgm&amp;task=detail&amp;fid=8&amp;oid=563 |archivedate=April 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/arts/design/08sfculture.html|title=A Torah Scribe Pushes the Parchment Ceiling|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/61328/cjm-to-celebrate-end-of-groundbreaking-torah-project |title=CJM to celebrate end of groundbreaking Torah project |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; From spring 2011 until August 2012 she scribed another sefer Torah, this time for the Reform congregation Beth Israel in San Diego.&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spiro |first=Amy |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=286912 |title=Torah, she wrote - Jewish World |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbisd.org/news-and-stories/87-news-and-stories/1158-a-special-open-house-with-torah-scribe-julie-seltzer-observe-the-completion-of-our-torah |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414105124/http://www.cbisd.org/news-and-stories/87-news-and-stories/1158-a-special-open-house-with-torah-scribe-julie-seltzer-observe-the-completion-of-our-torah |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 14, 2013 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seltzer was taught mostly by [[Jen Taylor Friedman]].&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt; On September 22, 2013, [[Congregation Beth Elohim]] of New York dedicated a new Torah, which members of Beth Elohim said was the first Torah in New York City to be scribed by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/congregation-beth-elohim-in-park-slope-dedicates-new-torah-for-150th-anniversary-1.6119015 |title=Congregation Beth Elohim in Park Slope dedicates new Torah for 150th anniversary |publisher=Brooklyn.news12.com |date=2013-09-22 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602035037/http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/congregation-beth-elohim-in-park-slope-dedicates-new-torah-for-150th-anniversary-1.6119015 |archivedate=2015-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah was scribed by Linda Coppleson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torah.cbebk.org/about/our-soferet/ |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011005036/http://torah.cbebk.org/about/our-soferet/ |archivedate=October 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there are an estimated 50 female sofers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Kunerth |url=http://www.pressherald.com/2014/08/23/female-jewish-scribe-helps-keep-tradition-alive/ |title=– Female Jewish scribe helps keep tradition alive |publisher=Pressherald.com |date=2014-08-23 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documents written by scribes==
Besides Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuzot, scribes are also necessary for the writing of the [[Five Megillot]] (scrolls of the [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Ruth]], [[Book of Esther]], [[Ecclesiastes]], and [[Book of Lamentations]]) and Nevi'im (the books of the prophets, used for reading the [[haftarah]]), and for ''[[Get (divorce document)|gittin]]'' (divorce documents). In some communities, especially [[Chaim Kanievsky]]'s community in [[Bnei Brak]], soferim also write the other books of the Bible, such as [[Psalms]] or the [[Book of Ezra]]. This was promoted in 19th-century Jerusalem by Rabbi [[Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski]].

==Calligraphy and lettering==
{{main|Klaf|Ashuri alphabet}}
[[File:Alephbetgimmel.svg|thumbnail|100px|The first four letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] as they would be written scribally (a digital approximation)]]
[[File:Tefillin.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The four-pronged Shin on [[tefillin]]]]
There are many rules concerning the proper formation of letters that must be adhered to if a written text is to be deemed religiously valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofer.co.uk/html/aleph_to_gimel.htm Some details on letters, with animations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510181805/http://www.sofer.co.uk/html/aleph_to_gimel.htm |date=May 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]], [[Chabad]] (Lubavitch), and [[Mizrahi Jews]] each have their own script for forming the letters, though the same rules apply throughout the text. Generally, regarding sifrei Torah, none of these groups would consider that these differences would render a Torah ''posul'' (ritually unfit or invalid).

The documents must be written on properly prepared [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] known as [[klaf]].

Many scribes also function as calligraphers—writing functional documents like ketubot, or ornamental and artistic renditions of religious texts—which do not require any scribal qualifications, and to which the rules on lettering and parchment specifications do not apply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42069">The tables on this page represents '''Latter-day Saint membership''', as reported by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), as of December 31, 2017.&lt;ref name="newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics|website=www.mormonnewsroom.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except where indicated, general population figures are based on the latest [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] estimates (primarily for July 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Percentages of LDS members were calculated with this information. The link under the names of each country, territory, etc. corresponds to brief LDS history and statistical information for that particular area.

In 2017, the LDS Church had over 30,500 congregations and a reported membership of 16,118,169.&lt;ref name="newsroom"/&gt; The number of [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], [[Ward (LDS Church)#Wards and branches|congregations]] were taken from the Meetinghouse Locator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meetinghouse Locator|url=https://www.lds.org/maps/meetinghouses|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership defined ==
The LDS Church defines membership as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership record|url=https://tech.lds.org/wiki/Membership_record|website=LDSTech Wiki|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Those who have been baptized and confirmed.
# Those under age nine who have been blessed but not baptized.
# Those who are not accountable because of intellectual disabilities, regardless of age.
# Unblessed children under age eight when:
#* Two member parents request it.
#* One member parent requests it and the nonmember parent gives permission.

== Membership considerations ==
In 2005, [[Peggy Fletcher Stack]], longtime religion columnist for ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', estimated that about one-third of the reported LDS membership was "active" (i.e., regularly attending church services and participating in other expected meetings and obligations).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]] (2005). [http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2890645&amp;itype=NGPSID Keeping members a challenge for LDS church], The Salt Lake Tribune,  July 26, 2005; accessed 20 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, this would have amounted to approximately 4 million active members among a worldwide LDS population of 12 million. Active membership varied from a high of 40 to 50 percent in congregations in North America and the Pacific Islands, to a low of about 25 percent in Latin America. Fletcher Stack's data was compiled from several sources, including a 2001 survey of religious affiliation by scholars at [[City University of New York]] and a demographer at LDS-owned [[Brigham Young University]].

In 2003, [[Quorum of the Apostles (LDS Church)|apostle]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]], noted that among recent converts "attrition is sharpest in the two months after baptism", which he attributed in part to difficulties adapting to the church's dietary code the [[Word of Wisdom]] that prohibits use of alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea.&lt;ref&gt;Dallin H. Oaks (2003; adapted from a 2000 speech). [https://www.lds.org/ensign/2003/03/the-role-of-members-in-conversion?lang=eng The Role of Members in Conversion], TheEnsign.com; accessed 20 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, sociologist [[Armand Mauss]] estimated that about 50 percent of LDS converts in the US stopped attending church within a year of baptism, while outside the US the rate was about 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy Willis (2001). [https://lasvegassun.com/news/2001/may/04/mormon-church-is-funding-its-future/ Mormon Church is funding its future], The Las Vegas Sun; accessed 20 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Preacher and the Slave"''' is a song written by [[Joe Hill]] in 1911. It was written as a [[parody]] of the hymn "[[In the Sweet By-and-By]]". The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (commonly known as the Wobblies) concentrated much of its labor trying to organize [[migrant worker]]s in [[lumber]] and [[construction]] camps. When the workers returned to the cities, the Wobblies faced the [[Salvation Army]] (which they satirized as the "Starvation Army").{{sfn|Adler|2011|p=12}} Hill had first encountered the Salvation Army in [[Sweden]] when he was a child.{{sfn|Adler|2011|p=181}}

Several songs were written parodying the Salvation Army's hymns, "The Preacher and the Slave" being the most successful.  In this song, Joe Hill coined the phrase "[[wiktionary:pie in the sky|pie in the sky]]."{{sfn|Adler|2011|p=182}} The song is often referred to as "Pie in the Sky", or as "Long Haired Preachers" (which was its original title).{{sfn|Adler|2011|pp=20, 130}} It was first published in the 4th edition of the ''[[Little Red Songbook]]'' in 1911.{{sfn|Adler|2011|p=130}}

 G                      D             G
 Then you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye 
&lt;/pre&gt;
The chorus is sung in a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] pattern.
{{poemquote|You will eat [You will eat] bye and bye [bye and bye]
In that glorious land above the sky [Way up high]
Work and pray [Work and pray] live on hay [live on hay]
You'll get pie in the sky when you die [That's a lie!]

Thus the final verse becomes:
You will eat [You will eat] bye and bye [bye and bye]
When you've learned how to cook and how to fry [How to fry]
Chop some wood [Chop some wood], 'twill do you good [do you good]
Then you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye [That's no lie]}}

'''''The War at Home''''' is an American [[situation comedy|sitcom]] created by [[Rob Lotterstein]] that ran from September 11, 2005 to April 22, 2007 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It follows the antics of a largely dysfunctional [[Long Island]] family. The show lasted for two full seasons but was not renewed for a third season.

==Cast and characters==
* [[Michael Rapaport]] as David "Dave" Gold
* [[Anita Barone]] as Victoria "Vicky" Gold
* [[Kyle Sullivan]] as Lawrence Allen "Larry" Gold
* [[Kaylee DeFer]] as Hillary Gold
* [[Dean Collins (actor)|Dean Collins]] as Michael "Mike" Gold
* [[Rami Malek]] as Khaleel Nazeeh "Kenny" Al-Bahir

==Overview==
The show depicts the daily lives of Dave and Vicky and their three children on [[Long Island, New York]], dealing with normal family issues. Dave is a [[middle class]] Jewish insurance salesman. He is often portrayed as insensitive and cynical, and sometimes as a paranoid, overprotective and hypocritical [[bigot]]. His family (especially Larry) find it difficult to accept his behaviour. Dave is constantly scolded and insulted (and even punched once) by Larry for always picking on him. It is established toward the end of season one that Dave is the way he is because he had a father who constantly badgered him. Dave's wife Vicky is an attractive Italian-American Catholic part-time receptionist at a Doctors' office. Generally levelheaded, she usually spends her time dealing with Dave's unreasonable behavior, but can be quite obnoxious herself.

Of their three children, the oldest is Hillary ([[Kaylee DeFer]]), a typical 17-year-old who frequently misbehaves, trying to get away with bad behavior behind the backs of her parents, who often regard her with suspicion. Second oldest is 16-year-old Larry ([[Kyle Sullivan]]), an odd misfit given to emotional outbursts (such as when Vicky denies him permission to see [[Brian Boitano]] star as [[Bilbo Baggins]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]] On Ice''). Larry is often seen with his best friend Kenny ([[Rami Malek]]). Initially Dave believes that the boys are both [[homosexual|gay]], but it is later revealed to the audience that while Larry is not gay, Kenny has a secret crush on Larry. Dave, and to a lesser extent Vicky, often treat Larry's flamboyancy with wary eyes. The youngest child, the [[puberty|pubescent]] 14-year-old Mike ([[Dean Collins (actor)|Dean Collins]]), must deal with issues such as [[masturbation]], [[dating]] and underage gambling. His character is portrayed as tougher and more cynical than Larry's.

The series frequently [[Fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] between segments of an episode, during which Dave or other characters deliver a [[Monologue|rant]] or other comment directly relating to the scene.

 |ShortSummary=16-year-old Hillary's father, Dave, refuses to let her go out on a date with a guy older than she is. So, to deceive him, she brings a new "study buddy" over to the house instead, but her friend, Taye, turns out to be black, which upsets Dave and Vicky.

 |ShortSummary=Vicky discovers some of Dave's secret instant messages he's been sending to someone with the screenname "Lonely Lady Michigan". She confronts him and compares his cybersex to cheating. He, in turn, accuses her of the same thing because she has been confiding in an ex-boyfriend via e-mail. Hillary, meanwhile, has some problems of her own... it is implied that her boyfriend Taye won't reciprocate sexually. Dave, completely misunderstanding what Hillary tells him, confronts her boyfriend Taye, and tells him that when a woman gives a man a gift, he should give her one in return.

 |ShortSummary=When Dave notices how nice Hillary has been to him recently, he is certain it's because she's having sex with someone. However, Mike convinces Dave that he is wrong. Dave then jumps to the conclusion that she's smoking pot when he notices his stash has gone missing. As he's confronting her about it, though, he accidentally lets it slip that the missing stash is his. He then lies and tells her that it's not really his—it belongs to Vicky's mother, Betty, who uses it for medicinal purposes. Mike overhears this, and buys some dope from the local playground to give to Grandma Betty, which he does, telling her it is from his dad. Vicky eventually finds the dope, and smokes it to help her cope with a boring book club meeting. Grandma Betty, meanwhile, has a party of her own. In the end, Larry is shown that he took the stash from Hillary's drawer, showing that she took the stash after all.

The account portrays Jesus as an impostor. 

The stories claim that Jesus ([[Yeshu]]) was an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] child, and that he practiced [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[Heresy in Judaism|heresy]], seduced women, and died a shameful death.&lt;ref name=webster&gt;{{cite book

But they also show a paradoxical respect for Jesus.

Both [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] scholars in modern times have paid little attention to the Toledot.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of Father [[Edward H. Flannery]] is representative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This scurrilous fable of the life of Jesus is a medieval work, probably written down in the tenth century. ....  Though its contents enjoyed a certain currency in the oral traditions of the Jewish masses, it was almost totally ignored by official or scholarly Judaism. Anti-Semites have not failed to employ it as an illustration of the [[blasphemous]] character of the Synagogue."&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Edward H., ''The Anguish of the Jews:  Twenty-three centuries of Anti-Semitism'' (1965, NY, Macmillan) page 283 (footnote 30 to chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This disregard has recently been lifting as the text becomes discussed as a possible window into the early history of [[polemic]] between [[Christian-Jewish relations|Christians and Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;*Meerson, Michael, and Peter Schäfer.

==Composition and dating==
Recent scholarship has given increased attention to the date of origin of the Toledot Yeshu. The early layers are considered to have been manufactured orally. The first textual proof subsists of fragments of Aramaic manuscripts discovered in Cairo.&lt;ref name="Burke2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sj5gCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|title=Forbidden Texts on the Western Frontier: The Christian Apocrypha in North American Perspectives: Proceedings from the 2013 York University Christian Apocrypha Symposium|author=Cornelia Horn|date=27 July 2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-4982-0982-3|editor=Tony Burke|pages=117–|chapter=Forbidden texts on the Western Frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study reports that more than 100 manuscripts of the Toledot exist, almost all of them late medieval (the oldest manuscript being from the 11th century).&lt;ref name = "Ben Ezra"&gt;Ben Ezra, Daniel Stokl, ''An Ancient List of Christian Festivals in Toledot Yeshu'', Harvard Theological Review, vol. 102, nr. 4 (Oct. 2009) pages 483-484.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest stratum of composition was probably in [[Aramaic]]. There are [[recension]]s extant in [[Hebrew]], and later versions in [[Judeo-Persian]] and [[Arabic]] as well as [[Yiddish]] and [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (Judeo-Spanish).&lt;ref name=gero&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of composition cannot be ascertained with certainty and there are conflicting views as to what markers denote dates. For instance, the Toledot refers to Christian festivals and observances that only originated after the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Ezra, Daniel Stokl, ''An Ancient List of Christian Festivals in Toledot Yeshu'', Harvard Theological Review, vol. 102, nr. 4 (Oct. 2009) p. 488; also, Leiman, Sid Z., ''The Scroll of Fasts: The Ninth of Tebeth'', Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. n.s. 74, nr. 2 (Oct. 1983) p.186-188, p.195.

|isbn=0-521-81746-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in his ''Incredible Shrinking Son of Man'' [[Robert M. Price]] states that the Toledot Yeshu is "dependent on second-century Jewish-Christian gospel",&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert (2003) ''Incredible Shrinking Son of Man'' pg 40&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexander argues that the oral traditions behind the written versions of the Toledot Yeshu might go all the way back to the formation of the canonical narratives themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, P. ‘Jesus and his Mother in the Jewish Anti-Gospel (the Toledot Yeshu)’, in eds. C. Clivaz et al., ''Infancy Gospels'', Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck GmbH &amp; Co. KG, 2011, pp. 588-616.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unlikely that one person is the author, since the narrative itself has a number of different versions, which differ in terms of the story details and the attitude towards the central characters. Even individual versions seem to come from a number of storytellers.&lt;ref name="Judaica"/&gt;

Some scholars assert that the source material is no earlier than the 6th century, and the compilation no earlier than the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Worth, Roland H., Jr., ''Alternative Lives of Jesus:  Noncanonical accounts through the early Middle Ages'' (2003, NC, McFarland &amp; Co.) pages 49-50; also, Dan, Joseph, "Toledot Yeshu" in ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' (2nd ed. 2007, Farmington Hills, Mich., Macmillin Reference USA) page 29; "The complete narrative, which could not have been written before the tenth century, used earlier sources ....".&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the individual anecdotes that make up the Toledot Yeshu may all come from sources dating before the sixth century, there is no evidence that their gathering into a single narrative is that early.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Joseph, ''Jesus of Nazareth:  His life, times, and teaching'' (orig. 1922, Engl. transl. 1925, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin) pages 52-53 ("The present Hebrew ''Tol'doth Yeshu'', even in its earliest form, ... was not composed before the tenth century").&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as Jeffrey Rubenstein, favour a late composition date, posterior to the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, ''Stories of the Babylonian Talmud’’ (2010), p 272: "There is not one shred of evidence that Toledot Yeshu existed in written form in Babylonian in the seventh century, as Gero claims it did, nor that the Bavli knew it."&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known mention is an oblique mention by [[Agobard]], [[archbishop of Lyon]], circa. 826, and then another mention by his successor, [[Amulo]], circa 849.&lt;ref name="schafer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agobard of Lyons, ''De Iudaicis Superstitionibus'', cited in Van Voorst, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Schonfield, Hugh J., ''According to the Hebrews'' (1937, London: Duckworth) pages 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Agobard does not refer to the source by name it cannot be certain that this is the Toledot.&lt;ref&gt;See Klausner, Joseph, ''Jesus of Nazareth:  His life, times, and teaching'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1925), page 53 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

The source material for the Toledot can be said to derive from four sources: (1) Jewish rabbinic literature; (2) canonical Christian scriptures; (3) noncanonical Christian writings; (4) pagan anti-Christian writings of the Roman period.

The largest source of input to the Toledot seems to be anecdotes gathered from various parts of the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the Talmudic references in Division 1.A of Herford, R. Travers, ''Christianity in Talmud and Midrash'' (1903, London; reprinted 1966, NJ, Reference Book Publ'rs) pages 35-96 https://archive.org/details/christianityinta00herfuoft .&lt;/ref&gt;
These appear to be popular adaptions of material aimed against two Christian doctrines, the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]].&lt;ref name=voorst/&gt;
Some of the Talmudic anecdotes are clearly fictitious or absurd, and some seem incompatible with each other or with known historical fact.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Joseph, ''Jesus of Nazareth:  His life, times, and teaching'' (orig. 1922, Engl. transl. 1925, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin) pages 26 &amp; 51 ("the book contains no history worth the name"), as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;
In some instances, the Talmudic source of the Toledot is very obscure or of doubtful authenticity, and may not originally have been relevant to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the "nativity" account in chapter 1 of the Strassburg version of the Toledot is derived from ''Kallah'', a purported Talmudic tractate whose provenance is so uncertain that it did not appear in print until 1864. (See Herford, R. Travers, ''Christianity in Talmud and Midrash'' (London, 1903) pages 487-50; Strack, H.L., &amp; Stemberger, G., ''Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash'' (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991) page 250; Klausner, Joseph, ''Jesus of Nazareth:  His life, times, and teaching'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1925) page 52.) Moreover, the anecdote in ''Kallah'' may not refer to Jesus at all (See Schonfield, Hugh J., ''According to the Hebrews'' (London: Duckworth, 1937) page 222; Herford, ''op.cit'', page 49; and Klausner, ''op.cit.'', page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, the Toledot seems to know (though sometimes only superficially) of the miracles of the canonical Gospels, and does not deny their occurrence, but instead attributes them to Yeshu's use of Egyptian magic, or his misuse of the secret [[Yahweh|Divine Name]] - though not to diabolical influences.&lt;ref&gt;Concurrences with the gospel accounts include the fact that Jesus's parents were named Joseph and Mary; that he was born in Bethlehem; that he was bold toward the Jewish elders; that he could perform miracles (here made out to be sorcery); that he claimed to be born of a virgin; that he claimed to be the Son of God; that he applied [[Isaiah 7:14]] to himself; that he raised the dead; that he healed a leper; that Jews fell down and worshipped him; that he entered Jerusalem upon an ass; that he applied to himself [[Book of Zechariah|Zacharias]] 9:9; that he charged the Jews with being stiff-necked people; that he applied to himself the 2nd and 110th [[Psalms]]; that he walked on water; that he was betrayed by [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]; that he was scourged, crowned with thorns, and given vinegar to drink; that he was put to death on the [[Passover]] and buried before the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] began; and  that his twelve apostles spread a story of his resurrection.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Joshua, ''The Devil and the Jews'' (1961, Philadelphia, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 230 (footnote 11 to chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the anecdotes recounted in the Toledot seem to have been drawn from non-canonical early Christian writings known as [[apocryphal gospels]], datable to the 4th – 6th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., the Strassburg version of Toledot tells the story that Yeshu, using magic, made clay birds come to life and fly. This closely resembles a story about the young Jesus found in the apocryphal “Infancy gospel of Thomas” and “Infancy gospel of pseudo-Matthew”. See Schonfield, Hugh J., ''According to the Hebrews'' (London: Duckworth, 1937), page 43; James, M.R., ''The Apocryphal New Testament'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924), pages 49, 55, and 76; Mead, George R.S., ''Did Jesus Live 100 BC?'' (London: Theosophical Publ'g Society, 1903), pages 264-265. For other examples see Baring-Gould, Sabine, ''The Lost and Hostile Gospels: an essay on the Toledoth Jeschu, and the Petrine and Pauline Gospels of the first three centuries of which fragments remain'' (London, 1874), pages 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution of Yeshu’s paternity to a soldier named Pandera or [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera|Pantera]] can be traced to the second-century Greek philosopher [[Celsus]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Origen, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen161.html '' Contra Celsus'' 1.32]&lt;/ref&gt;
though Celsus himself may have picked up this detail from a Jewish source.  Jews apparently polemicised actively against the new Christian religion, as can be inferred from the 2nd century Christian writer [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'', a fictional dialogue between a Christian and a Jew. In chapter 17 Justin claims that the Jews had sent out "chosen men" throughout the Roman Empire to polemicize against Christianity, calling it a "godless heresy".&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xvii.html Dialogue with Trypho ch. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

One early version of the Toledot Yeshu gave a milder description of Christianity. It did not cast aspersions on the characters of Mary and Jesus, instead it sought to undermine the tenets of the Christian faith. The goal was to seek the return of [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostates]] to the Jewish fold. To Tartakoff it seems that the Toledot may have been modified by Jews to fit into specific situations.&lt;ref name="Tartakoff2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7w_wN6nuhk0C&amp;pg=PA123|title=Between Christian and Jew: Conversion and Inquisition in the Crown of Aragon, 1250-1391|author=Paola Tartakoff|date=24 July 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0675-4|pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian response==

From the 9th through the 20th centuries the Toledot has inflamed Christian hostility towards Jews.&lt;ref name=tolan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schonfield, Hugh J., ''The History of Jewish Christianity'', (1936, London, Duckworth) page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1405, the Toledot was banned by Church authorities&lt;ref&gt;Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe, ''Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History'' (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press) pages 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt;   A book under this title was strongly condemned by [[Francesc Eiximenis]] (d. 1409) in his ''Vita Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=90-04-11398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1614 it was largely reprinted by a Jewish apostate, [[Samuel Friedrich Brenz]], in Nuremberg, as part of his book vilifying his former religion, titled "Skin Shed by the Jewish Snake".&lt;ref&gt;Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe, ''Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History'' (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press) page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

An indirect witness to the Christian condemnation of the book can be found in one manuscript of the Toledot, which has this cautionary note in its introduction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[This booklet] should be shown only to people of discretion, for one never knows what the morrow may bring. ... I copied it from three different pamphlets from three different countries, not just one, The contents of all these pamphlets were identical, except that I wrote it in the language of prudence [- namely, Hebrew, because Gentiles do not understand it].&lt;ref&gt;Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe, ''Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History'' (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press), page 185 (quoting a reprint in Krauss).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] quoted the Toledot (evidently the Strassburg version) at length in his general condemnation of Jews in his book [[Vom Schem Hamphoras]] in 1543.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Gerhard, ''The Jew in Christian Theology:  Martin Luther's anti-Jewish Von Schem Hampharos, previously unpublished in English, and other milestones in church doctrine concerning Judaism'' (1992, Jefferson, NC, McFarland) 296 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the two centuries after Luther, the Toledot reached the height of its fame and was well sought after by scholars and travelers alike. In 1681 Professor Johannes Christoph Wagenseil published an entire volume devoted to refuting the Toledot. Attitudes towards the work became more diversified during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="MeersonSchäfer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Meerson|author2=Peter Schäfer|title=Toledot Yeshu: The Life Story of Jesus: Two Volumes and Database.

==Historiography==

===Ramón Martí version===

Long unknown to Christians, the Toledot was first translated into [[Latin]] by [[Ramón Martí]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]], toward the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref name= webster/&gt;

===Wagenseil version, 1681===

Among the versions of the Toledot, the version published by [[Johann Wagenseil|Johann Christian Wagenseil]] is perhaps the most prominent.

In 1681 Wagenseil, a professor at the [[University of Altdorf]], published a Hebrew text of the ''Toledot Yeshu'' with a Latin translation, in a book titled "Satan's Flaming Arrow" (''Tela Ignea Satanae'').&lt;ref&gt;Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe, ''Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Jewish History'' (1977, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Press) page 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section treats Jesus's life; later sections deal with the exploits of his [[apostles]].  Supplementary chapters tell of [[Nestorius]] and his attempts to keep Christians obeying Jewish custom, and the story of [[Simeon Kepha]] who is construed to be the [[Apostle Peter]] or Paul.&lt;ref name=voorst/&gt;

Jesus is portrayed as a seducer and a [[Heresy|heretic]], showing a connection to the traditions in [[Celsus]] and [[Justin Martyr]] (see above).

====Summary of Wagenseil version====

A great misfortune struck Israel in the year 3651 (c. 90 BCE). A man of the tribe of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]], Joseph [[Pandera]], lived near a widow who had a daughter called Miriam.  This virgin was betrothed to Yohanan, a Torah-learned and God-fearing man of the house of [[David]]. Before the end of a certain [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], Joseph looked lustfully at Miriam, knocked on her door and pretended to be her husband, but she only submitted against her will. When Yohanan came later to see her, she was surprised how strange his behavior was. Thus they both knew of Pandera’s crime and Miriam’s fault. Without witnesses to punish Pandera, Yohanan left for Babylonia.

Miriam gave birth to [[Yeshua]], whose name later depreciated to [[Yeshu]]. When old enough, she took him to study the Jewish tradition. One day he walked with his head uncovered, showing disrespect, in front of the sages. This betrayed his illegitimacy and Miriam admitted him as Pandera’s son. Scandalised, he fled to [[Upper Galilee]].

Yeshu later went to the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] and learned the letters of [[Tetragrammaton|God’s ineffable name]] (one could do anything desired by them). He gathered 310 young men and proclaimed himself the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]], claiming [[Isaiah 7:14|Isaiah]]’s “a virgin shall conceive and bear a son” and other prophets [[Claimed Messianic prophecies of Jesus|prophesied about him]].  Using God’s name he healed a lame man, they worshipped him as the Messiah. The [[Sanhedrin]] decided to arrest him, and sent messengers to invite him to Jerusalem. They pretended to be his disciples to trick him.

Bound before [[Helena of Adiabene|Queen Helen]], the sages accused him of [[Witchcraft|sorcery]]. When he brought a corpse to life, she released him.

Accused again, the queen sent for his arrest. He asked his disciples not to resist. Using God’s name he [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|made birds of clay]] and caused them to fly. The sages then got [[Judas Iscariot|Judah Iskarioto]] to learn the name. At a contest of miracles between the two, they both lost knowledge of the name.

Yeshu was arrested and beaten with pomegranate staves. He was taken to Tiberias and bound to a synagogue pillar.  Vinegar was given to him to drink and a [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]] was put on his head. An argument broke out between the elders and Yeshu followers resulting in their escape to [[Antioch]] (or Egypt). On the day before the [[Passover]], Yeshu decided to go to the Temple and recover the secret name. He entered Jerusalem [[Jesus on a donkey|riding on an ass]], but one of his followers, Judah Iskarioto, told the sages he was in the Temple. On a day before the Passover, they tried to hang him on a tree; using the name he caused it, and any tree they should use, to break.  A cabbage stalk, being not a tree, was used successfully to hang him on, and he was buried.

His followers on Sunday told the queen that he was not in his grave, that he ascended to heaven as he had prophesied. As a gardener took him from the grave, they searched it and could not find him. But the gardener confessed he had taken it to prevent his followers from stealing his body and claiming his [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension to heaven]]. Recovering the body, the sages tied it to horse tail and took it to the queen. Convinced he was a [[false prophet]], she ridiculed his followers and commended the sages.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst. pp. 123–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strassburg Manuscript===

In the [[Strassburg]] Manuscript, Mary was seduced by a soldier called Ben Pandera.  The child Jesus shows great impudence by appearing bareheaded and disputing the [[Torah|Law]] with teachers.  The miracle working powers of Jesus are attributed to having stolen the [[Names of God in Judaism|Name of God]] from the [[Temple]].  Jesus claims messianic dignity and is accused of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] by the Jews in front of Queen [[Helena of Adiabene|Helena of Jerusalem]], but Jesus raises a man from the dead in front of the Queen's eyes and is released.  Jesus goes to [[Galilee]] where he brings clay birds to life and makes a millstone float.  (Klausner notes that the Toledot scarcely ever denies Gospel miracles, but merely changes good to evil.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Joseph, ''Jesus of Nazareth:  His life, times, and teaching'' (orig. 1922, Engl. transl. 1925, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin) page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;)   [[Judas Iscariot]], the hero of the tale, learns the Divine Name as well, and Jesus and Judas fly through the sky engaged in [[aerial combat]], with Judas victorious.  The now powerless Jesus is arrested and put to death by being hung upon a [[carob]] tree, and buried.

But Jesus's body is found hidden in a garden and is dragged back to Jerusalem and shown to Queen Helena.&lt;ref name=gero/&gt;

===Huldreich version, 1705===

A third major recension was published by Johann Jacob Huldreich (or Huldrich) in Leyden, Holland, in 1705, with a Latin translation, as ''Historia Jeschuae Nazareni'' by "Johannes Jocabus Huldricus".  This was based on a Hebrew manuscript, now lost, and has its own unique variants.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfield, Hugh J., ''According to the Hebrews'' (1937, London: Duckworth) page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  A summary of it is  presented by Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould, ''The Lost and Hostile Gospels'' (1874, London) pages 102-115, who surmised (because of some of the errors and anecdotes) that it was of medieval German origin, perhaps not even predating Martin Luther (page 115).  Baring-Gould noted (pages 69–71) that the Wagenseil version contains historical references that place its 'Yeshu' at least a century ''before'' the Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]] of the New Testament, and the Huldrich version contains references that place its 'Yeshu' at least a full century ''after'' the time of the Gospels.

===Krauss compilation, 1902===

[[Samuel Krauss]] reprinted a version recounting that [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Miriam]] had been betrothed to a nobleman by the name of Yochanan, who was both a descendant of the [[Davidic line|House of David]], and a God-fearing [[Torah]] scholar.&lt;ref name=schafer/&gt; In Yochanan's absence her neighbor, Yosef ben [[Yeshu#Yeshu ben Pandera|Pandera]] forced his way upon her,&lt;ref&gt;Later Slavonic versions portray Mary as active in the adulterous affair. Schafer, ''Op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; coercing her into an act of [[sexual intercourse]] during her [[Niddah]] (i.e., menstruation, a period of ritual impurity during which relations are forbidden according to [[Halacha|Jewish Law]]). The fruit of the affair was a son she named Yeshu, "the bastard son of a menstruate woman."&lt;ref name=schafer/&gt;

Krauss's book, ''Das Leben Jesu nach juedischen Quellen'', published in Berlin in 1902, contained a study of nine different versions of the Toledot, and remains the leading scholarly work in the field (but has not yet been translated into English).&lt;ref name="Dan"/&gt;

===English versions===

The first translation into English seems to date from 1874, when [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] published ''The Lost and Hostile Gospels'', which included lengthy summaries of two versions of the Toledot – one called the Wagenseil and one called the Huldreich (so named from the editor of a 1705 Latin edition) - as well as quotations and descriptions of apochryphal and lost gospels of early Christian history. He regarded the Toledot as being a kind of early anti-Christian folklore, largely motivated by the oppression suffered by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/lostandhostileg00barigoog Baring-Gould, Sabine, ''The Lost and Hostile Gospels: an essay on the Toledoth Jeschu, and the Petrine and Pauline Gospels of the first three centuries of which fragments remain'' (London, 1874). The Wagenseil Toledoth is summarized on pages 76-101, the Huldreich version summarized on pages 102-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, [[G.R.S. Mead]], a well known [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]], published ''Did Jesus Live 100 BC?'', which treated the Toledoth Yeshu as sufficiently authentic and reliable to postulate, on the basis of its mention of historic figures such as Queen Helene, that Jesus actually lived a century earlier than commonly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, George R.S., ''Did Jesus Live 100 BC?'' (1903, London, Theosophical Publ'g Society) 440 pages, the Toledoth text (primarily from Strassburg ms) on pages 258-280;  https://archive.org/details/didjesuslive100b00meaduoft .&lt;/ref&gt;   Baring-Gould (page 71) notes that, although the Wagenseil version named the Queen as Helene, she is also expressly described as the widow of [[Alexander Jannaeus]], who died BCE 76, and whose widow was named [[Salome Alexandra]] and she died in BCE 67.

In 1937, the Jewish New Testament scholar [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] published ''According to the Hebrews'', which theorized that the Toledot was considerably more ancient than commonly thought and may have originally constituted the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], a lost (and presumably heretical) book mentioned by name, but not otherwise described, in some early Christian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfield, Hugh J., ''According to the Hebrews'' (1937, London: Duckworth) 272 page, the Toledoth text (primarily from the Stassburg ms) on pages 35-61.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, scholarly consensus generally sees the Toledot as an unreliable source for the [[historical Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Van Voorst, "It may contain a few older traditions from ancient Jewish polemics against Christians, but we learn nothing new or significant from it". However, [[Jane Schaberg]] contends that the Toledot lend weight to the theory that [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary conceived Jesus]] as the result of being raped. See Van Voorst, ‘’op. cit.’’&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These books provided translations of the Toledot. Mead included some indelicate verses which Schonfield edited out, but Schonfield was the more erudite scholar, and he identified Talmudic and Islamic passages that may have supplied the content of the Toledoth.

'''Trinidad Orisha''', also known as '''Shango''', is a [[syncretic religion]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and is of [[Caribbean]] origin, originally from West Africa ([[Yoruba religion]])  and influenced by [[Roman Catholicism]]. Trinidad Orisha incorporates elements of [[Spiritual Baptist|Spiritual Baptism]], and the closeness between Orisha and Spiritual Baptism has led to use of the term "Shango Baptist" to refer to members of either or both religions. Anthropologist James Houk described Trinidad Orisha as an "[[Afro-American religion|Afro-American religious complex]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houk|first=James|title=Spirits, Blood, and Drums: The Orisha Religion in Trinidad|year=1995|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating elements mainly of [[traditional African religion]] and [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] and incorporates some elements of [[Christianity]] ([[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]), [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] (especially [[Sufism]]), [[Buddhism]],  [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í]], and Trinidad [[Kabbalah]].

==Ritual music==
{{See also|List of Caribbean membranophones}}
Trinidad Orisha practice involves [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] singing accompanied by a trio of drums. Orisha drums are double-headed bi-tensorial cylinders derived from Yoruba ''bembe'' drums (similar to the Cuban ''Iyesá'' drums). The drum that is lowest in pitch is called the ''bo'' or ''kongo''. The lead drum is called "center drum," "big drum," or ''bembe''. The smallest drum, highest in pitch, is called ''umele''. The first two drums are played with a single stick plus hand combination, while the ''umele'' is played with a pair of sticks. All of the sticks are curved at the end, and resemble a shepherd's crook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazinet|first=Ryan|title=Re-Constructing Place and Space|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|editor=Kamille Gentles-Peart and Maurice L.
