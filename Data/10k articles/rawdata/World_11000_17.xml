{{Politics of the African Union mini|institutions|width=5em}}

The '''African Unification Front''' ('''AUF''') is an organisation aiming to promote the [[political]], [[social]] and [[economic]] union of [[Africa]].

==History==
AUF was formed in August 1996. The AUF advocates for transformation of Africa into a federation, with the [[Pan African Parliament]] as the highest government, overseeing key institutions including a single currency, and one all-African army. The AUF promoted the creation of the [[African Union]] in the mid-1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Telò (ed.)|first1=Professor Mario|title=Globalisation, Multilateralism, Europe: Towards a Better Global Governance?, Section 2.1|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ntn6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT452&amp;dq=African+Unification+Front&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20Unification%20Front&amp;f=false|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=9781472405388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to advocate for an end to neocolonialism. It has also been active in campaigns against abuses by the diamond industry, weapons traders, and unfair [[terms of trade]] in the [[coffee]] industry.

==Organization==
The AUF National Committee is the body that elects the AUF president. The AUF Executive Committee is the body that implements policies and oversees the day-to-day administration of the AUF. AUF has been responsible for initiating and organizing several strategies, including the AUF's Fairtrade Coffee Campaign that pushed for reforms in the coffee industry.

The AUF, also known as the [[African Front]], consists of a worldwide network of supporters, who believe that Africa must be unified into a [[federation]] as a means of securing peace and an end to [[war]]s and [[poverty]]. Although most members of the AUF are Africans, membership is open to non-Africans.

===Past leaders===
Other past AUF leaders have been Fesseha Demessae who served as Deputy Secretary General and Director of Cultural Affairs, and former vice-president [[Mongezi Sefika wa Nkomo]].

[[Kirimi Kaberia]] was the first president of the AUF. [[Mouhamed Taofic Youssouf]] served briefly as AUF president, after Kirimi Kaberia accepted a posting as deputy ambassador for Kenya in Washington DC, USA.

==In the PAP==
Following the creation of the [[Pan African Parliament]], the AUF became the first All-African (continental) political party. Several PAP members are also members and supporters of the AUF.

AUF members who have served in the Pan African Parliament include Dr. [[Amani Walid Kabourou]] from Tanzania, [[Chrispin Mwitila Shumina]] from Zambia, and [[Loyce Bwambale]] from Uganda. Other influential supporters of the AUF include [[John Atta-Mills]] the president of Ghana, [[Alhaji Yahaya Ndu]] who is also a member of the AUF National Committee and the president of the [[African Renaissance Party]] in Nigeria, [[Alimamy Bakarr Sankoh]], head of the [[Sierra Leone People's Democratic League]] (PDL), and Dr. [[Miria Matembe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanfront.com/AF042.php africanfront.com (AUF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly chair of the Pan African Parliament's Rules Committee and a close ally of AU President [[Gertrude Mongella]].

==Symbols==
The [[Maure]] is used as the AUF's [[flag]] and [[emblem]].

The '''Battle of Mbandi Kasi''' was a military engagement between forces of [[Portuguese Angola]] and the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] during their first armed conflict which spanned from 1622 to 1623.  The battle, while not widely reported by the Portuguese, was recorded in correspondence between the Kongolese and their Dutch allies.  The battle marked the turn of the short war in the favor of Kongo and led to the ouster of the Portuguese governor of Luanda and the return of Kongolese subjects taken as slaves in earlier campaigns.

The '''Bituriges Vivisci''' were one of the tribes of [[Gaul]]. The tribe's capital was in Burdigala, modern-day [[Bordeaux]]. The Vivisci traded wine which they produced themselves.

''Bituriges'' is often taken to mean ''Kings of the World''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Conquest of Gaul By Julius Caesar|year=1983|publisher=[[Penguin Classics]]|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FbuvaXmRqdcC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=Bituriges+tribe|author= Stanley Alexander Handford, Jane F.

Some believe that the Bituriges Vivisci and the Bituriges Cubi once made up one single tribe, but seemed to have fallen apart, with the Vivisci staying in Burdigala, and the Cubi founding a new capital, Avaricum in the ''Berry'' region. The latter defended Avaricum against the Roman armies under [[Julius Caesar]], who destroyed the town and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67280/Bituriges#ref210784&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Strabo&lt;ref&gt;Geographia IV 2,1&lt;/ref&gt; their territory was surrounded by that of the [[Aquitani]]an people, but the Bituriges Vivisci were not themselves Aquitanian and took no part in their political affairs.

'''Body in Balance''' (BiB) is a [[TV channel]] which broadcasts from London, UK. It was the UK's first health and wellbeing channel.

It airs programming about [[yoga]], [[pilates]], [[meditation]], [[health]] &amp; [[Spirituality|spiritual]] well being. There are regional versions of the channel for [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Serbia]] and, more recently, [http://www.bodyinbalance.gr Greece]. In 2014, the channel plans to launch an online video on demand service.

==Background==
Customers and prospects 
Body in Balance was established in 2005 as a German-language channel. An English-language version, the UK's first leisure and health channel, followed in 2007. The channels were founded in response to the increasing popularity of yoga in both countries.

In [[feudalism|feudal]] [[Europe]], a '''corporation''' (from the Latin {{lang|la|corpus}}, {{lang|la|corporis}} a body) was an aggregation of business interests into a single legal body, entity or compact, usually with an explicit license from city, church, or national leaders.  These functioned as effective [[monopoly|monopolies]] for a particular good or labor.

The term "corporation" was used as late as the 18th century in [[England]] to refer to such ventures as the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] or the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]: commercial organizations that operated under royal [[patent]] to have exclusive rights to a particular area of trade.  In the medieval town, however, corporations were a conglomeration of interests that existed either as a development from, or in competition with, [[guild]]s.  The most notable corporations were in trade and banking.

The effects of a corporation were similar to a monopoly.  On the one hand, the ability to have sole access to markets meant that the business was encouraged (e.g., the ability to be an exclusive trader provided an incentive to the East India Company to accept financial risks in exploration) and the negative effects of competition were avoided (to take the same example, exclusive patents cut down on merchants sponsoring piracy).  Innovation was stifled, however, and prices were unregulated.  (In the case of patent corporations, the town or monarch was ostensibly able to regulate prices by revoking the patent, but this rarely occurred.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2845">The '''Court of Assize''', ({{lang-nl|Hof van Assisen}}, {{lang-fr|Cour d'Assises}}) in [[Belgium]] is very similar to the [[Cour d'assises|French court]] of the same name. It has jurisdiction over all [[Felony|felonies]]{{clarify|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- a felony is a specific kind of common law offence. Should this say "serious offence"? --&gt; that have not been correctionalised,{{clarify|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- this is not an English word, what does it mean?? --&gt; over political offences and press-related offences, except those inspired by [[racism]] or [[xenophobia]], and over crimes of [[international law]], such as [[genocide]] and [[crime against humanity]]. These courts sit in each of the ten [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] and in the [[Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital|Brussels capital territory]]. Unlike the other courts, which have a permanent structure, a Court of Assize has to be constituted  for each specific case. It comprises three professional judges and 12 [[Jury|jurors]].

The presiding judge is to be a judge at a [[Court of Appeal (Belgium)|Court of Appeal]] and is assisted by two judges of [[Court of First Instance (Belgium)|Courts of First Instance]]. The jury invariably consists of twelve members, who are balloted out of the citizens having the right to vote at elections and ageing between thirty and sixty, and they must be able to read and write. In addition, it is possible to call up one to twelve alternate jurors. Only the jury decides upon the facts, and with the judges the penalty is determined. There is no appeal for the verdicts, apart from one before the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref&gt;

Mainly handling murder cases, it is the only court constitutionally authorized to judge [[delicts]] regarding the [[freedom of the press]] – though few practical cases have been considered to involve an infliction on that freedom and thus nearly all incidents were tried by lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Duchy of Amalfi''' ({{lang-it|Ducato di Amalfi}}, {{Lang-la|Ducatus Amalphitanus}}) or the '''Republic of Amalfi''' ({{lang-it|Repubblica di Amalfi|links=no}}) was a ''[[de facto]]'' independent state centered on the [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] city of [[Amalfi]] during the 10th and 11th centuries. The city and its territory were originally part of the larger ''[[ducatus Neapolitanus]]'', governed by a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]], but it extracted itself from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] vassalage and first elected a  [[dux|duke]] (or [[doge]]) in 958. During the 10&lt;sup href="Byzantine Empire"&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 11&lt;sup href="dux"&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries Amalfi was estimated to have a population of 50,000 -70,000 people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45102891|title=The riddle of the compass : the invention that changed the world|last=D.|first=Aczel, Amir|date=2001|publisher=Harcourt|isbn=0151005060|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=45102891}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rose to become an economic powerhouse, a commercial center whose merchants dominated [[Mediterranean]] and [[Italy|Italian]] trade for a century before being surpassed and superseded by the other [[maritime republics]] of [[Northern Italy|the North]], like [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. In 1073, Amalfi lost its independence and fell to the [[Normans]], from whose yoke it failed in two separate attempts to free itself.

==History==
The city of Amalfi was founded as a trading post in 339. Its first bishop was appointed in 596. In 838, the city was captured by [[Sicard of Benevento]] with help from traitors within the city, who led him in through the waterward defenses. Many of the Amalfitans in [[Salerno]] sacked that city and left. In 839, Amalfi freed itself from [[Lombards|Lombard]] domination and elected a [[prefect]]. Nearby [[Atrani]] participated in these early prefectural elections. Subsequently, Amalfi helped to free [[Siconulf]] to oppose the ruling [[Prince of Benevento]]. In 897, the self-governing republic, still nominally tied to the Byzantine Empire, was defeated in a war with [[Duchy of Sorrento|Sorrento]], supported by [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], in which her prefect was captured, later ransomed. In 914, the prefect [[Mastalus I of Amalfi|Mastalus I]] was appointed first [[judge]]. In 903 the Amalfitans joined forces with Naples to attack the Arabs that had established them selves on the banks of the [[Garigliano|Garigliano river]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30112695|title=Family power in southern Italy : the duchy of Gaeta and its neighbours, 850-1139|last=1965-|first=Skinner, Patricia,|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052146479X|location=Cambridge|oclc=30112695}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the combined forces of Amalfi and the Naples were driven back by the Arabs and their allies, the Italian city state of  [[Gaeta]]. In 915 Amalfi did not join the [[Battle of Garigliano]] to fight against the Arabs. This was most likely due to the fact that since 909 Amalfi had been heavily trading with the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and did not want to jeopardize relations with this powerful trade partner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 958, [[Mastalus II of Amalfi|Mastalus II]] was assassinated and [[Sergius I of Amalfi|Sergius I]] was elected first [[dux|duke]] (or [[doge]]). From 981 to 983, Amalfi ruled the [[Principality of Salerno]]. In 987, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Amalfi-Cava de' Tirreni|Amalfitan bishopric]] was raised to archiepiscopal status.

From 1034, Amalfi came under the control of the [[Principality of Capua]] and, in 1039, that of Salerno. In 1073, [[Robert Guiscard]] conquered the city and took the title ''dux Amalfitanorum'': "duke of the Amalfitans." In 1096, Amalfi revolted, but this was put down in 1101. It revolted again in 1130 and was finally subdued in 1131, when the [[John (Sicilian admiral)|Emir John]] marched on Amalfi by land and [[George of Antioch]] blockaded the town by sea and set up a base on [[Capri]]. In 1135 and 1137, Pisa sacked the city and the glory of Amalfi was past.

The Arab traveller [[Ibn Hawqal]], writing in 977 during the great reign of [[Manso I of Amalfi|Manso I]], described Amalfi as:
{{cquote
|''. . . la più prospera città di Longobardia, la più nobile, la più illustre per le sue condizioni, la più agiata ed opulenta. Il territorio di Amalfi confina con quello di Napoli; la quale è bella città, ma meno importante di Amalfi.

. . . the most prosperous Lombard city, the most noble, the most illustrious for its conditions, the most wealthy and opulent. The territory of Amalfi borders that of Naples; a beautiful city, but less important than Amalfi.}}

The title "Duke of Amalfi" was revived in the later 14th century as a title used within the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote these lines in a poem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hwlongfellow.org/poems_poem.php?pid=204|title=Longfellow: Amalfi, Masque of Pandora and Other Poems|website=www.hwlongfellow.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled Amalfi in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abbot Desiderius and the Ties Between Montecassino and Amalfi in the Eleventh Century|last=Willard|first=Henry M.|publisher=Montecassino|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Where are now the freighted barks
From the marts of east and west?
Where the knights in iron sarks
Journeying to the Holy Land,

Where the merchants with their wares,
And their gallant brigantines

Vanished like a fleet of cloud,
Like a passing trumpet-blast,
Are those splendors of the past,
And the commerce and the crowd!
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem is about medieval Amalfi. and it references the crusades and its important maritime history.

== Importance ==
After the Amalfitans broke free of Lombard control they did not return to Neapolitan control but instead stated their independence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After 839 Amalfi was an independent entity and created a strong maritime presence. Amalfi had strong ties with both the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1007067413|title=Conflict, commerce, and an aesthetic of appropriation in the Italian maritime cities, 1000-1150|last=R.,|first=Mathews, Karen|isbn=9789004335653|location=Leiden|oclc=1007067413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amalfitans had a permanent and important presence in [[Constantinople]] during the 10&lt;sup href="Category:Maritime republics"&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 11&lt;sup href="Category:History of Campania"&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries.  Amalfitans also created Latin Christian outposts in the [[Levant]] around 1040 and hostels for Christian pilgrims in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the 10&lt;sup href="Category:States and territories established in the 950s"&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 11&lt;sup href="Category:1073 disestablishments"&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries Amalfi was dominating trade and commerce with North Africa and the Levant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828621064|title=Medieval Italy : texts in translation|date=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|others=Jansen, Katherine Ludwig, 1957-, Drell, Joanna H., 1965-, Andrews, Frances.|isbn=0812206061|location=Philadelphia|oclc=828621064}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the major exports from Amalfi during the Middle Ages was the [[chestnut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/671307987|title=Ecologies and economies in medieval and early modern Europe : studies in environmental history for Richard C.

== The legacy of the Duchy of Amalfi ==
[[File:Amalfi2.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amalfi2.jpg|thumb|Statute of ''Flavio Gioia'' in Amalfi by [[Alfonso Balzico]], 1900]]While The Duchy of Amalfi never regained its independence after 1137 the city of Amalfi was still important to maritime trade for the next 200 years until 1343 when an earthquake and a storm destroyed most of its harbor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Probably the most important contribution Amalfi made during those 200 years before its harbor was destroyed was the perfection of the modern day box [[compass]]. Between 1295 and 1302 the [[Flavio Gioja|Flavio Gioia]] turned the compass from a needle floating in water to what we use today,  a round box with a compass card that rotates 360 degrees attached to a magnetic element.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Eesti Ekspress''''' (Estonian Express) was the first politically independent newspaper in the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] during the Soviet control of [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/conferences/2007/bcn2007/overview_of_science_reporting_eu_en.pdf|title=Overview of science reporting in the EU|work=[[European Commission]]|page=61|date=2007|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eurot/&gt; In March 2010 the paper was restarted as a magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kai Joost|title=Eesti Ekspress switches to mag format|url=http://balticreports.com/2010/02/12/eesti-ekspress-switches-to-mag-format/|accessdate=4 June 2016|work=Baltic Reports|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The paper was founded in 1989.&lt;ref name="eurot"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eesti Ekspress|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/148512/eesti-ekspress|accessdate=4 June 2016|work=Euro Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was published on 22 September 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Factsheet. Eesti Ekspress|url=http://www.publicitas.com/belgium/media-solutions/factsheet/mediadata/eesti-ekspress/?PARAM1=EUVET3#.V1MLYJOLTVo|accessdate=4 June 2016|work=Publicitas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making use of [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], it was established as a weekly newspaper in 1989&lt;ref name="eurot"/&gt; by [[Hans H. Luik]] and others. The headquarters is in Tallinn.&lt;ref name="eurot"/&gt; The paper is published by AS Eesti Ajalehed.&lt;ref name="eurot"/&gt; In essentially the same format, although with a number of appendices, it is still every week. The day of the issue changed from Thursday to Wednesday&lt;ref name="eurot"/&gt; on 30 April 2014.

Success of ''Eesti Ekspress'' led to Hans H. Luik's becoming an established [[media mogul]].

''Eesti Ekspress'' has a liberal stance and is one of the [[Investigative journalism|investigative publications]] in Estonia.&lt;ref name="eurot"/&gt; The newspaper has broken a number of important stories and been known for its innovation-mindedness.  Considerably thicker than other newspapers of the late Soviet era, it was one of the first to make use of [[Desktop publishing|digital publishing]] technologies and [[photographic typesetting]].  Consequently, it has been notorious for popularising the incorrect usage of 'sh' and 'zh' in substitution of the characters 'š' and 'ž', which in late 1980s were rather inconvenient for computer processing but appear in a number of Estonian loanwords (e.g. ''garaaž'', borrowed from French ''[[wikt:garage|garage]]'' and ''tšau'' from Italian ''[[wikt:ciao|ciao]]'') and names transliterated from Slavic languages, most importantly, [[Russian language|Russian]].

Today the newspaper remains one of the most popular newspapers in Estonia, with a circulation of 28,000 copies in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eall.ee/members.html|title=Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2708">'''G-15''' is a name given to a group in [[Eritrea]] that opposes the policy of President [[Isaias Afewerki]] postponing elections and their failure in implementing the constitution. The membership of this group consists of former members of the President's ruling [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ) which has ruled the country since its independence in 1993. In May 2001 the group issued an open letter raising criticism against Isayas Afeworki's actions calling them "illegal and unconstitutional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/82280/section/6 |title=Service for Life |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |page=6 of 12|date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 15 members of the group, 11 are imprisoned, three are now living in the [[United States]] and the last remaining one, Muhammad Berhan Belata, had left the group and rejoined the government. The 11 members who are imprisoned are thought to be charged with treason. The Central Office of the PFDJ believes that they share, "...a common guilt: at the minimum, abdication of responsibility during Eritrea's difficult hours, at the maximum, grave conspiracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200109260023.html |title=Eritrea: Party Puts its Case Against Dissidents |publisher=allAfrica.com |author=Charles Cobb, Jr. |date=26 September 2001 |accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] named the imprisoned 11 [[prisoners of conscience]] and called for their immediate release.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eritrea: Prisoners of conscience held for a decade must be released|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/eritrea-prisoners-conscience-held-decade-must-be-released-2011-09-15 |publisher=Amnesty International |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hesse's Demi Bastion''' is a [[bastion|demi-bastion]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It is part of the Northern Defences of Gibraltar. The bastion forms a link in a chain of fortifications which ascend the lower north-west slopes of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], below the [[King's Lines Battery]] and Bombproof Battery. The [[Moorish Castle]]'s Tower of Homage is at the top of the same incline.

==History==
It was originally the ''Baluado de S. Pedro'' (St. Peter's Bastion) during the Spanish period prior to the [[Capture of Gibraltar]] in 1704 under Prince [[George of Hesse-Darmstadt]], after whom the bastion is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC5QBR0oB04C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=Hesse%27s+Demi+Bastion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3z48iMho5F&amp;sig=tQW_BfH7nD89AgXOjngjlwnxFYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FSAoVKGoBsKXaqPagLgO&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Fortifications of Gibraltar 1068-1945|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old Spanish bastion was rebuilt and renamed by the British in 1730. In 1762, during the [[Seven Years' War]], it was armed with two 18-pdrs and four 4-pdrs to flank the ditch in front of the [[Landport Gate]]. By 1885 the bastion's guns were all 32-pdrs.&lt;ref name="Hughes265"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strong as the Rock of Gibraltar|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|last2=Migos|first2=Athanassios|publisher=Exchange Publications|year=1995|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kabuli Kid''''' is a 2008 French-Afghan drama film directed by [[Barmak Akram]]. It stars [[Haji Gul Aser]], [[Valéry Schatz]] and [[Amélie Glenn]].  The film, about a [[Kabul]]-based taxi driver who finds an infant left in his back seat, was screened at the [[65th Venice International Film Festival]]. It was produced by Fidélité Films, 4 à 4 Productions, and Les Auteurs Associés.

==Cast==
*[[Haji Gul Aser]] as Khaled
*[[Valéry Schatz]] as Mathieu
*[[Amélie Glenn]] as Marie
*[[Mohammad Chafi Sahel]] as Baba
*[[Leena Alam]] as Khaled's wife
*Messi Gul as the abandoned infant
*Saleha Khan Gul 
*Rohina Gul
*Mariam Hakimi

==Reception==
The film was critically acclaimed. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: "Observation and narrative are so skillfully intertwined that every detail gestates a potential full-blown story and every story point teems with cultural contradictions. Thus, when Khaled’s wife slips among the veiled women waiting to claim the infant, she silently unleashes a subversively alternate point of view. Highly accomplished tech credits reinforce pic’s authenticity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/kabuli-kid-1200470599/|title=Kabuli Kid|publisher=''Variety''|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="846">The '''Comorian legal system''' rests on [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and an inherited French [[legal code]]. Village elders or civilian courts settle most disputes. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the [[legislative]] and the [[Executive (government)|executive]]. The Supreme Court acts as a Constitutional Council in resolving constitutional questions and supervising presidential elections. As High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court also arbitrates in cases where the government is accused of [[malpractice]]. The Supreme Court consists of two members selected by the [[president]], two elected by the Federal Assembly, and one by the council of each island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11416">The '''[[mass surveillance]] industry''' is a multibillion-dollar [[economic sector]] which has undergone phenomenal growth rates since 2001. According to [[data]] provided by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the retail market for surveillance tools has grown from "nearly zero" in 2001 to about US$5 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Jennifer Valentino-Devries , [[Julia Angwin]] and Steve Stecklow|title=Document Trove Exposes Surveillance Methods|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203611404577044192607407780|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|quote=Intelligence agencies in the U.S. and abroad have long conducted their own surveillance. But in recent years, a retail market for surveillance tools has sprung up from "nearly zero" in 2001 to about $5 billion a year, said [[Jerry Lucas]], president of TeleStrategies Inc., the show's operator.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the video surveillance market rose to US$13.5 billion in 2012, and is expected to reach US$39 billion by 2020.&lt;ref name="fortunesurveillance"&gt;{{cite news|title=The great surveillance boom|url=http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/26/video-surveillance-boston-bombings/|accessdate=22 September 2013 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current developments ==
Fueled by widespread fears of terrorist attacks, the future of surveillance is particularly promising in the field of [[video content analysis]], where computers analyze live camera feeds to count the number of people, register [[temperature]] changes, and automatically identify suspicious behavior via [[statistic]]al [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref name="fortunesurveillance"/&gt; The following terrorist attacks have led to a significant increase in street-level surveillance:

* Shortly after the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombings]], police commissioner [[Edward F. Davis]] requested the installation of more [[cameras]] to boost street-level surveillance.&lt;ref name="bbsurveilance1"/&gt; The [[Mayor of New York City]], [[Michael Bloomberg]], said that the bombings are a "terrible reminder" of the importance of acquiring surveillance technology.&lt;ref name="bbsurveilance1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry Atlas and Greg Stohr|title=Surveillance Cameras Sought by Cities After Boston Bombs|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-04-29/boston-bombing-spurs-demand-for-video-monitoring-decried-by-aclu|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the aftermath of the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]], U.S. cities spent billions of dollars in federal [[counter-terrorism]] funding to deploy video sensors in public areas.&lt;ref name="bbsurveilance1"/&gt;

== Private intelligence agencies ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2013}}
[[Private intelligence agency|Private intelligence agencies]] are non-governmental [[corporations]] involved in the collection and analysis of information. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, such tasks were mostly performed by governmental agencies such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the gathering of intelligence was rapidly outsourced by the U.S. government to private intelligences agencies, which function as [[independent contractor]]s.&lt;ref name="wapoprivint"/&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', about one in four U.S. intelligence workers are contractors, and over 70 percent of the budget of the [[United States Intelligence Community]] is earmarked for payment to private firms.&lt;ref name="wapoprivint"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robert O’Harrow Jr., Dana Priest and Marjorie Censer|title=NSA leaks put focus on intelligence apparatus’s reliance on outside contractors|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-10/business/39873303_1_intelligence-agencies-intelligence-community-intelligence-analysts|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=22 September 2013|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An examination by The Post found that 1,931 private companies work on programs related to intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robert O’Harrow Jr.|title=The outsourcing of U.S. intelligence raises risks among the benefits|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-outsourcing-of-us-intelligence-raises-risks-among-the-benefits/2013/06/09/eba2d314-d14c-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=22 September 2013|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average annual cost of a contract employee is US$250,000, almost twice that of a federal employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robert O'Harrow Jr.|title=Costs Skyrocket As DHS Runs Up No-Bid Contracts|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062702988.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=22 September 2013|date=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Commercial mass surveillance often makes use of [[copyright]] laws and "[[clickwrap|user agreements]]" to obtain (typically uninformed) 'consent'
to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials.  This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed
by government agencies.  This data is then often shared with government agencies - thereby - in practice - defeating the purpose of such privacy protections.

Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 ''Special report on Internet Surveillance'' contained a list of "Corporate Enemies of the Internet", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. The five companies on the initial list were: [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[FinFisher|Gamma]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany), but the list was not exhaustive and is likely to be expanded in the future.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''], Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mending Kids ''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)3 non-profit organization]] that provides surgeries to children across the world while training local medical communities to become self-sustaining.  It brings surgical mission teams of doctors, nurses and volunteers who donate their time and services to travel to developing countries to perform procedures that range from [[pediatric]] open-heart, neuro, ENT, [[orthopedic]] or general surgeries on impoverished or orphaned children while establishing sustainable teaching programs.  
Since 2006, it has helped thousands of children in 54 countries around the world, including the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mendingkids.org/assets/pdf/HM_CaseStatement.pdf |title=MKI Hometown Mission facts and info sheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization currently operates in [[Burbank, California]].

== History ==
Cris Embleton started volunteering nearly 30 years ago by helping local hospitals and communities. After the death of her adopted daughter just prior to her first birthday, she started her own [[Non-profit Organization]] - 'Healing the Children',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.htcorwwa.org/Our-History.asp |title=History of Healing the Children |publisher=Htcorwwa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now running in 14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mendingkids.org/history.php |title=Our History — Mending Kids International. Hope. Love. Mend |publisher=Mendingkids.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; states. In order to expand the mission in California, Embleton and her local Board of Directors broke off from the organization and started Mending Kids International&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signalscv.com/archives/728/ Mending hearts through Mending Kids],
By Tammy Marashlian, The Santa Clarita Valley Signal&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005.

== Programs ==
:'''1)U.S. Surgeries''' –– The organization brings children with complex surgical needs to the United States for treatment in partnerships with hospitals such as –– [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]], [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] and [[UCLA Medical Center]] –– and several other medical organizations across Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasadenanow.com/main/a-mending-kids-international-gala-to-remember |title=A Mending Kids International Gala to Remember, By Franz A.D.

:[[File:Mending Kids Tanzania Surgical Mission 2015.png|thumb|Mending Kids patient in Tanzania photographed by volunteer, Rebecca Pollack Parker.]]'''2)Surgical Missions''' –– Mending Kids assembles pediatric surgical mission teams along with non-medical volunteers and takes them to developing countries to provide free specialized surgeries to under-served, impoverished and/or orphaned children. Surgical missions provide help to children who would otherwise not have access to this care in their own country. The missions' priorities are to provide local surgeons and medical staff with mentoring and specialized surgical training in order to create self-sustainment.  In 2014, MendingKids is scheduled to travel on 11 missions including: Ethiopia, Panama,Guatemala (2 trips), Mozambique, China, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua.

:'''3)International Surgeries''' –– Due to a variety of reasons, including funding, it may be near impossible to fly the child to Los Angeles or send a surgical mission team to serve one patient. To solve this type of cases, MendingKids arranges to fund or provide surgeries to these children locally or in neighboring countries by partnering with local hospitals and other NGOs who may have access to surgeons but not the necessary funding.

:'''4) Hometown Mission''' Mending Kids launched their first Hometown mission in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mendingkids.org/hometown-mission-2013.php |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301110130/http://www.mendingkids.org/hometown-mission-2013.php |archivedate=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program gives needed operations to children living in the United States treatment when they do not have access to the surgical care they need, or have been denied by providers. A volunteer surgical team from a local hospital perform operations on up to 20 children on one day over the summer.

'''Nova TV''' is a Romanian television channel, set up in [[Mediaș]] and it was first released on January 19, 2004 at 17.30. Nova TV is the only local television in the northern area of Sibiu County.

It was released under the title "Televiziunea care te priveşte" (The television who is watching you).

Marius Hihn coordinates the Nova TV team from the start of its broadcast. The chief editor of the local television says that this period has meant continuous progress, but also its own improvement. Currently, the team is made up of several experienced editors - among them Jimmy Ionescu, the developer of the talk show "În linia întâi" (In the first line) and Ada Gheorghe, producer of the "Mediaş 120" show.

'''Public Relations''' is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[Band (music)|band]], which was formed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url    = http://www.musicweb.cz/aktuality/public-relations-se-odrazeji-ode-dna-a-zacinaji-znovu | title  =  Public Relations se odrážejí ode dna a začínají znovu | publisher  = Musicweb.cz | accessdate = 31 January 2014|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite originally playing crossover, over time they have moved on to [[electronic rock]], fusing the common rock elements with an [[Electronic music|electronic]] instrumentation.

== History ==
Many musicians had been turning in the band until 2008 when its line-up finally settled down in its permanent form: Jiří Sosik – guitar, Tomáš Frieb – guitar, Tomáš Klos – bass, Lukáš Kroutil – drums, Lukáš Kraut – vocals.

In 2008 the group recorded its debut album called "No Turns" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url    = http://rockmag.cz/clanky/public-relations-no-turns/ | title  = No Turns review on Rockmag.cz | publisher  = Rockmag.cz | accessdate = 14 May 2011|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url    = http://www.praha-music-city.cz/?clanek=53&amp;titulek=public-relations-no-turns | title  = No Turns review by Petr Korál | publisher  = Praha Music City|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started performing live in clubs and on music festivals, enhanced by a [[percussions|percussionist]] Tomáš Demel. The drummer Lukáš Kroutil left the band the next year and his place was filled by Marek Konečný, who had just come back from the [[United States|USA]], where he had been playing drums in a band called Cold Summer Society, after 13 years. Later, the band continued performing, however, without Tomáš Demel, who decided not to perform with Public Relations henceforward.

Those days the band had been working hard on new material, which culminated in 2011 by releasing its sophomore album called "The Platinum Air".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://www.irockshock.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2155 | title  = The Platinum Air review | publisher  = Rockshock | accessdate = 13 October 2011|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its release party and a series of live shows, the band was taking pause and Lukáš Kraut started working on his solo material. In July 2012 – the 8th anniversary of the band's existence – the vocalist decided to devote himself only to his solo career and left the band. The guitarist Tomáš Frieb left PUBLIC RELATIONS with him.

== Present ==
In the beginning of 2013 the band found a replacement for the position of the [[frontman]] - the vocalist Jan Ražnok, who had been performing in many local bands and projects before. With their new singer, Public Relations prepared a new repertoire, which was released on their third studio [[Musical album|album]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://www.studentpoint.cz/265-novinky/14062-public-relations-vypousti-do-sveta-treti-album-reset/ | title  = The article about the release of the album Reset | publisher  = Studentpoint.cz | accessdate  = 9 February 2014 | language  = cs | deadurl  = yes | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150623155619/http://www.studentpoint.cz/265-novinky/14062-public-relations-vypousti-do-sveta-treti-album-reset/ | archivedate  = 23 June 2015 | df  =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url    = http://www.ostravan.cz/14445/public-relations-nekdy-je-potreba-zmacknout-pomyslne-tlacitko-reset/ | title  = Interview with PUBLIC RELATIONS on Ostravan.cz | publisher  = Ostravan.cz | accessdate = 25 April 2014|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 31 December 2013.

Based in Potsdam, Radio Volga broadcast from the [[Königs Wusterhausen radio transmitter|Königs Wusterhausen radio facility]] near [[Berlin]], as well as the [[Burg AM transmitter]] near [[Magdeburg]].&lt;ref name ="WRTH"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ENI6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Radio+Volga%22++K%C3%B6nigs+Wusterhausen&amp;dq=%22Radio+Volga%22++K%C3%B6nigs+Wusterhausen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSxuuG4qfLAhWFuRQKHUD5Cw8Q6AEILTAA ''World Radio TV Handbook''], Oluf Lund-Johansen

From 1967 to 1976 Radio Volga used the 350-meter SL-3 tower, 2.2 kilometers from the transmitter. After it collapsed in 1976, one of the site's two 210-meter high steel tube masts was used instead. Radio Volga originally broadcast on the [[longwave]] frequency 283 [[kHz]].&lt;ref name="Grull"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YAwiAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Radio+Wolga%22+261+kHz&amp;dq=%22Radio+Wolga%22+261+kHz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZxfXj5afLAhWF7xQKHa27DqsQ6AEINzAB ''Radio und Musik von und für Soldaten: Kriegs- und Nachkriegsjahre : 1939-1960''], Günter Grull, Herbst, 2000, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Beside programs for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldiers stationed in the GDR, Radio Volga also broadcast [[German language]] programmes from [[Radio Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KXxJzHGJas0C&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22FFB%22%20Radio%20%22Berlin%22%20%221994%22&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=%22FFB%22%20Radio%20%22Berlin%22%20%221994%22&amp;f=true ''Radiogeschichten: Zeitreise und Exkursionen in die Berliner RadioWelten''], Die Radionauten, BoD, 2005, page 41&lt;/ref&gt; After [[German reunification]] in 1990, transmitting time was rented to the German-language news station [[Radioropa Info]], broadcasting on 261&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wcxNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Radio+Volga%22+261+kHz&amp;dq=%22Radio+Volga%22+261+kHz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ8Z2Y5KfLAhVD6xQKHayFAX8Q6AEIJjAA ''World Radio TV Handbook, Volume 48''], O.

'''Rainbowing''' is the process in which a [[Dredge|dredging]] ship propels sand that has been claimed from the ocean floor in a high arc to a particular location. This is used for multiple purposes, ranging from building up a beach to prevent [[erosion]] to constructing new islands. The name is derived from the appearance of the arc, which closely resembles a brown-colored rainbow.

This technique was used extensively in the construction of the [[Palm Islands]] and [[The World (archipelago)|The World, Dubai]].&lt;ref name = "Van de Velde"/&gt;

==Process==
The process of rainbowing begins with the excavation of sediment, typically sand, from the seabed by a [[dredger]]. Dredgers excavate the sediment using mechanical or hydraulic methods or a combination of both.&lt;ref name = "Dredging: the Facts"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Dredging: the Facts | year = 2005 | url= http://www.dredging.org/documents/ceda/downloads/publications-dredging_the_facts.pdf | publisher = WODA,IADC,PIANC,IAPH | isbn = 90-75254-11-3 | accessdate = 2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the excavation process, large quantities of water are collected along with sediment creating a mixture called [[slurry]]. The slurry can then be utilised on-site or transported to where it will be deposited. The liquid characteristics of the slurry allow the dredger to transfer the slurry by ejecting it through the air in arcs.&lt;ref name = "Linham"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://climatetechwiki.org/content/beach-nourishment |title = Beach nourishment |last1 = Linham |first1 = Matthew M. |last2 = Nicholls |first2 = Robert J. |accessdate = 2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rainbowing nozzles==
The projection of slurry for [[beach nourishment]] and other dredging uses is achieved through the use of nozzles which affect the output and trajectory of the slurry. 

The diameter of the nozzle affects the output of the dredger and the distance that the slurry is projected. Smaller diameters, for instance, have less flow leading to lower hourly output, but are able to project the slurry over a further distance due to a higher exit velocity. Jumbo dredgers today can easily achieve distances in excess of 150 metres, but at the cost of 30% extra discharge time.&lt;ref name = "Van de Velde"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.theartofdredging.com/rainbowing.htm |title = Rainbowing |last = Van de Velde |first = Marc  |date = March 2008 |accessdate = 2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nozzles that are angled 30° from the horizontal are standard. Although 45° nozzle angles achieve longer distances from a ballistics perspective, 45° nozzles have been observed to create large craters. In addition, a high amount of sand flows back towards the dredger. 30° nozzles instead project the sand with a flatter trajectory, minimizing back flow while achieving a final distance comparable to that reached by a 45° nozzle.&lt;ref name = "Van de Velde" /&gt;

Other methods of disposing and transferring the slurry include pumping the slurry through pipelines or using natural forces such as wave currents.&lt;ref name = Linham/&gt;

==Advantages==
Since rainbowing transfers material by ejecting it through the air, the technique is useful for reclaiming areas that are too shallow for direct placement.&lt;ref name = "PIANC"&gt;{{Cite book | year = 2010 | author = PIANC EnviCom Working Group 108 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zGXpWS4KtjQC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=Dredging+rainbowing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qq5AYPP5BI&amp;sig=DgT2dH6Z36vo00ljunadWaq3jic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PpYQUfmwI8Pi2QX38ICQAQ&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=Dredging%20rainbowing&amp;f=false | title = Dredging and Port Construction Around Coral Reefs  | publisher = PIANC | series = Issue 108 of PIANC report | isbn = 9782872231775 | accessdate = 2013-02-04}} pp. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rainbowing allows the dredger to dispose excavated sediment on-site. This is useful for dredging operations such as creating [[trench]]es since the dredger can simply cast the excavated sediment to the side as opposed to spending time dumping or transporting the collected sediment. This allows for a continuous trenching operation.&lt;ref name = "Van de Velde"/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
Rainbowing, along with other dredging and reclamation methods, has various effects on the environment apart from vastly changing its geographical structure.

Throughout the dredging and nourishment process, plumes of fine sediment, which can take longer to settle, can remain suspended in the water for long periods of time. These clouds of fine sediment can have adverse effects on the ecosystem, asphyxiating fish and other fauna as well as blocking sunlight. As organisms die, the water becomes toxic as decomposed organic materials raise [[hydrogen sulfide]] levels. In such cases, it is often impossible for an ecosystem to revive. It often takes a couple years for the ecosystem to recover, when recovery does occur.&lt;ref name = "Palm Island"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://sites.google.com/site/palmislandsimpact/environmental-impacts/initial |title = The Impact of the Palm Islands, United Arab Emirates |accessdate = 2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, coral can be removed or become buried by the sediment.&lt;ref name = "PIANC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">The '''Sustainable Preservation Initiative''' (SPI) is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to preserving the world's [[cultural heritage]] by providing transformative and sustainable economic opportunities to local communities. SPI is focused on countries in the developing world, more particularly those that are not part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] as well as [[Mexico]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. SPI seeks to encourage and develop sustainable economic development in the communities surrounding archaeological sites by aiding in the development of locally owned businesses that maximize the spending of dollars in these communities and regions.  Some [[manufacturing]] industries are aided as well, including local [[artisan]]s. SPI's projects provide a two-for-the-price-of-one benefit: they create viable economic opportunities for the local residents while saving archaeological sites for future generations to study and enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainablepreservation.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Felix Salmon of Reuters, SPI is about taking archaeological sites "in poor countries and making them generate cash for the locals — thereby giving them a real monetary incentive (rather than a high-minded lecture) aimed at preserving archeological treasures."&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/06/09/better-living-through-archeology/&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on job creation, Salmon cites SPI as a model for maximum job creation through small investments: "In general, if you want to create the maximum number of jobs for the smallest amount of money, the best way of doing so is to provide catalytic capital which helps to give a small business the step-up it needs to sustain new jobs on a permanent basis".&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/03/08/job-creation-datapoints-of-the-day/&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent report, the [[Milken Institute]] called for the adoption of SPI's model by the state of Israel in order to better protect that country's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Israel-Needs-Archaeological-Business-Models-Increase-Economic-Development-Value-Cultural-1389503.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Handeye Magazine, an international publication dedicated to culture and commerce, cites the organization as one that "continues to put 'people, not stones' at the forefront, placing equal or greater focus on economic and social investment as opposed to purely preservation."&lt;ref&gt;http://handeyemagazine.com/content/people-not-stones/&lt;/ref&gt; BigThink.com, a website that seeks to identify the "best thinking on the planet — the ideas that can help you think flexibly and act decisively in a multivariate world," featured SPI's paradigm for preservation and its success.&lt;ref&gt;http://bigthink.com/ideas/38801/&lt;/ref&gt;

SPI is active at ten sites in [[Peru]], as well as in Guatemala and Jordan. The SPI mantra is "Build Futures, Save Pasts." The program's executive director is archaeologist [[Larry Coben]]. SPI was incubated at the [[Cotsen Institute of Archaeology]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and the [[Archaeological Institute of America]].

[[TDF Group|TéléDiffusion de France]] broadcast the '''TDF''' [[time signal]], controlled by LNE–SYRTE, from the [[Allouis longwave transmitter]] at 162&amp;nbsp;kHz, with a power of 2&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://syrte.obspm.fr/gen/accueil_en.php SYRTE website]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also known as '''FI''' or '''France Inter''' because the signal was formerly best known for broadcasting the [[France Inter]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM signal]].  This signal ceased at the end of 2016, but the transmitter remains in use for its time signal and other digital signals.

In 1980, the first [[atomic clock]] was installed to regulate the [[carrier frequency]].&lt;ref name=reorient&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/tvignaud/am/allouis/allouis4.htm Les ré-orientations]&lt;/ref&gt;  The current time signal is generated by an extremely accurate [[caesium]] fountain atomic clock and phase-modulated on the 162&amp;nbsp;kHz carrier in a way that is inaudible when listening to the France Inter signal using a normal AM receivers. It requires a more complex receiver than the popular [[DCF77]] service, but the much more powerful transmitter (22 to 40 times DCF77's 50&amp;nbsp;kW) gives it a much greater range of 3,500&amp;nbsp;km.

The signal is almost continuous but there is a regularly scheduled interruption for maintenance every Tuesday.  This used to be from 01:03 to 05:00,&lt;ref name=reorient/&gt; but with the cessation of audio signals, it has been moved to 08:00 to 12:00.&lt;ref name=tests&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anfr.fr/gestion-des-frequences-sites/signal-horaire/les-tests-du-signal-horaire/ |title=Les tests du signal horaire |trans-title=The tests of the time signal |language=fr |publisher=Agence Nationale des Fréquences |access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signal was formerly 2,000&amp;nbsp;kW, but has been reduced to 1,500&amp;nbsp;kW, and tests are in progress of a further reduction to 1,100&amp;nbsp;kW for cost savings.&lt;ref name=tests/&gt;

==Signal format==
TéléDiffusion de France (TDF) uses an [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] [[longwave]] [[transmitter station]]. Time signals are transmitted by [[phase modulation|phase-modulating]] the carrier by ±1 [[radian]] in 0.1 s every second except the 59th second of each minute.  This modulation pattern is repeated to indicate a binary one.

The binary encoding of date and time data during seconds 15 through 59 is identical to that of [[DCF77]]; the numbers of the minute, hour, day of the month, day of the week, month and year are transmitted each minute from the 21st to the 58th second, in accordance with the French legal time scale.  The time transmitted is the local time of the upcoming minute.

Also like DCF77, bit 20 is always 1, bit 18 indicates that local time is UTC+1 (CET), bit 17 indicates that local time is UTC+2 (CEST), and bit 16 indicates that a change to local time will take place at the end of the current hour.  Bit 15 is reserved to indicate abnormal transmitter operation.

As extensions to the DCF77 code, bit 14 is set during public holidays (14 July, Christmas, etc.), and bit 13 is set the day before public holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/scale/timesignals.pdf Time signals known to BIPM]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike DCF77, bit 19 is not used for [[leap second]] warnings, but is always zero.  Instead, bit 1 is used to warn of a positive leap second,&lt;!--How much warning is given?  I'd sure like to know.--&gt; and bit 2 is used to warn of a (very unlikely) negative leap second.&lt;ref name=PA3FWM&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio signals during a leap second |first=Emmanuel |last=Fuste |url=http://pa3fwm.nl/signals/leapsecond-2016/ |date=31 January 2017 |accessdate=9 March 2017 |quote=Thanks to people at Agence Nationale des Fréquences (ANFR) and Chambre française de l'horlogerie et des microtechniques (CFHM) I got a copy of Norme Française NF C 90-002 from August 1988, describing the format of the TDF time signal.  The leap second announcement bits are in fact the 2nd (for positive leapsecond) and 3rd (for negative) bits in the minute.  The positive leap second is to be inserted by inserting an extra 0 bit after the 3rd bit of the last minute of the hour.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In case of a leap second, an additional zero bit is inserted between bits 2 and 3.  This is supposed to be inserted at 23:59:03, during minute 59 of the hour (during which the timestamp for minute :00 is transmitted), so that the minute markers are all broadcast at the correct times, but for the leap second at the end of December 2016, it was apparently inserted at 23:58:03.&lt;ref name=PA3FWM/&gt;

The relative uncertainty of the carrier frequency is 2 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Phase modulation pattern==
One signal element consists of the phase of the carrier shifted linearly by +1&amp;nbsp;rad in 25&amp;nbsp;ms (known as "ramp A"), then shifted linearly by −2&amp;nbsp;rad over 50&amp;nbsp;ms ("ramp B"), then shifted linearly again by +1&amp;nbsp;rad for another 25&amp;nbsp;ms ("ramp C"), returning the phase to zero. One signal element is always sent at each second between 0 and 58. Two signal elements are sent in sequence to represent a binary one; otherwise it is interpreted as binary zero.  During ramp B of the initial signal element, the exact point the signal phase is at zero represents the top of the UTC second.  Since the phase is the integral of the frequency, this triangular phase modulation at 40&amp;nbsp;rad/s corresponds to a square frequency modulation with a deviation of 20/''π'' ≈ 6.37&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Image:TDF phase modulation bit pattern.svg]]

Both the average phase and the average frequency deviation are thus zero.  Additional non-timing data is sent by phase modulation during the rest of each second.  But the second marker (and data bit) is always preceded by 100 ms without any phase modulation.  The signal is not phase-modulated at all during the 59th second past the minute.

'''''Tarentola protogigas''''' (English name: '''First Giant wood gecko''' or '''Giant Fogo wood gecko''') is a [[species]] of [[gecko]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Phyllodactylidae]]. The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, where it is found in the southwest portion of the Western Barlavento Islands, including [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and the lesser [[Ilhéus Secos]]&lt;ref name="RDB"&gt;{{NRDB species|genus=Tarentola |species=protogigas|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species was named by [[Hans Hermann Schleich]] in 1984.

==Etymology==
The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is named after the Greek name for the "first giant" (''πρώτο'' ''proto'' and ''γίγας'' ''gigas'' (Modern Greek: ''γίγαντας'' ''gigantas'')).&lt;ref name="RDB"/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The subspecies were elevated from ''Tarentola rudis protogigas'' by Vasconcelos, Perera, Geniez, Harris &amp; Carranza in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Vasconcelos, Perera, Geniez, Harris &amp; Carranza, ''An integrative taxonomic revision of the Tarentola geckos (Squamata, Phyllodactylidae) of the Cape Verde Islands.'' Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, vol. 164, no. 2, p. 328-360&lt;/ref&gt;  Also that time, ''Tarentola rudis hartogi'' was placed under this species as a subspecies of ''Tarentola protogigas hartogi''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9660">{{Time zones of Europe}}
[[Europe]] spans seven primary [[time zone]]s (from [[UTC−01:00]] to [[UTC+05:00]]), excluding [[daylight saving time|summer time]] offsets (four of them can be seen on the map to the right, with one further-western zone containing the [[Azores]], and two further-eastern zones spanning [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], eastern territories of [[European Russia]], and the European part of [[Kazakhstan]]). Most European countries use summer time and harmonise their summer time adjustments. See [[Summer time in Europe]] for details.

The time zones actually in use in Europe differ significantly from uniform zoning based purely on longitude, as used for example under the [[nautical time]] system. The world could in theory be divided into 24 time zones, each of 15 degrees of longitude. However, due to geographical and cultural factors it is not practical to divide the world so evenly, and actual time zones may differ significantly from those based purely on longitude. In Europe, the widespread use of Central European Time (CET) causes major variations in some areas from [[solar time]]. Based on solar time, CET would range from 7.5 to 22.5°E. However, for example Spain (almost entirely in the Western hemisphere) and France (almost entirely west of 7.5°E, as illustrated in the map below) should theoretically use UTC, as they did before the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poulle |first=Yvonne |title=La France à l'heure allemande |trans-title=France on German time |journal={{lang|fr|Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes}} |year=1999 |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=493–502 |url=http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989/article_bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989.pdf |accessdate=11 January 2012 }} {{fr icon}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general result is a solar noon which is much later than clock noon, and later sunrises and sunsets than should theoretically happen. The Benelux countries should also theoretically use GMT.

Russia and Belarus observed "permanent summer time" between March 2011 and October 2014.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Parfitt |first=Tom |title=Think of the cows: clocks go forward for the last time in Russia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/25/clocks-go-forward-last-time-russia |accessdate=5 January 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2014 Russia has observed "permanent winter time". Iceland can be considered to be on "''de facto''" permanent summer time because, since 1968, it uses UTC time all year, despite being located more than 15° west of the prime meridian. It should therefore be located in UTC−1, but chooses to remain closer to continental European time, resulting in legal times significantly in advance of local solar time; this is of little practical significance owing to the wide variations in daylight hours in that country.

The [[European Commission]] has proposed ending the practice of [[Summer Time in Europe|Summer time in the EU]] and [[EFTA]] countries in 2019. However, the decision lies with the EU's Member States as a group. &lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-5641_en.htm State of the Union 2018: Q&amp;A on the Commission's proposal to put an end to seasonal clock changes] [[European Commission]] − Press Release (Strasbourg, 12 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Traditional_dance_(tsutsube).jpg|thumb|200px|Tsutsube traditional dance]]
'''Tsutsube'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}  is a traditional dance in [[Botswana]] which is practiced by [[Basarwa]] or [[San people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wither the beloved Tsutsube |url=http://www.dailynews.gov.bw/news-details.php?nid=2957|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;Tsutsube is performed in four ritualistic categories or stages which are the first kill, [[puberty]], marriage and [[trance]]. According to the history, the first kill was for males or boys, and trance dance was for healing purposes to engage [[ancestors]] spirits.

A sister station to [[Virgin Radio]], '''Virgin Radio Groove''' was a former [[radio station]] broadcasting worldwide on the [[internet]]. The station closed officially on 31 December 2007; however, it continued to broadcast until 4 April 2008.

It was launched as '''The Groove''' on 26 June 2000, and was renamed '''Virgin Radio Groove''' in 2004.

It played [[Motown Records|motown]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[disco]] music and the first song played on The Groove was "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]" by the [[Jackson 5]].

As well as being broadcast on the [[internet]], Virgin Radio Groove also broadcast on [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] in [[London]] and selected digital television networks ([[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital]] and [[Virgin Media]]). On 5 September 2005 the station was temporarily replaced by [[Virgin Radio Xtreme]] on DAB in London, but returned in early 2006 as a part-time service, daily from 7.00pm to 6.00am.

==Closure==
Virgin Radio Groove was due to close down at the end of 2007. This came after it was revealed that plans to launch Virgin Radio Viva, which would have been on the new [[Channel 4]] platform and aimed at 15 to 29-year-old women, have been scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Between January and April 2008, the station still operated on all platforms, albeit entirely automated, and the official website was not updated since a message was added about the station's closure in 2007.

Virgin Radio Groove ceased broadcasting completely and was removed from the [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] [[Electronic Programme Guide|EPG]] on 4 April 2008. The online streams also closed down. On the former frequency of Eurobird 1 11390V It is currently showing a  16&amp;nbsp;Hz test tone for 1 day and then silent. The station's former channel existed on the [[Virgin Media]] EPG with a message mentioning the closure of the station in place of the programme titles until 17 April when [[Virgin Media]] removed it from their lineup.
