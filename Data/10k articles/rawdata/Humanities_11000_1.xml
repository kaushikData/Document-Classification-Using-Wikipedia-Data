'''[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]]''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them.

In [[Armenia]] the right of access to information is guaranteed and defined by the Articles 27 and 27.1 of the Constitution. Also, Armenia has a specific law on freedom of information providing the basic foundations for the realization of this right. According to the Constitution and the Law,  in Armenia everybody, in spite of the fact he/she is a citizen of the country or not, has a right to have access to information.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foi.am/en/faq/  |title= 12 Questions and Answers on FOI |date= |website=Foi.am |publisher=Freedom of Information Center of Armenia |access-date=19 January 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

The Law on Freedom of Information was adopted in September 2003 and was widely considered a progressive document, greatly appreciated by international experts.&lt;ref name=EPCSF&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 2015 |title=Report on the state of Media in Eastern Partnership Countries |url=http://archive.eap-csf.eu/assets/files/Report%20on%20state%20of%20media%20in%20EaP%20countries_Nov%202015.pdf |publisher=Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum |access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the adoption of the law, civil society and the journalists community, have advocated for the need to pass the regulations that would have supported and improved the implementation of the law. Such regulations were finally adopted in October 2015, when the Armenian government approved a procedure for improving the effectiveness of the procedure to access public information by streamlining the classification, maintenance and provision of information from the government to the public. Prior to the adoption of these regulations, in several cases public officials used to cite the lack of these implementation rules when refusing requests for information.&lt;ref name="USA2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foi.am/en/news/item/1546/ |title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2015 Armenia |last= |first= |date=14 April 2016 |website=Foi.am |publisher=Freedom of Information Center for Armenia |access-date=19 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies concerned by access to information===
According to the law, people can obtain information from: central government bodies, self-governing bodies, state institutions, organizations financed from central or local government finances, organizations with public functions, i.e. organisations providing public services (for instance, private universities, schools, hospitals, energy provider companies, etc.)&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt; Each body has a person that is responsible for freedom of information and is in charge of dealing with information requests.&lt;ref name="FOIFAQ" /&gt;

===Procedure===
To submit a request to access information, applicants have to apply to the information holder with a written or oral inquiry to be addressed to specific departments in the appropriate body or organization. Civil society organizations advocating for access to information suggest to apply with a written inquiry so that a compliant can be done in case of rejection. To be taken into consideration, both written and oral inquiries have to meet the requirements stated by the law.&lt;ref name="FOIFAQ" /&gt;

The inquirer is not obliged to justify the enquiry and to state the reason for it or how the information sought is going to be used.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

If the body/organizations does not possess all the details concerning the information required, the information holder has to provide the available parts and mention the name and the location of other possible information holders who might be in possess of other details concerning the information sought.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

Information are provided free of charge. Only technical expenses of information provision (photocopies, electronic supports, etc.) can be charged.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

===Exceptions===
Freedom of information can be restricted only on grounds well defined by the law. Information holder may refuse to provide information if it contains state, official, bank or trade secret; infringe the privacy of individuals and his family; contains pre-investigation data which cannot be made public; concerns data with accessibility limitation (such as business, notary or medical secrets); infringes copyright and associated rights.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

===Right to appeal===
In case of rejection, the information holder has to inform the applicant within 5 days in a written form and explain the reasons for the refusal as well as the relevant appealing procedures. Denials can be appealed to the [[Ombudsman]] or the court by administrative procedure. Citizens can also apply directly to the concerned bodies without appealing by an administrative procedure. Also, it is possible to apply to non-governmental organizations which provide legal advisory.&lt;ref name=FOIFAQ/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

In practice, despite the good legal framework, citizens and media professionals face some problems in accessing documents, such as incomplete disclosure of the information required, extensions of the time frame for obtaining information prescribed by the law, the refusal of some government bodies and officials to implement the law, and so forth.&lt;ref name=EPCSF/&gt;&lt;ref name=USA2016/&gt; According to the NGO [[Freedom of Information Center of Armenia]] and the [[Transparency International]] Anticorruption Center, the main challenge is the behaviour of some public officials and public bodies that continue to provide answers that are either irrelevant or incomplete. This has resulted in major difficulties for NGOs being less and less successful in bringing freedom of information cases before the courts than in previous years, as judges rejected their cases on the grounds that public offices had provided the answers, regardless of their content.&lt;ref name=USA2016/&gt;

In Armenia, NGOs have played a significant role in educating the public on how to exercise their "right to know" and have organised trainings for public officials. By 2012, the NGO Freedom of Information Center Armenia has distributed around 2050 bulletin boards in several urban and rural communities in order to inform the public on the right to access public information and how to realize it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/armenia |title=Armenia.

[[File:Peacock2.jpg|thumb|The Peacock Room, Aesthetic Movement designed by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], one of the most famous examples of Aesthetic style interior design]]

'''Aestheticism''' (also the '''Aesthetic Movement''') is an intellectual and [[art movement]] supporting the emphasis of [[aesthetic]] values more than social-political themes for [[literature]], [[fine art]], [[music]] and other [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference - 3rd Edition|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=261|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvTZrnmy5RoC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Aesthetic+movement%22+swinburne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQGt-5H3y4&amp;sig=Ir3QCh29f7c926rkx620LbcB5fs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kjKSuy9BNDdlAebobGSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aesthetic%20movement%22%20swinburne&amp;f=false "At the Temple of Art: the Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890"], Issue 1165, p. 38, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8386-3850-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning&amp;nbsp;— "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as [[Walter Pater]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as [[Harold Bloom]], who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] or [[Decadent movement|decadence]] represented in France, or [[decadentism]]o represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the [[Oxford]] professor [[Walter Pater]] and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty.  His text ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the [[Decadent movement]] used the slogan "[[Art for Art's Sake]]" (''L'art pour l'art''), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], although [[Angela Leighton]] in the publication ''On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word'' (2007) notes that the phrase was used by [[Benjamin Constant]] as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Leighton (2007) 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted to have been promoted by [[Théophile Gautier]] in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and [[morality]].

[[Image:Design for an Aesthetic theatrical poster.png|thumb|left|300px|One of many ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons about æsthetes]]
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept [[John Ruskin]],  [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[George MacDonald]]'s conception of art as something moral or useful, "Art for truth's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believed that Art did not have any [[didactic]] purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and [[Synesthesia|synaesthetic]]/[[ideasthesia|Ideasthetic]] effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Predecessors of the Aesthetics included [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and some of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem ''L’Art'' by [[Théophile Gautier]], who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Aesthetic Movement in English Literature|last=McMullen|first=Lorraine|publisher=Bytown Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], both influenced by the French Symbolists, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The style and these poets were satirised by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and other works, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s drama ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', and in comic magazines such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' particularly in works by George Du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YgrdCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=michele%20mendelssohn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture|last=Mendelssohn|first=Michèle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0748623853|location=|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel ''[[Sinister Street]]'' makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are [[Robert Byron]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[A.E. Housman]] and [[Anthony Powell]].

==Aesthetic visual arts==

Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley|Aubrey Beardsley]]. Although the work of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and  conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.

==Aesthetic Movement decorative arts==
[[File:Florian Papp Aesthetic Exhibition.jpg|thumb|Aesthetic Movement antiques at [[Florian Papp]], New York City]]
The primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim "art for art's sake", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially [[fine art]], cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Dresser]]. ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'' LXXXI, Saturday, August 12, 1882, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Morley. ''Reform and Eastern Art'' Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. [[Christopher Dresser]], a student and later Professor at the school  worked with Owen Jones on ''The Grammar of Ornament'', as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862, and ''Principles of Design'' 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* [[Ebonized]] wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on [[porcelain]] and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.

Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that [[Oscar Wilde]] used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by ''Punch'' magazine and in ''Patience''.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled "The House Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;O'brien (1982) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the "Ornamental Aesthetic" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in [[Annandale National Historic Site]], located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is [[18 Stafford Terrace]], London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.

The panel's findings 'did not discover' any role by 'senior, high-level' Saudi government officials, said officials familiar with the report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3551863/Rudy-Giuliani-suggests-Saudi-Arabia-involved-9-11-attacks-reveals-offered-10MILLION-prince-Obama-cozies-King-Salman-trip-Middle-East.html|title=Saudi Arabia was involved in 9/11, Rudy Giuliani suggests as Obama visits King Salman - Daily Mail Online|date=21 April 2016|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the "commission’s narrow wording", according to critics, suggests the possibility that "less senior officials or parts of the Saudi government could have played a role".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; [[Florida]] Democratic Senator [[Bob Graham]], who chaired the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] at the time the report said in his sworn statements that "there was evidence of support from the Saudi government for the terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hulse |first1=Carl |title=Florida Ex-Senator Pursues Claims of Saudi Ties to Sept. 11 Attacks |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/world/middleeast/florida-ex-senator-pursues-claims-of-saudi-ties-to-sept-11-attacks.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=New York Times |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 a New York lawyer, Jim Kreindler, said that he had found "a link between Saudi officials and the hijackers."&lt;ref name="Politico-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hannan|first1=Caleb|title=One Man’s Quest to Prove Saudi Arabia Bankrolled 9/11|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/saudi-arabia-911-lawyer-214996|accessdate=9 April 2017|work=POLITICO Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/saudi-government-denies-role-in-funding-9-11-attacks-215014 ''Saudi Government Denies Funding 9/11 Attacks''] publication of the aforementioned letter written by Nail Al-Jubeir, director of the information office of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington DC, denying the charge that the government of Saudi Arabia had played a role in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==File 17==
In July 2016, the U.S. government released a document, compiled by Dana Lesemann and Michael Jacobson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=File 17: Fresh documents hint at possible Saudi ties to 9/11 hijackers|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/349360-files-saudi-9-11/|accessdate=4 July 2016|agency=Russia Today|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as "File 17", which contains a list naming three dozen people, including Fahad al-Thumairy, Omar al-Bayoumi, Osama Bassnan, and Mohdhar Abdullah, which connects Saudi Arabia to the hijackers. According to the former Democratic US Senator Bob Graham, “Much of the information upon which File 17 was written was based on what’s in the 28 pages.”&lt;ref name="DeAP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riechmann|first1=Deb|title=File 17 Is Glimpse Into Still-Secret 28 Pages About 9/11|url=https://apnews.com/fe56c5d224a8463aa7cfc6ccf4689122|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Saudi government has long denied any connection.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Black|first1=Ian|last2=editor|first2=Middle East|last3=Smith|first3=David|last4=correspondent|first4=Washington|title=Obama faces friction in Saudi Arabia over 9/11 bill and Iran relationship|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/20/barack-obama-saudi-arabia-trip-9-11-terrorist-attacks|accessdate=22 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=20 April 2016|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatives of victims have tried to use the courts to hold Saudi royals, banks, or charities responsible, but these efforts have been thwarted partly by a 1976 law giving foreign governments immunity.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=MAZZETTI|first=MARK|title=Saudi Arabia Warns of Economic Fallout if Congress Passes 9/11 Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-warns-ofeconomic-fallout-if-congress-passes-9-11-bill.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|date=Apr 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gawdat Bahgat]], a professor of political science, following the 11 September attacks the so-called "Saudi policy of promoting terrorism and funding hatred" faced strong criticism by several "influential policy-makers and think-tanks in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bahgat|first1=Gawdat|title=SAUDI ARABIA AND THE WAR ON TERRORISM|journal=Arab Studies Quarterly|date=1 January 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=51–63|jstor=41858472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US government has actively collaborated with the Saudis in suppressing the revelation of evidence of the Saudi government's responsibility for the attacks, denying [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] requests and supplying inside information to the lawyers representing the Saudis involved. Graham characterises the strategy as not a 'cover up' but "aggressive deception".&lt;ref name="Politico-1"/&gt;

According to the [[New York Post]] in 2017, Saudi government was accused of performing "dry run" by paying two Saudi nationals, al-Qudhaeein and Hamdan al-Shalawi, "living undercover in the US as students, to fly from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]," two years before the attacks. Based on the FBI documents, Qudhaeein and Shalawi were in fact members of "the Kingdom's network of agents" in the United States. The documents also claimed that they were "trained in Afghanistan with a number of other al-Qaeda operatives that participated in the attacks."&lt;ref name="dryrun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sperry|first1=Paul|title=Saudi government allegedly funded a ‘dry run’ for 9/11|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/09/saudi-government-allegedly-funded-a-dry-run-for-911/|accessdate=14 September 2017|work=New York Post|date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1999, they boarded an America West flight to Washington, reportedly paid for by the Saudi Embassy. During the flights they tried to access the cockpit several times, in order to "test out flight deck security before 9/11."&lt;ref name="dryrun2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Revesz|first1=Rachael|title=Saudi government ‘funded a dry run' of 9/11'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/911-saudi-government-embassy-dry-run-hijacks-lawsuit-cockpit-security-a7938791.html|accessdate=14 September 2017|work=The Independent|date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots made an emergency landing in Ohio since they were "so spooked by the Saudi passengers and their aggressive behavior."&lt;ref name="dryrun"/&gt;

==JASTA==
{{also|Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act}}
In March 2016, Saudi Foreign Minister [[Adel al-Jubeir]] threatened to sell US$750 billion worth of American assets owned by Saudi Arabia if the [[Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act]] (JASTA) designed to create an exception to the 1976 [[Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act]] was enacted, which caused fears of destabilizing the US dollar.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] also warned against “[[unintended consequence]]s”, while Saudi economy analysts believed that this action would damage the Saudi government.&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Gareth|authorlink=Gareth Porter|title=The Classified 9/11 ’28 Pages’: A Diversion from Real US-Saudi Issues|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-classified-911-28-pages-a-diversion-from-real-us-saudi-issues/5522085|date=27 April 2016|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JASTA was enacted, after Barack Obama's veto was overridden by Congress, on 28 September 2016. Although [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] publicly supported the proposed legislation, Sanders and [[Tim Kaine]], Clinton's running mate, were the only two senators that refrained from voting to override Obama's veto. Senator [[Harry Reid]] was the sole "No" vote.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shabad|first1=Rebecca|title=Obama weighs in on 28 classified pages of 9/11 report|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-says-director-of-national-intelligence-to-soon-complete-28-pages-review/|accessdate=22 April 2016|work=cbsnews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tumulty|first1=Bill J.|title=N.Y. primary highlights bill allowing 9/11-related suits against Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/19/ny-primary-highlights-bill-allowing-911-related-suits-against-saudi-arabia/83242120/|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indep"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buncombe|first1=Andrew|title=Senate passes bill allowing victims to sue Saudi Arabia for 9/11 attacks|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/911-attacks-senate-passes-bill-allowing-victims-to-sue-saudi-arabia-a7034781.html|accessdate=18 May 2016|work=The Independent|date=17 May 2016|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morrissey|first1=Ed|title=JASTA Rebuke: Senate Votes 97-1 To Override Obama Veto; Update: Override Succeeds In 348-77 House Vote|url=https://hotair.com/archives/2016/09/28/jasta-rebuke-senate-votes-97-1-override-obama-veto/|date=September 28, 2016|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, a US judge allowed a suit to move forward against Saudi Arabia brought by 9/11 survivors and victim's families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-sept11/saudi-arabia-must-face-u-s-lawsuits-over-sept-11-attacks-idUSKBN1H43A1 "Saudi Arabia must face U.S. lawsuits over Sept. 11 attacks"] ''Reuters''.

'''Anna L. Peterson''' (born 1963) is an American scholar of [[religious studies]] who is currently a [[professor]] in the Department of Religion at the [[University of Florida]], where she has worked since 1993. Her research variously concerns [[religion in Latin America]] and [[ethics]]—including [[religious ethics]], [[Christian ethics]], [[environmental ethics]], [[animal ethics]] and [[social ethics]]. She is the author of five monographs: ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' ([[State University of New York Press]], 1997); ''Being Human'' ([[University of California Press]], 2001); ''Seeds of the Kingdom'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2001); ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2009); and ''Being Animal'' (Columbia University Press, 2013).

==Career==
Peterson studied at [[Williams College]] (1981–1983) before going on to receive a [[religious studies]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1983–1985). She then studied at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] from 1986 to 1991. She received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1987, and a [[doctorate|PhD]] in Ethics and Society in 1991. Her doctoral [[thesis]] was supervised by Robin Lovin.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;Peterson, Anna L. [http://sites.clas.ufl.edu/religion/files/2012/11/Peterson-CV1.pdf CV]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;"[http://people.clas.ufl.edu/annap/ Anna L. Peterson]". [[University of Florida]]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[assistant professor]] in religious studies at [[St. Norbert College]] in 1991, where she remained until 1993, when she took up the position of assistant professor at the [[University of Florida]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; In 1997, her ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' was published with [[State University of New York Press]]. The book blends [[theology]], [[social history]] and [[ethnographic]] [[anthropology]] to explore ideas of [[Catholic]] [[martyrdom]] in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Flora, Cornelia. (1998). "''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion: Progressive Catholicism in El Salvador's Civil War''. By Anna L. Peterson". ''Journal of Church and State'' '''40''' (3): 696–7. {{Doi|10.1093/jcs/40.3.696}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[associate professor]] in 1998, and spent two years as a [[visiting fellow]] at the [[Wesleyan University]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; 2001 saw the publication of her ''Being Human'', a book about [[environmental ethics]] from the perspective of [[religious ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Susan J. (2002). "[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_9/0602armstrong.html ''Being Human: Ethics, Environment, and Our Place in the World'']". ''[[Journal of Political Ecology]]'' '''9''' (2). {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she became a [[full professor]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Peterson has published a number of books while a full professor at Florida. ''Seeds of the Kingdom'', a comparative study of United States [[Amish]] farming communities and of El Salvador's refugee communities, appeared in 2005. Both groups examined, Peterson argues, attempt to build [[utopian]] Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;McKanan, Dan (2007). "Anna L Peterson, ''Seeds of the Kingdom''". ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'' '''87''' (2): 295–7. {{doi|10.1086/513230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' was published in 2009. In this book, Peterson argues that humans should the extend ethical values dominant in interpersonal relationships, such as love, to differently structure currently instrumental societal and political relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Rita (2010). "''Everyday Ethics and Social Change''". ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'' '''32''' (4): 421–4. {{doi|10.5840/enviroethics201032445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 saw the publication of ''Working Toward Sustainability: Ethical Decision-Making in a Technological World'', a textbook which Peterson co-authored with Charles J. Kibert, Martha C. Monroe, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele.&lt;ref&gt;Kibert, Charles J., Martha C. Monroe, Anna L. Peterson, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele (2012). ''Working Toward Sustainability''. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013's ''Being Animal'', Peterson critiques the separation of environmental and [[animal ethics]]. Though frequently thought irreconcilable, Peterson argues that the separation can be blamed on a weak understanding of nature, humans, and animals, as well as the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhall, Andrew (2015). "Anna L. Peterson: ''Being Animal: Beasts &amp; Boundaries in Nature Ethics''". ''[[Ethical Theory and Moral Practice]]'' '''18''' (4): 877–9. {{Doi|10.1007/s10677-015-9560-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected bibliography==
In addition to her books, Peterson has written over twenty articles published in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journals]] and scholarly [[edited collections]], as well as various [[review articles]], [[book reviews]] and [[encyclopedia]] articles.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

{{primary sources|date=December 2008}}An '''audition website''' is a web site that aggregates [[audition]] information and delivers this information via the [[World Wide Web]]. There are hundreds of companies that operate [[acting]], [[Model (person)|modeling]], and [[dancing]] audition websites. Originally, only talent agents were able to provide actors, models, dancers and other performers with audition information. This meant that only performers that were represented by Talent Agents could go on auditions. Today, both open auditions and private auditions can be found on reliable audition websites. Talented performers can browse the World Wide Web and find many different audition websites. The primary organization of professional screen and theater casting in the United States is the [[Casting Society of America]] (CSA). Membership to the CSA is optional.

Audition websites are an integral component in the employment statistics&lt;ref name="employment statistics"&gt;''Bureau Of Labor Statistics ''[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos093.htm employment statistics] Occupational Outlook Handbook - Actors, Producers, and Directors&lt;/ref&gt; of actors and other industry professionals.  Most acting assignments are typically short term and range from 1 day to a few months. Many professional actors use either agents or managers to find work, and plan their careers. A [[talent agent]] generally earns a percentage of the pay earned by an actor, as specified in the actor’s contract. Other actors rely solely on attending open [[auditions]], found on audition websites, for parts.

Some audition websites require membership and others are free to use. Most all audition websites involve the member regularly browsing audition listings and "self-submitting" for auditions. This enables members to choose the types of jobs that they audition for. Other than membership dues, audition websites do not charge other fees or take a percentage of income earned from jobs. Audition websites have grown in popularity and the most visited audition websites have memberships in the millions. A [[casting director]], [[talent agent]], [[film producer]], or [[movie director]] can use Audition websites to locate performers for casting. These industry professionals use audition websites to find talent for commercials, [[music videos]], [[movies]], and other entertainment projects.

[[File:Armagh County Museum, Bann Flakes.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Four Bann flakes on display in Armagh County Museum.]]
A '''Bann flake''' is a large, butt-trimmed, leaf-shaped [[lithic blade]] of [[flint]] or [[chert]], dating from the Late [[Mesolithic]] period of [[prehistoric Ireland]], from around 4500 BC onwards.  They are named after the [[river Bann]] in Northern Ireland where large numbers have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace and O'Floinn, 45&lt;/ref&gt;   The term is rather variably defined, and the uses of the flakes probably varied considerably, with many being all-purpose tools, and perhaps weapons. Some were probably used as spear heads attached to wooden shafts, despite many being rather heavy for this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountsandel.com/teachers/meso_later.asp "The Later Mesolithic: 5500-3500 BC"], Mount Sandel&lt;/ref&gt;  

They are part of the Bann culture assemblage. Peter Woodman of [[University College Cork]] defines them as large flakes without a significant [[Tang (tools)|tang]], with only light [[Retouch (lithics)|retouch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095445477 "Bann flake"], in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology''&lt;/ref&gt;  They come in two forms: elongated or laminar forms less than 3.2&amp;nbsp;cm across, or wider leaf shapes having only very peripheral retouch at the butt.

Historical accounts for early U.S. naval history now occur across the spectrum of two and more centuries. This Bibliography lends itself primarily to [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] covering early U.S. naval history beginning around the [[American Revolution]] period on through the 18th and 19th centuries and includes sources which cover notable naval commanders, Presidents, important ships, major naval engagements and corresponding wars. The bibliography also includes sources that are not committed to the subject of U.S. naval history per se but whose content covers this subject extensively.

Among the contemporary and earlier historical accounts are [[WP:PSTS|primary sources]], historical accounts, often derived from letters, dispatches, government and military records, captain's logs and diaries, etc., written by authors who were involved in or closely associated to the historical episode in question. Primary source material is often collected, compiled and published by other editors also, sometimes many years after the historical subject has passed. Many of the authors are notable and even famous in their own right and are linked to their corresponding biographies.

==Listing and format of sources==
Sources dedicated to or well committed to a subject are listed under that subject/section.
Sources in any given section can often be used for other subjects/section so a link is sometimes provided to those section(s). A few of the more general sources are sometimes duplicated in the various sections where they equally apply. Sections/subjects are listed in chronological order.  For uniformity in the listing, sources in this bibliography employ the format supported by [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bibliographies#Examples|WikiProject Bibliographies]], presented in the example shown directly below, noting author's ''lastname'' first, etc., year-date of publication, book title in ''italics'', number of pages, ISBN and/or OCLC number (when available):
&lt;center&gt;
*'''Last, First, (1900), ''Book-title'', Publisher, 123 pages, ISBN '''0123...''', Url'''''
&lt;/center&gt;
Primary sources listed in this bibliography are denoted with an uppercase bold ' ('''P''') ' before the book title. Many of the historical accounts were authored by members and ex-members of the U.S. Navy who have not only offered primary accounts but have very often gone on to write about naval history in other general and specific capacities—these sources will be denoted with an  ' ('''N''') ' following the author's name.

Many of the sources are available for searching and viewing online. Copyrighted publications are often offered for partial viewing, while sources in the public domain can be viewed in their entirety and are denoted with '' 'E'book' ''. At this late date most of the publications are now available in PDF and/or EPUB formats.  A link to the publication is included at the end of a given title listing.

As the listings in the various sections are often lengthy, a link to the ''' 'Top' ''' of a given section is provided at the end of that section.

'''Biohistory''' is a relatively new school of [[historiography]] although its development can be found in the late nineteenth century. Biohistory is defined, according to biohistorian Stephen Boyden,&lt;ref&gt;
Stephen Vickers Boyden AM FAA FRSA (born 1925) is an English-born Ecologist and Veterinarian who after graduating with a BSc in London in 1947, worked in Cambridge and Europe before moving to Australia in 1960 and working at the ANU until his official retirement in 1990. He has authored several books on Biohistory, most of which are quoted in this article.

Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
For the historians who study under this school, one of the main principles is the understanding the relationship of the biosphere, the total collection of Earth’s [[ecosystems]] combined and various human elements, including cultural adaptations and the impact of biological forces on society.  One of the things that make biohistory unique is that the "starting point is the history of life on [[Earth]], and the basic principles and facts of [[evolution]], genetic inheritance, [[ecology]], and [[physiology]]. Next, it turns to consider the evolutionary background, biology and innate sensitivities of the human species, and the emergence in evolution of the human aptitude for culture."&lt;ref name=BoydenPg3/&gt;

Biohistory emerged from several different schools and disciplines including the [[Annales school]], [[environmental history]], [[human geography]], and [[sociobiology]] as well as Darwinian Theory.&lt;ref name="toqonline1"&gt;Paulson, Eric. “Biohistory.” The Occidental Quarterly. Published: May 26, 2010. Accessed: April 3, 2011. http://www.toqonline.com/blog/biohistory/&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are biohistorians who work towards eliminating affiliation with Darwinian Theory, especially [[Social Darwinism]], in order to reduce critiques of biological determinism.

A similar concept to biohistory, evolutionary biology is different because it only takes into account the scientific aspects of phenomena and not the historical implications.
As of 2010, the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) has not accepted biohistory as a legitimate historiographical school of study, though there are academic scholars who study under it.&lt;ref name="toqonline1"/&gt; However, for over one hundred years, there have been statements given that suggest an eventual acceptance of the main tenets of biohistory as a basis for future historical research and scholarship. The term biohistory has contested origins because many scholars who write on the topic claim to have coined it.

== Biohistory as a field of study ==
{{Human timeline}}{{Life timeline}}
There are scholars within the field of history that say the current study of history does not fully take into account the scope of human history, but “omits the events and effects of the longest period of human existence.”&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"&gt;McElvaine, Robert S, “The Relevance of Biohistory”, The Chronicle Review. 49: 8, October 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The “longest period” referring to the large quantity of time that humans ([[Homo Sapiens]]) spent adapting and evolving to their environment. Robert S. McElvaine (January 24, 1947- ) argues that the study of history should take into account “the evolution of the particular sort of animals we are.”&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt; History combined with “evolutionary biology could provide historians with a means of assessing how changes over long periods of prehistory affect the times we study.”&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt;
In 1991, [[Carl N. Degler]] (February 6, 1921- ) noted that, as of that time, social scientists in various fields including sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and political scientists had begun to accept the notion that biology, as it describes innate human proclivities, plays an important role in study, but he could not point to any historian that necessarily accepted this notion.&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt; Many of the scholars that have influenced biohistory are scientists by nature. Aside from the above list of professionals, geographers, sociobiologists, microbiologists, pathologists, and others have contributed.
Human proclivities or the natural tendencies to behave in a certain manners commonly referred to as human nature, which historians can study, include the ability to adapt into small bands of hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt;
One of the many benefits of studying biohistory is the increased ability for historians and scientists to conduct “collaborative research projects, which offer the potential for unusual analytical perspectives as well as new evolutionary sources” as stated by Nancy Buenger, an American history scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Brueger, Nancy “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research, Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No.3, (2004), 235.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars promote the idea that using biology as a method to history should not only study what features, values, and predispositions of the human condition were favorable in the environment, but also “how those predispositions interacted with the various cultural and historical environments in which humans have lived.”&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt; In the study of biohistory, McElvaine states that biology is a useful tool for history and that both can be utilized to gain a broader perspective of history.&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt;

== Antecedents and regression ==
Biohistory has its roots in the late nineteenth century with the evolutionary biology theories of [[Charles Darwin]] (February 12, 1809 – April 19, 1882).&lt;ref name="toqonline1"/&gt; Up until this time, the primary focus of history was to study the lives and events of important people including kings and generals.&lt;ref name="toqonline1"/&gt; The topics of biohistory soon began gaining popularity as a study of history. In 1901 the president of the AHA, [[Charles Francis Adams Jr]] (May 27, 1835 – May 20, 1915), stated that Darwinian Theory “was the dividing line between us [contemporary historians] and the historians of the old school.”&lt;ref name="toqonline1"/&gt;
The early movements toward biohistory, however, were not followed and lost momentum due to [[Franz Boas]] (July 9, 1859 – December 21, 1942) with his research into the differences between biological and cultural evolution.&lt;ref name="toqonline1"/&gt; Another group that led to the decline of biohistorical study was the [[Frankfurt School]], a group of neo-Marxist intellectuals that challenged some widely held societal ideologies.&lt;ref name="toqonline1"/&gt;

== Resurgence ==
The [[Annales School]], which was formed in the years between the world wars, came into opposition to these critiques of biohistorical research. The idea behind the Annales School was to write a total history which utilized various scientific studies such as geography. [[Fernand Braudel]] (August 24, 1902 – November 27, 1985), a student of founder [[Lucien Febvre]] (July 22, 1878 – September 11, 1956), believed that in the study of history, one must remember to consider “humans as living organisms and to not lose sight of the ‘biological reality of man.”&lt;ref name="toqonline1"/&gt;
During the 1970s and 1980s, [[environmental history]] gained notoriety as a discipline. It did not take long for environmental history to shift towards using biology to explain history. Alfred W. Crosby, a prominent environmental historian once claimed that “[t]he ideology of environmental history is, at its roots, biological.”&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Alfred W., “The Past and Present of Environmental History,” American Historical Review 100:4, (1995), 1189.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also noted as combining both principles in several of his books including The Colombian Exchange (1972) and Ecological Imperialism (1986). The study of biohistory, although similar to environmental history, is different in the aspect that it takes into account the environment as well as other biological phenomena in the study of history.
In 2001, at the 115th annual conference of the AHA, [[Edward O. Wilson]] (June 10, 1929- ), the founder of sociobiology, gave a speech at the 115th annual conference of the AHA in 2001. He stated that “[h]istory is no longer just the study of war and peace, of politicians and economics. If the next generation of historians hopes to understand the driving forces of humanity, they need to know the principles of ecology, population genetics and even molecular biology.”&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Cook, “Wilson Rattles Historians with ‘Bio-History’ Theories,” [[Boston Globe]], January 16, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not fully recognized as a separate discipline, the 115th AHA conference sponsored a distinct session on biohistory which shows that historians are thinking of the implications of biology on history, though many historians remain skeptical because they do not wish biohistory to be labeled “biological determinism.”

== Early scholars ==
One of the first contributors to what can be deemed biohistory was [[Ellsworth Huntington]] (September 16, 1876 – October 17, 1947). Although a geographer by study, Huntington discovered an interesting correlation between the nature of climate, human geography, and culture. In his book, Climate and Civilization published in 1915, he found that there is a positive correlation between the amounts of energy exerted based on climate regions and the perceived areas of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;See Huntington, Ellsworth, Civilization and Climate (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsworth defines civilization as “those characteristics which are generally recognized as the highest value.”&lt;ref name="civilization1915"&gt;Huntington, Ellsworth, Civilization and Climate (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1915), 150&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1916, a year after Huntington’s work went into circulation, [[Madison Grant]] (November 19, 1865 – May 30, 1937), a [[eugenicist]], published his work, [[The Passing of the Great Race]]; or, The racial basis of European history, which advanced his opinion of Nordic superiority over the Alpine and Mediterranean peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Madison, The Passing of the Great Race, or The Racial Basis of European History (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1916).&lt;/ref&gt;
These two thinkers utilized biohistory in their research. However, Huntington’s work was largely dismissed, although never disproven, and Grant’s theories were highly contested and repudiated by the United States and Europe by 1945.

== Biohistorical Studies ==
Biohistory encompasses a wide array of study. It can be used in many different areas that are commonplace in historical study as well as new areas of research. Below, several social aspects and their application are considered.

=== Biohistory and the Environment ===
The interplay between the human condition, natural processes, and the environment is important in the study of biohistory.
Stephen Vickers Boyden, an historian well-noted for his definition of biohistory, has written extensively about this concept. He has studied various aspects of humanity including weaponry, farming, and society in regard to biological factors in order to better understand this relationship.
Under the focus of biohistory Boyden examines the evolution of human progress and thought from its inception thousands of years ago. He is also known for his use of adaptation as a major factor for human progress. There are many types of adaptation, including cultural and evolutionary adaptation, which have shaped and allowed humanity to thrive in many areas of the world and survive as a species.&lt;ref name=BoydenPg4&gt;Boyden, Stephen Vickers. Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Four Phases ====
He classifies human existence into four distinct ecological periods: the [[hunter-gather]] phase, the early farming phase, the early urban phase, and the high-energy phase. In each phase there is a unique relationship between humanity and the environment.

===== The Hunter-Gather Phase =====
: The longest period of the four presented, Boyden claims this phase represents “the only lifestyle and economy known to humankind.”&lt;ref name=BoydenPg102&gt;Boyden, Stephen Vickers. Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; This period is viewed as human populations actively moving to stay in close proximity to food.

===== The Early Farming Phase =====
: This period began with the advent of agriculture and includes all farming practices, even into the High Energy Phase. This is symbolic of the first time that human populations began to remain sedentary.&lt;ref name=BoydenPg102/&gt;

===== The Early Urban Phase =====
: With the foundation of cities which occurred over 200 generations ago, this phase and the last phase began to coexist. Humans living in this phase relied on farming communities. Many societal changes and developments were evident during this period. Empires and kingdoms and the constant change of human populations based on these distinctions. This phase ended roughly around the time of the Industrial Revolution, at least for the West, and was centered on the connectivity of human populations with one another.&lt;ref name=BoydenPg102/&gt;

===== The High Energy Phase =====
: This period of time is considerably the shortest of the four. This phase roughly began at the time of the Industrial Revolution in England. It is defined by the expanded use of resources and energy which power machines. Boyden states that this current phase is unsustainable and will not last long if the current trend continues. Boyden defines this process as ecodeviation.&lt;ref name=BoydenPg103&gt;Boyden, Stephen Vickers. Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Boyden, Stephen Vickers, Western Civilization in Biological Perspective: Patterns in Biohistory, (Michigan: Clarendon Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
Boyden states that if the human race were to survive in the future then there is the necessity to enter into a fifth phase. This new phase would have to be more sustainable than the current one.&lt;ref name=BoydenPg103/&gt;
Ellsworth Huntington’s research also speaks to the nature of humanity and the environment. His work on the nature of the climate of an area and the rate of perceived civilization provides a framework for the seemingly complex interaction among humans and the environment.

=== Biohistory and race ===
There are many different methods that can be applied to the study of race and race relations under the biohistorical method. There are scholars, like Robert McElvaine, who say that “biohistory seeks to illuminate aspects of history through a better understanding of human nature – the fundamental traits and predispositions that all humans share and that make us alike” which eliminates the necessity of the study of race.&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt; Other scholars, however, see validity in the study of the differences that make people unique. In their study, S. O. Y. Keita and Rick A. Kittles found that “[r]acial thinking rests on the belief that visible human variation connotes fundamental deep differences within the species, which can be packaged into units of near-uniform individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Kieta, S.OY. and Rick A. Kittles, “The Persistence of Racial Thinking and the Myth of Racial Divergence,” The American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 99, No. 3 (Sep., 1997), 534.&lt;/ref&gt;
Race biohistorians use many different methods in their study. Scholars use dental morphology, bone structure data, and DNA testing to identify certain aspects of racial identity and growth.  One common practice is to use scientific data to explain certain aspects of race. One scholar, Heather J.H. Edgar, used teeth samples and other genetic identifiers to test her hypotheses.  She used these samples to check evolutionary change of both European Americans and African Americans and societal perceptions of Americans of each group.&lt;ref name="biohistorical1"&gt;Edgar, Heather J.H., “Biohistorical Approaches to ‘Race’ in the United States: Biological Distances Among African Americans, European Americans and Their Ancestors,” American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Vol. 39 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Through her study she found the idea of “White” changed over a small length of time to include Eastern Europeans, while the idea of “Black” has changed very little over the 400 years that there has been contact with Americans.&lt;ref name="biohistorical1"/&gt;
Although never actually accepted as valid, the research of Madison Grant, which advocated the idea of Nordic superiority, is another example of racial biohistoric study. His book outlined his belief that the Mediterranean and Alpine races were causing various problems in the political structure of Europe and the United States.

==== Biohistory and African Americans ====
Many race historians have studied biohistory in relation to African Americans. Like Heather Edgar, Lesley M. Rankin-Hill in her dissertation, focused mainly on the conditions, especially the prevalence of disease, of free African Americans, including the population of blacks at the First African Baptist Church in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin-Hill, Lesley M. Afro-American Biohistory: Theoretical and Methodological Considerations. (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Through her research, using bone, teeth, and other samples, one of her findings was that “free Philadelphia Afro-Americans were generally healthier than their slave or emancipated counterparts.”&lt;ref&gt;Rankin-Hill, Lesley M. Afro-American Biohistory: Theoretical and Methodological Considerations. (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1992), xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
In her article, Fatimah Linda Collier Jackson describes various factors and their effects on the African American population. She states that along with the continent of Africa having had the longest history of human habitation
African American biological variation is also a product of the great Atlantic Diaspora, a movement that was initiated with the social and economic disruptions in Africa preceding the trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans peoples and includes the forced march of prisoners of war to the sea for transport, the dynamics of the horrific Middle Passage and the seasoning process, and the biological and biocultural readjustments of Africans to enslavement in the Americas&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Fatimah Linda Collier, “Evolutionary and Political Economic Influences on Biological Diversity in African Americans,” Journal of Black Studies, Vol. 23: No. 4, (June 1993), 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biohistory and gender studies ===
[[Thomas Jefferson]] (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826), third President of the United States once wrote, “[t]he stronger sex imposes on the weaker. It is civilization alone which replaces women in their natural equality.” This quote is reflective of the relationship that has existed between man and women throughout most of human history.&lt;ref name="mcelvaine2001"&gt;McElvaine, Robert S., Eve’s Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History, (New York: McGraw Hill, 2001), 3&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert S. McElvaine, author of Eve’s Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and Human History, explains the relationship between men and women through a biological framework. His research focuses on the idea that instead of women having penis envy, men have breast and/or womb envy. This can be attributed to the fact that “[p]regnancy, birthing, and nursing have always constituted a ‘no man’s land.’” With these areas that men were not allowed, they
In response to this circumstance...have, throughout history and across cultures, set up a variety of ‘no woman’s land’: war, politics, clergy, business, men’s clubs, and so forth. From which activities women are excluded varies from one culture to another, but some form of exclusion can be found in all societies&lt;ref name="mcelvaine2001"/&gt;
McElvaine argues that it is this distinction that has driven men to subordinate women. Through various studies, he also hypothesizes that women were responsible for the agriculture, which took control and power away from the males, of which males soon took back power.&lt;ref&gt;McElvaine, Robert S., Eve’s Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History, (New York: McGraw Hill, 2001), Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; McElvaine asserts that it throughout history, it is this interaction and struggle, among others, between the sexes that led to the subordination of women.
Of Robert McElvaine and his research, some say that he almost accurately presents the [[masculine]]/[[feminine]] dichotomy in relation to environmental and biological factors.

== Another branch of biohistory ==
Aside from the above-stated study of biohistory there is another branch that is more accessible to the public. This branch of biohistory is concerned with using science to not only validate history, but to form historical conclusions about certain events or trends that cannot be noted otherwise. It uses various methods that are also associated with the other branch of study such as DNA testing and other methods to determine specific characteristics of specific individuals and/or artifacts.
Both historians, scholars, and amateur historians are able to partake of this study.&lt;ref&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell Lewis. “Judgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.” The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This is because individuals and organizations are more able to petition for and conduct studies. Individuals can often cause a stir, such as this support group’s letter to the Chicago Historical Society, “I thought that a ‘historical’ society wanted to ferret out truth. Where is that line in the sand drawn—what we ignorant heathens are permitted to learn about historical figures and what is off limits to us? And who draws that line—the Chicago Historical Society?”&lt;ref&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 230.&lt;/ref&gt;
Russell Lewis states that as a biohistorian he “felt compelled to undertake this research by the promise of finding new clues, new evidence, perhaps even new understandings of the past in dirt and stains and grit and grime that typically would be removed from an artifact during cleaning.”&lt;ref&gt;Russell Lewis. “Judgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.” The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 96&lt;/ref&gt; This can be considered a common approach and desire for many biohistorians under this method.

=== Examples ===
On April 25, 2011, Wynne Parry wrote an article for [[MSNBC]] about the unknown child aboard the Titanic. For years there have been speculations about the identity of this young boy. Through misleading evidence, researchers have inaccurately identified the child numerous times.&lt;ref name="msn1"&gt;Parry, Wynne, “Titanic’s Unknown Child is Finally Identified,” MSNBC, April 25, 2011, accessed: April 26, 2011, http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42755013/ns/technology_and_science-science/42683081.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of genetics to solve this problem began a decade ago. Robert Parr, an adjunct professor familiar with extraction and DNA testing pursued one claim. Through mitochondrial DNA test of the remains, he tested the DNA with that of the siblings of the perceived child. When results did not match, the search continued. After another false identification due to perceived age, researchers have agreed on the identity of the child, [[Sidney Goodwin]]. Even with looking at other factors including teeth structures, researchers misidentified the child. Ryan Parr commented, “Luckily, it was a rare difference, so that is what gives you 98 percent certainty the identification is correct.”&lt;ref name="msn1"/&gt;  The possibility exists that the child may still be inappropriately identified, but this case shows how this branch of biohistory works.
This form of biohistory was also used with artifacts of [[Abraham Lincoln]] (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865). The Chicago Historical Society has the largest collection of artifacts and items related to the late President. There are many scholars and amateur historians that have the desire to “exemplify biohistorical quests that typically involve the authentication of historical remains and artifacts, the resolution of speculative medical history or paternity disputes, or the commercial potential of genetic analysis.”&lt;ref name="biohistorical2004"&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The CHS was constantly asked to conduct DNA testing on several of Lincoln’s personal items in order to find out various facts including “proof whether or not he suffered from Marfan’s syndrome.”&lt;ref&gt;Russell Lewis. “Judgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.” The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have stated interest in conducting aDNA tests on the bloody cloak of [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Lincoln]], wife of Abraham.
These types of claims and research are an integral part of this branch of biohistory.

== Ethical standards ==
Some scholars have developed a set of ethical standards for biohistorical study. These ethical standards are largely associated with the branch of study that uses science to validate history since the other branch does not necessarily require such standards since the nature of study does not directly have any debilitating consequences.
There have been concerns with the scope of biohistorical research as the study has grown in popularity. Russell Lewis stated that a “review of professional codes for twenty-three scientific, historical, and cultural organizations showed a lack of inconsistency and insufficient concern for ethical values that should inform biohistorical investigation.”&lt;ref&gt;Russell Lewis. “Judgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.” The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some aspects of biohistorical research that can be detrimental towards understanding include the destruction of fragile and/or antique artifacts, unreliable and wrong data attributed as fact due to scientific reasoning, and the defamation and other consequences that can affect living populations associated with what is being studied. This last point is especially true of studies dealing with people who are deceased. Because “[b]iohistory often involves an identifiable object and genetic analysis of tissue can reveal information about the paternity, health status, and predispositions of family members” there is the potential for biohistoric research to lead to inappropriate claims as well as other areas of defamation.&lt;ref&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In one study done by the Chicago Historical Society they “concluded that DNA testing [one of the most widely accepted forms of biohistorical research] would damage the artifacts [here referring to the Society’s Abraham Lincoln collection].”&lt;ref&gt;Russell Lewis. “Judgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.” The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 93&lt;/ref&gt; Buenger states that "[g]reater consideration should be given to basic techniques, such as detailed visual or microscopical examination" which are less destructive rather than rely on DNA and similar tests.&lt;ref&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedures and guidelines ===
The norm of scientific validation and

[b]iohistorical research proposals have generated historical, scientific, and social concerns, including the justification for the proposed research, appropriateness of the study design, destruction of fragile museum specimens, the relevance of informed consent, potential harm to live relatives, cultural respect for the dead, confidentiality of medical and genetic information, and the interpretation of study results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref name="biohistorical2004"/&gt;

which has led to a call for some ethical standards to set a framework for study.
Through her evaluation of biohistorical ethical standards Nancy Buenger came up with a series of questions that should be answered by those doing the research. She broke them down into three areas: Historical, Scientific, and Social Considerations. Some of the questions that she states need to be asked include:
* Is the provenance of proposed biological samples reliable?
* Do the investigators have previous experience and a reasonable success rate with the proposed materials and methodologies?
* What are the potential negative consequences of biohistorical knowledge for human subjects as well as their relatives and communities?&lt;ref&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 234.&lt;/ref&gt;
For a full list of her ethical considerations click here [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4129637?seq=8&amp;Search=yes&amp;searchText=connective&amp;searchText=tissue&amp;list=show&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dconnective%2Btissue%26acc%3Don%26wc%3Don&amp;prevSearch=&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=1835&amp;returnArticleService=showFullText&amp;resultsServiceName=null].

One debate coming out of the rise of biohistorical research centers on whether or not these studies should be conducted based on cultural and societal beliefs. There are those that say “cranial dimensions” and other scientific measurements “should trump notions of cultural affiliation.”&lt;ref&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Then there are those that ask if this kind of study should be paramount because of certain significances that some societies hold true that can be eliminated with scientific discovery.

== Interpretations ==
As with any intellectual school of thought, there exist critiques, criticisms, and praise for biohistory. Below are a few examples of both positive and negative critiques.

=== Positive ===
The study of biohistory allows for the possibility of collaboration between historians and scientists, in a way that has rarely been seen before. This collaboration allows for better understanding between the disciplines because “[t]hey need the insights of historians to mediate between humans’ evolutionary inheritance and modern behavior as much as historians and social scientists need the insights of biologists to understand better the motivations behind the historical behavior we study.”&lt;ref name="biohistory2002"/&gt;
The study of biohistory allows for historians to consider an aspect of historical research that has not been considered before. Biohistory also opens up the scope of study to the beginning of human existence into prehistory, which goes back many more years than historians normally like to go back.

=== Negative ===
Aside from the collaboration that can be a product of this type of study, there are many scholars who find fault with biohistory. One major critique of biohistory is the continued repetition of ideas from scholar to scholar. In a review of Stephen Boyden’s book, Western Civilization in the Biological Perspective: Patterns in Biohistory, one such scholar states that “[r]eaders who are familiar with other works in biohistory by René Dubos, D. B. Grigg, C.J. Glacken, Donald Worster, and William McNeill will find little that is new.”&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Alfred W, “Review [untitled]" Isis, Vol. 80: No. 1, (March 1989), 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another critique is that biohistory encompasses too vast a scope. To start from the beginning of the human condition creates too wide a spread of time, leaving room for much speculation. That is because there is not much data and knowledge about the early times studied, leading biohistorians to speculate and possibly make invalid assumptions. Another critique is that many biohistorians rely on too much science in their research. In trying to make assertions about certain historical issues, many are limited in their areas of study to just focusing on scientific aspects while leaving out others.

One scholar, in review of Lesley M. Rankin-Hill’s book, A Biohistory of 19th Century Afro-Americans: The Burial Remains of a Pennsylvania Cemetery, stated that while supporting her hypothesis with examples and statistics that she promotes others have not considered, “Rankin-Hill charts out, and then gets bogged down in, the model she will use in her ‘biocultural analysis’” that she fails to present any new evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Savitt, Todd L, “Review: [untitled],” The Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Vol. 28: No. 4. (March 1998), 682.&lt;/ref&gt;
Referring to the CHS and the collection of Lincoln’s items, Nancy Brueger states that in their general study
Historians are most interested in analyses that illuminate broad cultural, economic, political, or social trends. The authenticity of an individual artifact such as CHS’s cloak would not significantly contribute to the reevaluation of President Lincoln’s assassination or the social impact of this event.&lt;ref&gt;Buenger, Nancy. “Connective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.” Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

'''Brian Patrick Lamb''' ({{IPAc-en|l|æ|m}}; born October 9, 1941)&lt;ref name=PlayStr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31lamb.htm |title=Playing It Straight |author=Peter Meredith |date=31 October 2005 |publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=16 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222150817/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31lamb.htm |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[journalist]] and the founder, executive chairman, and now retired CEO of [[C-SPAN]]; an American [[Cable channel|cable network]] which provides coverage of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] as well as other public affairs events. Prior to launching C-SPAN in 1979, Lamb held various communications roles including [[White House]] [[Telecommunications policy of the United States|telecommunications policy]] staffer and Washington bureau chief for ''Cablevision'' magazine. He also served as a commissioned officer in the [[United States Navy]] for four years. Lamb has conducted thousands of interviews in his lifetime, including those on C-SPAN's ''[[Booknotes]]'' and ''[[Q&amp;A (U.S. talk show)|Q&amp;A]]'', and is known for his unique interview style, focusing on short, direct questions. Over the course of his career Lamb has received numerous honors and awards including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[National Humanities Medal]].

==Early life and education==
Lamb was born in [[Lafayette, Indiana]]&lt;ref name=Aamidor&gt;{{cite news |title= Q&amp;A Brian Lamb Founder, CEO of C-SPAN |author= Abe Aamidor |url=http://www.indy.com/posts/q-a-brian-lamb-founder-ceo-of-c-span |newspaper= ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]''|page= I12|date= 25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lived there until he was 22 years old. Growing up, he wanted to be an entertainer and spent time as a [[disc jockey]] and as a [[drummer]] in many local bands.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChanChan&gt;{{cite journal |date=March–April 2003|title= Changing the Channel|journal= National Endowment for the Humanities |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030401141916/http://www.neh.gov:80/news/humanities/2003-03/channel.html|access-date=April 1, 2003|volume= 24|issue= 2|pages= 14+|issn= 0018-7526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb showed an early interest in television and radio: he started his first radio job at a local station in Lafayette, [[WASK (AM)]], at the age of 17,&lt;ref name=Cullen&gt;{{cite news |title=Legend's Lafayette ties strong |author=Kevin Cullen |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=470F-9C20-01D1-S50G&amp;csi=256482&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |newspaper=Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN) |date=27 July 2002 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Manip/&gt; working as a disc jockey and selling advertisements.&lt;ref name=MaureenGroppe/&gt; His job at the radio station gave him the opportunity to interview musicians including [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Count Basie]], and [[The Kingston Trio]], while he was still in high school.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manip/&gt; In 1961, during his junior year at college, he coordinated a television program titled ''Dance Date'', similar to [[Dick Clark]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series, ''[[American Bandstand]]''.&lt;ref name=ChanChan/&gt;

After graduation from [[Jefferson High School (Lafayette, Indiana)|Jefferson High School]], Lamb attended [[Purdue University]],&lt;ref name=Cullen/&gt; where he was a member of [[Phi Gamma Delta]]&lt;ref name=FIJI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purduegreeks.com/famousAlumni.php here |title=Famous Alumni |work=purduegreeks.com |publisher=Purdue Interfraternity Council |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Speech in 1963.&lt;ref name=PlayStr/&gt;&lt;ref name=States/&gt;

==Military service==
Following graduation from Purdue, Lamb was accepted into the [[United States Navy]] [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)|Officer Candidate School]]. Upon completion of his training, he served 18 months on the [[Amphibious cargo ship|attack cargo ship]] {{USS|Thuban|AKA-19|6}}, and then moved to the Pentagon where he served in the audio/visual office of the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs]]. Lamb took up this role midway through the [[Vietnam War]] and, in addition to handling queries from radio and television networks,&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite news |title=C-SPAN founder among Lone Sailor awardees |author=Joshua Stewart |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=534M-5K51-DYJJ-P1VF&amp;csi=275831&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |newspaper=Navy Times |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he attended press briefings with [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]].&lt;ref name=Barnhart/&gt; In July 1967, following [[1967 Detroit riot|riots in Detroit]], Lamb was sent there and tasked with providing recordings of news conferences of [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] [[George W. Romney]] of Michigan for the [[White House Situation Room]].&lt;ref name=ChanChan/&gt; He also served as a [[White House Military Office|White House social aide]] to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], in which role he escorted [[Lady Bird Johnson]] down the aisle at the wedding of [[Chuck Robb]] and [[Lynda Bird Johnson Robb|Lynda Johnson]]. He later recalled, "For five years after I got out of the Navy and went back part of the time to Indiana, the only thing I was known to have ever done in my life was to escort Mrs. Johnson down the aisle."&lt;ref name=ChanChan/&gt; Lamb spent a total of four years in the U.S. Navy and was a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant, junior grade]] at the time that he left.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt; He later said that his time in the U.S. Navy "was probably the most important thing [he has] ever done".&lt;ref name=ChanChan/&gt;

==Early career==

===Communications and journalism work===
In December 1967, following his Navy service, Lamb's interest in politics led him to interview for the role of personal aide to [[Richard Nixon]] during his campaign for the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], but instead he returned to Indiana . In August 1968, after working at a local television station in Lafayette, he spent ten weeks working for a group called United Citizens for [[Richard Nixon presidential campaign, 1968|Nixon-Agnew]].&lt;ref name=Prato&gt;{{cite news |title=The Man Behind C-SPAN |author=Lou Prato |url=http://ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=1503 |work=American Journalism Review |date=September 1992 |accessdate=8 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603061946/http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=1503# |archive-date=2013-06-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the campaign, he worked as a reporter for UPI Audio&lt;ref name=Truman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanaward.org/web/LambBio.html |title=Mr. Brian Lamb's Bio |publisher=The Harry S.

After the White House, Lamb returned to journalism as the editor of a biweekly newsletter entitled, ''The Media Report''.&lt;ref name=Truman/&gt;&lt;ref name=TargetedNews/&gt; While editing ''The Media Report'', he also became the Washington bureau chief of trade magazine ''Cablevision''&lt;ref name=Kirtley&gt;{{cite news |title=Founding Father: How C-SPAN's Brian Lamb Changed Politics in America |author=Jane E.

==C-SPAN==
{{main article|C-SPAN}}
In 1977, Lamb submitted to cable television executives a proposal for a nonprofit channel that would broadcast official proceedings of [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name=PurePol&gt;{{cite news |title= Pure Politics|work= Scene|page= SC1|date= 17 June 1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45xJMl18F20C&amp;pg=PA289 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said, "The risks weren't very significant. No one knew who I was. If I failed, so what?"&lt;ref name=PlayStr/&gt; The idea was approved in December 1977 and the [[C-SPAN|Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network]] was created as a private nonprofit business with a board of cable-operating company executives, funded by affiliate fees from cable companies.&lt;ref name=Heath&gt;{{cite news |title=Value Added: A 46-Year Career Built on Letting Viewers Make Up Their Own Minds |author=Thomas Heath |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/value-added-a-46-year-career-built-on-letting-viewers-make-up-their-own-minds/2011/09/15/gIQA3IaEdK_story_1.html |work=Washington Post |date=18 September 2011 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bedard/&gt; At its launch the network had a staff of four employees, including Lamb, and an annual budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]450,000.

Lamb does not discuss his own political views.&lt;ref name=Gillespie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reason.com/archives/2010/11/16/the-democratizer |title=The Democratizer |author=Nick Gillespie |date=December 2010 |work=Reason.com |publisher=Reason Magazine |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ''The Advocate'', his style of interviewing is "Spartan",&lt;ref name=Advocate/&gt; and he has stated: "Too many interviewers intrude too much. … They try to make us think they're smarter than the person they're interviewing. Well, I assume I'm not smarter and if I am smarter I don't want the audience to find out."&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;  

If a guest uses a term of art such as "cloture" he will ask them to define it for the audience, and invariably will ask the guest where they went to school, his or her children's names, and occupations.

===''Booknotes''===

In his 35 years at C-SPAN, Lamb has conducted thousands of interviews,&lt;ref name=Aamidor/&gt; including 801 editions of ''[[Booknotes]]'', a weekly program he hosted focusing on nonfiction books.&lt;ref name=PlayStr/&gt;&lt;ref name=TargetedNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slices&gt;{{cite news |title=Slices of History; Excerpts from author interviews on C-SPAN's 'Booknotes' are compiled by host; Brian Lamb |author=Susan L.

After ''Booknotes'' ended, Lamb began hosting a new program titled ''Q&amp;A'', featuring interviews with notable figures from politics, technology, education, and media, as well as authors.&lt;ref name=TVNewsCheck/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAssociatedPress/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.c-span.org/series/?qa|title= About Q&amp;A|accessdate=27 November 2014 |publisher= [[C-SPAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued to host ''Washington Journal'', C-SPAN's morning call-in program, until 2008.&lt;ref name=TheAssociatedPress/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewsCheck/&gt;

In 2011, Lamb donated his collection of books from the ''Booknotes'' series, many containing his personal marginalia, to the rare books collection of [[George Mason University]] to create an academic archive.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite news |title=In Brian Lamb's 'Booknotes' marginalia, a record of our time's serious thoughts |author=John Kelly |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/in-brian-lambs-booknotes-marginalia-a-record-of-our-times-serious-thoughts/2011/09/21/gIQA8EwzlK_story.html |work=The Washington Post |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues===
As CEO of C-SPAN, Lamb was involved in issues related to ensuring public access to the proceedings of the federal government and also to increasing media access to legislative and judicial proceedings. Lamb opposed the "[[must-carry]]" provisions of the [[Cable Television Protection and Competition Act]] of 1992, which he later stated had led to 10 million Americans losing or experiencing reduced access to C-SPAN.&lt;ref name=Lardner&gt;{{cite news |title=The Anti-Network |author=James Lardner |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1994/03/14/1994_03_14_049_TNY_CARDS_000364044 |newspaper=The New Yorker |date=14 March 1994 |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lamb: Digital Rule Could Bump Cable Net in Millions of Homes Cable |author=Brooks Boliek |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4928575-1.html |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=29 May 1998 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he wrote to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation|Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]], arguing against digital must-carry legislation.&lt;ref name=NewsCheck&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/04/20/41591/cspan-the-other-washington-monument |title=C-SPAN: The Other Washington Monument |date=20 April 2010 |work=TVNewsCheck.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite news |title=C-Span chief pans digital must-carry |author=Christopher Stern |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117471381?refCatId=18 |newspaper=Daily Variety |date=1 June 1998 |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; During the [[impeachment of President Clinton]], Lamb wrote to then-Senate Majority Leader [[Trent Lott]], urging the Senate to "keep this process open to the public" and formally requesting permission for televised coverage of the Senate's deliberations.&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{cite news |title=C-SPAN's Beltway Buddha Wisely Pushes for TV Coverage |author=James Warren |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/37922117.html?dids=37922117:37922117&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+10%2C+1999&amp;author=James+Warren.&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=C-SPAN'S+BELTWAY+BUDDHA+WISELY+PUSHES+FOR+TV+COVERAGE&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=10 January 1999 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he has written to House Speakers of both parties in 1994, 2006 and 2010, requesting that independent media cameras be added to the House floor to allow a more complete view of debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=C-SPAN asks GOP leader John Boehner for more camera access |author=Catalina Camia |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2010/11/c-span-john-boehner-house-cameras-/1 |work=USA Today |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=C-SPAN to Incoming House Speaker John Boehner: Let Us Use Our Own Cameras to Cover Congress |author=Alex Weprin |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/c-span-to-incoming-house-speaker-john-boehner-let-us-use-our-own-cameras-to-cover-congress_b39751 |work=TVNewser |publisher=Mediabistro  |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb has also written to chief justices Rehnquist and Roberts requesting the televising of [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=C-SPAN asks court to allow TV coverage |newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20001125&amp;id=NMlaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gXgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6754,6777917 |date=25 November 2000 |page=7A |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ardor in the Court |author=Michael McGough |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=20051114&amp;id=bPBRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=53ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6830,3020997 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=14 November 2005 |page=B7 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other federal courts.&lt;ref name="Groppe2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weyrich&gt;{{cite news |title=Nice Guys Don't Always Finish Last |author=Paul M.

The '''Catacomb of San Pancrazio''' (also called '''of Ottavilla''') is a [[Catacombs of Rome|catacomb of Rome]] ([[Italy]]), located in the [[Via Aurelia]], within the modern ''Quartiere'' Gianicolense.

==The martyrs==
The catacomb is especially known to have Pancras from Phrygia, a famous martyr, buried within its walls. Pancras was entrusted to his uncle Dionysus at age 8,after his parents died, and they both came to Rome. Saint Pancras converted to Christianity while in Rome and at the age of 14, he was beheaded in May 304 AD (around 303 AD Christians were being persecuted for their faith) when he refused to sacrifice to the gods. Before Diocletian, emperor at the time, was impressed with how young Pancras was and how he had the courage to refuse sacrificing to the Gods, so he offered Pancras money and power to leave the Christian faith, but Pancras still refused so he was beheaded and thrown to the side.

His body was abandoned on the Via Aurelia and was picked up by a Christian matrona, Ottavilla, who buried him. Ottavilla found the body and the head on May 12 304 AD, she picked them up, wrapped Pancras in precious linen and buried him specifically in the Catacombs that stood there. His head was eventually placed in a precious manner in the Basilica, the body lays in an urn and the site still reads "Hic decollatus fuit Sanctus Pancratius" (Here San Pancrazio was taken off) ". His body now rests among other martyrs buried in the Catacombs.

The ancient sources, particularly the Medieval itineraries for pilgrims, mention other martyrs buried within the catacomb: Artemy, Paulinus, Sophia and her three daughters Faith, Hope and Charity. The resting place of the last four martyrs can probably be identified with the so-called cubicle of St. Sophia.

The cult of St. Pancras highly spread during the Middle Ages, so much so that the catacomb bearing his name was one of the few in Rome that could always be visited by the pilgrims. The once di Calepodio cemetery, where Pancras was buried, changed its name to the Catacombs of San Pancrazio. The first notice about the martyrdom of Pancras comes from the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, that sets the date of the death at 12 May.

==History==
Between the end of the 4th century and the beginning of the 5th, Pope Symmachus built a basilica above the catacomb consecrated to the martyr and a thermal edifice. In 594 Gregory the Great provided the basilica with a cloister. In 625 Pope Honorius I rebuilt the basilica after a Greek-Gothic war, with three naves. Pope Honorius' rebuilding is the basilica that still exists today.

As mentioned above, San Pancrazio is one of the few catacombs in Rome whose track has not been completely lost during the centuries, even if it has often been confused with other catacombs rising along the Via Aurelia. Antonio Bosio thoroughly studied the cemetery, but he confused it with the cemetery of Calepodius; the two catacombs were distinguished by Giovanni Battista de Rossi in the 19th century.

Excavations carried out at the beginning of the 1930s under the floor of the Basilica of San Pancrazio led to the discovery of a Roman street that cut in two, diagonally to the church; they also brought to light some mausolea and ground graves, both inside the basilica and in its square, such demonstrating that the hypogeous cemetery also included an extended funerary area on the topsoil.

==Topography and description==

The Catacomb of San Pancrazio is not in the most perfect condition: the tunnels are mostly destroyed and therefore the visit to see the Catacomb is very short.

The hypogeous cemerety can be divided into three main regions:

*The first region is placed below the left transept of the basilica and behind the apse and its access is still the former entrance, within the left nave. This region was explored in the first half of the 20th century by Father Fusciardi.

*In the right nave, a trapdoor gives access to the second region, placed below the square in front of the basilica. In this region it is possible to visit:

    The cubicle of Botrys, from the name of the decedent buried in it. The peculiarity of this grave is that, on his headstone, Botrys declares himself as a christianós, an unusual expression in the Christian graveyards.

    The cubicle of Saint Felix, dating back to the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century, decorated with a linear red style and elements referring to the sea (ships and fishes).

    The cubicle of Saint Sophia, housing a white-plastered arcosolium with four graves, that are believed to be the martyr Sophia and her three daughters'.

*Finally, the third region is placed below the cloister. Within the third region there are widespread Constantinian Christograms, which lead the researchers to believe that this part of the hypogeous cemetery has been built in the 4th century.

'''Catalist''' is a for-profit corporation based in Washington, D.C., that operates a [[voter database]].&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ambinder|first1=Marc|title=Exclusive: How Democrats Won The Data War In 2008|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/10/exclusive-how-democrats-won-the-data-war-in-2008/27647/|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
It was founded in 2006 by [[Harold M. Ickes]] with seed money from [[George Soros]]. It specializes in [[microtargeting]] for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Robert|title=Catalist, the left’s secret electoral weapon, outguns GOP|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/19/knight-the-lefts-mighty-catalist/?page=all|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=Washington Times|date=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded as Data Warehouse, LLC.&lt;ref name="CatalistBloomberg"&gt;{{cite web

Catalist's CEO is [[Laura Quinn]], an economic policy advisor in the U.S. Senate and former Deputy Chief of Staff for Vice President Al Gore. 

In August 2016, Catalist analyzed records from 10 [[battleground states]] through June and found a major influx of new voters, majority-white, were responsible for the record-breaking turnout in the Republican primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/donald-trumps-great-white-hope-is-fading-fast.html|title=Donald Trump’s Great White Hope Is Fading Fast|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/voter-influx-appears-missing-for-trump-1471912460|title=Voter Influx Appears Missing for Trump|last=Tau|first=ron|date=2016-08-23|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaboration between Catalist and [[SurveyMonkey]] showed that Sanders supporters voted less frequently and were less reliably Democratic than Clinton supporters.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Catalist served as the principal repository of Democratic data, working with over 90 liberal groups including the [[Service Employees International Union]], the [[Democratic National Committee]], and the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;

Catalist has engaged in [[data mining]] on behalf of clients such as [[Rock the Vote]] and [[EMILY's List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Issenberg|first1=Sasha|title=For Sale: Detailed Voter Profiles|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/victory_lab/2012/01/the_co_op_and_the_data_trust_the_dnc_and_rnc_get_into_the_data_mining_business_.html|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=Slate|date=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalist receives funding from the [[Democracy Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Confessore|first1=Nicholas|title=Groups Mobilize to Aid Democrats in ’14 Data Arms Race|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/us/politics/groups-mobilize-to-aid-democrats.html|accessdate=11 November 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Catalist received $725,000 from the [[National Education Association]], a major teachers union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/08/15/if-your-childs-school-is-failing-thank-union.html|title=If your child's school is failing, thank a union {{!}} Fox News|last=Berman|first=Richard|date=2016-08-15|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company as of 2018 claims that it has data on 240 million unique individuals in the United States, to be used by "progressive" organizations. Laura Quinn remained chief executive officer.&lt;ref name="AboutCatalist"&gt;{{cite web

The anthology's title derives from an 1831 declaration by [[Maria W. Stewart]] (1803–1880), the first [[African-American]] woman to give public lectures, in which she said: "O, ye daughters of Africa, awake! awake! arise! no longer sleep nor slumber, but distinguish yourselves. Show forth to the world that ye are endowed with noble and exalted facutlies."&lt;ref&gt;Maria W. Stewart (ed. Marilyn Richardson), [https://books.google.com/books?id=noSOhOOsNuUC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=maria+stewart+%22ye+daughters+of+africa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tuyBxyTqUE&amp;sig=ZYGhcoSnPkaZTe-73tid8AVCvxQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAWoVChMIoa6CoLOtxwIVRrUaCh1igw9W#v=onepage&amp;q=maria%20stewart%20%22ye%20daughters%20of%20africa%22&amp;f=false "Religion And The Pure Principles of Morality, The Sure Foundation On Which We Must Build"], in ''America's First Black Woman Political Writer: Essays and Speeches''], [[Indiana University Press]], 1987, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Daughters of Africa'' was widely praised on publication. Reviewing it for Black British newspaper ''The Weekly Journal'', Evie Arup wrote: "''Daughters of Africa'' is a literary first. Never before has the work of women of African descent world-wide been gathered together in one volume. The breadth of this collection is startling.... This book should be required reading for any student of literature, and a standard reference book in school libraries, and, to paraphrase that well known slogan, 'every home should have one.'"&lt;ref&gt;Evie Arup, "Books: Daughters of Africa", ''The Weekly Journal'' (Issue 29), 12 November 1992, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer from ''[[The Independent]]'', however, observed: "This book may seem to be about literature but in the end it is as much a testament to language: its power to create attitudes as well as its potency as a means of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Lee, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/book-review-canon-to-the-right-of-them-canon-to-the-left-daughters-of-africa-ed-margaret-busby-1563049.html "BOOK REVIEW / Canon to the right of them, canon to the left..."], ''The Independent'', 12 December 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Library Journal]]'', the anthology is "an invaluable text for courses on women writers and writers of African descent",&lt;ref name=B&amp;N&gt;[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/daughters-of-africa-margaret-busby/1002938755#productInfoTabs "Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Words and Writings by Women of African Descent and from the Ancient Egyptian to the Present"], Barnes &amp; Noble.&lt;/ref&gt; and Keneth Kinnamon in ''[[Callaloo (journal)|Callaloo]]'' saw it as "impressive", noting: "Brief headnotes and long bibliographies enhance the value of this important volume."&lt;ref&gt;Keneth Kinnamon, "Anthologies of African-American Literature from 1845 to 1994", in ''Callaloo'', Vol. 20, No. 2 (Spring, 1997), p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorna Sage]] in the ''Independent on Sunday'' concluded that "''Daughters of Africa'' has a paradoxical universality",&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Sage, "Deep roots in an impossible homeland", The Sunday Review, ''Independent on Sunday'', 3 January 1993, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Washington Post Book World]]'' called it: "A magnificent starting place for any reader interested in becoming part of the collective enterprise of discovering and uncovering the silent, forgotten, and underrated voices of black women."&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1994/02/06/new-in-paperback/438e9308-0e92-44ef-a403-3fde2d87806a/ "New in Paperback"], ''The Washington Post'', 6 February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shereen Ali, [http://m.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2015-04-29/sharing-our-voices "Sharing Our Voices"], ''[[Trinidad and Tobago Guardian]]'', 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reviewer for ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' wrote: "It is a landmark anthology.... Busby's first-of-a-kind anthology is a poignant reminder of how vast and varied the body of black women's writing is."&lt;ref name=Bolden /&gt; It has also been described as "groundbreaking",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-busby Margaret Busby profile], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as "one of the most significant assemblages of writers across the diaspora"&lt;ref&gt;Carol Boyce Davies, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=%22Daughters+of+Africa%22+%22margaret+busby%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uqtNXKoCPA&amp;sig=5BNdSUI3ahIcdmpA-st1pgEJ5mk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CJIBEOgBMBhqFQoTCJ_a55Cmn8cCFUTaGgod8QwMWQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Daughters%20of%20Africa%22%20%22margaret%20busby%22&amp;f=false "Women and Literature in the African Diaspora"], in Melvin Ember, Carol R. Ember, Ian Skoggard (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World, Volume 1'', Springer Science and Business Media Inc., 2005, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the ultimate reference guide to the writing of 'daughters of Africa'".&lt;ref&gt;Sharmilla Beezmohun, [http://www.wasafiri.org/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=307 "Twenty-Five most influential books"], ''[[Wasafiri]]'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was included in ''Sacred Fire: "QBR" 100 Essential Black Books'',&lt;ref&gt;Max Rodriguez, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Sacred_Fire.html?id=FDxEAAAAMAAJ ''Sacred Fire: "QBR" 100 Essential Black Books''], University of Michigan, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; which said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Daughters of Africa'' is a monumental achievement because it is the most comprehensive international anthology of oral and written literature by women of African descent ever attempted. (...) The success of the collection is that it clearly illustrates why all women of African descent are connected by showing how closely related are the obstacles, the chasms of cultural indifference, and the disheartening racial and sexual dilemmas they faced. In so doing, the collection captures the range of their singular and combined accomplishments.

''Daughters of Africa''′s accomplishment lies in its glorious portrayal of the richness and magnitude of the spiritual well from which we've all drawn inspiration and to where we've all gone for sustenance, and as such, it is a stunning literary masterpiece."&lt;ref name=B&amp;N /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1559">'''Esperantology''', or '''Esperanto studies''', is a special [[Esperanto]] linguistics whose subjects are word construction, word assembly, word introduction and transcription of [[umbrella term]]s and proper names. Esperantology principles of word construction are exemplary of the principles of necessity and sufficiency which postulate a balance between conciseness and clarity of the word. Regarding word roots, esperantology sets these principles:

* The principle of internationality
* The principle of analogy with other language elements
* The principle of the vocabulary being economical
* The principle of euphony

As it is possible to see, all these principles are not always in accordance among themselves; for example the principle of internationality asks for the word ''internacionala'' while the analogy and the dictionary being economical as for the word ''internacia''. In the language, the second and third rule are stronger than the first one.

Besides, the absolute validity of the above-mentioned principles also obstructs the language use, which can sanction not that correct forms and can clarify forms not clear enough.

[[File:ExilesOnAsperus.jpg|thumb|First edition, cover art by Colin Hay]]

'''''Exiles on Asperus''''' ({{ISBN|0-340-24046-6}}) is a collection of [[science fiction]] short stories by [[John Wyndham]], writing as John Benyon, published in 1979 after his death by [[Coronet Books]].

The collection contains:

*Exiles on Asperus (1933)
*No Place Like Earth (1951)
*The Venus Adventure (1932)

Exiles tells the story of a human crew who are transporting a group of Martian dissidents to a penal colony only for the captives to revolt leading to the crew, prisoners, and the survivors of a previous crash becoming embroiled in a battle for survival against the indigenous life form of the planet Asperus.

No Place Like Earth sees a survivor of the Earth's destruction facing a slow, quiet life on Mars or becoming part of the efforts to keep humanity alive on Venus, and the repercussions of his decision.

The Venus Adventure tells of an early flight to Venus and the surprising world the crew of the Fyra discover. Not only are there intelligent indigenous lifeforms, and a breathable atmosphere, there are also fellow humans.

== Concepts ==
The ''free scientific'' intended to solve the contradictions of the [[exegesis]] school and improve the traditional [[Legal positivism|juspositivism]]. One of its goals was to complete the "voids" of legal order&lt;ref&gt;See also [[A Theory of Legal Order]]&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling them with scientific elements, so denying law as the unique source of that order.&lt;ref name="TRADULEX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradulex.org/Actes2000/kasirer.pdf|title=François Gény's "Libre Recherche Scientifique" as a Guide to Legal Translation|author=Kasirer, Nicholas|publisher=Tradulex.org|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CONTJUR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conteudojuridico.com.br/monografia-tcc-tese,a-hermeneutica-na-aplicacao-dos-principios-juridicos,23352.html|title=A Hermenêutica na Aplicação dos Princípios Jurídicos|author=Mendonça, Aline Cala|date=12 March 2009|publisher=Conteúdo Jurídico|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thinking paradigm emphasizes the use of [[Equity (law)|equity]] as source of the law.&lt;ref name="STUD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studility.com/?q=node/16|title=La réalisation du droit|publisher=Studility|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JUSNAV2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/9032/estudos-sobre-interpretacao-constitucional|title=Estudos sobre Interpretação Constitucional|author=Chamone, Marcelo Azevedo|date=September 2006|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free scientific research and ''nature of things'' ==
The free scientific school has elements which have come from the philosophical school called the ''[[Nature (philosophy)|nature of things]]''.&lt;ref name="HASSO"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6cfY3iaYnsC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321|last=Hasso|first=Hofmann|title=A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence - From Jhering to Hadbruch|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-90-481-2963-8|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISCSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscsp.utl.pt/~cepp/autores/franceses/geny.htm|title=Gény, François|publisher=Insituto Superior de Ciências Sociais e Políticas da Universidade Técnica de Lisboa|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free scientific school may not be identified to the ''[[natural law]]'', they are different concepts.&lt;ref name="JUSCOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/6751/o-processo-do-conhecimento-humano-e-as-correntes-do-pensamento-juridico|title=O Processo do Conhecimento Humano e as Correntes do Pensamento Jurídico|author=Borges, José Ademir Campos|date=June 2004|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be confusion between free scientific with ''free law''.&lt;ref&gt;This school denies application of imposed law when unfair in the concrete case&lt;/ref&gt; These two schools are not identical one to the other.&lt;ref name="BUSCAUFSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buscalegis.ufsc.br/revistas/files/anexos/15235-15236-1-PB.htm|title=O Direito Alternativo e a Escola do Direito Livre|author=Liberato, Gustavo Tavares Cavalcanrti|publisher=Buscalegis|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Position of the school between other thinking paradigms ==
As said above, this school is a start in facing the challenges of adjusting juspositivism to a value-oriented paradigm.

'''Gay Mountain'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Mountain|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6RID82Ru-k|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a 90-second video created for [[UK]] broadcaster [[Channel 4]] by its in-house advertising agency 4Creative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4Create|url=http://www.4creative.co.uk/|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It first aired across all of Channel 4's television channels on the day of the official opening of the [[Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics]], 7 February 2014, having been released on [[YouTube]] the previous night, on 6 February 2014. Within 48 hours of its online release (by 8pm 8 February 2014), it had accumulated over half a million views.

The video opens with a title slide saying: ''"Channel 4 proudly presents A SPECIAL WINTER ANTHEM"'' and depicts a fictional scenario in which a young woman enters a small auditorium and takes a seat as one of the last people to arrive. A man (Fred Bear of cabaret act Bearlesque),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Gay Mountain': Channel 4 Celebrates Gay Olympians with Dancing 'Bear'|url=http://adage.com/article/creativity-pick-of-the-day/gay-mountain-channel-4-celebrates-gay-olympians/291583/|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=Advertising Age|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wearing a large brown fur coat, appears on stage and starts singing a song parodying the [[National Anthem of Russia]], with his hand held to his chest.

Several members of the audience stand and emulate his gesture. Within a few bars, the singer turns around to face a red curtain behind him; this now opens up to reveal a rainbow arch with light bulbs which illuminate, and the music style changes into an up-beat dance track. Four female dancers, wearing cabaret costumes and sunglasses, appear and peel the fur coat off the singer, while putting a set of fake bear ears on his head. Now only wearing his boots, socks, red shorts with a fake bear tail and his bear ears, the man continues singing and dancing, repeating the chorus: ''"Good luck gays on Gay Mountain"''.

As the song progresses, more and more members of the audience get up and dance to the music and silver foil confetti rains from the ceiling. Among the cutaways to the audience, a young woman is seen happily dancing on her own, a male couple kiss and a topless DJ wearing sunglasses - who commentators have noted bears some resemblance to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Bryan|title=Channel 4 Has Changed Its Logo To Support Gay Athletes At The Winter Olympics|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/scottybryan/channel-4-have-changed-their-logo-to-support-gay-athletes-at|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=BuzzFeed|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - is also dancing along to the music. Throughout, the lyrics of the song appear as [[Karaoke]]-style subtitles. The video ends with the music fading out and a closing slide wishing ''"GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE OUT IN SOCHI."'' It finally cuts to a station ident that features the Channel 4 logo, a super-imposed, revolving, rainbow-coloured prism and the caption: ''"BORN RISKY"''.

Channel 4's Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Dan Brooke, has been quoted as saying: "This is a typically Channel 4 way of celebrating the start of the Winter Games and showing our support to all of the athletes out in Sochi, gay or straight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mark|first=Sweney|title=Sochi 2014: Channel 4 rebrands to back gay rights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/06/socchi-2014-channel-4-gay-winter-olympics-russia|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The video was scheduled to be broadcast by the channel for a week after its launch and ties in with Channel 4's temporary rebranding of its logo in the rainbow colours, in response to Russian legislation restricting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, introduced in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[[LGBT rights in Russia]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as widely reported human rights abuses against members of the LGBT community, such as those investigated in Channel 4's own documentary ''"Hunted"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mark|first=Jefferies|title=Shocking Channel 4 documentary reveals full horror of persecution in Russia where "gay people are hunted like animals|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/hunted-shocking-channel-4-documentary-3111965|accessdate=8 February 2014|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first broadcast in the "[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]" series on Wednesday 5 February 2014, in the run up to the Sochi Winter Olympics.

''Gay Mountain'' drew a largely positive response, with several mainstream media outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Channel 4 wins first gold medal of Sochi for fabulous gay rights promo|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/02/06/channel-4-wins-first-gold-medal-of-sochi-for-fabulous-gay-rights-promo-4293825/|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=Metro|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mark|first=Sweney|title=Sochi 2014: Channel 4 rebrands to back gay rights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/06/socchi-2014-channel-4-gay-winter-olympics-russia|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Bryan|title=Channel 4 Has Changed Its Logo To Support Gay Athletes At The Winter Olympics|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/scottybryan/channel-4-have-changed-their-logo-to-support-gay-athletes-at|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=BuzzFeed|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  covering its release and viewers' 'likes' outnumbering 'dislikes' on YouTube by 10:1 after two months following its release.

The night the Gay Mountain video was first aired on Channel 4, a small portion of the song/routine was performed live, to close an episode of [[The Last Leg]]. Earlier in the Last Leg episode, they showed a clip of the original Gay Mountain video, and offered half-hearted protest at Channel 4 blatantly mocking Putin and the anti-LGBT attitudes in Russia, when the makers of The Last Leg (which also airs on Channel 4) had been unofficially cautioned by MI6 in the previous weeks, to cut down on their attempts to poke fun at Putin by portraying him as a gay icon. The live performance of Gay Mountain was intercut with a rap - performed by show hosts [[Adam Hills]], [[Josh Widdicombe]] and [[Alex Brooker]] - offering their apologies and friendship to Vladimir Putin, and offering hope that he won't have them assassinated with [[Georgi Markov|a "poisoned umbrella]]." 

Channel 4 published the lyrics of ''Gay Mountain'' on its own website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C4 goes rainbow to wish "good luck to those out in sochi"|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-goes-rainbow-to-wish-good-luck-in-sochi|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

Be fabulous, be free&lt;br&gt;
We honour our Queens&lt;br&gt;
And follow the rainbow which leads to the east&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gay mountain, gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
Be proud on gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
Gay mountain, gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
Good luck gays, on gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mens and all Men's and Womens and all Womens ''[sic]''&lt;br&gt;
Come together tonight, sing with pride&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gay mountain, gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
Be proud on gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
Gay mountain, gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
Good luck gays, on gay mountain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A ''Gay Mountain Extended Mix'' was posted to [[SoundCloud]] on the same date as the YouTube release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Mountain Extended Mix|url=https://soundcloud.com/gay-mountain|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goguryeo art''' is the art of [[Goguryeo]], an ancient [[Korea]]n kingdom (37 BCE &amp;ndash; 668 CE) which occupied large areas of present-day [[Northeast China]] and [[Korea]]. Its distinct style is marked by flowing lines and vivid colors.  The prime examples of this style are [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|tomb murals]] excavated in [[North Korea]] and [[Manchuria]], which were produced from the 3rd to 7th centuries.

'''Harumi Fujita''' ({{lang-ja|藤田はるみ}},{{sfn|Ichikawa|2014|p=55}} also known as '''Harumi Fujita Kawabe'''){{sfn|INAH|1991}} is a [[Japan]]ese researcher of Mexican archaeology, who has specialized in pre-classical period of the northern states of [[Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]. Her research has shown that fishing cultures had arisen in the area at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] period, indicating an occupation from at least 11,000 years ago. In a cave shelf known as the ''Babisuri Shelter'', [[radiocarbon dating]] indicated the area may have been occupied 40,000 years ago.

==Early life==
Harumi Fujita was born in [[Otaru]], [[Hokkaido]], Japan and was raised in [[Sapporo]] until her fifth birthday. Because her father was a student at the [[University of Michigan]], the family, which included a brother and her parents, moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] for two years, where Fujita began her primary schooling. Returning to Japan, she completed her secondary studies and attended [[Hokkaido University]]. After her graduation, Fujita moved to [[Israel]] to study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and met several Mexican students in her classes. Living on a [[kibbutz]], she became interested in archaeology, visiting various sites during her two years in the country. In 1978, she moved to [[Mexico City]] and enrolled in archaeology classes at the [[Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia]] (ENAH). Completing her course work in 1982, she accompanied Jesus Mora and Baudelina Garcia Uranga to the [[Baja California Peninsula]] in northern Mexico to complete her field projects. Writing her thesis on the shellfish gathered by the prehistoric indigenous people on the peninsula, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in archaeology in 1985.{{sfn|Inner Explorations|n.d.}}

==Career==
Working on a waste pile in Baja California Sur, Fujita postulated in 1988, that the settlements along the coast from the remains of sea animals appeared to be transitory.{{sfn|Bendímez Patterson|Agustín Téllez|Serrano|1993|p=186}}
In 1991, Fujita was designated as a researcher with the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (INAH) (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and assigned to Baja California Sur{{sfn|INAH|1991}} working the cape region. Her initial task was to coordinate a survey of the area and document sites.{{sfn|Inner Explorations|n.d.}} Between 1994 and 1996, Fujita's survey of the Island as well as nearby [[Isla Partida]] were compiled as ''El poblamiento de América visto desde la isla Espíritu Santo'' (The settlement of America seen from the island Espiritu Santo) and documented 127 coastal sites, which included caves, open-air campsites, shelters, and waste piles, containing artifacts, burials and cave paintings.{{sfn|Ravelo|2002}}{{sfn|Ibarra|2014}} Dated to indicate habitation between 10,000 and 21,000 years ago, the findings confirmed occupation of the island long before the arrival of Europeans.{{sfn|Ibarra|2014}}

In 1996, Fujita identified the Babisuri Shelter site on the [[Isla Espíritu Santo|Island of Espíritu Santo]]. In stratum III of the shelter, she discovered artifacts made from shell that were radiocarbon dated to yield dates indicating occupation of the site at 40,000 years ago.{{sfn|Sánchez|2016|p=16}} The findings were significant, as they indicated that habitation of the Americas may have occurred thousands of years before previously estimated.{{sfn|Ravelo|2002}} Eighty-eight different dating tests were performed on the site, confirming five layers of soils and three different occupations by inhabitants for the [[Archaic Period (Americas)|Archaic period]].{{sfn|Sánchez|2016|p=17}} In 2000, Fujita and [[Judith F. Porcasi]] evaluated methods in which early hunters might have exploited dolphins. Lack of remains, has caused many theorists to reject that such hunting occurred in northern Mexico, but Fujita and Porcasi postulated that clacking stones together underwater from the side of a boat, could disrupt the sonar of dolphins. In areas where deep water is found near the shoreline, the technique could be used to beach the animals and allow them to be clubbed or speared, as it was in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Islands.{{sfn|Snow|2015|p=694}}

Fujita discovered artifacts in 2011, which were c-shaped hooks, similar to those found in Ecuador, Australia and along the coast of the Arabian Sea, indicating that as early as 8,000 to 11,000 years ago, indigenous peoples living in Baja California Sur were engaged in fishing. Fourteen of the hooks were definitively dated to the [[Pleistocene|Terminal Pleistocene]] era, making the among the oldest fishing hooks known to exist and confirming that fishing cultures had emerged in [[North America]] before the Early Holocene period.{{sfn|''El Informador''|2011}} In 2013, Aníbal Lopez Espinoza published an analysis of the cave paintings documented by Fujita, Dave Huddart and Silva.{{sfn|Lopez Espinoza|2013}} Expanding her research area along the coast covering the area between [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] and the [[Sierra de las Cacachilas]] (west to east) and between El Novillo and [[Tecolote Beach]] (south to north), Fujita identified 172 sites with significant archaeological remains. In all, her work in Baja California Sur has identified over 500 places with traces of historical value. In 2014, she located two caves near Tecolote Beach which confirm ancient settlement of the area to around 10,000 years ago in the [[Holocene|Early Holocene]] period. Similarly to earlier sites found on Espíritu Santo, marine resources and shells were frequently used by the inhabitants.{{sfn|''BCS Noticias''|2014}} Continuing her work on the site, she discovered 61 burial sites, which show funerary characteristics of dual burials for the ancient inhabitants.{{sfn|''Uno TV''|2017}}

This article outlines the '''history of [[media studies]]'''.

==Chicago School==
Though not yet named as such, media studies' roots are in the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] and thinkers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Charles Cooley]] and [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]]. These authors saw American society on the cusp of positive social change toward pure democracy. Mead argued that for an ideal society to exist, a form of communication must be developed to allow the unique individual to appreciate the attitudes, viewpoints and positions of others unlike himself, and allow him to be understood by others as well. Mead believed that this "new media" would allow humans to empathize with others, and therefore moves toward an "ideal of human society."&lt;ref&gt;Mead, George Herbert. "Obstacles and Promises in the Development of an Ideal Society." ''Mind, Self &amp; Society'', pp. 317–28. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Mead sees an ideal society, Dewey names it the "Great Community," and further asserts the assumption that humans are intelligent enough for self-government, and that that knowledge is "a function of association and communication."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. "Search for the Great Community." The Public and Its Problems, pp. 143–84. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1927. "Nature, Communication, and Meaning." Experience and Nature, pp. 138–70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Cooley asserts that political communication makes public opinion possible, which in turn promotes democracy. Each of these authors represent the Chicago School’s attention to [[electronic communication]] as a facilitator of democracy, its faith in the informed electorate, and its focus on the individual as opposed to the mass.

==First M.A. Media Studies program in the U.S.==
The social impact of mass communication has been studied at The New School University in New York since its founding in 1919. The first college course to investigate the motion picture was offered here in 1926. [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s colleague, John Culkin, brought his Center for Understanding Media to The New School in 1975 and The New School began offering the Master of Arts degree in Media Studies, one of the first graduate programs of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies-about/&lt;/ref&gt; Today, among other programs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies-degrees-and-programs/&lt;/ref&gt; MA in Media Studies is still being offered by [http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies/ School of Media Studies, The New School], which will celebrate 40th anniversary of Media Studies at The New School during the academic year 2015-2016&lt;ref&gt;http://smscommons.newschool.edu/news/2015/09/14/media-studies-40th-anniversary-celebration-fall-2015-spring-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda studies==
Between the First and Second World Wars, the [[Institute for Propaganda Analysis]] briefly rose to importance. Their definition of propaganda was &lt;blockquote&gt;"expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence opinion or actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Alfred M. (With Elizabeth Briant Lee)|year= 1937|title=The Fine Art of Propaganda: A Study of Father Coughlin’s Speeches}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Harold Lasswell]], who worked in the paradigm of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] of sociology wrote [[Propaganda Technique in the World War]], which included this definition of propaganda:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Propaganda in the broadest sense is the technique of influencing human action by the manipulation of representations. These representations may take spoken, written, pictorial or musical form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lasswell|first=Harold.|year= 1937|title= Propaganda Technique in the World War|pages= 214–22.|isbn=0-8240-0458-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These definitions of [[propaganda]] clearly show that this was a school of thought that focused on [[media influence|media effects]], as it highlighted the influence that media could have over its audiences attitudes and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= [[Harold Lasswell|Lasswell]]|first= Harold|year= 1937|title= [[Propaganda]]|encyclopedia =  Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|pages= 521–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epitomizing this early school of media effects studies are experiments done by The Experimental Section of the Research Branch of the U.S. War Department's Information and Education Division. In the experiments, the effects of various U.S. wartime [[propaganda]] films on soldiers were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= [[Carl Hovland|Hovland]]|first= Carl I.|author2=Arthur A. Lumsdaine |author3=Fred D. Shefield  |year= 1949|title= Experiments in Mass Communication|journal=  Studies in the Social Psychology in World War II, American Soldier Series|volume= 3|pages=3–16, 247–79.|publisher= Macmillan|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Propaganda studies are applied into many fields besides politics. Herman described a propaganda model as "a model of media behavior and performance, not of media effects." (Herman, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;63)  He argued: "They are profit-seeking business, owned by very wealthy people (or other companies); and they are funded largely by advertisers who are also profit-seeking entities, and who want their advertisements to appear in a [[supportive selling environment]]."&lt;ref name="herman62"&gt;(Herman, 2000, p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt; He also presented "five factors: owner ship, advertising, sourcing, flak and anti-communist ideology-work as filters through which information must pass, and that individually and often in cumulative fashion they greatly influence media choices."&lt;ref name="herman62"/&gt; Until now, there is no conclusion of propaganda, debate still continues.

==Frankfurt School Critical Theory==
Typified by the philosophical and theoretical orientations of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, and Herbert Marcuse, the Frankfurt school contributed greatly to the development and application of critical theory in media studies.  Their Marxist critique of market-driven media was critical of its atomizing and leveling effects.

The Frankfurt school also lamented the effects of the "culture industry" on the production and appreciation of art.  For example, in ''A Social Critique of Radio Music'', Adorno asserts: &lt;blockquote&gt;"…music has ceased to be a human force and is consumed like other consumers’ goods.  This produces ‘commodity listening’…The listener suspends all intellectual activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adorno |first=Theodor W. |year= 1945|title= A Social Critique of Radio Music|journal= Kenyon Review |volume= 7|pages=208–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Frankfurt school lamented on the effects of the "culture industry" they also began to identify [[mass culture]] and [[high culture]] as two distinct entities.  Scholars like Benjamin (1936) and Adorno (1945) can be credited with what would eventually become known as popular culture and high culture.  Their finite distinction of equating original production with ritualistic behavior as compared with mass culture that finds its identifying symbols in reproductions.  These reproductions are souless and lacking in definition and originality.

==Media effects==
{{main|Media effects}}
The less paradigm in media studies since the Second World War has been associated with the ideas, methods and findings of [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Paul F. Lazarsfeld]] and his school: media effect studies. Their studies focused on measurable, short-term behavioral ‘effects’ of media and concluded that the media played a limited role in influencing public opinion. The "Limited-Effects" Model developed by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues from Columbia was highly influential in the development of media studies. The model claims the mass media has "limited-effects" on voting patterns. Voters are influenced, rather, through the ‘two-step flow’ model, the idea that media messages are disseminated through personal interaction with ‘opinion leaders’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gitlinn |first=Todd |year=1974 |title=Media Sociology: the Dominant Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of limited- effects was so influential that the question of media "effects" on politics was left largely unaddressed until the late 1960s. Eventually Mass Communication scholars began to study political behavior again and the limited-effects model was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffee, Steven H., &amp; Hockheimer, J.. "The Beginnings of Political Communication Research in the United States: Origins of the ‘Limited Effects’ Model." The Media Revolution in America &amp; Western Europe, pp. 267–96. Ed. Ev Rogers &amp; F. Balle. Norwood, N.J.: Ablex, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and gratification model==

As a response to the previous emphasis upon media effects, from the 1970s researchers became interested in how audiences make sense of media texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchby|first=Ian |year= 2006|title=Media Talk: Conversation Analysis and the Study of Broadcasting |location=Berkshire |publisher=Open University Press|isbn= 0-335-20995-5|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[uses and gratifications]]" model, associated with [[Jay Blumler]] and [[Elihu Katz]], reflected this growing interest in the 'active audience'. One such example of this type of  research was conducted by Hodge and Tripp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodge, R.|author2=Tripp, D.|year=1986|title=Children and Television|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press |isbn=0-8047-1352-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and separately Palmer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=P |year=1986 |title=The Lively Audience: A Study of Children around the TV set|location=Sydney|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=0-86861-970-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; about how school-children make sense of the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]''. They found that pupils could identify with the prisoners: they were "shut in", separated from their friends and wouldn't be there had they not been made to be, etc. Also, the children could compare the wardens to their teachers: "the hard-bitten old [one], the soft new one, the one you could take advantage of..."&lt;ref name="fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=John |year= 1987 |title=Television Culture|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 0-415-03934-7|pages=68–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] summarises:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The children inserted meanings of the program into their social experience of school in a way that informed both -- the meanings of school and the meanings of ''Prisoner'' were each influenced by the other, and the fit between them validated the other.&lt;ref name="fiske"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Luther Carrington Goodrich''' (September 21, 1894 &amp;ndash; August 10, 1986) was an American [[sinology|sinologist]] and historian of China. A prolific author, he is perhaps best remembered for his work on the ''Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368–1644''.

==Life==
Luther Carrington Goodrich was born on September 21, 1894, in [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tongzhou]], a southeastern suburb of [[Beijing]], where his parents were serving as [[Protestant]] missionaries.  His father, Chauncey Goodrich (b.1836), had published ''A Pocket Dictionary (Chinese-English) and Pekingese Syllabary'' in 1891 and among the nephews of Chauncey's great-grandfather Josiah (b.1731) were a [[Chauncey Goodrich|US Senator]] and [[Elizur Goodrich|US Representative]].

As a young child, he lived through the [[Siege of the International Legations]] in Beijing; he was able to remember some of these events even in his old age, when he must have been one of the last survivors.&lt;ref name=beal&gt;Edwin G. Beal, Jr., [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/jeal/vol1987/iss82/12/ L. Carrington Goodrich]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Chefoo School]] in [[Yantai]] ([[Shandong]]), the  Oberlin Academy in [[Ohio]], and  [[Williams College]], from which he graduated in 1917. In 1918, soon after the United States entered [[World War I]], Goodrich joined the [[US Army]] and was sent to France, where he worked with the [[Chinese Labour Corps|Chinese Labour Corps in France]], workers who were brought to France during the war, and were now participating in the post-war rebuilding of the country.&lt;ref name=beal/&gt;

In 1920, Goodrich started graduate work at [[Columbia University]], but soon left for China, where he worked for the China Medical Board of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Back at Columbia in 1925, he received his master's degree in 1927 and Ph.D. in 1934. Continued at Columbia as a faculty member, attaining the rank of full Professor in 1945.&lt;ref name=beal/&gt; Excluding a few short breaks spent as a visiting professor in institutions abroad (as far as India, Japan, and Australia), he spent the rest of his career at Columbia University; even after his retirement from teaching, he still remained associated with Columbia as Dean Lung Professor Emeritus of Chinese.&lt;ref name=beal/&gt;

During his academic career, Goodrich published a number of works on Chinese history. In 1956-57, he was President, [[Association for Asian Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D. Goodrich, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/605789?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103244942307 "Luther Carrington Goodrich (1894-1986) : a bibliography"] ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 113.4 (1993): 585-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manda''' is a village and an archaeological site in [[Jammu (city)|Jammu]] in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. It was excavated by [[Archaeological Survey of India]] during 1976-77 by J. P. Joshi. The site contains ruins of an ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;Indian Archaeology 1976-77, A Review. Archeologival Survey of India, New Delhi.1980.

==Excavation==
Excavation at Manda revealed a 9.20&amp;nbsp;m deposit with threefold sequence with two sub periods in Period I. Period II has early historical pottery of types comparable with those of same period from Northern part of India and period III is represented by Kushan antiquities and house walls with 3&amp;nbsp;m wide street.&lt;ref name=archaeology1&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_exca_imp_jammukashmir.asp Archaeological Survey of India]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Kushan period, the site seems to have been deserted.&lt;ref name=archaeology/&gt;

==Historical significance==

The '''Maritime Archaeology Trust''' (formerly the '''Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology''') is a [[charitable trust]] that researches and excavates maritime archaeology and heritage in [[Great Britain]]. Historically, their core activities were focused around [[Hampshire]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Solent]], but now they work in other parts of the country and on international projects.

==History==
The discovery of the wreck of [[HMS Pomone (1805)|HMS ''Pomone'']] at [[The Needles]] in 1969 led the [[Isle of Wight Council]] to fund and organise a team to research and excavate the site.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Medland, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; As more wrecks were discovered in the following decades, the '''Isle of Wight Maritime Heritage Project''' was formed. The project originally focused on the [[Yarmouth Roads Wreck|Yarmouth Roads Protected Wreck Site]] but also began to identify [[Mesolithic]] sites on the seabed of the [[Solent]].&lt;ref name=Sparks3&gt;Sparks, Momber &amp; Satchell, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BA32&gt;British Archaeology, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  When central government funds were withdrawn, the project was re-organised as the '''Isle of Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology''' in 1990. The Trust managed the excavation of several sites and became the [[licensee]] for many of them.&lt;ref name=M52/&gt;  In 1991, with support from [[Hampshire County Council]], the Trust's scope expanded and it became the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology.&lt;ref name=Sparks3/&gt;&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt; In 2013, it became the Maritime Archaeology Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/mat|title=HWTMA is MAT|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The charity has since investigated a great deal of maritime archaeology around the Solent, including shipwrecks, submerged landscapes and inter-tidal foreshore sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/research|title=Archaeological Research|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also conducted projects as far away as [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Farasan Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/sublocation|title=Submerged prehistory|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bouldnor Cliff===
In 1999 divers from the Trust discovered the Mesolithic settlement site of [[Bouldnor Cliff]]. The site is offshore of [[Bouldnor]] on the Isle of Wight and about 11 metres below the surface of the Solent.&lt;ref&gt;British Archaeology, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Attention was first drawn to the site when divers observed a lobster discarding worked flint tools from its burrow.&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6928293.stm|title=Fight on to save Stone Age Atlantis|publisher=BBC|date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, regular fieldwork has revealed that Bouldnor was almost certainly a settlement site approximately 8,000 years ago (6,000 BC), at a time when lower sea levels meant that the Solent was an extensive river valley. Work done so far has revealed that the technology of Mesolithic settlers was probably 2,000 years ahead of what had previously been believed.&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Diving into the Past| newspaper =Isle of Wight County Press | pages =14 | date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forton Lake===
Between 2006 and 2009, the Trust ran a joint community archaeology project at [[Forton Lake]], with the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]], cataloguing the wide range of [[hulk (medieval ship type)|hulk]]s there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/forton.php|title=Forton Lake|publisher=Nautical Archaeology Society|date=|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425123831/http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/forton.php|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was designed to raise local awareness and foster a sense of local pride and ownership amongst nearby residents in [[Gosport]].&lt;ref&gt;Forton Lake, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centaur Tanks===
In a joint project with [[Southsea Sub Aqua Club]], the Trust has investigated two [[Centaur tank]]s from a capsized [[Landing Craft Tank]] in the Solent, as part of a case study to see if land based legislation can be used to protect maritime archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isle of Wight's sunken World War II tanks studied |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-14322864 |publisher=BBC |date= 28 July 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mystery Wreck===
The Trust investigated a 'mystery wreck' on [[Horse Tail Sands]] in the Solent between 2003 and 2011. It was not until 2011 that the Trust was able to confirm the vessel's identity as the ''Flower of Ugie'', a 19th-century [[barque]]. As well as fully recording the vessel's remains, the Trust replicated the process of wreck research and identification in a teaching pack for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.solentforum.org/resources/pdf/solnews/S%20News%20issue%2030%20web.pdf|title=Mystery Shipwreck Solved|publisher=Solent Forum|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissemination and education==
The Trust runs an active outreach and schools programme and operates a "Maritime Bus" to make maritime archaeology more accessible to the general public. The bus attends regular events in the south coast, including school, community and other public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schools.hwtma.org.uk/maritimebus|title= The Maritime Bus|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamblevalley.com/home/great-outdoors/heritage.php|title=Hamble Valley; History and Heritage|publisher=The Marketing Collective|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218165816/http://www.hamblevalley.com/home/great-outdoors/heritage.php|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust also runs the [[Sunken Secrets]] exhibition at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref&gt;Burdett &amp; Insole, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Trust was awarded a [[Europa Nostra]] award for [[Europa Nostra#Categories|Category 4: Education, Training and Awareness Raising]], for "raising the profile of maritime heritage and archaeology", recognising the numerous ways in which the Trust teaches audiences of all types about maritime heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.europanostra.org/projects/64/|title=Raising Awareness of Maritime Cultural Heritage - Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology|publisher=Europa Nostra|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime Archaeology Limited==
In 2004, the Trust formed '''Maritime Archaeology Ltd''' as a commercial trading arm in order to provide archaeological contractual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeology.co.uk/about-maritime-archaeology/|title=About Maritime Archaeology Ltd.|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Limited|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Human history}}
'''Modern history''', the '''modern period''' or the '''modern era''', is the linear, global, [[historiography|historiographical]] approach to the time frame after [[post-classical history]].&lt;ref&gt;Intrinsic to the [[English language]], "modern" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval; modern history is the history of the world since the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaNDmZBcNGQC&amp;pg=PA3814|title=The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia|publisher=|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history can be further broken down into periods:
* The [[early modern period]] began approximately in the early [[16th century]]; notable historical milestones included the European [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Discovery]], and the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunan, Marcel. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Modern History, From 1500 to the Present Day''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bartlebyModern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/28/M0362800.html |title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online – Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622132303/http://www.bartleby.com/61/28/M0362800.html |archivedate=2008-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Modern history#Late modern period|late modern period]] began approximately in the mid-[[18th century]]; notable historical milestones included the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[Great Divergence]], and the [[Russian Revolution]]. It took all of human history up to 1804 for the world's population to reach 1 billion; the next billion came just over a century later, in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world-july-dec11-population1_10-27/|title=World Population to Hit Milestone With Birth of 7 Billionth Person|author=|date=2011-10-27|website=PBS.org|access-date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Contemporary history]] is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present time.

This article primarily covers the 1800–1950 time period with a brief summary of 1500–1800. For a more in depth article on modern times before 1800, see [[Early modern period|Early Modern period]].

===Modern===

The term ''modern'' was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times (ultimately derived from the Latin adverb ''modo'', meaning "just now").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/modern|website=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European [[Renaissance]] (c. 1420–1630), which marked the transition between the [[Late Middle Ages]] and Early Modern times, started in Italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity|classical]] art and literature, as well as the new perspectives gained from the [[Age of Discovery]] and the invention of the [[telescope]] and [[microscope]], expanding the borders of thought and knowledge.

In contrast to the pre-modern era, [[Western world|Western civilization]] made a gradual transition from pre-modernity to modernity when [[scientific method]]s were developed which led many to believe that the use of science would lead to all knowledge, thus throwing back the shroud of [[mythology|myth]] under which pre-modern peoples lived. New information about the world was discovered via [[empirical observation]],&lt;ref&gt;Baird, F.E., &amp; Kaufmann, W.A. (2008). ''Philosophic classics: From Plato to Derrida''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; versus the historic use of [[reason]] and [[innate knowledge]].

The term ''Early Modern'' was introduced in the English language in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;''New Dictionary of the History of ideas'', Volume 5, Detroit 2005. Modernism and Modern&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the time between what has been called the [[Middle Ages]] and time of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (1800) (when the meaning of the term ''Modern Ages'' was developing its contemporary form). It is important to note that these terms stem from European history. In usage in other parts of the world, such as in Asia, and in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], the terms are applied in a very different way, but often in the context with their contact with European culture in the Age of Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_14.html|title=Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Late Medieval and Early Modern Medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary ===

{{Main|Contemporary history}}
In the Contemporary era, there were various socio-technological trends. Regarding the 21st century and the late modern world, the [[Information Age]] and computers were forefront in use, not completely ubiquitous but often present in everyday life. The development of Eastern powers was of note, with China and India becoming more powerful. In the Eurasian theater, the [[European Union]] and [[Russia|Russian Federation]] were two forces recently developed. A concern for Western world, if not the whole world, was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts.

== Modern era ==
=== Significant developments ===

The modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of [[science]], [[politics]], [[warfare]], and [[technology]]. It has also been an [[age of discovery]] and [[globalization]]. During this time, the [[power (international)|European powers]] and later their colonies, began a political, economic, and cultural [[colonization]] of the rest of the world.

By the late 19th and 20th centuries, [[modernist]] art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]], but almost every civilized area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the west and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of [[individualism]],&lt;ref name="NCEref"&gt;''National, cultural, and ethnic identities: harmony beyond conflict'' by Jaroslav Hroch, David Hollan&lt;/ref&gt; [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''Capitalism and modernity: the great debate'' by Jack Goody&lt;/ref&gt; [[urbanization]]&lt;ref name="NCEref" /&gt; and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m9Ha1fmAXk4C ''Progress and its discontents''] American Academy of Arts and Sciences. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ov86j30F96EC&amp;pg=PA297 Technology and politics]." Western Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A companion to the philosophy of technology'' by Jan-Kyrre Berg Olsen, Stig Andur Pedersen, Vincent F. Hendricks&lt;/ref&gt;

Wars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx, Durkheim, Weber: formations of modern social thought'' by Kenneth L. Morrison. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Schweiker, ''The Blackwell companion to religious ethics''. 2005. p. 454. (cf., "In modernity, however, much of economic activity and theory seemed to be entirely cut off from religious and ethical norms, at least in traditional terms. Many see modern economic developments as entirely secular.")&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by [[postmodernism]] while the dominance of Western Europe and [[Anglo-America]] over other continents has been criticized by [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]].

One common conception of modernity is the condition of Western history since the mid-15th century, or roughly the European development of [[movable type]]&lt;ref&gt;''Early European History'' by [[Henry Kitchell Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;''The European Reformations'' by [[Carter Lindberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the "modern" society is said to develop over many periods, and to be influenced by important events that represent breaks in the continuity.&lt;ref&gt;''The new Cambridge modern history: Companion volume'' by Peter Burke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Plains Indian History and Culture: Essays on Continuity and Change'' by John C. Ewers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Weber, irrationality, and social order'' by Alan Sica&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early ====
{{Main|Early modern period}}
The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:
* The [[Renaissance]]
* The [[Protestant reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter Reformation]].
* The [[Age of Discovery]]
* The Rise of [[capitalism]]
* The [[Golden Age of Piracy]]

Important events in the early modern period include:
* The invention of the [[printing press]]
* The [[English Civil War]]
* The [[Seven Years' War]]

|&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Modern Age characteristics&lt;/div&gt;
The concept of the modern world as distinct from an ancient or medieval world rests on a sense that the modern world is not just another [[era]] in history, but rather the result of a new type of change. This is usually conceived of as progress driven by deliberate human efforts to better their situation.

Advances in all areas of human activity—[[politics]], [[industry]], [[society]], [[economics]], [[commerce]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[mechanization]], [[automation]], [[science]], [[medicine]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]—appear to have transformed an ''Old World'' into the ''Modern'' or ''New World''.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern"&gt;''Contemporary history of the world'' by Edwin Augustus Grosvenor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson"&gt;''A summary of modern history'' by Jules Michelet, Mary Charlotte Mair Simpson&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the identification of the old Revolutionary change can be used to demarcate the old and old-fashioned from the modern.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson" /&gt;

Portions of the Modern world altered its relationship with the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[value system]], revalued the [[monarchy|monarchical]] government system, and abolished the [[feudalism|feudal]] economic system, with new [[democracy|democratic]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas in the areas of [[politics]], [[science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson" /&gt;
|}
This combination of epoch events totally changed thinking and thought in the early modern period, and so their dates serve as well as any to separate the old from the new modes.

As an [[Age of Revolution]]s dawned, beginning with those revolts in [[American Revolution|America]] and [[French Revolution|France]], political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, C.W.

New York: Gotham Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of [[mechanization]] in society, the [[American Revolution]], the first [[French Revolution]]; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the peace established by [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Second Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Charles Downer (1910). ''Europe since 1815''. American historical series, H. Holt and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Late ====
As a result of the Industrial Revolution and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of [[Modernism]] emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:
* Increasing role of [[science]] and [[technology]]
* Mass [[literacy]] and proliferation of [[mass media]]
* Spread of [[social movements]]
* Institution of [[representative democracy]]
* [[Individualism]]
* [[Industrialization]]
* [[Urbanization]]
* [[Total fertility rate]]s and [[ecological collapse]]s occurring at [[exponential growth|geometric rates]];

Other important events in the development of the Late modern period include:
* The [[American Revolution]]
* The [[French Revolution]]
* The [[Colonization of Australia]]
* The [[Revolutions of 1848]]
* The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]
* The [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]

Our most recent era{{mdash}}Modern Times{{mdash}}begins with the end of these revolutions in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Duruy, V., &amp; Grosvenor, E.A. (1894).

''Modern times: The world from the twenties to the nineties''. New York: HarperPerennial.&lt;/ref&gt; (encompassing [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]) and the emergence of [[socialism|socialist countries]] that led to the [[Cold War]]. The ''contemporary era'' follows shortly afterward with the explosion of research and increase of knowledge known as the [[Information Age]] in the latter 20th and the early 21st century.

== Early modern period ==
{{Main|Early modern period}}
Historians consider the early modern period to be approximately between 1500 and 1800. It follows the Late Middle Ages and is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable nation-states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.

The expansion of Islam took place in North and East Africa. In West Africa, various native nations existed. The Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia were a vital link in the spice trade. On the Indian subcontinent, the [[Mughal Empire]] existed. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas.

Various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere. In Japan, the [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to the enthronement of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. In the Americas, Pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Empire]] and cities, and the [[Muisca Confederation|Chibcha]]. In the west, kingdoms of Europe moved in the direction of reformation and expansion. Russia [[Russian conquest of Siberia|reached the Pacific coast]] in 1647 and consolidated its control over the [[Russian Far East]] in the 19th century.

Later religious trends of the period saw the end of the aforementioned Muslim expansion. Christians and Christendom saw the end of the Crusades and of religious unity under the Roman Catholic Church. It was during this time that the Inquisitions and the [[Protestant Reformation]] took place.
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|centre|thumb|upright=3.4|{{center|Colonial empires in 1800}}]]
During the early modern period, an [[age of discovery]] and trade was undertaken by the Western European nations. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in Africa, southern Asia, and North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0142002100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434996/Ottoman-Empire |title=Ottoman Empire |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia took possession in Eastern Europe, Asia, and North America.

In China, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however,  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the later Ming Dynasty became isolated, prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1000ce_mingvoyages.htm#decision|title=The Ming Voyages {{!}} Asia for Educators {{!}} Columbia University|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite isolationist policies the Ming Economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish New World]] silver entering its economy through new European colonies such as [[Portuguese Macau|Macao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115ch8.html|title=Chapter 8 The New World|website=mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ming China was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect [[Joseon|Korea]] from [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=168–169|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) was founded after the fall of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], the last [[Han Chinese]] dynasty, by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]. The Manchus were formerly known as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]]. When Beijing was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels in 1644, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of [[Beijing]], which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]]. Schoppa, the editor of ''The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History'' argues, "A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'. It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

{{Main|Edo period}}
[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], art flourished in the Edo Period]]
In pre-modern&lt;ref&gt;or early-modern&lt;/ref&gt; Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of "warring states", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[shōgun]]'' in 1603.
Society in the Japanese "[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]" ([[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the [[warrior]]-caste of [[samurai]], with the [[farmer]]s, [[artisans]], and [[merchant|traders]] ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=175|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimyōs'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimyōs'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. [[Taxes]] on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for [[inflation]] or other changes in [[monetary]] value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.

===== British and Dutch colonization =====

The development of [[New Imperialism]] saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers. The [[Company rule in India|commercial colonization of India]] commenced in 1757, after the [[Battle of Plassey]], when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1765, when the Company was granted the ''diwani'', or the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in [[Calcutta]], appointed its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Warren Hastings]], and became directly involved in governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Clive and Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, 1757 by Francis Hayman.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] and [[Mir Jafar]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]], 1757 by Francis Hayman]]

The [[Maratha Empire|Maratha states]], following the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], eventually lost to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818 with the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] and consequent of the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the [[India Office|British government]] assumed the task of directly administering India in the new [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 [[Stamford Raffles]] established [[Singapore]] as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.&lt;ref&gt;Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

Russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.
[[File:Repin Cossacks.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cossacks]] became the backbone of the early Russian Army.]]
In 1648, the peasants of [[Ukraine]] joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the river [[Dnieper]], leaving the western part (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian river routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

==== Reason and Enlightenment ====
{{Further|Great Divergence}}
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach - Mass in B minor - Agnus Dei.ogg|left|thumb|Johann Sebastian Bach – Mass in B minor – Agnus Dei, From 1724]]
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice full.jpg|thumb|upright=1|"If there is something you know, communicate it. If there is something you don't know, search for it." An engraving from the 1772 edition of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; [[Truth]] (center) is surrounded by light and unveiled by the figures to the right, [[Philosophy]] and [[Reason]]|alt=]]

Traditionally, the European intellectual transformation of and after the Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era. The [[Age of Reason]] in the Western world is generally regarded as being the start of [[modern philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' offered an explanation of the heliocentric model of the Universe.&lt;/ref&gt; and a departure from the medieval approach, especially [[Scholasticism]]. Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularization]] in Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] is a time in [[Western philosophy]] and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority. Enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously in many parts of Europe and America. Developing during the Enlightenment era, [[Renaissance humanism]] as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term ''umanista'' comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'', a novel curriculum that was competing with the ''[[quadrivium]]'' and [[scholastic logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–114, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance humanism took a close study of the Latin and Greek classical texts, and was antagonistic to the values of [[scholasticism]] with its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries; and humanists were involved in the sciences, philosophies, arts and poetry of classical antiquity. They self-consciously imitated [[classical Latin]] and deprecated the use of [[medieval Latin]]. By analogy with the perceived decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning.[[File:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|thumb|Model for the Three Superior Planets and Venus from [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum''.|alt=|147x147px|left]]The [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] was a [[literature|literary]] and artistic quarrel that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the [[Académie française]]. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (''Anciens'') who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] and the Moderns (''Modernes''), who supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

==== Scientific Revolution ====
{{Main|Scientific Revolution}}
The Scientific Revolution was a period when European ideas in [[classical physics]], [[classical astronomy|astronomy]], [[classical biology|biology]], [[History of anatomy#Early modern anatomy|human anatomy]], [[classical chemistry|chemistry]], and other [[classical science]]s were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from [[Ancient Greece]] to the Middle Ages which would lead to a transition to [[modern science]]. This period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[biology]], in institutions supporting [[scientific investigation]], and in the more [[worldview|widely held picture of the universe]]. Individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this questioning that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields.

==== The French Revolutions ====
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''La liberté guidant le peuple''. The [[French Revolution]] inspired a wave of revolutions across Europe. [[Liberalism]] and [[Nationalism]] were popular ideas that challenged [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchies]] in the 19th century. |alt=]]
{{Main|French Revolution}}
Toward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French governmental structure, previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy transform, changing to forms based on Enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first revolution led to government by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third by the [[French Directory|Directory]].

The changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.

===== National and Legislative Assembly =====
{{Main|National Assembly (French Revolution)|Legislative Assembly (France)}}
During the French Revolution, the National Assembly, which existed from June 17 to July 9 of 1789, was a transitional body between the Estates-General and the National Constituent Assembly.

The Legislative Assembly was the legislature of France from October 1, 1791 to September 1792. It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention.

===== The Directory and Napoleonic Era =====
[[File:Baron Antoine-Jean Gros-Battle Pyramids 1810.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon III|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] 1810 by Baron Antoine-Jean Gros]]
{{Main|French Directory|Napoleonic Era}}
The Executive Directory was a body of five Directors that held executive power in France following the Convention and preceding the Consulate. The period of this regime (2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly known as the Directory (or Directoire) era, constitutes the second to last stage of the French Revolution. Napoleon, before seizing the title of Emperor, was elected as First Consul of the Consulate of France.

The campaigns of French Emperor and General Napoleon Bonaparte characterized the Napoleonic Era. Born on Corsica as the French invaded, and dying suspiciously on the tiny British Island of St. Helena, this brilliant commander, controlled a French Empire that, at its height, ruled a large portion of Europe directly from Paris, while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as Spain, Poland, several parts of Italy and many other Kingdoms Republics and dependencies. The Napoleonic Era changed the face of Europe forever, and old Empires and Kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and "Glorious" surge of [[Republicanism]].

==== Italian unification ====
[[File:Gioacchino toma roma o morte 1863.jpg|left|thumb|''Rome or Death,'' Italian Patriotic Painting, 1863]]

[[Italian unification]] was the political and social movement that annexed different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of Italy in the 19th century. There is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning and the end of this period, but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, and approximately ended with the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871, though the last ''[[Italia irredenta|città irredente]]'' did not join the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] until after World War I.

==== End of the early modern period ====
Toward the end of the early modern period, Europe was dominated by the evolving system of mercantile capitalism in its trade and the New Economy. European states and politics had the characteristic of Absolutism. The French power and English revolutions dominated the political scene. There eventually evolved an international balance of power that held at bay a great conflagration until years later.

The end date of the early modern period is usually associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750. Another significant date is 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution, which drastically transformed the state of European politics and ushered in the Prince Edward Era and modern Europe.

=== North America ===
{{Main|European colonization of the Americas}}[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the five-man committee in charge of drafting the Declaration in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]

The [[French and Indian Wars]] were a series of conflicts in North America that represented the actions there that accompanied the European dynastic wars. In Quebec, the wars are generally referred to as the Intercolonial Wars. While some conflicts involved Spanish and Dutch forces, all pitted Great Britain, its colonies and American Indian allies on one side and France, its colonies and Indian allies on the other.

The expanding French and British colonies were contending for control of the western, or interior, territories. Whenever the European countries went to war, there were actions within and by these colonies although the dates of the conflict did not necessarily exactly coincide with those of the larger conflicts.

Beginning the Age of Revolution, the [[American Revolution]] and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (also called American War of Independence).

[[File:North America 1797 - U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1909.jpg|left|thumb|right|North America 1797]]

The American Revolution began with fighting at Lexington and Concord. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. In June 1776, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. While the states had already rejected the governance of Parliament, through the Declaration the new United States now rejected the legitimacy of the monarchy to demand allegiance. The war raged for seven years, with effective American victory, followed by formal British abandonment of any claim to the United States with the Treaty of Paris.

The [[Philadelphia Convention]] set up the current United States; the [[United States Constitution]] ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a limited central government. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791.

==== Decolonization of North and South Americas ====
{{Main|Decolonization of the Americas|Spanish American wars of independence}}The decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|}

When the Central Junta fell to the French, numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas, eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south, to Mexico in the north. After the death of the king Ferdinand VII, in 1833, only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898. Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in America. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador (later relocated to Rio de Janeiro) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822, becoming the [[Empire of Brazil]].

The first Industrial Revolution merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships and railways, and later in the 19th century with the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[electric power]] generation. The Second Industrial Revolution was a phase of the Industrial Revolution; labeled as the separate Technical Revolution. From a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two. Major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel industries. Specific advancements included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships, the development of the airplane, the practical commercialization of the automobile, mass production of consumer goods, the perfection of canning, mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation techniques, and the invention of the telephone.

==== Industrialization ====
[[Industrialization]] is the process of social and economic change whereby a human group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one. It is a subdivision of a more general [[modernization]] process, where [[social change]] and [[economic development]] are closely related with [[innovation|technological innovation]], particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production. It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change, where people obtain a different attitude towards their [[nature|perception of nature]].

==== Revolution in manufacture and power ====
[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|[[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] from 1830, world's first railway.]]
An [[economic system|economy]] based on [[manual labour]] was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It began with the mechanization of the [[textile]] industries and the development of [[iron]]-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads, and then [[rail transport|railways]].

The introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by [[coal]]) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Business and Economics.  [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0195115899&amp;id=CX9kBaVx4JkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;sig=V0eO27c7koD8rrIV2EKv6-guB5s  ''Leading Issues in Economic Development''], Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0195115899}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.

The modern [[petroleum industry]] started in 1846 with the discovery of the process of refining [[kerosene]] from [[coal]] by [[Nova Scotia]]n [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]]. [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available "rock oil" ("petr-oleum") [[seep]]s in 1852 and the first rock oil mine was built in [[Bóbrka, Krosno County|Bóbrka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the following year. In 1854, [[Benjamin Silliman]], a science professor at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], was the first to fractionate petroleum by distillation. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world.

==== Notable engineers ====
[[File:Teslathinker.jpg|thumb|Nikola Tesla with his high-frequency transformer at East Houston Street, New York|alt=|193x193px]]

Engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science. The advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life. In the first revolution, [[Lewis Paul]] was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill. [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]]'s improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world.

In the latter part of the second revolution, [[Thomas Alva Edison]] developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1882, Edison switched on the world's first large-scale [[electrical supply network]] that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution, [[Nikola Tesla]] made many contributions in the field of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==== Social effects and classes ====
The Industrial Revolutions were major [[technology|technological]], [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], and [[culture|cultural]] changes in late 18th and early 19th centuries that began in Britain and spread throughout the world. The effects spread throughout [[Western Europe]] and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting the majority of the world. The impact of this change on [[society]] was enormous and is often compared to the [[Neolithic revolution]], when mankind developed [[agriculture]] and gave up its [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Brown, Lester. [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN1853839043&amp;id=5aCyfUsHM6kC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;sig=1dsUat9P_-9dWWVRMpPt1udT8DQ ''Eco-Economy''], James &amp; James, Earthscan. {{ISBN|1853839043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis [https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm essay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127032512/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm |date=2007-11-27 }} retrieved March 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mid-19th-century European revolts =====
[[File:Alexanderplatz Berlin 1848.jpg|left|thumb|[[Revolutions of 1848|German Revolution]], Berlin 1848]]
The [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]], known in some countries as the Spring of Nations or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout the European continent. Described as a revolutionary wave, the period of unrest began in France and then, further propelled by the French Revolution of 1848, soon spread to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cayley, E.S. (1856). ''The European revolutions of 1848''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. Vol. I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, S.B., &amp; Hart, A.B. (1918). ''New medieval and modern history''. New York: American book company.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the revolutions were quickly put down, there was a significant amount of violence in many areas, with tens of thousands of people tortured and killed. While the immediate political effects of the revolutions were reversed, the long-term reverberations of the events were far-reaching.

===== Industrial age reformism =====
Industrial age [[reform movement]]s began the gradual change of society rather than with episodes of rapid fundamental changes. The reformists' ideas were often grounded in liberalism, although they also possessed aspects of utopian, socialist or religious concepts. The Radical movement campaigned for electoral reform, a reform of the Poor Laws, free trade, educational reform, postal reform, prison reform, and public sanitation.

Following the Enlightenment's ideas, the reformers looked to the [[Scientific Revolution]] and industrial progress to solve the social problems which arose with the Industrial Revolution. Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy.

==== Imperial Russia ====
{{Main|Russian Empire}}
[[File:Russian Peasant Girls-retouched.jpg|thumb|Russian Peasant Girls, 1900]]
Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=9, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/09_01.html|isbn=978-5170021420|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]] and [[Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=15, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/15_01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Baltic Sea]] Peter founded a new capital called [[Saint Petersburg]], later known as Russia's ''Window to Europe''. [[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (''the Great''), who ruled in 1762–96, extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward and southward.  Russia would [[Russian conquest of Siberia|colonize]] the vast Asian lands of [[Siberia]] expanding by land to the Pacific Coast of Asia, and [[Russian America|North America]].  As the large realm embraced [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchy]] Russia remained more conservative than its western neighbors. In the 19th century, Russia was invaded by France in 1812 but emerged as a more powerful superpower afterwards. Nonetheless industrialization did not come to Russia until the 1870s. The Medieval practice of serfdom was [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolished]] in 1861 freeing over thirty million Russian peasants. A market economy finally emerged in the Russian Empire. However class warfare rose, and the nation was vulnerable due to rivalries with the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].

=== European dominance and the 19th century ===
{{Main|19th century|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
Historians define the 19th century [[List of time periods|historical era]] as stretching from 1815 (the [[Congress of Vienna]]) to 1914 (the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]). Alternatively, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] defined the [[The long 19th century|"Long Nineteenth Century"]] as spanning the years 1789 to 1914.

==== Imperialism and empires ====

[[File:World heads of state in 1889.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|alt=Painting of a group of standing and seated heads of state in a variety of national uniforms and formal dress|"The World's Sovereigns", 1889]]

In the 1800s and early 1900s, once great and powerful Empires such as Spain, Ottoman Turkey, the Mughal Empire, and the Kingdom of Portugal began to break apart. Spain, which was at one time unrivaled in Europe, had been declining for a long time when it was crippled by Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion. Sensing the time was right, Spain's vast colonies in South America began a series of rebellions that ended with almost all of the Spanish territories gaining their independence.

The once mighty Ottoman Empire was wracked with a series of revolutions, resulting with the Ottoman's only holding a small region that surrounded the capital, Istanbul.

[[File:Imperalism.xcf|left|thumb|Montage that depicts European wars of imperialism. By clockwise, wars include [[French conquest of Algeria|French Algerian War]], [[First Opium War|Opium War]], [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|Russian Conquest of Central Asia]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu War]]]]
The Mughal empire, which was descended from the Mongol Khanate, was bested by the upcoming [[Maratha Confederacy]]. All was going well for the [[Maratha]]s until the British took an interest in the riches of India and the British ended up ruling not just the boundaries of Modern India, but also Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Bangladesh and some Southern Regions of Afghanistan.

The King of Portugal's vast territory of Brazil reformed into the independent Empire of Brazil. With the defeat of Napoleonic France, Britain became undoubtedly the most powerful country in the world, and by the end of the First World War controlled a Quarter of the world's population and a third of its surface. However, the power of the British Empire did not end on land, since it had the greatest navy on the planet. Electricity, steel, and petroleum enabled Germany to become a great [[Power (international)|international power]] that raced to create empires of its own.

The [[Meiji Restoration]] was a chain of events that led to enormous changes in Japan's political and social structure that was taking a firm hold at the beginning of the [[Meiji Era]] which coincided the opening of Japan by the arrival of the [[Black Ships]] of [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] and made [[Imperial Japan]] a [[great power]]. [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] China failed to keep pace with the other world powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires. The Qing Dynasty's military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international pressure, massive [[rebellion]]s and defeats in wars, the dynasty declined after the mid-19th century.

European powers controlled parts of Oceania, with French [[New Caledonia]] from 1853 and [[French Polynesia]] from 1889; the Germans established colonies in [[German New Guinea|New Guinea]] in 1884, and [[German Samoa|Samoa]] in 1900. The United States expanded into the Pacific with Hawaii becoming a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. territory]] from 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention of 1899]].

==== British Victorian era ====
{{Main|British Empire|Victorian era}}[[File:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|The British Empire in 1897, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps|alt=|left]]The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was a long period of prosperity for the British people, as profits gained from the overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home, allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]].
[[File:Fleet Street. By James Valentine c.1890..jpg|alt=Fleet Street in London, 1890.|thumb|Fleet Street in London capital of the [[British Empire]], 1890]]
In Britain's "imperial century",&lt;ref&gt;For more, see [[Pax Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt; victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in central Asia. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'', and a foreign policy of "[[splendid isolation]]". Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries, such as China, [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been generally characterized as "[[informal empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. T. (2004). ''Informal empire: Mexico and Central America in Victorian culture''. Minneapolis, Minn: Univ. of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt; Of note during this time was the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], which was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the [[Zulu Empire]].

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]]. Growing until 1922, around {{convert|13000000|sqmi|km2}} of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, Angus (2001).

==== French governments and conflicts ====
The [[Bourbon Restoration]] followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814. The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period is called the Restoration, following French usage, and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics. The [[July Monarchy]] was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution (or Three Glorious Days) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848. The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.

[[File:BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg|left|thumb|[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] after the [[Battle of Sedan]]]]
The [[Franco-Prussian War]] was a conflict between France and Prussia, while Prussia was backed up by the North German Confederation, of which it was a member, and the South German states of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria. The complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. It also marked the downfall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the Third Republic. As part of the settlement, almost all of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it would retain until the end of World War I.

The [[French Third Republic]] was the republican government of France between the end of the Second French Empire following the defeat of Louis-Napoléon in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 and the Vichy Regime after the invasion of France by the German Third Reich in 1940. The Third Republic endured seventy years, making it the most long-lasting regime in France since the collapse of the Ancien Régime in the French Revolution of 1789.

==== Slavery and abolition ====
[[File:Une Dame d´une Fortune Ordinaire dans son Intérieur au Milieu de ses Habitudes Journalières, by Jean-Baptiste Debret 1823.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Slavery]] in [[Brazil]], before 1823]]
{{Main|Abolitionism}}
[[Slavery]] was greatly reduced around the world in the 19th century. Following a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt in Haiti]], Britain forced the [[Barbary pirates]] to halt their practice of kidnapping and enslaving Europeans, [[Slavery Abolition Act|banned slavery throughout its domain]], and charged its navy with ending the global [[slave trade]]. Slavery was then abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]], [[Emancipation Proclamation|America]], and [[Lei Áurea|Brazil]].

==== African colonization ====
{{Main|Colonisation of Africa}}

Following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and propelled by economic exploitation, the [[Scramble for Africa]] was initiated formally at the [[Berlin West Africa Conference]] in 1884–1885. The Berlin Conference attempted to avoid war among the European powers by allowing the European rival countries to carve up the continent of Africa into national colonies. Africans were not consulted.

The major European powers laid claim to the areas of [[Africa]] where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area. These claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate. The European power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national [[colony]]. The European nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony’s commercial interests without having to fear rival European competition. With the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the European power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples, however, this principle remained more theory than practice. There were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native Africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under European colonial rule, to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as "hell on earth."
[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|left|thumb|European officials staking claims to [[Africa]] in the [[Congress of Berlin]] ]]
At the time of the [[Berlin Conference]], Africa contained one-fifth of the world’s population living in one-quarter of the world’s land area. However, from Europe's perspective, they were dividing an unknown continent. European countries established a few coastal colonies in Africa by the mid-nineteenth century, which included [[Cape Colony]] (Great Britain), [[Angola]] (Portugal), and [[Algeria]] (France), but until the late nineteenth century Europe largely traded with free African states without feeling the need for territorial possession. Until the 1880s most of Africa remained uncharted, with western maps from the period generally showing blank spaces for the continent’s interior.

From the 1880s to 1914, the European powers expanded their control across the African continent, competing with each other for Africa’s land and resources. [[Great Britain]] controlled various colonial holdings in East Africa that spanned the length of the African continent from Egypt in the north to South Africa. The [[France|French]] gained major ground in West Africa, and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] held colonies in southern Africa. [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]] established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent, which included German East Africa (Tanganyika) and German Southwest Africa for Germany, Eritrea and Libya for Italy, and the Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in northwestern Africa for Spain. Finally, for [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]] (ruled from 1865 to 1909), there was the large “piece of that great African cake” known as the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]], which became his personal fiefdom. By 1914, almost the entire continent was under European control. [[Liberia]], which was settled by freed American slaves in the 1820s, and Abyssinia ([[Ethiopia]]) in eastern Africa were the last remaining independent African states.&lt;ref&gt;John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe, Volume Two: From the French Revolution to the Present'', Third Edition (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;819–859&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meiji Japan ====
{{Main|Meiji period}}
[[File:View of Kobe LACMA M.91.377.8.jpg|left|thumb|Kobe Japan and its harbor, 1865. Hand colored.]] Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the [[Meiji era]] occurred during the reign of the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]]. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This [[Japanese era name|era name]] means "Enlightened Rule". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Pyle, "Profound Forces in the Making of Modern Japan", ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' (2006) 32#2 pp. 393–418 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jjs/summary/v032/32.2pyle01.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The [[Ministry of War (pre-modern Japan)|hyobusho]] (war office) was replaced with a [[Imperial Japanese Army|War Department]] and a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Naval Department.]] The [[samurai]] class suffered great disappointment the following years.

Laws were instituted that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves. This action, the deathblow for the samurai warriors and their ''daimyōs'', initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki ("blood tax") literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. The Japanese government began modelling their ground forces after the French military. The French government contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks. Japan's modernized military gave Japan the opportunity to engage in Imperialism with its victory against the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] Japan annexed [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and the Chinese province of [[Shandong|Shangdong]].

After the death of the Meiji Emperor, the [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]] took the throne, the[[Taishō period]] was a time of democratic reform granting democratic rights to all Japanese men. Foreigners would instrumental in aiding in Japan's modernization.  A key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] in this period was [[Ernest Mason Satow]].

[[File:Westward the Course of Empire.jpg|thumb|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way'' (1861).]]
The [[Antebellum Age]] was a period of increasing division in the country based on the growth of slavery in the [[Southern United States|American South]] and in the western territories of [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]] that eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861. The Antebellum Period is often considered to have begun with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854,{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} although it may have begun as early as 1812. This period is also significant because it marked the transition of American manufacturing to the industrial revolution.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

"[[Manifest destiny]]" was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—"from sea to shining sea"—largely defining the borders of the contiguous United States as they are today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==== Civil War and Reconstruction ====

{{Main|American Civil War|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
The American Civil War began when seven [[Slave state|Southern slave states]] declared their [[secession]] from the U.S. and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], the Confederacy (four more states joinged the Confederacy later). Led by [[Jefferson Davis]], they fought against the [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S. federal government (the Union)]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]], which was supported by all the free states and the five [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] in the north.

Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. Secession and Confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals, raising large armies and supplying them, avoiding foreign interference, and making the end of slavery a war goal. The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend, and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear as was the case in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vickysburg]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers. Its soldiers, especially those in the East under the command of General [[Robert E. Lee]] proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] in 1864–65. The [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77) began with the [[Emancipation Proclamation|Emancipation proclamation]] in 1863, and included freedom, full citizenship and voting rights for Southern blacks. It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally, politically, socially and economically until the 1960s.

==== The Gilded Age and legacy ====
{{Main|Gilded Age}}

[[File:Flatiron Building and Street Scene October 8th 1902 New York City.ogv|thumb|1902 New York City in early [[skyscraper]]s]]

During the Gilded Age, there was substantial growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th century. The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion. The businessmen of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] created industrial towns and cities in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial [[working class]] which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich [[Robber baron (industrialist)|industrialists and financiers called the "robber barons"]]. An example is the company of [[John D. Rockefeller]], who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry. Using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices, later widely criticized, [[Standard Oil]] absorbed or destroyed most of its competition.

The creation of a modern industrial economy took place. With the creation of a [[Infrastructure|transportation and communication infrastructure]], the [[corporation]] became the dominant form of business organization and a [[Management|managerial revolution]] transformed [[business]] operations. In 1890, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]—the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal, or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase "restraint of trade" remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and [[industrial production]] in the United States exceeded that of any other country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form [[labor union]]s despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace, declaring the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" [[monopoly]] under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] in 1911. It ordered Standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States'', 221 U.S. 1 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, [[Darwinism]] gained acceptance, promoting the concept of [[adaptation]] in the theory of [[natural selection]]. The fields of [[modern geology|geology]], [[modern astronomy|astronomy]] and [[modern psychology|psychology]] also made strides and gained new insights.

These ideas were challenged, for example by the [[young Marx|young Karl Marx]], who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of [[human rights]]), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], humanism was nothing more than a secular version of [[theism]]. In his ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]'', he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires.

==== Notable persons ====
[[File:Albert Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Albert Einstein in 1921|alt=]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] is renowned for his redefinition of [[sexual desire]] as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his therapeutic techniques, including the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]], his [[transference|theory of transference]] in the therapeutic relationship, and the [[Dream interpretation|interpretation of dreams]] as sources of insight into [[unconscious desire]]s.

[[Albert Einstein]] is known for his theories of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. He also made important contributions to [[statistical mechanics]], especially his mathematical treatment of [[Brownian motion]], his resolution of the [[Einstein solid|paradox of specific heats]], and his connection of [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|fluctuations and dissipation]]. Despite his reservations about its interpretation, Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and, indirectly, [[quantum field theory]], primarily through his theoretical studies of the [[photon]].

==== Social Darwinism ====
At the end of the 19th century, [[Social Darwinism]] was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas was a "natural" framework for social evolution in human societies. In this view, society's advancement is dependent on the "[[survival of the fittest]]", the term was in fact coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] and referred to in "[[The Gospel of Wealth]]" written by [[Andrew Carnegie]].

==== Marxist society ====
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]], produced in the United States|alt=|left]]
[[Karl Marx]] summarized his approach to history and politics in the opening line of the first chapter of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848). He wrote:
:''The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of [[class struggle]]s.''&lt;ref&gt;In the 1888 English edition of the ''Communist Manifest'', [[Friedrich Engels]] added a footnote with the commentary: "That is, all written history. In 1847, the prehistory of society, the social organization existing previous to recorded history, was all but unknown. Since then Haxthausen discovered common ownership of land In Russia, Maurer concluded it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and by and by village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The Inner organization of this primitive Communistic society was laid bare, In its typical form, by Morgan's work on the true nature of the gens and Its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of these primaeval communities society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempte to retrace this process of dissolution in "''[[Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigenthums und des Staats]]''"", from Marx, Karl, Friedrich Engels, Leon Trotsky, and Karl Marx. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEyEzazZKwIC&amp;pg=PA46 The Communist Manifesto and Its Relevance for Today]''. Chippendale, N.S.W.: Resistance Books, 1998. p. 46, see also ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p7s0oTEWB_MC&amp;pg=PA204 Cornelius Castoriadis, Political and Social Writings]''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Manifesto'' went through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890; notable new prefaces were written by Marx and Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian edition, the 1883 German edition, and the 1888 English edition. In general, [[Marxism]] identified five (and one transitional) successive stages of development in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive Communism]]: as seen in cooperative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] Society: which develops when the tribe becomes a city-state. Aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocracy is the ruling class. Merchants develop into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the true working class.
# [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]: workers gain class consciousness, [[Proletarian revolution|overthrow]] the capitalists and take control over the [[Socialist state|state]].
# [[Communism]]: a [[classless society|classless]] and [[stateless society]].

[[File:Australia 1900.jpg|thumb|Though still tied to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth]] [[Australia]] achieved peaceful independence in 1901.|alt=]]
Major political developments saw the former [[British Empire]] lose most of its remaining political power over [[British Commonwealth|commonwealth]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably by dividing the British crown into several sovereignties by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the [[patriation]] of constitutions by the [[Canada Act 1982]] and the [[Australia Act 1986]], and by the independence of countries such as India, Pakistan, South Africa, and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Other events include the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], two world wars, and the [[Cold War]].

==== Australian Constitution ====
In 1901, the [[Federation of Australia]] was the process by which the six separate British [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, the colonies collectively became [[States and territories of Australia|states]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].

==== Revolution and Warlords in China ====

The picture above is [[Nanjing Road]] after the uprising, hung with the [[Five Races Under One Union]] Flags then used by the revolutionaries.|alt=|left]]
The last days of the [[Qing dynasty]] were marked with civil unrest, [[Hundred Days' Reform|failed reforms]] and foreign invasions such as the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer rebellion]]. Responding to these civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court did attempt to reform the government in various ways, as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910. However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such reforming measures of political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer toward the road of revolution.

The assertions of Chinese philosophy&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Enlightenment. By Vera Schwarcz. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; began to integrate concepts of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls, such as the [[May Fourth Movement]], to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There were attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-sen]] at the beginning of the 20th century

In 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in [[Nanjing]] as the first [[President of the Republic of China|Provisional President]]. But power in [[Beijing]] already had passed to [[Yuan Shikai]], who had effective control of the [[Beiyang Army]], the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent [[civil war]] and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic, leaders agreed to Army's demand that China be united under a Beijing government. On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.

After the early 20th century revolutions, shifting alliances of [[Warlord era (China)|China's regional warlords]] waged war for control of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the [[Beiyang government]]. The warlord era ended around 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, W.A. (2010). ''Politics in China: An introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Yalu River 1904.jpg|thumb|The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was the first time a European Country was defeated by an Asian Country in modern times. The Japanese Victory shocked the world.|alt=]]
In 1900 the World's Population had approached approximately 1.6 billion.
Four years into the 20th century saw the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] establishing the [[Empire of Japan]] as a world power. The Russians were in constant pursuit of a [[warm water port]] on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The Manchurian Campaign of the [[Russian Empire]] was fought against the Japanese over [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]]. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Mukden]], and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the [[Yellow Sea]]. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government.

The [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] was a wave of mass political unrest through vast areas of the [[Russian Empire]]. Some of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected.  It included [[terrorism]], worker strikes, peasant unrests, and military mutinies. It led to the establishment of the limited constitutional monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian Constitution of 1906]]&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]], and the [[multi-party system]].

In China, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. The Xinhai Revolution began with the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on October 10, 1911 and ended with the abdication of [[Emperor Puyi]] on February 12, 1912. The primary parties to the conflict were the Imperial forces of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), and the revolutionary forces of the [[Tongmenghui|Chinese Revolutionary Alliance]] (Tongmenghui).

===== Edwardian Britain =====
[[File:Steamship Titanic.jpg|thumb|The [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] was the largest ship constructed in its time. Deemed invincible, it was sunk by [[iceberg]]s off the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada.]] |alt=|left]]
The [[Edwardian era]] in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] up to the end of the First World War, including the years surrounding the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. In the early years of the period, the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions. The imperial policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]] the Liberals won a huge landslide. The Liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the [[House of Lords]], which was largely Conservative. Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament over the [[People's Budget]] led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910. The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|general election in January that year]] returned a [[hung parliament]] with the balance of power held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Nationalist Party (Ireland)|Irish Nationalist]] members.

===== World War I =====
{{Main|World War I}}

The [[causes of World War I]] included many factors, including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the war. The [[Triple Entente]] was the name given to the loose alignment between the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] after the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907.  The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various agreements with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the United States, and [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], constituted a powerful counterweight to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict. The immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, the spark (or casus belli) for which was the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] of Austria.

However, the crisis did not exist in a void; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the [[Baghdad Railway]] which was planned to connect the [[Ottoman Empire]] cities of [[Konya]] and [[Baghdad]] with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;([[Morris Jastrow, Jr.|Jastrow]] 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the [[Balkans]]. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The [[Balkan Wars]] were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the [[Balkan League]] (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.

The war caused the disintegration of four empires—the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian ones—as well as radical change in the European and West Asian maps. The Allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the [[Triple Entente]], and the Central Powers are referred to as the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].

[[File:Chemical Warfare in the Twentieth Century Q54781.jpg|left|thumb|[[Chemical warfare|Chemical Warfare]] was used for the first time in WWI.

On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing, although the scale of the conflict was just as large.  Hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and—for the first time—from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and [[genocide]] committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. Notably, more people died of the worldwide [[Spanish flu|influenza outbreak]] at the end of the war and shortly after than died in the hostilities. The unsanitary conditions engendered by the war, severe overcrowding in barracks, wartime propaganda interfering with public health warnings, and migration of so many soldiers around the world helped the outbreak become a [[pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=John M.|authorlink=John M.

Ultimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old [[New World Order (political)|world order]] that had emerged after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which was modified by the mid-19th century's nationalistic revolutions. The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations.&lt;ref&gt;Roderic H.

The [[League of Nations]] granted France mandates over [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]] and granted the United Kingdom mandates over [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine]] (which was later divided into two regions: [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]). Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became parts of what are today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]].

===== Revolutions and war in Eurasia =====

{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Lenin.gif|thumb|Lenin]]

The Russian Revolution is the series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the [[Tsarist autocracy]] and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. Following the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was established. In October 1917, a [[October Revolution|''red'' faction revolution]] occurred in which the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]], armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the Bolshevik Party, seized control of [[Saint Petersburg]] (then known as [[Petrograd]]) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former [[Russian Empire]].

Another action in 1917 that is of note was the armistice signed between Russia and the Central Powers at [[Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan Mawdsley (2008) ''The Russian Civil War'': 42&lt;/ref&gt; As a condition for peace, the treaty by the [[Central Powers]] conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting [[nationalist]]s and [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. The Bolsheviks made peace with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]], as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution. Vladimir Lenin's decision has been attributed to his sponsorship by the foreign office of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], offered by the latter in hopes that with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from World War I. This suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]].  The [[Triple Entente|Western Allies]] expressed their dismay at the Bolsheviks, upset at:
# the withdrawal of Russia from the war effort,
# worried about a possible Russo-German alliance, and
# galvanized by the prospect of the Bolsheviks making good their threats to assume no responsibility for, and so default on, Imperial Russia's massive [[External debt|foreign loans]].&lt;ref&gt;the legal notion of [[Odious debt]] had not yet been formulated&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Russian civil war posters.png|left|thumb|Two contrasting visions of the [[Russian Civil War]]. To the left is propaganda from the [[White Army]], to the right is propaganda from the [[Bolsheviks]]. ]]
In addition, there was a concern, shared by many [[Central Powers]] as well, that the socialist revolutionary ideas would spread to the West. Hence, many of these countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. [[Winston Churchill]] declared that Bolshevism must be "strangled in its cradle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 Cover Story: Churchill's Greatness.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004110408/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 |date=2006-10-04 }} Interview with Jeffrey Wallin. (The Churchill Centre)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war that occurred within the former [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Russian provisional government]] collapsed and the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviets]] under the domination of the [[Bolshevik]] party assumed power, first in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd (St. Petersburg)]] and then in other places. In the wake of the [[October Revolution]], the old Russian Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard was the Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the [[Cheka]], the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Christopher, ''From Tsar to Soviets'', Oxford University Press (1996), p. 237: By 1920, 77% of the Red Army's enlisted ranks were composed of peasant conscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Beryl, ''The Russian Revolution 1917–1921'', Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

[[File:Vladivostok intervention.jpg|thumb|In the Russian Civil War, over eleven nations intervened in favor of the [[White Movement]]. Here Japanese occupy [[Vladivostok]].]]
The principal fighting occurred between the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]] and the forces of the [[White Movement|White Army]]. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied Forces]], yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist [[Green armies|Green Army]], the Ukrainian anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] and [[Black Guards]], and warlords such as [[Ungern von Sternberg]]. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied [[Vladivostok]], previously held by the [[Provisional Priamur Government]]. The last enclave of the White Forces was the [[Ayano-Maysky District]] on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General [[Pyotr Wrangel]] in the [[Crimea]], but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., [[Kronstadt Uprising]], [[Tambov Rebellion]], [[Basmachi Revolt]], and the final resistance of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]]).

While the early 1920s was a time of flux for revolutionary Russia and Central Asia, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] was proclaimed in 1922 as the successor state to the fallen [[Russian Empire]]. Revolutionary leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] died of natural causes and was succeeded by [[Joseph Stalin]].

==== The Early Republic of China ====

In 1917, China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under Japanese control. The [[New Culture Movement]] occupied the period from 1917 to 1923. Chinese representatives refused to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to intense pressure from the student protesters and public opinion alike.
[[File:Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2.jpg|left|thumb|Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2]]

The [[May Fourth Movement]] helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 [[Sun Yat-sen]] had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in [[Guangzhou]] in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).[[File:Sino-german cooperation.png|thumb|With [[Sino-German cooperation until 1941]], Chinese industry and military was improved just prior to the war against Japan.|alt=|150x150px]]

In early 1927, the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Kuomintang had decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to [[Wuhan]]. But [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whose [[Northern Expedition]] was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in [[April 12 Incident|April 1927]].

The interwar period was the period between the end of the First World War and the beginning of the Second World War. This period was marked by turmoil in much of the world, as Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War.[[File:A flapper girl LCCN2012645724.tif|thumb|227x227px|American, Flapper Girl.

The social and societal upheaval known as the Roaring Twenties began in North America and spread to Europe in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The ''Roaring Twenties'', often called "[[Jazz Age|The Jazz Age]]", saw an exposition of social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. "[[Normalcy]]" returned to politics, [[jazz music]] blossomed, the [[flapper]] redefined modern womanhood, [[Art Deco]] peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].[[File:I Got The Ritz From The One I Love.ogg|left|thumb|''I got the Ritz from the one I love,'' Jazz music radio broadcast 1932]]
Europe spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. In Germany, the [[Weimar Republic]] gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil, which culminated with the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation]] of 1923 and the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass-produced goods. By the middle of the decade, [[economic development]] soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the "[[Golden Twenties]]". In France and francophone Canada, they were also called the "''années folles''" ("Crazy Years")., 1935. German Nazis created large public performances to earn public support. [[File:Depression, Breadlines-long line of people waiting to be fed, New York City, in the absence of substantial government... - NARA - 196506.tif|thumb|[[Great Depression]], Breadlines-long line of people waiting to be fed, [[New York City]], [[United States]] i|alt=|150x150px]]Worldwide prosperity changed dramatically with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] served to punctuate the end of the previous era, as ''The Great Depression'' set in. The ''Great Depression'' was a worldwide economic [[Recession|downturn]] starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries.&lt;ref name="CRomer1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/243118/Great-Depression "Great Depression"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest and most important [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] in the 20th century, and is used in the 21st century as an example of how far the world's economy can fall.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", ''New York Times'', March 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue, prices and profits. [[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities all around the world]] were hit hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent.&lt;ref name="USBLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/|title=Commodity Data|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cochrane, Willard W.|title=Farm Prices, Myth and Reality|year=1958|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[League of Nations]]|title=World Economic Survey 1932–33|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on [[Primary sector of economic activity|primary sector industries]] suffered the most.

In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist [[Demagogy|demagogues]]—the most infamous being [[Adolf Hitler]]—setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of [[Nazism]]. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regards to China.

===== The League and crises =====
[[File:Another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler.ogg|thumb|U.K Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] attempted to negotiate with [[Adolf Hitler]] as Nazi Germany practiced an expansionist policy .|alt=|left]]
The interwar period was also marked by a radical change in the international order, away from the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] that had dominated pre–World War I Europe. One main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], which was created after the First World War with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and encouraging economic growth between member countries. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States, leading many to question its effectiveness and legitimacy.[[File:Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, Hebei, autumn 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] soldiers defending at the Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, [[Hebei]], [[China]] autumn 1937. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] cost at least twenty millions lives. ]]A series of international crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] by Japan and the [[Abyssinian crisis]] of 1935/36 in which Italy invaded [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], one of the only free African nations at that time.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, Münchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|left|thumb|The signatories [[Munich Agreement]] where British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] [[Appeasement|appeased]] to the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]] regarding territorial claims in [[Sudetenland]], [[Czechoslovakia]] to avoid conflict.]]
The League tried to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. The Abyssinian war showed Hitler how weak the League was and encouraged the remilitarization of the Rhineland in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Versailles. This was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War.

Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese designs on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of [[Manchuria]] in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor [[Puyi]] as head of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)]], the loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The [[League of Nations]], established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the [[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|areas not under Japanese control]]. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms, and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants—while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence.

===== Tripartite Pact =====
[[File:Shashin Shuho No 151.jpg|left|thumb|141x141px|Japanese poster advocating for Tripartite Pact, 1941.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United States; events such as the [[Panay incident]] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] turned American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of [[French Indochina]] in the years of 1940–41, and with the continuing war in China, the United States placed embargoes on Japan of [[strategic material]]s such as scrap metal and oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of [[South East Asia]]—specifically [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]). In 1940, Imperial Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

=====World War II=====

{{Main|World War II}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-012-0037-23A, Polen, Straßenkampf, Infanterie.jpg|left|thumb|The German [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939 is the official start of [[World War II|WWII]]]]

The Second World War was a global military conflict that took place in 1939–1945. It was the largest and deadliest war in history, culminating in [[the Holocaust]] and ending with the dropping of the [[atom bomb]].

Even though Japan had been invading in China since 1937, the conventional view is that the war began on September 1, 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland, the [[Drang nach Osten]]. Within two days the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, even though the fighting was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union joined with Germany on September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.
The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were initially made up of Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, as well as [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries which were controlled directly by the UK, such as the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]]. All of these countries declared war on Germany in September 1939.
[[File:Children in the Holocaust concentration camp liberated by Red Army.jpg|alt=Holocaust Survivors, January 1945|thumb|Survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] at the infamous German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] located in Occupied Poland. ]]
Following the lull in fighting, known as the "[[Phoney War]]", Germany invaded western Europe in May 1940. Six weeks later, France, in the mean time attacked by Italy as well, surrendered to Germany, which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer Britain. On September 27, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed a mutual defense agreement, the [[Tripartite Pact]], and were known as the [[Axis Powers]].Nine months later, on June 22, 1941, Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, which promptly joined the Allies. Germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two fronts. This proved to be a mistake by Germany – Germany had not successfully carried out the invasion of Britain and the war turned against the Axis.

On December 7, 1941, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor]], bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time, and attacked Japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare. By the beginning of 1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and the British Commonwealth, China, and the United States were fighting Japan. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were referred as a "trusteeship of the powerful" during the [[World War II]]&lt;ref name = Justus&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doenecke |first1=Justus D. |last2=Stoler |first2=Mark A. |title=Debating Franklin D.

It is possible that around 62 million people [[World War II casualties|died in the war]]; estimates vary greatly. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, [[genocide]] (in particular, the [[Holocaust]]), and aerial bombing. The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died.
The Holocaust (which roughly means "burnt whole") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other "unwanted" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later. Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans.

After World War II, Europe was informally split into Western and Soviet [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. [[Western Europe]] later aligned as the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and [[Eastern Europe]] as the [[Warsaw Pact]]. There was a shift in power from Western Europe and the [[British Empire]] to the two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. These two rivals would later face off in the [[Cold War]]. In Asia, the defeat of Japan led to its [[democratization]]. [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] continued through and after the war, resulting eventually in the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The former colonies of the European powers began their road to independence.

The mid-20th century is distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature. Economic development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life, to a degree which was unprecedented in human history.

Over the course of the 20th century, the world's per-capita [[gross domestic product]] grew by a factor of five,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bradford DeLong, [http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html ''Cornucopia: Increasing Wealth in the Twentieth Century''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230090216/http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html |date=2005-12-30 }}. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its Industrial Revolution). Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning.  However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider,&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Wayne. ''Theoretical criminology: from modernity to post-modernism''. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Program). ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being''. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment series. Washington, DC: Island Press, 2005. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the [[Global South]]. Large-scale industry and more centralized [[Mass media|media]] made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century, leading to wars that were also unprecedented. However, the increased communications contributed to [[democratization]]. Technological developments included the development of airplanes and [[space exploration]], [[nuclear technology]], advancement in [[genetics]], and the dawning of the [[Information Age]].

=== American Peace ===

{{Main|Pax Americana}}
Pax Americana is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America starting around the start of the 20th century. Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used in various places and eras. Its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.

=== Cold War era ===
{{Main|Cold War}}
The Cold War began in the mid-1940s and lasted into the early 1990s. Throughout this period, the conflict was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The conflict included costly defense spending, a massive [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and numerous [[proxy war]]s; the two [[superpower]]s never fought one another directly.

[[File:NATO vs. Warsaw (1949-1990).svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|{{center|Borders of [[NATO]] (blue) and [[Warsaw Pact]] (red) states during the Cold war era.}}]]
The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various western European countries began a policy of "[[containment]]" of [[communism]] and forged myriad alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. Several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe, including western Germany, which the Soviets opposed. In other regions of the world, such as Latin America and [[Southeast Asia]], the Soviet Union fostered [[communist revolution]]ary movements, which the United States and many of its allies opposed and, in some cases, attempted to "[[rollback|roll back]]". Many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either NATO or the Warsaw Pact, though other movements would also emerge.
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|left|thumb|US and USSR nuclear stockpiles]]
In China [[Mao Zedong]] (''Máo zé dōng'') utilized [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought. When the [[Communist Party of China]] assumed power in 1959, previous schools of Chinese thought, excepting notably [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], were denounced as backward. Many parts of China's past were even purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Though initially friendly with the [[Soviet Union]] the Chinese and Soviet communists diverged in the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1960. Through the end of the Cold-War, China would continue on its own path from other communist countries, building better relations with the United States after 1972. China's economy would recover from the Cultural Revolution due to [[Chinese economic reform|market-oriented reforms]] led by [[Deng Xiaoping]].

The Cold War saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. International crises arose, such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949), the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989) and [[Able Archer 83|NATO exercises in November 1983]]. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought [[détente]]. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for [[mutual assured destruction]] using deliverable [[nuclear weapon]]s.

The Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from [[Brezhnev stagnation|severe economic stagnation]]. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' reforms.

In Latin America in the 1970s, leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country's upper class to support coups d'état to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by [[military dictatorship]]s that were supported by the United States of America. In the 1970s, the regimes of the [[Southern Cone]] collaborated in [[Operation Condor]] killing many [[leftist]] dissidents, including some [[urban guerrilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |author=Victor Flores Olea |title=Editoriales – El Universal – 10 de abril 2006 : Operacion Condor |work=[[El Universal (Mexico)|El Universal]] |location=Mexico |accessdate=2009-03-24 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021303/http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |archivedate=June 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies.

=== Space Age ===

[[File:Neil Armstrong small step.wav|left|thumb|Neil Armstrong small step]]
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a photograph of Earth as seen from Apollo 17. The second half of the 20th century saw an increase of interest in both [[space exploration]] and the [[environmental movement]].]]
The [[Space Age]] is a period encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age began with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the Soviet Union in October 1957. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83&amp;nbsp;kg. The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the [[Vostok programme]] and reached its peak with the [[Apollo program]] which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of [[Apollo 11]] was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], public attention has largely moved to other areas.

== Education and schools ==
The [[humanities]] are academic disciplines which study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic induction|analytic]], critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social sciences]]. Although many of the subjects of modern history coincide with that of standard history, the subject is taught independently by various systems of education in the world.

=== British education ===
Students can choose the subject at university. The material covered includes from the mid-18th century, to analysis of the present day. Virtually all colleges and sixth forms that do teach modern history do it alongside standard history; very few teach the subject exclusively.

=== Universities ===
&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[List of alumni of Jesus College, Oxford]] --&gt;
At the [[University of Oxford]] 'Modern History' has a somewhat different meaning. The contrast is not with the Middle Ages but with Antiquity. The earliest period that can be studied in the [[Final Honour School]] of Modern History begins in 285.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The '''Natural semantic metalanguage''' ('''NSM''') is a linguistic theory based on the conception of Polish professor [[Andrzej Bogusławski]]. The theory was formally developed by [[Anna Wierzbicka]] at [[Warsaw University]] and later at the [[Australian National University]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref name="Lexical Meaning"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lexical Meaning|last=Murphy|first=M. Lynne|publisher=Cambridge|year=2010|isbn=978-0521677646|location=|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cliff Goddard]] at [[Australia]]'s [[Griffith University]].&lt;ref name="Meaning and Universal Grammar"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning and Universal Grammar: Theory and Empirical Findings|editor-last=Goddard|editor-first=Cliff|editor2-first=Anna|editor2-last=Wierzbicka|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2002|isbn=9781588112644|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) theory attempts to reduce the semantics of all lexicons down to a restricted set of [[Semantic primes|semantic primitives, or primes]]. Primes are universal in that they have the same translation in every language, and they are primitive in that they cannot be defined using other words. Primes are ordered together to form [[explication]]s, which are descriptions of semantic representations consisting solely of primes.&lt;ref name="Lexical Meaning" /&gt;

Research in the NSM approach deals extensively with language and [[cognition]], and language and [[culture]]. Key areas of research include [[lexical semantics]], [[grammatical semantics]], [[phraseology]] and [[pragmatics]], as well as [[cross-cultural communication]].

Dozens of languages, including representatives of 16 language groups, have been studied using the NSM framework.  They include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[East Cree]], [[Koromu]], at least 16 [[Australian languages]], and a number of [[creole languages]] including [[Trinidadian creole]], [[Australian Kriol language|Roper River Kriol]], [[Bislama]] and [[Tok Pisin]].&lt;ref name="NSM-approach"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peeters |first1=Bert |title=nsm-approach.net |url=https://nsm-approach.net/ |website=nsm-approach.net |accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the originators [[Anna Wierzbicka]] and [[Cliff Goddard]], several other scholars have participated in NSM semantics, most notably [[Bert Peeters]], [[Zhengdao Ye]], [[Felix Ameka]], [[Jean Harkins]], [[Marie-Odile Junker]], [[Anna Gladkova]], [[Jock Wong]], [[Carsten Levisen]], [[Helen Bromhead]], [[Adrian Tien]], [[Carol Priestley]], [[Yuko Asano-Cavanagh]] and [[Gian Marco Farese]].

== Semantic primes ==
{{Main article|Semantic primes}}
Semantic primes (also known as semantic primitives) are concepts that are universal and primitive. Universal indicates that they can be translated literally into any known language and retain their semantic representation. They are primitive as they are proposed to be the most simple linguistic concepts and are unable to be defined using simpler terms &lt;ref name="Lexical Meaning" /&gt;.

Proponents of the NSM theory argue that every language shares a core vocabulary of concepts. In 1994 and 2002, Goddard and Wierzbicka studied languages across the globe and found strong evidence supporting this argument&lt;ref name="Lexical Meaning" /&gt;.

Wierzbicka's 1972 study&lt;ref name="Semantic Primitives"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Semantic Primitives|last=Wierzbicka|first=Anna|publisher=Athenäum|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed 14 semantic primes. That number was expanded to 60 in 2002 by Wierzbicka and Goddard, and the current agreed-upon number is 65 &lt;ref name="Semantics of Nouns"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Semantics of Nouns|editor-last=Ye|editor-first=Zhengdao|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780198736721|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Words and Meanings"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Words and Meanings: Lexical Semantics across Domains, Languages and Cultures|last1=Goddard|first1=Cliff|first2=Anna|last2=Wierzbicka|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780199668434|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each language's translations of the semantic primes are called exponents. Below is a list of English exponents, or the English translation of the semantic primes. It is important to note that some of the exponents in the following list are [[polysemy|polysemous]] and can be associated with meanings in English (and other languages) that are not shared. However, when used as an exponent in the Natural semantic metalanguage, it is only the prime concept which is identified as universal.

The following is a list of [[English language|English]] exponents of semantic primes adapted from [[Levisen]] and Waters (eds.) 2017&lt;ref name="Cultural Keywords"/&gt;.

{| class="wikitable"

===NSM Syntax===
NSM primes can be combined in a limited set of syntactic frames that are also universal &lt;ref name="Semantic Analysis" /&gt;. These valency options specify the specific types of grammatical functions that can be combined with the primes. While these combinations can be realized differently in other languages, it is believed that the meanings expressed by these syntactic combinations are universal. 

Example of valency frames for SAY (from Semantic Analysis &lt;ref name="Semantic Analysis" /&gt; )

someone said something→[minimal frame]

someone said: '––'→[direct speech]

someone said something to someone→[plus 'addressee']

someone said something about something/someone→[plus 'locutionary topic']

===Explications===

A semantic analysis in the NSM approach results in a reductive paraphrase called an explication that captures the meaning of the concept explicated &lt;ref name="Semantic Analysis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Semantic Analysis|last=Goddard|first=Cliff|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199560288|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An ideal explication can be substituted for the original expression in context without change of meaning.

E.g., ''Someone X killed someone Y'':&lt;br /&gt;
someone X did something to someone else Y&lt;br /&gt;
because of this, something happened to Y at the same time&lt;br /&gt;
because of this, something happened to Y's body&lt;br /&gt;
because of this, after this Y was not living anymore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goddard|first=Cliff|title=The Natural Semantic Metalanguage Approach|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/419064/Goddard_2010_OUP_Handbook_Ch18.pdf|website=Griffith University|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(archived at'' &lt;ref name="Goddard_archive"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goddard |first1=Cliff |title=The Natural Semantic Metalanguage Approach |url=https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/419064/Goddard_2010_OUP_Handbook_Ch18.pdf |website=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=13 October 2018 |archivedate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;'')''

==Semantic Molecules==
Semantic molecules are intermediary words used in explications and cultural scripts. While not semantic primes, they can be defined exclusively using primes. Semantic molecules can be determined as words that are necessary to build upon to explicate other words &lt;ref name="Cultural Keywords"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Keywords in Discourse|editor-last=Levisen|editor-first=Carsten|editor2-first=Sophia|editor2-last=Waters|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2017|isbn=9789027256829|location=Amsterdam|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These molecules are marked by the notation [m] in explications and cultural scripts. Some molecules are proposed to be universal or near-universal, while others are culture or area specific&lt;ref name="Homepage Semantic Molecules"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goddard|first1=Cliff|title=Semantic Molecules|url=https://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities-languages-social-science/research/natural-semantic-metalanguage-homepage/what-is-nsm/semantic-molecules|website=NSM Homepage|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Examples of proposed universal molecules:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| hands, mouth, eyes, head, ears, nose, face, teeth, fingers, breast, skin, bones, blood|| Body parts
|-
| long, round, flat, thin, hard, soft, sharp, smooth, heavy|| Physical
|-
| children, men, women, be born, mother, father, wife, husband || Biosocial
|}

==Minimal English==
'''Minimal English''' is a new derivative of the Natural semantic metalanguage research, with the first major publication in 2018 &lt;ref name="Minimal English"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minimal English for a Global World|editor-last=Goddard|editor-first=Cliff|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a reduced form of English designed for non-specialists to use when requiring clarity of expression or easily translatable materials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goddard|first1=Cliff|last2=Wierzbicka|first2=Anna|title=Global English, Minimal English position papers|url=http://hrc.cass.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/hrc/u78/Global_English_Minimal_English%20position%20papers.pdf|website=Global English, Minimal English: Towards better intercultural communication|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Minimal English uses an expanded set of vocabulary to the semantic primes. It includes the proposed universal and near-universal molecules, as well as non-universal words which can assist in clarity &lt;ref name="Homepage Minimal English"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goddard|first1=Cliff|title=Minimal English|url=https://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities-languages-social-science/research/natural-semantic-metalanguage-homepage/minimal-english|website=NSM Homepage|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  As such, it already has counterparts targeted at speakers of other natural languages, e.g. '''Minimal French'''&lt;ref name="Peeters_stereotypes"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peeters |first1=Bert |title=Du bon usage des stéréotypes en cours de FLE: le cas de l’ethnolinguistique appliquée [Making good use of stereotypes in the French foreign language classroom: the case of applied ethnolinguistics] |journal=Dire |date=2017 |volume=9 |pages=43-60 |url=http://epublications.unilim.fr/revues/dire/816 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Minimal Polish'''&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka_What"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wierzbicka |first1=Anna |title=W co wierzą chrześcijanie? Opowieść o Bogu i o ludziac [What Christians believe: The story of God and people] |date=2017 |publisher=Znak |location=Kraków ([[Cracow]]) |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''65 Sanaa''' (''Minimal Finnish'')&lt;ref name="Minimal English" /&gt;{{rp|225-258}} and so on.  Minimal English differs from other simple Englishes (such as [[Basic English]]) as it has been specifically designed for maximal cross-translatability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">'''Otompan''' ([[Nahuatl]] for "place of [[Otomi people|Otomis]]") or '''Otumba''' (the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version of the name) was a [[pre-Columbian]] ''[[altepetl]]'' or [[city-state]] in the upper [[Teotihuacan Valley]] (now in [[Mexico]]).

According to histories written in the [[colonial Mexico|colonial period]] (16th and 17th centuries), Otompan was created around 1395 when [[Techotlalatzin]], ruler of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], settled [[Otomi people|Otomi]] [[refugee]]s there who were fleeing the conquest of [[Xaltocan]] by the [[Tepanec]]s under [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]].

Wittgenstein claims there is an unbridgeable gap between what can be expressed in language and what can only be expressed in non-verbal ways. Picture theory of language states that statements are meaningful if they can be defined or pictured in the real world.

Wittgenstein's later practice-based theory of meaning laid out in the First Part of ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' refuted and replaced his earlier picture-based theory with a [[use theory of meaning]]. However, the second psychology-focused Part of ''Philosophical Investigations'' employs the concept as a metaphor for human psychology.&lt;ref name="Philosophical Investigations"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wittgenstein|first=Ludwig|translator= G.E.M.

{{For|the specific theoretical justifications behind the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]s|Theory of Productive Forces}}
{{Marxism}}
"'''Productive forces'''", "'''productive powers'''", or "'''forces of production'''" (in German, ''Produktivkräfte''), is a central idea in [[Marxism]] and [[historical materialism]].

In [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]]'s own critique of [[political economy]], it refers to the combination of the [[means of labor]] (tools, machinery, land, infrastructure, and so on) with human [[labor power|labour power]].  Marx and Engels probably derived the concept from [[Adam Smith]]'s reference to the "productive powers of labour" (see e.g. chapter 8 of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''), although the German political economist [[Friedrich List]] also mentions the concept of "productive powers" in ''The National System of Political Economy'' (1841).

All those forces which are applied by people in the production process (body and brain, tools and techniques, materials, resources, quality of workers' cooperation, and equipment) are encompassed by this concept, including those management and engineering functions technically indispensable for production (as contrasted with social control functions). Human [[knowledge]] can also be a productive force.

Together with the social and technical [[relations of production]], the productive forces constitute a historically specific [[mode of production]].

== Labor ==

[[Karl Marx]] emphasized that, with few exceptions, means of labour are not a productive force unless they are actually operated, maintained and conserved by living human labour. Without applying living human labour, their physical condition and value would deteriorate, depreciate, or be destroyed (an example would be a [[ghost town]] or capital depreciation due to [[strike action]]).

Capital itself, being one of the [[factors of production]], comes to be viewed in capitalist society as a productive force in its own right, independent from labour, a subject with "a life of its own". Indeed, Marx sees the essence of what he calls "the capital relation" as being summarised by the circumstance that "capital buys labour", i.e. the power of property ownership to command human energy and labour-time, and thus of inanimate "things" to exert an autonomous power over people. What disappears from view is that the power of capital depends in the last instance on human cooperation.

{{Quotation|"The production of life, both of one’s own in labour and of fresh life in procreation... appears as a double relationship: on the one hand as a natural, on the other as a social relationship. By social we understand the co-operation of several individuals, no matter under what conditions, in what manner and to what end. It follows from this that a certain mode of production, or industrial stage, is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation, or social stage, and this mode of co-operation is itself a “productive force.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The productive power of cooperation comes to be viewed as the productive power of capital, because it is capital which forcibly organises people, rather than people organising capital. Marx regarded this as a supreme [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].

Unlike British classical economics, [[Marxian economics]] classifies financial capital as being an element of the relations of production, rather than the factors or forces of production ("not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things").&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Vol. I, Ch. 33], courtesy of www.marxists.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destructive forces==

Marx &amp; Engels did not believe that human history featured a continuous growth of the productive forces. Rather, the development of the productive forces was characterised by social conflicts. Some productive forces destroyed other productive forces, sometimes productive techniques were lost or destroyed, and sometimes productive forces could be turned into destructive forces:

{{Quotation|"How little highly developed productive forces are safe from complete destruction, given even a relatively very extensive commerce, is proved by the Phoenicians, whose inventions were for the most part lost for a long time to come through the ousting of this nation from commerce, its conquest by Alexander and its consequent decline. Likewise, for instance, glass-painting in the Middle Ages. Only when commerce has become world commerce, and has as its basis large-scale industry, when all nations are drawn into the competitive struggle, is the permanence of the acquired productive forces assured. (...) Competition soon compelled every country that wished to retain its historical role to protect its manufactures {{sic}} by renewed customs regulations (the old duties were no longer any good against big industry) and soon after to introduce big industry under protective duties. Big industry universalised competition in spite of these protective measures (it is practical free trade; the protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade), established means of communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself, transformed all capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation (development of the financial system) and the centralisation of capital. By universal competition it forced all individuals to strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion, morality, etc. and where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie. It produced world history for the first time, insofar as it made all civilised nations and every individual member of them dependent for the satisfaction of their wants on the whole world, thus destroying the former natural exclusiveness of separate nations. It made natural science subservient to capital and took from the division of labour the last semblance of its natural character. It destroyed natural growth in general, as far as this is possible while labour exists, and resolved all natural relationships into money relationships. In the place of naturally grown towns it created the modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight. Wherever it penetrated, it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory of the commercial town over the countryside. [Its first premise] was the automatic system. [Its development] produced a mass of productive forces, for which private [property] became just as much a fetter as the guild had been for manufacture and the small, rural workshop for the developing craft. These productive forces received under the system of private property a one-sided development only, and became for the majority destructive forces; moreover, a great multitude of such forces could find no application at all within this system. (...) from the conception of history we have sketched we obtain these further conclusions: (1) In the development of productive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause mischief, and are no longer forces of production but forces of destruction (machinery and money); and connected with this a class is called forth, which has to bear all the burdens of society without enjoying its advantages, which, ousted from society, is forced into the most decided antagonism to all other classes; a class which forms the majority of all members of society, and from which emanates the consciousness of the necessity of a fundamental revolution, the communist consciousness, which may, of course, arise among the other classes too through the contemplation of the situation of this class. (...) Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the changing of men on a mass scale is, necessary, a change which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it, can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages, and become fitted to found society anew. (From ''[[The German Ideology]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm#d1)]&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

==Marxist–Leninist definition in the Soviet Union==

The Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., textbook (1957, p xiv) says that "[t]he productive forces reflect the ''relationship'' of people to the objects and forces of nature used for the production of material wealth." (italics added) While productive forces are a ''human'' activity, the concept of ''productive forces'' includes the concept that technology mediates the human-nature relationship. Productive forces do ''not'' include the [[subject of labor]] (the raw materials or materials from nature being worked on). Productive forces are not the same thing as the [[means of production]]. Marx identified three components of production: human labor, subject of labor, and means of labor (1967, p 174). Productive forces are the union of human labor and the means of labor; ''means of production'' are the union of the subject of labor and the means of labor. (Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., 1957, p xiii).

On the other hand, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1969-1978) states:
{{Quotation| Society’s principal productive forces are people—the participants in social production, or the workers and the toiling masses in general (K. Marx and F. Engels, vol. 46, part 1, p. 403; V. I. Lenin, Poln. sobr. soch., 5th ed., vol. 38, p. 359). &lt;…&gt;
Through the purposeful expenditure of labor power in labor activity, human beings “objectify” or embody themselves in the material world. The material elements of the productive forces (the means of production and the means of consumption) are the product of human reason and labor. The means of production include the means of labor, which transmit human influence to nature, and the objects of labor, to which human labor is applied. The most important components of the means of labor are the instruments of labor (for example, tools, devices, and machines).
 (From ''Productive forces. — The Great Soviet Encyclopedia: in 30 volumes. — Moscow: «Soviet Encyclopedia», 1969-1978.''; English web-version of the article [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Production+forces]; original version in Russian [http://slovari.yandex.ru/%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%8D%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8B/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8B/])}}

According to this, productive forces have such structure:
* People (human labour power)
* Means (the material elements of the productive forces)
** Means of production
*** Means of labour
**** Instruments of labour
*** Objects of labour (also known as Subject of labour)
** Means of consumption

Marxism in USSR served as core philosophical paradigm or platform, and had been developing as a science. So different views, hypotheses and approaches were widely discussed, tested and refined with time.

==Reification of technology==

Other interpretations, sometimes influenced by [[postmodernism]] and the concept of [[commodity fetishism]] have by contrast emphasized the [[reification (Marxism)|reification]] of the powers of technology, said to occur by the separation of technique from the producers, and by falsely imputing human powers to technology as autonomous force, the effect being a perspective of inevitable and unstoppable [[technological progress]] operating beyond any human control, and impervious to human choices.

In turn, this is said to have the effect of naturalising and legitimating social arrangements produced by people, by asserting that they are technically inevitable. The error here seems to be that [[social relations]] between people are confused and conflated with technical relations between people and things, and object relations between things; but this error is said to be a spontaneous result of the operation of a universal [[Market (economics)|market]] and the process of [[commercialization]].

==Productivity==

Marx's concept of productive forces also has some relevance for discussions in economics about the meaning and measurement of [[productivity]].

Modern economics theorises productivity in terms of the marginal product of the [[factors of production]]. Marx theorises productivity within the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] in terms of the social and technical [[relations of production]], with the concept of the [[organic composition of capital]] and the [[value product]]. He suggests there is no completely neutral view of productivity possible; how productivity is defined depends on the values and interests people have. Thus, different [[social class]]es have different notions of productivity reflecting their own station in life, and giving rise to different notions of [[Unproductive labor|productive and unproductive labour]].

==Critique of technology==

In the [[romanticism|romantic]] or [[ecological]] critique of technology, technical progress boosting productivity often does not mean human progress at all. The design of production technologies may not be suited to human needs or human health, or technologies may be used in ways which do more harm than good. In that case, productive forces are transformed into destructive forces.

Sometimes this view leads to [[cultural pessimism]] or a theory of "[[Small Is Beautiful|Small is beautiful]]" as proposed by [[E. F. Schumacher]]. Ideas about [[alternative technology]] are also proposed. All of this suggests that the technologies we have, are only ''options'' which have been chosen from different technical possibilities existing at the time, and that the same technologies can be used for good or for ill, in different contexts.

A technology may be chosen because it is profitable, and once adopted on a mass scale, it may be difficult to create alternatives to it, particularly because it becomes integrated with other technologies and a whole "life style" (e.g. petrol-fueled cars). Yet that may not mean that the technology is ultimately desirable for human life on earth.

Productive force determinism is then criticised on the ground that whatever technologies are adopted, these are the result of human [[choices]] between technical alternatives, influenced by the human interests and stakes existing at the time. What may be presented as a pre-determined "technical necessity" may in reality have more to do with considerations of [[political power|political]], [[power (sociology)|sociological]], or [[economic power]].

Advocates of technological progress however argue that even if admittedly "progress may have its price", without technical innovation there would be no progress at all; the same people who criticize technology also depend on it for their everyday existence.

'''Rakuten.co.uk''' is a [[website]] owned by [[Rakuten]], that operates as an [[online marketplace]]. The website does not sell any products directly, but instead allows third party sellers to sell their products. The website replaced '''Play.com''', which was originally established in [[Jersey]] as an online retailer of entertainment products including DVDs and music, which subsequently expanded its product offering.

Rakuten purchased Play.com in 2011,&lt;ref name=playbuy&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Zoe|title=Play.com sold to Rakuten of Japan for £25m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/21/playcom-sold-rakuten-japan|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 the company switched to its new marketplace format following a change in the law covering tax for companies operating in Jersey and selling to consumers on the UK mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-20953357|title=Jersey retailer Play.com closes direct retail business|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Play.com website was replaced by Rakuten.co.uk on March 23, 2015.

==History==

===Play.com===
[[File:Rakuten Play.com Logo.png|thumb|Former Play.com logo following its purchase by Rakuten]]
Play.com was founded in 1998 under the name '''Play247.com''', but rebranded as Play.com in 2000. Play.com originally sold region 1 and 2 DVDs only, but since expanded its range to include CDs and [[video game]]s and other electronic items. In 2004 it began to sell books and [[electronics]], in 2006 it started selling [[personal computers]], [[posters]] and [[T-shirt]]s and in 2007 it started selling [[HD DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]]s, with sister site PlayUSA.com selling region 1 DVDs, HD DVDs and region A [[Blu-ray Disc]]s and offering sales in a range of currencies. The site's interface was redesigned on a number of occasions.

Play.com was ranked second on the November 2006 UK "Hot Shops List" compiled by IMRG and [[Hitwise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitwise.com/news/uk200611.html "November Hitwise - IMRG Hot Shops List"] - hitwise.com; retrieved 12 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Play.com started selling DRM-free MP3s, clothing, accessories, and [[Ticket (admission)|tickets for events]], allowing customers to buy and sell tickets. They also held a consumer games show which was open to the public, with tickets available through Play.com.

On 15 January 2009, a survey published by Verdict Research found Play.com was the UK's second favourite music and video retailer, behind first place Amazon.co.uk and ahead of the now defunct entertainment retailer [[Zavvi (retailer)|Zavvi]] which was third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/74820-amazon-is-uks-third-favourite-retailer.html |title=Amazon is UK's third favourite retailer |publisher=theBookseller.com |accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2009, it was reported that Play.com had topped the National Consumer Satisfaction Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ieda4f2f47125746da816749f5c0f4caa |title=U.K. Consumers Most Satisfied With Play.com |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsiuk.com/index.php |title=Ncsi-Uk |publisher=Ncsi-Uk |date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of [[Amazon.co.uk]] and [[iTunes]].

In May 2009, Play.com launched a branded [[Visa Inc.|Visa credit card]] in partnership with [[MBNA]]. Cardholders received points for purchases made on the website and at other retailers. Points could then be redeemed against products bought on the Play.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play.com/Campaign.html?campaign=6748&amp;cid=5106868 |title=Credit Card |publisher=Play.com |date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/news.phtml/24223/playcom-offers-credit-card-loyalty-points.phtml |title=Play.com offers credit card |publisher=Pocket-lint.com |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayUSA.com website was closed down in February 2011. In September 2011, Japan-based Rakuten purchased Play.com for £25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a341548/playcom-bought-by-japanese-firm-rakuten-for-gbp25m.html |title=Play.com bought by Japanese firm Rakuten for £25m - Media News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2013, Play.com has operated solely as an online marketplace, where third party retailers sell products with their listings hosted on the website. All retailers on the Marketplace have the ability to build a fully branded and customised storefront, giving them control of how their products are merchandised.

===Replacement with Rakuten===
In October 2014, Rakuten launched Rakuten.co.uk, which replaced Play.com completely on 23 March 2015.

'''Rakuten UK to close'''

On June 7, 2016, Rakuten announced plans for changes in the business in the UK. Rakuten.co.uk in its existing format would no longer be available after the end of August 2016 for new purchases. Rakuten.co.uk was then relaunched in October 2016 as a portal to earn "Superpoints" from using online shops such as Topman, HMV and B&amp;Q.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://link.newsletter.rakuten.co.uk/public/r/yufXLs4Iz0D4hYWhNKfcMQ/mze+19T2aUwm4NRq0+5ZPQ/dNDOVSFzHI1Rsk5dlIFT6A|title=An error has occurred|author=|date=|website=link.newsletter.rakuten.co.uk|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A copy of the Thor's hammer from Skåne - Nachbildung des Thorshammers von Skåne 02.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the [[Thor's hammer]] from [[Scania]]. The original find was created around 1000 AD.]]
A '''replica''' is an exact [[copying|reproduction]], such as of a [[painting]], as it was executed by the original artist or a copy or reproduction, especially one on a [[scale (ratio)|scale]] smaller than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Replica|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/replica|work=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Replica|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/replica|work=The Free Online Dictionary|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica is a [[copying]] closely resembling the [[original]] concerning its shape and appearance. An inverted [[microtechnology|replica]] complements the original by filling its gaps. It can be a copy used for historical purposes, such as being placed in a [[museum]]. Sometimes the original never existed. Replicas and reproductions can be related to any form of licensing an image for others to use, whether it is through photos, postcards, prints, miniature or full size copies they represent a resemblance of the original object.

"Not all incorrectly attributed items are intentional [[forgeries]]. In the same way that a [[museum]] shop might sell a [[printmaking|print]] of a painting or a replica of a [[vase]], copies of [[statue]]s, paintings, and other precious [[cultural artifact|artifacts]] have been popular through the ages.&lt;ref name="Hamma"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamma|first=Kenneth|title=Public Domain Art in an Age of Easier Mechanical Reproducibility|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/hamma/11hamma.html|publisher=D-Lib Magazine|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, replicas have often been used illegally for [[forgery]] and [[counterfeit]]s, especially of money and coins, but also commercial merchandise such as [[designer label]] clothing, luxury bags and accessories, and luxury [[watches]]. In arts or collectible automobiles, the term "replica" is used for discussing the non-original recreation, sometimes hiding its real identity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In motor racing, especially motorcycling, often manufacturers will produce a street version product with the colours of the vehicle or clothing of a famous racer. This is not the actual vehicle or clothing worn during the race by the racer, but a fully officially approved brand-new street-legal product in similar looks. Typically found in helmets, race suits/clothing, and motorcycles, they are coloured in the style of racers, and often carry the highest performance and safety specifications of any street-legal products. These high-performance race-look products termed "Replica", are priced higher and are usually more sought-after than plain colours of the same product.

Because of [[gun control|gun ownership restrictions]] in some locales, gun collectors create non-functional legal replicas of illegal firearms. Such replicas are also preferred to real firearms when used as a [[theatrical property|prop]] in a film or stage performance, generally for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Making a Working Hunting Gun from Antique Brunswick Rifle Parts|url = http://www.ammoland.com/2014/07/making-a-working-hunting-gun-from-antique-brunswick-rifle-parts/#axzz3xPelfjO1|website = AmmoLand.com Shooting Sports News|access-date = 2016-01-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[prop replica]] is an authentic-looking duplicate of a prop from a video game, movie or television show.

==Background==

"Replicas represent a copy or forgery of another object and we often think of forgeries we think of paintings but, in fact, anything that is collectible and expensive is an attractive item to forge".&lt;ref name="Hamma"/&gt;

Replicas have been made by people to preserve a perceived link to the past. This can be linked to a historical past or specific time-period or just to commemorate an experience. Replicas and reproductions of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] help provide a material representation of the past for the public. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Replicas of artifacts and art==

[[File:General Terracotta Warrior.jpg|thumb|A General Terracotta Replica Warrior {{convert|3+1/2|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}]]

Replicas of artifacts and [[arts|art]] have a purpose within [[museum]]s and research. They are created to help with preserving of original artifacts. In many cases the original artifact may be too frail and be to much at risk of further damage on display posing a risk to the artifact from light damage, environmental agents, and other risks greater than in secure storage.&lt;ref name="Goff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Kent J.|title=Reproductions of Original Artifacts in Museum Programming and Exhibits|url=http://www.mvep.org/MCMgmtpaper.htm|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicas are created for the purpose of experimental archaeology where archaeologists and material analysts try to understand the ways that an artifact was created and what technologies and skills were needed for the people to create the artifact on display.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;

Another reason for the creation of replica artifacts, is for museums to be able to send originals around the globe or allow other museums or events to educate people on the history of specific artifacts. Replicas are also put on display in museums when further research is being conducted on the artifact, but further display of the artifact in real or replica form is important for public access and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;

==Authenticity and replicas==

Replicas and their original representation can be seen as fake or real depending on the viewer. Good replicas take much education related to understanding all the processes and history that go behind the culture and the original creation. To create a good and authentic replica of an object, there is to be a skilled artisan or forger to create the same authentic experience that the original object provides.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Kent J. |title=Reproductions of Original Artifacts in Museum Programming and Exhibits|url=http://www.mvep.org/MCMgmtpaper.htm|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process takes time and much money to be done correctly for museum standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knell|first=Simon|title=Care of Collections|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203974711|pages=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s6awQjJQU4C&amp;dq=%22Do+objects+have+a+Finite+Lifetime%3F%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity or real feeling presented by an object can be “described as the experience of an ‘aura’ of an original.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtorf|first=Cornelius|title=From Stonehenge to Las Vegas: Archaeology as Popular Culture|year=2005|publisher=Altamira press|isbn=0-7591-0267-8|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aura of an object is what an object represents through its previous history and experience.&lt;ref name="Holtorf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtorf|first=Cornelius|title=From Stonehenge to Las Vegas:Archaeology as Popular Culture|year=2005|publisher=Altamira press|isbn=0-7591-0267-8|pages=112–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicas work well in museum settings because they have the ability to look so real and accurate that people can feel the authentic feelings that they are supposed to get from the originals. Through the context and experience that a replica can provide in a museum setting, people can be fooled into seeing it as ‘original’.&lt;ref name="Holtorf"/&gt;

The authenticity of a replica is important for the impression it gives off to tourists or observers. 
“According to Trilling, the original use of authenticity in tourism was in museums where experts wanted to determine 'whether objects of art are what they appear to be or are claimed to be, and therefore worth the price that is asked for them or…. worth the admiration they are being given'.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trilling|first=Lionel|title=Sincerity and Authenticity|year=1972|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674808614|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Carol J.|title=Reconceptualizing object authenticity|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=January 2006|volume=33|issue=1|pages=65–86|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738305000897|accessdate=25 March 2012|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2005.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reproductions and the values of authenticity presented to the public through artifacts in museums provide “truth”.  However, authenticity has a way of also being represented in what the public expects in a predictable manner or based on stereotypes within museums.&lt;ref name="Steiner"/&gt; This idea of authenticity also relates to cultural artifacts like food, cultural activities, festivals, housing, and dress that helps to homogenize the cultures that are being represented and make them seem static.&lt;ref name="Steiner"/&gt;

For luxury goods, the same authentic feel has to be present for consumers to want to buy a “fake” designer bag or watch that provides them with the same feelings and desired experiences, but as well achieves the look of higher class.

==Examples of replicas==

[[Image:050114 2529 difference.jpg|thumb|The replica Difference Engine No. 2 in the [[Science Museum, London]]]]
[[File:Bugatti Esders Roadster Royale.jpg|thumb|Replica of a [[Bugatti Royale|1932 Bugatti Type 41]] "Esders Roadster Royale"]]

Replicas and reproductions are also for purely consumption and personal value. Through souvenirs people can own their very own physical representation of their experience or passions. 
People can buy on-line full size replicas (museum-quality) of the Rosetta Stone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosetta stone replicas|url=http://www.freemaninstitute.com/rosettastone.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or prints and museum-quality copies of the Mona Lisa and other famous pieces of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mona Lisa posters|url=http://www.allposters.com/-st/Mona-Lisa-da-Vinci-Posters_c83942_.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Difference Engine]] No. 2, designed by [[Charles Babbage]] in the 19th century, was reconstructed from original drawings studied by [[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan Bromley]] in the 1980s and is now on display at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in [[London]], [[England]]. A second example is [[Stephenson's Rocket]] where a replica was built in 1979, following the original design fairly closely, but with some adaptations.

In China the terra-cotta warriors can be recreated to be personalized for customers. The “Talented craftspeople use their hands and proper tools reproducing every masterwork precisely in the same manner as the royal craftsmen did 2200 years ago. They are made from the same local clay as the originals and constructed essentially in the same ancient method.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factory Tour Lintong, Xi'an: How to make Xian Qin Terracotta Warrior Statues Soldiers?|url=http://www.online-shopping-china.com/tcwft.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These warriors can come in a variety of sizes and provide a very realistic and authentic experience with their own personal warrior.

As the white mark prestige comes from the imitation of iPhone, the white marks are the most popular brands in the world. Knock-off brand label fashions and accessories  like Louis Vuitton, Coach, Chanel, and Rolex are major labels that get copied.

==Issues and controversies==
[[Controversies]] with replicas (museum context) are associated with who owns the past.

With works of art museums assert their intellectual property rights for replicas and reproduction of images which many museums use commercial licensing for providing access to images. Issues are arising with more images being available on the internet and it being free access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamma|first=Kenneth|title=Public Domain Art in an Age of Easier Mechanical Reproducibility|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=November 2005|volume=11|issue=11|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/hamma/11hamma.html|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists can claim [[copyright infringement]] related to displays of their work in a context they did not approve of which can be the creation of replicas of their pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bamberger|first=Alan|title=Copyright Infringement, Reproduction Rights, and Artist Careers|url=http://www.artbusiness.com/reprosuit.html|work=The art business. com|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With replica artifacts the copies to be “museum-quality” have to reach a high standard and can cost a lot of money to be produced.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;

Replica artifacts (copies) can provide an authentic view but represents more of the subjectivities of what people expect and desire from their museum experiences and the cultures they learn about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtorf|first=Cornelius|title=From Stonehenge to Las Vegas:Archaeology as Popular Culture|year=2005|publisher=Altamira press|isbn=0-7591-0267-8|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With copies of retail and other counterfeit goods there is a legal issue related to copyright and trademark ownership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10708">The [[American Revolution]] spanned from 1775 to 1783, after which the [[United States]] received recognition of independence by and from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Rhetorical or hyperbolic references to a '''Second American Revolution''' have been made on a number of occasions throughout the history of the United States.

==Interpretations==
* A second American revolution was conceived early on as attainable via the [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|Article V Convention]], as set forth in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. Occasional conventions were envisioned by many of the country's founding generation of leaders to be a sort of institutionalized avenue toward the ideal of revolution every twenty years, often attributed to [[Thomas Jefferson]]. According to Samuel Williams of [[Vermont]] (1743&amp;ndash;1817), it was to be the means to accomplish periodic constitutional adaptation to changing times. Born the same year as Jefferson, Williams saw the federal constitutional convention as the vehicle for what loose constructionists today term the [[Living Constitution|"living, breathing constitution."]]&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Williams, The Natural and Civil History of Vermont, 2 vols. (Burlington VT, Samuel Mills, 1809) 2:395-96. Congregational minister, Harvard professor, author of the first history of Vermont, and founder of Vermont's oldest continuously published newspaper; Rev. Williams considered a rigid, unchanging constitution to be high folly, in that "no policy would appear more puerile or contemptible to the people of America, than an attempt to bind posterity to our forms, or to confine them to our degrees of knowledge, and improvement: The aim is altogether the reverse, to make provision for the perpetual improvement and progression of the government itself…."&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[War of 1812]] between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] is sometimes referred to as the second American Revolution, stemming from the second British recognition of 1781 American borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.about.com/od/warof1812/War_of_1812.htm War of 1812 - The Second War for Independence]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John C. Calhoun]] was perhaps the first to make this claim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OMVakHwT4poC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=War+of+1812+Second+American+Revolution&amp;lr= ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'', pg. 498]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] thought they were fighting a second American Revolution by attempting to secede from the United States during the [[American Civil War]] from 1861 to 1865. It was also used in the 1920s by historian [[Charles A. Beard]] to emphasize the changes brought on by the Union's victory.
* Historian [[Charles A. Beard]] first proposed—in 1927—that the US [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and emancipation amounted to a second American revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1927), 2 vols., II, 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many historians—including [[James M. McPherson]], Gregory P. Downs, and Bruce Levine—have argued that the fight against and victory over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] amounts to a second American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/20/books/liberating-the-slaves-and-himself.html?mcubz=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/07/19/why-the-second-american-revolution-deserves-as-much-attention-as-the-first/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://jacobinmag.com/2015/08/second-american-revolution-civil-war-charleston-emancipation-lincoln-union&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
* In the 1992 [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], the Confederates officially refer to the American Civil War as the Second American Revolution after their victory in 1864.
* In the 2006 novel ''[[Empire (2006 novel)|Empire]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], a second revolution occurs following the assassination of both the president and the vice president.
* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Back in the USSA]]'' by [[Eugene Byrne]] and [[Kim Newman]], both a second revolution and civil war occur after the corrupt presidency of [[Charles Foster Kane]]. He had become the 28th president after former president and [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate [[Theodore Roosevelt]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 presidential election]], but was assassinated on December 19, 1912 when he and the [[Rough Riders]] attempted to break up a labor strike at the [[Chicago]] [[Union Stock Yards]] by the sharpshooter and exhibition shooter [[Annie Oakley]]. Due to Kane being Roosevelt's running mate, he became president on March 4, 1913. By 1917, the US had become unstable politically and socially. That year, the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist party]] led by [[Eugene Debs]] gains increasing support and the Second American Revolution based on the [[Russian Revolution]] breaks out, following which Kane is ousted from [[The White House]] and overthrow and executed for [[Treason laws in the United States|treason]], and the United States becomes the United Socialist States of America (USSA) with Debs as its president, serving until his death in 1926.
* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' by [[L. Neil Smith]] as part of the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]], the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] becomes a Second American Revolution in 1794 after [[Albert Gallatin]] intercedes to help the farmers rather than the US Government as he does in real history. This eventually leads to [[George Washington]] getting overthrown and executed by firing squad for treason, the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] being declared null and void, and Gallatin being proclaimed as the second president and would serve until 1812. In 1795, a new caretaker government is organized with all taxes being repealed. A revised version of the [[Articles of Confederation]] are ratified in 1797, but with a greater emphasis on individual and economic freedom.
* In the 1991 short story "Dispatches From the Revolution" by [[Pat Cadigan]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'', a second revolution occurs after a bomb is planted at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in August 1968, which explodes. The explosion kills [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], Senator [[George McGovern]], and Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], wiping out the most prominent contenders for the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 Presidential Election]]. This leads to major chaos and the United States eventually becomes an [[Autocracy|autocratic]] state with [[Ronald Reagan]] as the president.
* The [[dystopian novel|dystopian science fiction novel]] ''[[Alongside Night]]'' by [[J. Neil Schulman]] has the novel set during the crisis of a Second American Revolution. It has been adapted into a graphic novel&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Schulmans-Alongside-Night-Graphic-Novel-ebook/dp/B00FWQXISS/&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2014-released narrative feature film&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Alongside-Night-Kevin-Sorbo/dp/B0163BSRWW/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* In the alternate history novel ''[[Fire on the Mountain (Bisson novel)|Fire on the Mountain]]'' by [[Terry Bisson]], [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] succeeded in [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|his raid]] on [[Harper's Ferry]] and touched off a [[slave rebellion]] in 1859, which sparks an alternate civil war and leads to the formation of a new Socialist nation known as "[[Republic of New Afrika|Nova Africa]]" in the Southern U.S. Decades later, a Socialist revolutionary war occurs in [[Chicago]] and defeats the rump United States.
* In the [[dystopian novel]] ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]]. A [[Christian fundamentalist]] movement known as the "Sons of Jacob" set off a Second Revolution by staging an attack that kills the President and most of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. They win the war and suspend the US Constitution under the pretext of restoring order. The new regime, known as the Republic of Gilead, moves quickly to consolidate its power and reorganize society along a new militarized, hierarchical regime of [[Old Testament]]-inspired social and religious fanaticism among its newly created social classes. In this society, human rights are severely limited and women's rights are even more curtailed; for example, women are forbidden to read or work normal jobs. The Republic of Gilead is quickly able to take away women's rights, largely attributed to financial records being stored electronically and labelled by gender.

===Television===
* American armed resistance to a fictional [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion in ''[[Amerika (miniseries)|Amerika]]'' was described by its supporters as a Second American Revolution.
* In ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' universe, the Office of Secret Intelligence (OSI) is said to have been established during or shortly after the Second American Revolution (the invisible one).

===Video games===
* The ''National Secessional Forces'' in the 2000 video game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' are stated to believe that they are fighting the Second American Revolution.

[[File:Old view moon.jpg|thumb|upright|"Lunar Day", from the book ''Recreations in Astronomy'' by H. D. Warren D. D., 1879. This represents a historical concept of the lunar surface appearance. Robotic missions to the Moon later showed that the surface features are much more rounded due to a long history of impacts.]]

'''Selenography''' is the study of the surface and physical features of the [[Moon]]. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar [[Lunar mare|maria]], [[Impact crater|crater]]s, mountain ranges, and other various features. This task was largely finished when high resolution images of the [[near side of the Moon|near]] and [[far side of the Moon|far]] sides of the Moon were obtained by orbiting spacecraft during the early space era. Nevertheless, some regions of the Moon remain poorly imaged (especially near the poles) and the exact locations of many features (like [[crater depth]]s) are uncertain by several kilometers. Today, selenography is considered to be a subdiscipline of [[selenology]], which itself is most often referred to as simply "lunar science." The word selenography is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] lunar deity Σελήνη ''[[Selene]]'' and [[wiktionary:γράφω|γράφω]] graphō, "I write".

== History ==
{{see also|Exploration of the Moon}}

The idea that the Moon is not perfectly smooth originates to at least ''circa'' 450 BC, when [[Democritus]] asserted that the Moon's "lofty mountains and hollow valleys" were the cause of its markings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=democritus+moon+valleys+and+mountains&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SPKVGK7dL0&amp;sig=clKAWfiJ7RJm6EJ0z3aN9hPNIr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2_qG1uejeAhVjRN8KHYSlBp8Q6AEwFHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=democritus%20moon%20valleys%20and%20mountains&amp;f=false|title=The Moon and the Condition and Configurations of Its Surface|last=Neison|first=Edmund|last2=Nevill|first2=Edmund Neville|date=1876|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not until the end of the 15th century AD did serious study of selenography began. ''Circa'' AD 1603, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] made the first lunar drawing based on naked-eye observation. Others soon followed, and when the [[telescope]] was invented, initial drawings of poor accuracy were made, but soon thereafter improved in tandem with [[optics]]. In the early 18th century, the [[libration]]s of the Moon were measured, which revealed that more than half of the lunar surface was visible to observers on Earth. In 1750, Johann Meyer produced the first reliable set of lunar [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] that permitted astronomers to locate lunar features. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Lunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter|Johann Schröter]] began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar [[topography]]. In 1834 [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]] published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published ''The Universal Selenography''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reese.org/duneroller/content/unexplained/Oddities/wax_honeymoon.htm Wax and the Honey Moon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070724101724/http://www.reese.org/duneroller/content/unexplained/Oddities/wax_honeymoon.htm |date=2007-07-24 }}; an account of Maedler's work and the creation of the first wax model of the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when [[J.W. Draper]], using a 5 inch reflector, produced a [[daguerreotype]] of the Moon and thus introduced photography to [[astronomy]]. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the [[telescope]] 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of [[astronomy]].

The 20th century witnessed more advances in selenography. In 1959, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft [[Luna 3]] transmitted the first photographs of the [[far side of the Moon]], giving the first view of it in history. The [[United States of America]] launched the [[Ranger program|Ranger]] spacecraft between 1961 and 1965 to photograph the lunar surface until the instant they impacted it, the [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]]s between 1966 and 1967 to photograph the Moon from orbit, and the [[Surveyor program|Surveyors]] between 1966 and 1968 to photograph and softly land on the lunar surface.  The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod]]s [[Lunokhod 1|1]] (1970) and [[Lunokhod 2|2]] (1973) traversed almost 50&amp;nbsp;km of the lunar surface, making detailed photographs of the lunar surface.  The [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] spacecraft obtained the first nearly global cartograph (map) of the lunar [[topography]], and also [[multispectral images]].  Successive missions transmitted photographs of increasing resolution.

The first serious denominations of the surface features of the Moon, based on telescopic observation, were made by [[Michael van Langren|Michel Florent van Langren]] in 1645. His work is considered the first true cartograph (map) of the Moon because it demarcated the various [[lunar mare|lunar maria]], [[Impact crater|crater]]s, and mountains and ranges. Many of his denominations were distinctly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], denominating craters in honor of Catholic [[Royal family|royalty]] and capes and promontories in honor of Catholic [[saint]]s. The lunar ''maria'' were denominated in [[Latin]] for terrestrial seas and oceans. Minor craters were denominated in honor of astronomers, mathematicians, and other famous scholars.[[File:Micrographia Schem 38.jpg|thumb|A study of the Moon from [[Robert Hooke|Robert Hooke's]] ''[[Micrographia]]'' of 1665]]

In 1647, [[Johannes Hevelius]] produced the rival work ''Selenographia'', which was the first lunar atlas. Hevelius ignored the nomenclature of Van Langren and instead denominated the lunar [[topography]] according to terrestrial features, such that the names of lunar features corresponded to the toponyms of their geographical terrestrial counterparts, especially as the latter were denominated by the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] civilizations. This work of Hevelius influenced his contemporary European astronomers, and the ''Selenographia'' was the standard reference on selenography for over a century.

[[Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], a [[Catholic priest]] and scholar who lived in northern [[Italy]] authored the present scheme of [[Latin]] lunar nomenclature. His ''Almagestum Novum'' was published in 1651 as a defense of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] views of the [[Counter Reformation]]. In particular he argued against the views espoused by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Copernicus]] of a heliocentric universe with perfectly circular orbits. ''Almagestum Novum'' contained scientific reference matter based on contemporary knowledge, and contemporary [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] educators widely used it. However, the only significant component of the work that is presently authoritative is his system of lunar nomenclature.

The lunar illustrations in the ''Almagestum Novum'' were drawn by a fellow [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] educator named [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi, SJ]]. The nomenclature was based on a subdivision of the visible lunar surface into octants that were numbered in Roman style from I to VIII. Octant I referenced the northwest section and subsequent octants proceeded clockwise in alignment with compass directions. Thus Octant VI was to the south and included [[Clavius (crater)|Clavius]] and [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho]] Craters.

The [[Latin]] nomenclature had 2 components: the first denominated the broad features of ''terrae'' (lands) and ''maria'' (seas) and the second denominated the craters. Riccioli authored lunar [[toponym]]s derived from the names of various conditions, including climactic ones, whose causes were historically attributed to the Moon. Thus there were the seas of crises ("Mare Crisium"), serenity ("Mare Serenitatis"), and fertility ("Mare Fecunditatis"). There were also the seas of rain ("Mare Imbrium"), clouds ("Mare Nubium"), and cold ("Mare Frigoris"). The topographical features between the ''maria'' were comparably denominated, but were opposite the [[toponym]]s of the ''maria''. Thus there were the lands of sterility ("Terra Sterilitatis"), heat ("Terra Caloris"), and life ("Terra Vitae"). However, these names for the highland regions were supplanted on later cartographs (maps). See [[List of features on the Moon#Terra]] for a complete list.

[[File:Schröter selenotopographische fragmente beispiel karten.png|thumb|upright|Samples of lunar maps in the ''Selenetopographische Fragmente'' by [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter]].]]
Many of the craters were denominated topically pursuant to the octant in which they were located. Craters in Octants I, II, and III were primarily denominated based on names from [[ancient Greece]], such as [[Plato]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], and [[Archimedes]]. Toward the middle in Octants IV, V, and VI craters were denominated based on names from the ancient [[Roman Empire]], such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], and [[Lucius Taruntius Firmanus|Taruntius]]. Toward the southern half of the lunar cartograph (map) craters were denominated in honor of scholars, writers, and [[philosophy|philosophers]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] and Arabic regions. The outer extremes of Octants V, VI, and VII, and all of Octant VIII were denominated in honor of contemporaries of [[Giambattista Riccioli]]. Features of Octant VIII were also denominated in honor of [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], and [[Galileo]]. These persons were "banished" to it far from the "ancients", as a gesture to the [[Catholic Church]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Many craters around the [[Mare Nectaris]] were denominated in honor of [[Catholic]] [[saint]]s pursuant to the nomenclature of Van Langren. All of them were, however, connected in some mode with [[astronomy]]. Later cartographs (maps) removed the "St." from their [[toponym]]s.

The lunar nomenclature of [[Giambattista Riccioli]] was widely used after the publication of his ''Almagestum Novum'', and many of its [[toponym]]s are presently used. The system was scientifically inclusive and was considered eloquent and poetic in style, and therefore it appealed widely to his contemporaries. It was also readily extensible with new [[toponym]]s for additional features. Thus it replaced the nomenclature of Van Langren and Hevelius.

Later astronomers and lunar cartographers augmented the nomenclature with additional [[toponym]]s. The most notable among these contributors was [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter|Johann H. Schröter]], who published a very detailed cartograph (map) of the Moon in 1791 titled the ''Selenotopografisches Fragmenten''. Schröter's adoption of [[Giambattista Riccioli|Riccioli's]] nomenclature perpetuated it as the universally standard lunar nomenclature. A vote of the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 1935 established the lunar nomenclature of [[Giambattista Riccioli|Riccioli]], which included 600 lunar [[toponym]]s, as universally official and doctrinal.

The IAU later expanded and updated the lunar nomenclature in the 1960s, but new [[toponym]]s were limited to [[toponym]]s honoring deceased scientists. After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft photographed the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the Moon, many of the newly discovered features were denominated in honor of Soviet scientists and engineers. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] assigned all subsequent new lunar [[toponym]]s. Some craters were [[List of lunar craters named for space explorers|denominated in honor of space explorers]].

===Satellite craters===
[[Johann Heinrich Mädler|Johann H. Mädler]] authored the nomenclature for satellite craters. The subsidiary craters surrounding a major crater were identified by a letter. These subsidiary craters were usually smaller than the crater with which they were associated, with some exceptions. The craters could be assigned letters "A" through "Z", with "I" omitted. Because the great majority of the [[toponym]]s of craters were masculine, the major craters were generically denominated "[[patronymic]]" craters.

The assignment of the letters to satellite craters was originally somewhat haphazard. Letters were typically assigned to craters in by order of significance rather than location. Precedence depended on the angle of illumination from the [[Sun]] at the time of the telescopic observation, which could change during the lunar day. In many cases the assignments were seemingly random. In a number of cases the satellite crater was located closer to a major crater with which it was not associated. To identify the patronymic crater, Mädler placed the identifying letter to the side of the midpoint of the feature that was closest to the associated major crater. This also had the advantage of permitting omission of the [[toponym]]s of the major craters from the cartographs (maps) when their subsidiary features were labelled.

Over time, lunar observers assigned many of the satellite craters an [[eponym]]. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) assumed authority to denominate lunar features in 1919. The commission for denominating these features formally adopted the convention of using capital Roman letters to identify craters and valleys.

When suitable cartographs (maps) of the far side of the Moon became available by 1966, Ewen A. Whitaker denominated satellite features based on the angle of their location relative to the major crater with which they were associated. A satellite crater located due north of the major crater was identified as "Z". The full 360° circle around the major crater was then subdivided evenly into 24 parts, like a 24-hour clock. Each "hour" angle, running clockwise, was assigned a letter, beginning with "A" at 1 o'clock. The letters "I" and "O" were omitted, resulting in only 24 letters. Thus a crater due south of its major crater was identified as "M".

[[Image:Replica of the Stone of Scone, Scone Palace, Scotland (8924541883).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Stone of Scone, Scone Palace]]
The '''Stone of Scone''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|uː|n}}; {{lang-gd|An Lia Fàil}}, {{lang-sco|Stane o Scuin}})—also known as the '''Stone of Destiny''', and often referred to in England as '''The Coronation Stone'''—is an oblong block of red [[sandstone]] that was used for centuries in the [[coronation]] of the [[monarchs of Scotland]], and later the [[monarchs of England]] and those [[List of British monarchs|of the United Kingdom]]. Historically, the artefact &lt;!-- "artefact" is correct NVOE; do not modify to foreign "artifact" --&gt; was kept at the now-ruined [[Scone Abbey]] in [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]], near [[Perth, Scotland]]. It is also known as [[Jacob's Pillow-Pillar Stone|Jacob's Pillow Stone]] and the [[Tanistry|Tanist]] Stone, and in Scottish Gaelic, ''clach-na-cinneamhain''. Its size is approximately {{convert|660|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|425|mm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|267|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} and its weight is approximately {{convert|152|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.

==Tradition and history==
[[File:Stone of Scone replica.jpg|thumb|Replica of the Stone of Scone at [[Scone Palace]]]]

===Origin and legends===
In the 14th century, the English cleric and historian [[Walter Hemingford]] described the previous location of the Scottish coronation stone as the [[Scone Abbey|monastery of Scone]], 3km north of Perth:
{{quote|{{lang|la|Apud Monasterium de Scone positus est lapis pergrandis in ecclesia Dei, juxta magnum altare, concavus quidem ad modum rotundae cathedrae confectus, in quo futuri reges loco quasi coronationis ponebantur ex more.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Skene |first=William Forbes |author-link=William Forbes Skene |year=1869 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=The Coronation Stone |volume= |edition= |publisher=Edmonston &amp; Douglas |publication-date=1869 |publication-place=Edinburgh |pages=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvwHAAAAQAAJ |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the monastery of Scone, in the church of God, near to the high altar, was placed a large stone, hollowed out as a round chair, on which future kings were placed for their coronation, according to custom.}}

Various theories and legends exist about the stone's history prior to its placement in Scone:

*One story concerns [[Fergus I|Fergus, son of Erc]], the first King of the Scots in Scotland, whose transport of the Stone from Ireland to Argyll, where he was crowned in it, was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Andree, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some versions identify the stone brought by Fergus with the [[Lia Fáil]] used at [[Tara, County Meath|Tara]] for the [[High King of Ireland]]. Other traditions contend the Lia Fáil remains at Tara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Danvers |first=Frederick Charles |title=The covenant; or, Jacob's heritage |publisher=William Henry Guest |year=1877 |pages=226–233 |url=https://archive.org/stream/covenantorjacob00danvgoog#page/n242/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrie|first=George|year=1839|title=On the History and Antiquities of Tara Hill|journal=The Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy:|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|volume=18|pages=159–162|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-30078991/30078991#page/n137/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Inis Fáil, The Island of Destiny, is one of the traditional names of Ireland.)
*Legends place the origins of the Stone in [[Bible|Biblical]] times and consider the Stone to be the [[Stone of Jacob]], taken by [[Jacob]] while in [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]], (Genesis 28:10–22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bible.org/seriespage/35-runaway-bribe-genesis-2810-22|title=Genesis 28:10-22|publisher=Bible.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologists proved that the stone taken by [[Edward I of England]] to Westminster&lt;ref&gt;'The Stone of Destiny: Symbol of Nationhood' by David Breeze and Graeme Munro&lt;/ref&gt; is a "lower [[Old Red Sandstone]]", which was quarried in the vicinity of Scone.&lt;ref&gt;John Prebble, ''The Lion in the North''&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts over the authenticity of the stone have existed for a long time: a [[blog]] post by retired Scottish academic and writer of historical fiction Marie MacPherson shows that they date back at least two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Marie MacPherson|title=The Stone of Destiny|url=http://englishhistoryauthors.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-stone-of-destiny.html|website=English Historical Fiction Authors|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=30 August 2014|date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter to the editor of the ''Morning Chronicle'', dated 2 January 1819, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the 19th of November, as the servants belonging to the West Mains of Dunsinane-house, were employed in carrying away stones from the excavation made among the ruins that point out the site of Macbeth's castle here, part of the ground they stood on suddenly gave way, and sank down about six feet, discovering a regularly built vault, about six feet long and four wide. None of the men being injured, curiosity induced them to clear out the subterranean recess, when they discovered among the ruins a large stone, weighing about 500lb [{{convert|500|lb|disp=output only}}], which is pronounced to be of the meteoric or semi-metallic kind. This stone must have lain here during the long series of ages since Macbeth's reign. Beside it were also found two round tablets, of a composition resembling bronze. On one of these two lines are engraved, which a gentleman has thus deciphered.— 'The sconce (or shadow) of kingdom come, until Sylphs in air carry me again to Bethel.' These plates exhibit the figures of targets for the arms. From time immemorial it has been believed among us here, that unseen hands brought Jacob's pillow from Bethel and dropped it on the site where the palace of Scoon now stands. A strong belief is also entertained by many in this part of the country that it was only a representation of this Jacob's pillow that Edward sent to Westminster, the sacred stone not having been found by him. The curious here, aware of such traditions, and who have viewed these venerable remains of antiquity, agree that Macbeth may, or rather must, have deposited the stone in question at the bottom of his Castle, on the hill of Dunsinane (from the trouble of the times), where it has been found by the workmen. This curious stone has been shipped for London for the inspection of the scientific amateur, in order to discover its real quality.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Westminster Abbey===
[[File:Coronation Chair and Stone of Scone.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of the Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey, 1855]]
In 1296, the stone was captured by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as [[Looting|spoils of war]] and taken to [[Westminster Abbey]], where it was fitted into a wooden chair—known as [[King Edward's Chair]]—on which most subsequent English and then British sovereigns have been crowned. Edward I sought to claim his status as the "Lord Paramount" of Scotland, with the right to oversee its King.&lt;ref&gt;Arundell, Brian, of Wardour Howard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfCHMBR7JkAC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Jacob%27s+Pillar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1wr7UvGcBMqT2QWgtYDwCA&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Gaels&amp;f=false ''Judah Scepter: A Historical and Religious Perspective''], iUnivers (2010) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doubt exists over the stone captured by Edward I. The [[Westminster Stone theory]] posits that the [[monk]]s at [[Scone Palace]] hid the real stone in the [[River Tay]], or buried it on [[Dunsinane Hill]], and that the English troops were tricked into taking a substitute. Some proponents of the theory claim that historic descriptions of the stone do not match the present stone.&lt;ref name=pillow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/salmond-stone-of-destiny-is-fake-1-1433959|title=Salmond: 'Stone of Destiny is fake'|publisher=|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton|The Treaty of Northampton]] 1328, between the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[Kingdom of England]], England agreed to return the captured stone to Scotland; riotous crowds prevented it from being removed from Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Christopher "Bannockburn 1314"&lt;/ref&gt; The stone remained in England for another six centuries, even after [[James VI of Scotland]] assumed the English throne as [[James I of England]]. For the next century, the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings and queens of Scotland once again sat on the stone but at their coronation as kings and queens of England.

===Removal and damage===
{{Main article|Removal of the Stone of Scone in 1950}}

On Christmas Day 1950, a group of four Scottish students ([[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]], [[Gavin Vernon]], Kay Matheson, and Alan Stuart) removed the stone from Westminster Abbey for return to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianhamiltonqc.com/blog/?p=269 |title=Blog Archive » Emotion Nationalism And The Brave-Heart Factor |publisher=Ian Hamilton Qc |date=20 January 2008 |accessdate=13 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712235747/http://www.ianhamiltonqc.com/blog/?p=269 |archive-date=12 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the removal process, the stone broke into two pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/25/scotland.britishidentity |title=Film on Stone of Destiny heist 'will end UK' |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Olga Craig |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny: I felt I was holding Scotland's soul |publisher=Telegraph |date=14 Dec 2008 |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After burying the greater part of the Stone in a [[Kent]] field, where they camped for a few days,&lt;ref name="Guardian 14Oct2008"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/14/heritage-scotland |title=The Caledonian job |last=Scott |first=Kirsty |work=The Guardian |date=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; they uncovered the buried stone and returned to Scotland, along with a new accomplice, John Josselyn. According to one US diplomat who was posted in Edinburgh at the time, the stone was hidden for a short time in a trunk in the basement of the Consulate's Public Affairs Officer, unknown to him, before it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adst.org/2014/09/scotland-a-land-apart/ |title=ADST Interview with FSO Robert Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although English, Josselyn, who was then a student at the [[University of Glasgow]], was a Scottish Nationalist.

The entire stone was passed to a senior [[Glasgow]] politician, who arranged for it to be professionally repaired by Glasgow [[stonemason]] [[Robert Gray (Scottish politician)|Robert Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scone-palace.co.uk/palace-grounds/stone-of-destiny|title=The Stone of Destiny|date=2013-07-12|work=Scone Palace Perthshire|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VXZDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7qQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3896%2C2940043 |title=Offer to repair Stone of Destiny |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=17 September 1974 |page=3 |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major search for the stone was ordered by the [[British Government]], but proved unsuccessful. The custodians left the stone on the altar of [[Arbroath Abbey]] on 11 April 1951, in the safekeeping of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Once the London police were informed of its whereabouts, the stone was returned to Westminster four months after it had been removed. Afterwards, rumours circulated that copies had been made of the stone,{{how|date=April 2017}} and that the returned stone was not the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Richard Blystone|title=Scotland's 'Stone of Scone' finds its way home|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/15/stone.of.scone/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=CNN|date=15 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sad"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Richard Halloran|title=The Sad, Dark End of the British Empire|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/the-sad-end-of-the-british-empire-110362_Page2.html#.VAGwX0v5lg0|website=Politico Magazine|accessdate=30 August 2014|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Scotland===
In 1996,&lt;ref name="Sad" /&gt; in a symbolic response to growing dissatisfaction among Scots at the prevailing constitutional settlement, the British Government decided that the stone should be kept in Scotland when not in use at coronations. On 3 July 1996, it was announced in the House of Commons that the stone would be returned to Scotland, and on 15 November 1996, after a handover ceremony at the border between representatives of the [[Home Office]] and of the [[Scottish Office]], it was transported to [[Edinburgh Castle]]. The stone arrived in the Castle on 30 November 1996, [[St Andrew's Day]], where the official handover ceremony occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/scotland-welcomes-the-new-stone-age-1312444.html |title=Scotland welcomes the new Stone age |first=Neal |last=Ascherson |authorlink=Neal Ascherson |work=[[The Independent on Sunday]] |date= 1 Dec 1996 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], representing Queen Elizabeth II, formally handed over the [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] transferring the stone into the safekeeping of the [[Honours of Scotland#Commissioners for the Safekeeping of the Regalia|Commissioners for the Regalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/index.php/20-lesser-known-facts-about-the-stone-of-destiny-20-facts-for-20-years |title=20 lesser known facts about the Stone of Destiny – 20 facts for 20 years! - Edinburgh Castle Blog |date=30 November 2016 |publisher= |accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonial of the day: {{Edinburgh Gazette|city=e |issue=24101 |pages=2861–2862 |date=29 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently remains alongside the crown jewels of Scotland, the [[Honours of Scotland]], in the Crown Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/discover/highlights/the-stone-of-destiny |title=The Stone Of Destiny |website= edinburghcastle.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bee and the Orange Tree''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].

==Synopsis==
After many childless years, a king and queen had a daughter, whom they named Aimée. Unfortunately, a ship she was on, wrecked. As fate would have it, she drifted ashore in her cradle.  There, an [[ogre]] couple found her, and the ogress resolved to raise Aimee, instead of eating her, resolving that the infant would make a good wife for her son when she grew up.  The ogress summoned a hind from the woods to nurse the baby.  After fifteen years, the king and queen gave up hope of locating the princess and the king told his brother to send his best son to be the heir to the throne.  The brother chose his second son.

Meanwhile, Aimee grew up among the ogres.  A little ogre had fallen in love with her, but the thought of marrying him revolted her.  She regularly walked along the shore after storms, to protect things swept ashore from the ogres, and one day she found a man.  She saved the man, who happened to be her cousin, although neither of them knew the truth or could speak each other's language.  She managed to make him understand that he had to hide in a cave.  After some time hiding and feeding him, she wished to show her friendship and gave him a locket she wore.  This had her name on it, and the prince deduced from her looks that she was indeed his cousin, the princess Aimee.

The little ogre decided it was time for them to marry, and horror-struck, Aimee fled to the prince.  When she returned, she injured her foot on a thorn and could no longer walk.  The prince wondered why she did not come, and when he tried to find her, he was captured.

Now, every night, the ogres all put on golden crowns before they went to bed.  The princess snuck in that night, took a crown from the head of a little ogre, and put it on the prince's head.  The ogre woke up, seized on the sleeping little ogre who no longer had a crown, and ate him.  Again the next night, the princess stole a crown from one of the ogres to place on the Prince's head.  This time, the ogress ate the crown-less ogre.

The princess remembered the magic wand that the ogress had used to summon the hind.  With it, she gave herself the power to speak the prince's language.  He told her who she was, and the princess decided to steal the ogres' camel so they could ride away to safety.  She used the wand to enchant a bean to hide their escape.  It spoke whenever the ogress asked anything.  Finally, however, the ogress realized they had fled.  The ogre used his [[seven-league boots]] to follow.

When the ogre caught up, the princess [[Shapeshifting|turned]] herself into a boatwoman, the prince into a boat, and the camel into a lake; to confuse the ogre.  He found nothing, but when he returned, the ogress told him how they had been transformed with her stolen magic wand, and so he set out to find them again.  This time Aimmee turned herself into a dwarf, the prince into a portrait, and the camel into a pillar.  When the ogre reached her, she told an elaborate story about how the prince had fought in a tournament in honor of the lady in the picture.  Confused again, the ogre returned home.

This time the ogress came after them.  The princess turned the prince into an orange tree, herself into a bee, and the camel into a box.  The princess stung the ogress and drove her off, but some travelers carried off the wand.  Without the wand, the Princess was unable to change the group back into their prior forms.

A princess, Linda, loved to walk in the woods where the orange tree stood.  Linda tried to have the tree transplanted into her gardens, Aimee stung Linda out of jealousy.  This caused the prince and princess to quarrel, but they soon reconciled.  When Linda tried again, Aimee stung her again.  Linda tried to arm herself with a branch, but when she did, blood flowed from the tree.  Aimee went to fetch a balm for the wound.

A fairy visited the princess and when she detected the enchantment, the fairy restored the prince.  He told his story, and she restored Aimee as well, and then brought them to her parents, where they married.

The book details the story of Pakistan [[cricket]]; how the game transformed from an urban, exclusive sport into a force uniting millions in a vast, disparate country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unquiet Ones: A History of Pakistan Cricket|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/9350298015/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=9350298015&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=newstatesmanc-21|website=amazon.co.uk|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has five sections which contain thirty-one essays, with each section covering distinct eras of varying lengths of time. Each section starts with a match that is used to define that era, and includes essays on a maximum two players who were similarly definitive. The ultimate section covers the last 22 years, from 1992 to early 2014.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite news|last1=Naqvi|first1=Ahmer|title=Telling Pakistan's story through its cricket|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/818807.html|accessdate=13 August 2017|work=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A reviewer for [[ESPNcricinfo]] stated that "this book on cricket comes across as one of the most authentic and authoritative depictions of what the country is actually like." He described it as a "superbly researched book", while criticizing "the complete absence of any discussion of the women's game." The reviewer rated the book 4.5/5, writing that the book is "highly recommended".&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

A reviewer for [[Wisden India]] called the book an "ode to Pakistan cricket". He further stated that "the 500-odd page tribute to Pakistan cricket is more than the sum of its research material – it’s no mere quizzer-goldmine". He adds that "the book deserved a bigger title to match its scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Shamya|title=An insider’s ‘jazba’ for Pakistan cricket|url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-article/insiders-jazba-pakistan-cricket/151943|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=[[Wisden India]]|date=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer for [[Express Tribune]] called the book "a triumph" while stating that "the research – let us call it scholarship – is immense".&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yusuf|first1=Imran|title=Book review: The Unquiet Ones - war and peace and reverse swing|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/818092/book-review-the-unquiet-ones-war-and-peace-and-reverse-swing/|accessdate=13 August 2017|work=[[Express Tribune]]|date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for [[DNA India]] praised the "extensive research". He further added that Samiuddin "keeps the reader glued to his book" while praising him metaphorically for "a well-crafted century on debut".&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krishnan|first1=G|title=Book Review: The Unquiet Ones- A History of Pakistan Cricket|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/review-book-review-the-unquiet-ones-a-history-of-pakistan-cricket-2059115|accessdate=13 August 2017|work=[[DNA India]]|date=8 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer for [[New Statesman]] calls the book "magnificent as stand-alone history of Pakistan cricket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wigmore|first1=Tim|title=Sporting chaos: the history – and future – of cricket in Pakistan|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2015/10/sporting-chaos-history-and-future-cricket-pakistan|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nadeem Farooq Paracha|Nadeem F. Paracha]], a cultural critic writing for [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] calls the book "a knowledgeable fan’s history of Pakistan cricket" and "a youthful celebration of a wildly impulsive cricketing culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paracha|first1=Nadeem F.|title=Pakistan cricket: Two books, one history|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1160432|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errors==
Some of the factual/typographical errors in the book surfaced so far are:
*The use of the past tense in the following sentence is wrong because at the time Minhas was alive and in his 80s. “Safdar Minhas was a tall, fast off-cutter…”&lt;ref name="ET"/&gt;
*The book says, "Australia fell from 305 for one to 310 all out" in the second innings of the 1979 Melbourne Test when in fact the Australian team slipped from 305 for three to 310 all out.&lt;ref name="DNA"/&gt;

[[File:KellsFol309r.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|The [[Book of Kells]], c. AD 800, is lettered in a script known as "insular majuscule", a variety of uncial script that originated in Ireland.]]
'''Uncial''' is a [[majuscule]]&lt;ref name=gl&gt;[[Geoffrey Glaister|Glaister, Geoffrey Ashall]]. (1996) ''Encyclopedia of the Book''. 2nd edn. New Castle, DE, and London: Oak Knoll Press &amp; [[The British Library]], p. 494. {{ISBN|1884718140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]] (written entirely in capital letters) commonly used from the 4th to 8th centuries AD by [[Latin]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] [[scribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Uncial letters were used to write [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Gothic language|Gothic]].

==Development==
[[File:Evolution of minuscule.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|Simplified relationship between various scripts, showing the development of Uncial from Roman and the Greek Uncial.]]
Early uncial script is likely to have developed from late [[Old Roman cursive]]. Early forms are characterized by broad single stroke [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s using simple round forms taking advantage of the new [[parchment]] and [[vellum parchment|vellum]] surfaces, as opposed to the angular, multiple stroke letters, which are more suited for rougher surfaces, such as [[papyrus]]. In the oldest examples of uncial, such as the fragment of ''[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|De bellis macedonicis]]''  in the [[British Library]], of the late 1st-early 2nd century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Papyrus_745 British Library Mss]&lt;/ref&gt; all of the letters are disconnected from one another, and word separation is typically not used. Word separation, however, is characteristic of later uncial usage.

As the script evolved over the centuries, the characters became more complex. Specifically, around AD 600, flourishes and exaggerations of the basic strokes began to appear in more manuscripts. [[Ascender (typography)|Ascenders]] and [[descender]]s were the first major alterations, followed by twists of the tool in the basic stroke and overlapping. By the time the more compact [[Lower case|minuscule]] scripts arose circa AD 800, some of the evolved uncial styles formed the basis for these simplified, smaller scripts. Uncial was still used, particularly for copies of the [[Bible]], tapering off until around the 10th century. There are over 500 surviving copies of uncial script, by far the largest number prior to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].

==Forms==
[[File:Codex bezae latin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A sample of the Latin text from the [[Codex Bezae]]]]

In general, there are some common features of uncial script:

* {{angle bracket|f}}, {{angle bracket|i}}, {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|t}} are relatively narrow.
* {{angle bracket|m}}, {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|u}} are relatively broad; {{angle bracket|m}} is formed with curved strokes (although a straight first stroke may indicate an early script), and {{angle bracket|n}} is written as {{angle bracket|ɴ}} to distinguish it from {{angle bracket|r}} and {{angle bracket|s}}.
* {{angle bracket|e}} is formed with a curved stroke, and its arm (or ''hasta'') does not connect with the top curve; the height of the arm can also indicate the age of the script (written in a high position, the script is probably early, while an arm written closer to the middle of the curve may indicate a later script).
* {{angle bracket|l}} has a small base, not extending to the right to connect with the next letter.
* {{angle bracket|r}} has a long, curved shoulder {{angle bracket|{{MUFI|&amp;#xA783;}}}}&lt;!--?--&gt;, often connecting with the next letter.
* {{angle bracket|s}} resembles (and is the ancestor of) the "[[long s]]" {{angle bracket|ſ}}; in uncial it {{angle bracket|{{MUFI|&amp;#xA785;}}}} looks more like {{angle bracket|r}} than {{angle bracket|f}}.

In later uncial scripts, the letters are sometimes drawn haphazardly; for example, {{angle bracket|ll}} runs together at the baseline, bows (for example in {{angle bracket|b}}, {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|r}}) do not entirely curve in to touch their stems, and the script is generally not written as cleanly as previously.

==National styles==
Due to its extremely widespread use, in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[North Africa in the Roman era|Africa]]n, [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italian]], [[France in the Middle Ages|French]], [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Spanish]], and "insular" ([[Early Christian Ireland|Irish]], [[Wales in the Early Middle Ages|British]] and [[England in the Early Middle Ages|English]]) centres, there were many slightly different styles in use:

*African (i.e. [[North Africa during the Classical Period|Roman North Africa]]n) uncial is more angular than other forms of uncial. In particular, the bow of the letter {{angbr|a}} is particularly sharp and pointed.
*Byzantine uncial has two unique features: "b-d uncial" uses forms of {{angbr|b}} and {{angbr|d}}, which are closer to half-uncial (see below), and was in use in the 4th and 5th centuries; "b-r" uncial, in use in the 5th and 6th centuries, has a form of {{angbr|b}} that is twice as large as the other letters, and an {{angbr|r}} with a bow resting on the baseline and the stem extending below the baseline.
*Italian uncial has round letters ({{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|o}} etc.) with flatter tops, and a with a sharp bow (as in African uncial), an almost horizontal rather than vertical stem in {{angbr|d}}, and forked finials (i.e., [[serif]]s in some letters such as {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|l}}, {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|s}}).
*Insular uncial (not to be confused with the separate [[insular script]]) generally has definite word separation, and accent marks over stressed syllables, probably because Irish scribes did not speak a language descended from Latin. They also use specifically Insular [[scribal abbreviation]]s not found in other uncial forms, use wedge-shaped [[finial]]s, connect a slightly subscript "pendant {{angbr|i}}" with {{angbr|m}} or {{angbr|h}} (when at the end of a word), and decorate the script with animals and dots ("Insular dotting", often in groups of three).
*French (that is, [[Merovingian]]) uncial uses thin descenders (in {{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|p}} etc.), an {{angbr|x}} with lines that cross higher than the middle, and a {{angbr|d}} with a curled stem (somewhat resembling an apple), and there are many decorations of fish, trees, and birds.
*{{Anchor|ustav|semi-ustav|poluustav}}[[Cyrillic]] manuscript developed from Greek uncial in the late ninth century (mostly replacing the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]), and was originally used to write the [[Old Church Slavonic]] liturgical language. The earlier form was called ''ustav'' (predominant in the 11–14th centuries), and later developed into ''semi-ustav'' script (or ''[[poluustav]]'', 15–16th centuries).

==Etymology==
[[File:Schriftzug Unziale.svg|thumb|upright=1.36|Calligraphic writing of the word "Unziale" in a modern uncial hand]]There is some doubt about the original meaning of the word. ''Uncial'' itself probably comes from [[St. Jerome]]'s preface to the [[Book of Job]], where it is found in the form ''uncialibus'', but it is possible that this is a misreading of ''inicialibus'' (though this makes little sense in the context), and Jerome may have been referring to the larger initial letters found at the beginning of paragraphs.
:''Habeant qui volunt veteres libros, vel in membranis purpureis auro argentoque descriptos, vel '''uncialibus''' ut vulgo aiunt litteris onera magis exarata quam codices.''
:"Let those who so desire have old books, or books written in gold and silver on [[purple parchment]], or burdens {rather than books} written in uncial letters, as they are popularly called."

In classical Latin ''uncialis'' could mean both "inch-high" and "weighing an ounce", and it is possible that Jerome was punning on this; he may conceivably also have been playing with the other meaning of ''codex'', "block of wood".

The term ''uncial'' in the sense of describing this script was first used by [[Jean Mabillon]] in the early 18th century. Thereafter his definition was refined by [[Scipione Maffei]], who used to refer to this script as distinct from [[Roman square capitals]].

==Other uses==
[[File:Codex sinaticus.jpg|thumb|A portion of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], in Byzantine uncial, containing [[Book of Esther|Esther]] 2:3–8.]]
The word, ''uncial'', is also sometimes used to refer to manuscripts that have been scribed in uncial, especially when differentiating from those penned with minuscule. Some of the most noteworthy Greek uncials are:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
*: — these being three of what are often called the four [[great uncial codices]]
* [[Codex Bezae]]
* [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus]]

The Petropolitanus is considered by some to contain optimum uncial style. It is also an example of how large the characters were getting.

For further details on these manuscripts, see Guglielmo Cavallo ''Ricerche sulla Maiuscola Biblica'' (Florence, 1967).

Modern [[calligraphy]] usually teaches a form of evolved Latin-based uncial hand that would probably be best compared to the later 7th to 10th century examples, though admittedly, the variations in Latin uncial are much wider and less rigid than Greek. Modern uncial has borrowed heavily from some of the conventions found in more [[cursive]] scripts, using flourishes, variable width strokes, and on occasion, even center axis tilt.

In a way comparable to the continued widespread use of the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s for written [[German language|German]] until well into the 20th century, [[Gaelic type|Gaelic]] letterforms, which are similar to uncial letterforms, were conventionally used for typography in [[Irish language|Irish]] until the 1950s. The script is still widely used in this way for titles of documents, inscriptions on monuments and other 'official' uses. Strictly speaking, the Gaelic script is [[Insular script|insular]], not uncial. Uncial Greek (commonly called "Byzantine lettering" by Greeks themselves) is commonly used by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and various institutions and individuals in [[Greece]] to this day. The Modern Greek State has also used uncial script on several occasions in official capacity (such as on seals, government documents etc.) as did many of the Greek provisional governments during the [[Revolution|Greek War of Independence]]. The height of uncial usage by the Modern Greek State was during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]], when even [[Greek Drachma]] coins had uncial lettering on them. Since the [[Metapolitefsi]], the Greek State has stopped using uncial script.

==Half-uncial==
The term ''half-uncial'' or ''semi-uncial'' was first deployed by Scipione Maffei, ''Istoria diplomatica'' (Mantua, 1727); he used it to distinguish what seemed like a cut-down version of uncial in the famous ''Codex Basilicanus'' of Hilary, which contains sections in each of the two types of script. The terminology was continued in the mid-18th century by [[René Prosper Tassin]] and [[Charles François Toustain]]. Despite the common and well-fixed usage, half-uncial is a poor name to the extent that it suggests some organic debt to regular uncial, though both types share features inherited from their ancient source.  See now:  L. E. Boyle, "'Basilicanus' of Hilary Revisited," in ''Integral Palaeography'', with an introduction by F. Troncarelli (Turnhout, 2001), 105-17.

Like uncial, half-uncial derived from Roman cursive, but now of a later, evolved type. It was first used around the 3rd century and remained in use until the end of the 8th century. The early forms of half-uncial were used for pagan authors and Roman legal writing, while in the 6th century the script came to be used in Africa and Europe (but not as often in insular centres) to transcribe Christian texts.

===Half-uncial forms===
Some general forms of half-uncial letters are:
* {{angbr|a}} is usually round {{angbr|ɑ}}, sometimes with a slightly open top
* {{angbr|b}} and {{angbr|d}} have vertical stems, identical to the modern letters
* {{angbr|g}} has a flat top, no bow, and a curved descender {{angbr|ᵹ}} (somewhat resembling the digit 5)
* {{angbr|t}} has a curved shaft {{angbr|ꞇ}}
* {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|r}} and {{angbr|s}} are similar to their uncial counterparts (with the same differences compared to modern letters)

Half-uncial was brought to Ireland in the 5th century, and was then carried to England. There, it was used up to the 8th century, and developed into the [[insular script]] after the 8th century.

{{Place of articulation}}
'''Velarization''' is a [[secondary articulation]] of [[consonant]]s by which the back of the [[tongue]] is raised toward the [[soft palate|velum]] during the articulation of the consonant.
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], velarization is transcribed by one of four diacritics:
#A [[tilde]] or [[swung dash]] through the letter {{unichar|0334|COMBINING TILDE OVERLAY|html=}} covers velarization, [[uvularization]] and [[pharyngealization]], as in {{IPA|[ɫ]}} (the velarized equivalent of {{IPA|[l]}})
#A [[superscript]] [[Latin gamma]] {{unichar|02E0|MODIFIER LETTER SMALL GAMMA|html=}} after the letter standing for the velarized consonant, as in {{angle bracket|{{IPA|tˠ}}}} (a velarized {{IPA|[t]}})
#To distinguish velarization from a velar fricative release, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ᵚ}}}} may be used instead of {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ˠ}}}}&lt;ref&gt;Vd. Tryon (1995) ''Comparative Austronesian Dictionary"&lt;/ref&gt;
#A superscript {{angle bracket|w}} {{unichar|02B7|MODIFIER LETTER SMALL W}} indicates either simultaneous velarization and [[labialization]], as in {{angle bracket|{{IPA|sʷ}}}} or {{angle bracket|{{IPA|pʷ}}}}, or labialization of a velar consonant, as in {{angle bracket|{{IPA|kʷ}}}}.
Although [[electropalatographic]] studies have shown that there is a continuum of possible degrees of velarization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2005|p=2}} citing
{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Fontdevila|Pallarès|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; the IPA does not specify any way to indicate degrees of velarization, as the difference has not been found to be contrastive in any language. However, the IPA convention of doubling diacritics to indicate a greater degree can be used: {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ˠˠ}}}}.

==Examples==

===English===
A common example of a velarized consonant  is the [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant]] (or "dark L"). In some accents of English, such as [[Received Pronunciation]], the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/l/}} has "dark" and "light" allophones: the "dark", velarized allophone appears in [[syllable coda]] position (e.g. in ''full''), while the "light", non-velarized allophone appears in [[syllable onset]] position (e.g. in ''lawn''). Other accents of English, such as [[Scottish English]], [[Australian English]], and [[General American|General American English]], have "dark L" in all positions.

===Velarized /l/===
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]] phonemically contrasts light ''l'' and dark ''ll''
* [[Catalan phonology|Catalan]] dialect and allophonic variance
* [[Portuguese phonology|Portuguese]] dialect and allophonic variance 
* [[Turkish phonology|Turkish]]
* [[Kurdish phonology|Kurdish]]
For many languages, velarization is generally associated with more dental articulations of coronal consonants so that dark l tends to be dental or dentoalveolar, and clear l tends to be retracted to an alveolar position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2005|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other velarized consonants===
*[[Danish language|Danish]] realizes /d/ in some environments as a velarized [ð].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dgcss.hum.ku.dk/aarsberetninger/2010/conference_proceedings_presentations/poster_sound_change_workshop_Barcelona_2010_N_Pharao.pdf|title=Word frequency and sound change in groups and individuals|last=Pharao|first=Nicolai|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Irish language|Irish]] has velarized consonants that systematically contrast with palatalized consonants.
*[[Scottish Gaelic]] has a three-way contrast in [[nasal consonant|nasals]] and [[lateral consonant|laterals]] between {{IPA|[n ~ n̪ˠ ~ ɲ]}} and {{IPA|[l ~ l̪ˠ ~ ʎ]}}&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Michael. ''Blas na Gàidhlig: The Practical Guide to Gaelic Pronunciation.'' Glasgow: Akerbeltz, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] has three velarized consonants ({{IPA|/ɫ/}}, {{IPA|/sˠ/}} and {{IPA|/zˠ/}}) which contrast with plain ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Fattah|first= Ismaïl Kamandâr|year= 2000|title= Les dialectes Kurdes méridionaux|publisher= Acta Iranica |isbn= 9042909188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=McCarus|first=Ernest N. |year= 1958|title=—A Kurdish Grammar|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED089545.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palatalized/velarized contrast is known by other names, especially in language pedagogy: in Irish language teaching, the terms '''slender''' (for palatalized) and '''broad''' (for velarized) are often used. The terms '''light''' or '''clear''' (for non-velarized or palatalized) and '''dark''' (for velarized) are also widespread. The terms "'''soft''' ''l''" and "'''hard''' ''l''" are not equivalent to "light ''l''" and "dark ''l''". The former pair refers to [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] ("soft" or [[iotation|iotated]]) and plain ("hard") [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] consonants.

The '''war against the potato beetle''' was a campaign launched in [[Warsaw Pact]] countries during the [[Cold War]] to eradicate the [[Colorado potato beetle]] (''Leptinotarsa decemlineata''). It was also a [[Eastern Bloc information dissemination|propaganda operation]] that alleged that the insect was introduced into [[East Germany]], the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] by the [[United States]] as a form of [[entomological warfare]]. Communist propaganda of the time claimed that the insect was being dropped from parachutes and balloons, with the intent of immiserating the populations of these countries, causing famines, and facilitating an economic crisis.&lt;ref name="war136"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=pMctyFo34E8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Six-Legged+Soldiers:+Using+Insects+as+Weapons+of+War#v=onepage&amp;q=Six-Legged%20Soldiers%3A%20Using%20Insects%20as%20Weapons%20of%20War&amp;f=false|title=Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lockwood, Jeffrey A. | year=2008 | pages=136 | isbn=0199743886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The beetle==
[[Image:kartoffelkaefer fg01e.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Native ranges of the Colorado beetle and the potato]]

The Colorado potato beetle, also known as the "''ten striped spearman''", is a common pest of potato crops. It is most likely native to the area between [[Colorado]] and northern [[Mexico]], and was discovered in 1824 by [[Thomas Say]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Since the mid-nineteenth century, it has been one of the most destructive pests of the cultivated potato. The insect made its way to [[Germany]] in the 1870s but was successfully eradicated. However, it made a second appearance after [[World War I]] in the [[Bordeaux]] area in [[France]], where it probably arrived with American troops and equipment.&lt;ref name="war407"&gt;{{cite book | title=Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lockwood, Jeffrey A. | year=2008 | pages=407 | isbn=0199743886}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached the French border with Germany by 1936 and continued spreading eastward.&lt;ref name="soviet"/&gt; It was probably transferred to Czechoslovakia with the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] after the [[Munich agreement]] and to Poland after the [[Nazi invasion of Poland|Nazi invasion]] in 1939.

The most common method of dealing with the pest is through the use of pesticides. [[DDT]] was effectively used until the bug developed resistance by the 1950s. Subsequently, other insecticides were employed but these eventually ran into a similar problem.

==Before the Cold War==

While later Cold War-era allegations were propaganda, the idea of using the beetle for purposes of warfare had factual origins. During World War I, the French did actually draft plans for using the potato beetle against the Germans and in turn, during [[World War II]], Germany worked on developing an insect army of its own, while simultaneously alleging that such a program was being carried out by the United States and the British.&lt;ref name="soviet"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=6iSg3YKhzikC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Soviet+Biological+Weapons+Program#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Soviet%20Biological%20Weapons%20Program&amp;f=false | title=The Soviet Biological Weapons Program: a history | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Leitenberg, M.| author2=Zilinskas, R. A.| author3=Kuhn, J. H.| year=2012 | pages=408 | isbn=0674065263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Cold War==

===Soviet Union===
The Colorado beetle crossed the borders of the Soviet Union in 1949, but Soviet authorities were able to quickly eradicate it, and strict quarantine restrictions managed to prevent its spread, but only until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Insect Pests of Potato: Global Perspectives on Biology and Management
 edited by Andrei Alyokhin, Charles Vincent, Philippe Giordanengo page 14&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the beetle spread widely across USSR, greatly affecting potato crops on the collective farms and small individual plots. The latter were affected especially severely, since in USSR the  private small farmers and gardeners lacked access to officially distributed effective pesticides, so the beetle, their eggs, and larvae often had to be collected by hand - often a chore assigned to children.

===German Democratic Republic===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-15032-0001, Vahldorf, Gesammelte Kartoffelkäfer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|East German [[Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]] during the ''War against the potato beetle''. The boy on the left, Bodo, [[Udarnik|set a record]] for most beetles collected in one day, 2000. The girl on the right, Magdalena, managed 800 specimens.]]
After World War II, nearly half of all potato fields in the Soviet-occupied zone were infested by the beetle by 1950. 
In East Germany in the 1950s, the insect came to be known as ''"Amikäfer"'', a neologism for ''"Amerikanischer Käfer"'' (the "American beetle"). Propaganda posters were issued that depicted the beetle marching across Germany, with its yellow and black stripes replaced by red and white ones with white stars on a blue background on the [[thorax]].&lt;ref name="war136"/&gt; Other posters showed the beetle being dropped from American planes with the caption ''"Kampf für den Frieden"'' ("The battle for peace"). A letter was issued to "the people of the world", stating that "the beetles are smaller than the [[atomic bomb]]... but they are also a weapon of the US imperialists in the fight against the peace-loving workers and peasants of East Germany." Children's books on the beetle were also published and ''"Sondersuchtage"'' ("Special Search Days") were organized in which everyone from young children to the elderly was expected to come out and gather the pests for destruction.&lt;ref name="kartoffel"/&gt;

The communist authorities were aware, however, that the presence of the potato beetle on socialist German soil was not an American plot. An internal report of the East German Ministry of Agriculture attributed the increase in the number of pests after the war to the favorable climate and the straightforward migration of the insect from the west.&lt;ref name="kartoffel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.widdershausen.de/kartoffelkafer.html | title=Kartoffelkäfer | publisher=Chronik und Dorfbuch Widdershausen | work=Landwirtschaft | accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of Poland===
In Poland, the war against the potato beetle (''stonka'') began in the second half of the 1940s. Articles on the plague appeared in major newspapers and farmers' magazines such as ''Przysposobienie Rolnicze i Wojskowe'' ("Agricultural and Military Almanac"). The official organ of the ruling communist [[Polish United Workers' Party]] ''[[Trybuna Ludu]]'' ("People's Tribune") reported that after being dropped on the [[Baltic Sea]] by American planes, the beetle emerged onto land and began to wage "sabotage and diversionary actions aimed at socialist Poland". As a result, the communist government declared a "merciless war against the beetle". A ''Naczelny Nadzwyczajny Komisarz'' ("General Special Commissar") was appointed to oversee the assault on the beetles, the country was divided into strategic sectors, and battle maps indicating enemy positions were drawn up. Simultaneously, instructions were issued to farmers describing simple and effective ways of eradicating the pest if pesticides were not available; for instance drowning specimens in water with a small admixture of [[kerosene]]. Even Poland's socialist poets joined the struggle, exemplified by [[Maria Kownacka]]'s poem ''Alarm'', which instructs farmers to "protect the potatoes!!!" and tells either the beetle or the imperialists that "we will not let ourselves to be starved!!!" (exclamation marks in original).&lt;ref name="desant"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.farmer.pl/biznes/doradztwo/edukacja-i-szkolenia/desant-stonki,725.html | title=Desant stonki | publisher=Farmer.pl Portal  Nowoczesnego Rolnika | work=Edukacja i szkolenie. | date=29 November 2006 | accessdate=22 October 2013 | author=Daszkiewicz, Alicja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Polish newsreel from 1950, ''"Walka z stonką"'' ("The struggle against the beetle"), claimed that "the progressive opinion of the world has rightfully condemned the crimes of the American pilots who dropped tremendous amounts of the potato beetle on the fields of the German Democratic Republic... from where the beetle invaded Polish territory". The news report went on to describe the campaign launched by the Polish Ministry of Agriculture to eradicate the pest through the use of DDT (''Azotox'' in its Soviet bloc version), vigilance on Poland's Baltic coast, engagement of the [[Polish Air Force]], and the general mobilization of society, particularly the youth. The newsreel concluded that "the American pest will be unsuccessful both in Poland and Germany. The warmongers' provocation will crash and burn. Everyone to war against the beetle!"&lt;ref name="pkf"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.kronikarp.pl/szukaj,10890 | title=Walka z stonka (War against the beetle) | publisher=Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych | year=1950 | medium=Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1951 book published by the Polish Ministry of Defense, Zofia Kowalska wrote that American planes dropped beetles, "violating sovereign airspace", on the night of 24 May in East Germany, in the [[Zwickauer Land]] of Saxony.&lt;ref name="kowalska"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stonka ziemniaczana | publisher=Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej (Ministry of National Defense, Poland) | author=Kowalska, Zofia | year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poland, the propaganda campaign associated with the beetle ended by the beginning of the 1960s.

===Western response===
In response to the allegations issued by the Soviet bloc countries' governments, the US issued tepid denials.&lt;ref name="kartoffel"/&gt; In August 1950, at the suggestion of the [[CIA]], the [[West Germany|West German]] authorities printed postcard-sized cardboard replicas of the potato beetle and stamped these with political slogans and the letter "F" for ''"Freiheit"'' ("Freedom"). A number of these were sent to all the municipal governments in East Germany and the rest dropped from a balloon over East German territory as a joke.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/kalter_krieg/brosch_04.htm | title=Politische Broschüren im Kalten Krieg | publisher=Deutsches historisches Museum | work="SBZ von A-Z"  -  gesamtdeutsche Broschüren? | accessdate=22 October 2013 | author=Körner, Klaus | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
In the European Union, the beetle remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in any of these member states, although occasional infestations occur, as in Finland in the summer of 2011, when strong winds blew from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5401253 Koloradonkuoriainen hyppyyttää tarkastajia perunapelloilla] YLE news {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=anFVftxuYboC&amp;pg=PA101 | title = Schauplätze und Themen der Umweltgeschichte : Umwelthistorische Miszellen aus dem Graduiertenkolleg | isbn = 9783941875234 | author1 = Herrmann | first1 = Bernd | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mycenae]]an '''Warrior Vase''', found by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] on the [[acropolis]] of [[Mycenae]], is one of the prominent treasures of the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.varchive.org/schorr/warvase.htm The Warrior Vase]&lt;/ref&gt; The Warrior Vase, dated to the 13th century BCE, is probably the best-known piece of [[Late Helladic]] pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Early Late Helladic III C.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[krater]], a mixing bowl used for the dilution of wine with water, a custom which the [[ancient Greeks]] believed to be a sign of civilized behavior.

The broad frieze of armed soldiers on the vase, which is incomplete, suggested the name that Schliemann gave it. The warriors are clad in short [[Chiton (costume)|chitons]], [[breastplate]]s, helmets and [[greave]]s; they are armed with spears and carry shields. The bull's head handles for long encouraged scholars to date the piece later, in the early seventh century BCE.

Many Scholars observe that the style of the figures and the bull head handles of this thirteenth century BCE vase are very similar to eighth century BCE pottery. Similar spearmen are also depicted in eighth century BCE pottery which introduces a curious 500-year gap in styles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This vase also leads to clues about post-palatial Mycenaean warriors. The knapsacks the warriors carry suggest that they may have to travel long distances to battle. Figures on one side of the vase wear helmets with horns. The other side depicts warriors in "hedgehog" style helmets. The latter is equipped with spears that are shorter than general spears depicted of the time. The warriors on both sides have shields, tunics, and leg protection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The warriors on either side appear to be uniform suggesting the army as a whole and not representing individual warriors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Winged sun sharpe.png|thumb|250px|"Winged Sun of Thebes" (from ''Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity'' by Samuel Sharpe, 1863)]]
The '''winged sun''' is a symbol associated with [[divinity]], [[Royal family|royalty]] and power in the [[Ancient Near East]] ([[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Anatolia]], and [[Persia]]).

== Ancient Egypt ==
In ancient Egypt, the symbol is attested from the [[Old Kingdom]] ([[Sneferu]], 26th century BC {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}), often flanked on either side with a [[uraeus]].
In early Egyptian religion, the symbol Behedeti represented [[Horus]] of [[Edfu]], later identified with [[Ra-Harachte]]. It is sometimes depicted on the neck of [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]], the bull of [[Ptah]].  As time passed (according to interpretation) all of the subordinated gods of Egypt were considered to be aspects of the sun god, including e.g. [[Khepri]].

== Mesopotamia and the Levant ==
[[File:Nimrud stele winged sun.jpg|thumb|200px|Stele to [[Assurnasiripal II]] at [[Nimrud]] (9th century BC), detail showing the winged sun.]]

From roughly 2000 BC, the symbol also appears in the [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Asia Minor]]. It appears in reliefs with [[Assyria]]n rulers and in [[Hieroglyphic Luwian|Hieroglyphic Anatolian]] as a symbol for royalty, transcribed into [[Latin]] as SOL SUUS (literally, "his own self, the Sun", i.e., "His Majesty").

== Hebrew ==
From ca. the 8th century BC, the winged solar disk appears on [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] seals connected to the royal house of the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Many of these are seals and jar handles from [[Hezekiah]]'s reign, together with the inscription ''l'melekh'' ("belonging to the king").&lt;ref name=Deutsch2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=Robert|title=Lasting Impressions: New bullae reveal Egyptian-style emblems on Judah’s royal seals|journal=Biblical Archaeology Review|date=July–August 2002|volume=28|issue=4|pages=42–51|url=http://www.archaeological-center.com/en/monographs/m13/|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, Hezekiah's royal seals feature two downward-pointing wings and six rays emanating from the central sun disk, and some are flanked on either side with the Egyptian [[ankh]] ("key of life") symbol.&lt;ref name=Deutsch2002 /&gt; Prior to this, there are examples from the seals of servants of king [[Ahaz]] and of king [[Uzziah]].&lt;ref name=Sarlo2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarlo|first1=Daniel|title=Winged Scarab Imagery in Judah: Yahweh as Khepri|journal=Eastern Great Lakes Biblical Society Annual Meeting, Erie, PA|date=2014|url=https://www.academia.edu/5562359/Winged_Scarab_Imagery_in_Judah_Yahweh_as_Khepri|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare also [[Malachi]] 4:2, referring to a winged "Sun of righteousness",
:''But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings...'' ([[KJV]])

== Zoroastrianism ==
[[File:Persepolis Bas-Relief.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Faravahar]] in the [[Persepolis]]. Also a small winged sun is below of it, click on the image to see.]]
The symbol evolved into the  [[Faravahar]] (the "visual aspect of [[Ahura Mazda]]") in [[Zoroastrian]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]].

==Greece==
The winged sun is conventionally depicted as the knob of the [[Staff of Hermes]].

==Modern use==
[[File:Winged Sun alchemical.jpg|thumb|200px|As an [[alchemical symbol]]: a winged sun hovers over a sepulchre filled with water (from ''[[Rosary of the Philosophers]]'').]]
The symbol was used on the cover of [[Charles Taze Russell]]'s textbook series ''[[Studies in the Scriptures]]'' beginning with the  1911 editions. Various groups such as [[Freemasonry]],  [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Thelema]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Unity Church]] have also used it.  Variations of the symbol are used as a trademark logo on vehicles produced by the [[Chrysler]] Corporation, and [[Harley Davidson]].

==Heraldic use==
A winged sun is used in the heraldry of the North America Trade Directory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamerica-trade.com/heraldic.htm Heraldic information of the North America Trade Directory] (retrieved November 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur''''' (commonly abbreviated '''''ZfdA''''') is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in the field of [[German studies]] with emphasis on the older periods. It was established in 1841 and is the oldest periodical in early [[Germanic studies]] still publishing.

== History ==
The journal was established in 1841 by [[Moriz Haupt]] as the ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthum'' (older spelling) with the objective of applying the same rigour to the [[philology]] and textual criticism of medieval German texts as was already current with Greek and Latin.&lt;ref name=Meves/&gt;

With volume 13 (1867) the ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthum'' began a new series ({{lang-de|Neue Folge}}).&lt;ref name=Chron163&gt;[[Kurt Ruh]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20655699 "Kleine Chronik der Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur"], ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur'' 100 (1971) 163–65, p. 163 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, with volume 19 (New Series 7) its name was changed to the present ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur'' and a supplement, the ''Anzeiger'', began publication as a journal of reviews;&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Josef Worstbrock]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20657952 "Mitteilung des Herausgebers"], ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur'' 119 (1990) 1&amp;ndash;3, p. 1 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; this sometimes overshadowed the parent journal.&lt;ref name=Chron164&gt;Ruh, "Chronik", p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal has appeared in quarterly issues since 1931. It was originally published by the [[Weidmannsche Buchhandlung]], first in [[Leipzig]], from 1856 in [[Berlin]]. With the third issue of volume 82 (1948/50), [[Franz Steiner Verlag]] took over publication.&lt;ref name=Chron165&gt;Ruh, "Chronik", p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The current publisher is [[S. Hirzel Verlag]].

Since volume 140 (2011) the [[editor-in-chief]] has been [[Jürgen Wolf]] ([[University of Marburg]]).&lt;ref name=Heinzle&gt;[[Joachim Heinzle]], "Mitteilung des Herausgebers", ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur'' 139 (2010), p. 417 {{de icon}} ([http://www.zfda.de/download/mitteilung.pdf pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editorial philosophy ==
Haupt wrote a statement of purpose in the first issue in which he set out the journal's range: "the literature, language, customs, legal history [and] belief of German antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;"die literatur, die sprache, die sitten, die rechtsalterthümer, der glauben der deutschen vorzeit": cited in Kurt Ruh, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20655669 "Zum hundertsten Jahrgang der Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur"], ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur'' 100 (1971) 1&amp;ndash;3, p. 1 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major focus from the beginning was publishing editions of [[Old High German|Old]] and [[Middle High German]] works, which were presented for the most part for an academic readership, without explanatory material.&lt;ref name=Meves&gt;Uwe Meves, "Die Entstehung und frühe Entwicklung der Germanischen Philologie", in ''History of the language sciences: an international handbook on the evolution of the study of language from the beginning to the present/Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaften: ein internationales Handbuch zur Entwicklung der Sprachforschung von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart/Histoire des sciences du langage: manuel international sur l'évolution de l'étude du langage des origines à nos jours'', ed. Sylvain Auroux ''et al''., Volume 2, Handbücher zur Sprache- und Kommunikationswissenschaft 18.2, Berlin: de Gruyter, 2001, {{ISBN|9783110167351}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;1286&amp;ndash;93, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DI6hb3x_eY4C&amp;pg=PA1260&amp;dq=Zeitschrift+f%C3%BCr+deutsches+Altertum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OMdWUoGoNYS-igL2_4CYBA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20deutsches%20Altertum&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;1260]{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal "quickly became the most important academic forum for the 'Berlin school'".&lt;ref&gt;Nottscheid, Müller and Richter: "... die schnell zum wichtigsten wissenschaftlichen Forum der 'Berliner Schule' avancierte".&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the narrowness of its approach, a quarterly named ''[[Germania: Vierteljahrsschrift für deutsche Altertumskunde|Germania]]'' was founded by [[Franz Pfeiffer]] in 1856, with the objective of reflecting the broader approach of [[Jacob Grimm]] and of classical philology and of therefore laying a greater emphasis on articles than editions. The foundation of the ''[[Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie]]'' in 1868 was also a reaction to the ''ZfdA'''s restricted focus, in its case intended to supplement it.&lt;ref name=Meves/&gt; For at least a century, this emphasis on philology and relatively few changes of editor left the ''Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur'' largely untouched by changes in opinion in the field. Until the end of World War II, the editor was traditionally the Chairman of the Faculty of ''Germanistik'' at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. It was a relatively impersonal publication, sometimes accused of arrogance, and did not even include death notices for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Ruh, "Zum hundertsten Jahrgang", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
