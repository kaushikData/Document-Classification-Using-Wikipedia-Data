[[File:Ariel's pict.jpg|thumb|Ariel Bybee, Mezzo Soprano]]

Bybee received a bachelor's degree from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1965. She later took advanced musical studies in New York where one of her voice teachers was [[Cornelius L. Reid]].

Bybee was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and has soloed with the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir|Tabernacle Choir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldsfilm.com/bio/bioB4.html ldsfilm bios]&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2001 dedication of the [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska Temple]] Bybee sang a solo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/39817/Newest-temple-stands-on-sanctified-soil.html "Newest temple stands on sanctified soil",] ''[[Church News]]'', April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}
Bybee sang at the Met in every season from 1977-95. She first earned accolades at the Met for her performance as Jenny in ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]'' when she replaced [[Teresa Stratas]] on very short notice. Further acclaim came from her performances as Annio in the Met's premiere of Mozart's ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]''.

Bybee has sung numerous leading roles at the Met including Hansel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', Niclausse in ''[[Les contes d'Hoffmann]]'' and Suzuki in ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. She made her highly successful debut at the Washington, D.C. Opera in a new production of Menotti's ''[[The Consul]]'' and her European opera debut as [[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Melisande]] at the Sofia Music Weeks in Bulgaria. She made her debut with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] ([[Lorin Maazel]], conducting) in a concert performance of ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]].

Bybee's professional talents were discovered by Maestro [[Maurice Abravanel]] of the Utah Symphony and later by [[Kurt Herbert Adler]] of the [[San Francisco Opera]]. Adler invited Bybee to sing in San Francisco for several seasons, during which she appeared in many roles, including the title roles in ''[[Carmen]]'', Musetta in ''[[La bohème]]'' and Inez in ''[[La favorita]]''. 

She first performed on the East Coast when she sang the title role of Monteverdi's ''[[Coronation of Poppea]]'' at the [[Tanglewood Music Festival]]. In the spring of 1985, Bybee appeared on stage with the [[New York City Ballet]] in its production of ''[[Songs of the Auvergne]]'', and she debuted at the [[Ravinia Festival]] in ''Elektra'' conducted by [[James Levine]]. She made her debut in Kuhmo, Finland in [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]]'s ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' and [[Vivaldi]]'s ''Gloria''.

==Teaching history and voice==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}
Before making her debut with the [[San Francisco Opera Company]], Bybee taught junior high school music for five years, first in Utah and then in California. 

Starting in 1993, Bybee began teaching private students in her New York studio, as well as teaching both at the [[Lee Strasberg Institute]] and the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]] in New York City. 

For ten years, she was Artist-in-Residence and Associate Professor of Voice at the [[University of Nebraska, Lincoln]], teaching voice and directing operatic productions. In 2007, her UNL production of Frank Loesser's ''The Most Happy Fella'' won the International Trophy (Grand Prize) in competition at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera. 

When she became an emerita professor at UNL, the university endowed the Ariel Bybee Chair of Opera Performance in her honor. In 2008, Bybee moved to the Salt Lake City area where she taught voice at the [[University of Utah]].

==Recordings==
Bybee can be heard in [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s 1983 motion picture of ''[[La traviata]]'', singing the role of Flora. As well as being heard on numerous ''[[Live from Lincoln Center]]'' telecasts, Bybee has recorded two solo albums: ''O Divine Redeemer'' and ''Eternal Day''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Personal life==
From 1972-96, she was married to John Neylan McBaine. They divorced in the latter year. Bybee was married to James E. Ford, a professor of English, in 1998. Ford was at the [[University of Nebraska, Lincoln]], which is what prompted her to join the faculty there. She and Ford first had met and dated when they were both teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/deseretnews/obituary.aspx?n=ariel-bybee&amp;pid=188547980&amp;fhid=13417 ''Deseret News'' bio of Bybee], legacy.com; accessed April 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; She has a daughter, [[Neylan McBaine]], and three grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014278/sione-pouha-mormon-slash-anchored-to-family-faith.html Profile], deseretnews.com, March 29, 2018; accessed April 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bybee proactively used her musical skill to advance the goals of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] of which she was a member. She often performed at the [[Washington DC Temple]] Visitors Center, especially at events where Ambassadors were invited. She performed several solos with the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

A '''Bachelor of Science in Information Technology''', (abbreviated '''BSIT''' or '''B.Sc IT'''), is a [[Bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course or program in the [[Information technology]] field. The degree is normally required in order to work in the Information technology industry. 
 
A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree program typically takes three to four years depending on the country. This degree is primarily focused on subjects such as software, databases, and networking. In general, computer science degrees tend to focus on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing rather than emphasizing specific technologies. The degree is a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science degree]] with institutions conferring degrees in the fields of information technology and related fields. This degree is awarded for completing a program of study in the field of [[software development]], [[software testing]], [[software engineering]], [[web design]], [[databases]], [[Computer programming|programming]], [[computer networking]] and [[computer systems]].

Graduates with an information technology background are able to perform technology tasks relating to the processing, storing, and communication of information between computers, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. Information technology as a field emphasizes the secure management of large amounts of variable information and its accessibility via a wide variety of systems both local and worldwide.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Computer-and-Information-Technology/Network-and-computer-systems-administrators.htm|title = Network and Computer Systems Administrators|date = 2012-03-29|accessdate = 2013-12-01|website = Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher = United States Bureau of Labor Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills taught==
Generally, software and information technology companies look for people who have strong programming skills, system analysis, and software testing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm|title = Computer and Inform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colleges teach practical skills that are crucial to becoming a software developer. As logical reasoning and critical thinking are important in becoming a software professional, this degree encompasses the complete process of software development from software design and development to final testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://view.fdu.edu/default.aspx?id=3815 Bachelor of Science in Information Technology :: Fairleigh Dickinson University].

The '''Bangladesh Nazrul Sena''' (''Bangladesh Nazrul Army'') is an [[NGO]], public service organization working for the education, health and upliftment of children, adolescents and young adults in [[Bangladesh]]. It is named after famous [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[poet]], [[writer]] and [[musician]] [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], whose philosophy has inspired the purpose and mission of the organization.

==Foundation==
The Bangladesh Nazrul Sena was founded in 1964 in Bangladesh (then [[East Pakistan]]). Its activities were curtailed during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], but began rapidly growing following the independence of Bangladesh. It was inspired by the philosophy of Kazi Nazrul Islam, who is regarded as the "[[national poet]]" of Bangladesh. The organization seeks to combat child abuse, injustice and discrimination of children and young people based on socio-economic background, religion, poverty, birth, sex, health and handicaps.

==Activities==
Governed by a central committee of trustees and board members, the Bangladesh Nazrul Sena has 35 branches and chapters across Bangladesh, through which it sponsors initiatives and programmes for healthcare and education for Bangladeshi youth. It works with public schools, kindergarten schools and orphanages to provide care and support for the development of children and young adults. The organization also supports many volunteer activities and programmes.

==Nazrul Sena School==
The organization has also established the Nazrul Sena School, which is a well-known kindergarten school in [[Mymensingh]]. It was established in 1990, and is directly monitored by Bangladesh Nazrul Sena. G. E. M. Faruque, a key official of the organization, is the founder and the current principal of the school. [[Nazrul Sena school]] has more than 200 students, 18 full-time teachers and 5 other staff members. Students of the school are always busy with their education and also involved in cultural activities like music, dance, drawing, sports, debating, speech and other social activities. The school started education using multimedia computer software for the first time in Myemsingh and amongst the first in Bangladesh. Every year the school arranges picnics, study tours, annual sports, cultural competitions, annual prize-giving ceremony. Every year, the students organize a ''Multimedia Computer Show''. In the fair, the students exhibit how much they learn from computer multimedia software.

'''Bathroom reading''' is the act of [[Reading (process)|reading]] text while in a [[bathroom]], usually while sitting on the [[toilet]] and [[Defecation|defecating]]. The practice has been common throughout history and remains widespread today with both printed material and [[smartphone]]s.

==History==
Bathroom reading has been commonplace throughout history. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Thermae|bath houses]] often contained libraries with scrolls for reading.&lt;ref name="Alford"&gt;{{Cite newspaper
| url          = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/books/review/23alford.html

The advent of the [[smartphone]] is believed to have significantly increased bathroom reading. A 2009 study conducted in Israel found that a majority of adults read from their smartphones on the toilet, and a 2015 study conducted by [[Verizon]] found that 90% of cell phone users admitted to reading from their phones while on the toilet.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web

==Bathroom reading and literature==
The term "bathroom reading" refers to any literary material deemed suitable for casual or light reading. In 2011, the Canadian author [[Margaret Atwood]] wrote:

{{quote|Bathroom reading is a certain kind of reading—episodic, but encouraging first thing in the morning. Sometimes the readers there prefer to read the newspaper, but when that's not available, they resort to their hand phones. The hand phone has a huge contributor in the rise of bathroom pollution.

The bathroom is a place where you can go in and pretend to be doing one thing while actually you're reading. Nobody can interrupt you. Compendiums of this and that are very useful for bathroom reading: small reading packages within a larger book. You wouldn't want to read ''[[War and Peace]]'' in there. You'd never come out. They'd probably call the police and get the door broken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Pulp magazine]]s were associated with bathroom reading, which the film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' references in repeated scenes of [[John Travolta]]'s character Vincent Vega reading the pulpy [[spy fiction|spy]] novel ''[[Modesty Blaise (novel)|Modesty Blaise]]'' while sat on a toilet.&lt;ref name=screenprism&gt;{{cite web

| date         = September 8, 2015
| accessdate   = September 4, 2018
| deadurl      = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bathroom reading also refers to a [[Literary genre|genre]] of books containing [[Humour|humor]] and [[trivia]], such as the ''[[Uncle John's Bathroom Reader]]'' series.&lt;ref name=screenprism/&gt;

In [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the protagonist [[Leopold Bloom]] reads a magazine on the toilet and then wipes himself with it.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Sanitation, hygiene and health== 
According to a professor at the [[Columbia University Medical Center]], reading in the bathroom can potentially facilitate [[Transmission (medicine)|the spread of disease]] if [[Airborne disease|airborne]] [[bacteria]] land on reading material and are transmitted to the reader; however, the activity is not a significant health concern as long as the reading environment is [[Sanitation|sanitary]], the reader does not have a [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune system]], and the reader practices ordinary [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| deadurl      = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[University of Arizona]] [[microbiologist]] who researched the topic in 2002 found that bathroom reading at the workplace was not a significant hygiene risk, noting that paper is a relatively unattractive environment for bacteria and that [[desk]] areas often have more bacteria than bathrooms because they are cleaned less frequently.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;

Although time spent on the toilet can increase the incidence of [[hemorrhoid]]s, a 2009 study found that bathroom readers were not more likely than non-bathroom readers to have hemorrhoids.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Bathroom reading and psychology==
Even when people read for extended periods of time during defecation, it is rare for bathroom readers to feel [[disgust]]ed by the smell of their own [[human feces|feces]], or even to consciously notice the smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url          = https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/perception-and-performance/201707/bathroom-reading

The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Otto Fenichel]] believed bathroom reading was an indication of [[early childhood trauma]]. He wrote that the activity is "an attempt to preserve the equilibrium of [[Id, ego and super-ego|the ego]]; part of one's bodily substance is being lost and so fresh matter must be absorbed through the eyes."&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; [[James Strachey]], who translated Freud's works into English, similarly noted that the activity of casual reading while defecating was essentially "infantile" behavior.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

[[DiMassimo Goldstein|DiMassimo Brand Advertising]] once tested [[Campaign advertising|political advertising]] in bathrooms by placing various messages about [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] in New York City public restrooms. The company's study found that 62 percent of people "remembered the exact message" of bathroom ads, compared to 16 percent for [[billboard]] advertisements.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;&lt;!--

In an interview with ''Entrepreneur Magazine'', she remembered when she “was preparing for [her] own boards, [she] was putting together things from other books and notes that were not up to date.”&lt;ref name=entr&gt;{{cite web| last =Maindiratta| first =Nitasha| title =These 3 Startups Are Looking to Get the Health Industry in Tip-Top Shape| work =Entrepreneur | date =Feb 7, 2014| url =http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231325}}&lt;/ref&gt; She critiqued the lack of any standardized preparation or review and therefore sought to make a dynamic change. Dr. Paul left her Yale residency program to team up with several medical educators.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web| last =Kavilanz| first =Parija| title =I ditched med school to start a business| work =CNN| date =Sep 18, 2013| url =http://money.cnn.com/gallery/smallbusiness/2013/09/18/medical-school-entrepreneurs/2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She partnered with [[Harvard Business School]] graduate and software developer Dan Lambert in 2012 to head Board Vitals as its CEO. Lambert was formerly a co-founder and CTO at Pushpins, which was acquired by Ebates in 2013.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Pushpins| work =Crunchbase| url =https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pushpins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business structure==
After its founding in 2012, BoardVitals has undergone several rounds of financing. In January 2014 it received a $500k seed investment from venture capital firms Rothenberg Ventures and Accelerator Blueprint Health.&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Heussner| first =Ki Mae| title =Got revenue? Blueprint Health accelerator picks its most advanced class yet | work =GIGAOM| date =Jul 12, 2013| url =https://gigaom.com/2013/07/12/got-revenue-blueprint-health-accelerator-picks-its-most-advanced-class-yet/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vent&gt;{{cite web| title =BoardVitals.com Raises Seed Funding| work =VC News Daily| date =Jan 22, 2014| url =http://www.vcnewsdaily.com/boardvitals.com/venture-capital-funding/gmpssyllqn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, BoardVitals entered the Gust Catapult NYC startup contest sponsored by entrepreneur and investor [[David S. Rose]]. The contest creates a platform for startups to pitch their business plan to a series of angel investors and venture capitalists. BoardVitals was selected as the winner of the competition out of over two hundred candidates. It was then invited to spend three months in a [[Silicon Alley]] incubator under the tutelage of Rose. BoardVitals has drawn the attention of several major investment groups.&lt;ref name=start/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyd&gt;{{cite web| last =Furman| first =Phyllis| title =Just what the doctor ordered: an NYC app that helps physicians study wins top prize in startup contest| work =New York Daily News| date =Feb 20, 2014| url =http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/doctor-ordered-nyc-app-helps-physicians-study-wins-top-prize-startup-contest-article-1.1620939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its clients include [[Harvard medical school]], [[Yale medical school]], and the [[Veterans Health Administration]]. In addition it has partnerships with several medical publishers, including [[McGraw-Hill]], [[Wolters Kluwer Health]], and [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley Publishers]].&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=vent/&gt; The business model focuses on aggregating questions and answers from Publishers, Universities, and individually contributing physicians in a single location.

==Test preparation==
Medical practitioners often continue their education after medical school by completing a residency in a specialty field to become a medical specialist. To complete their certification, the practitioner is required to pass a board certification exam to illustrate mastery of knowledge. Traditionally, there has been no standard review for these tests and study often includes outdated material. In addition, traditional review often requires multiple sources such as textbooks, lecture notes, and journals that can become costly and tedious. In recent years there has been a decline in pass rates among board certifications.&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

BoardVitals offers comprehensive test preparation for several specialty fields available on any electronic device. The material is taken from top medical universities, publishers and individually practicing physicians and compiled into a review database that can be accessed anytime from any number of mobile devices. It also only provides the most up-to-date medical knowledge in its curriculum, making sure its users never review obsolete material. Other material is sourced from top medical journals and texts in each specialty.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

Questions are written by faculty from top institutions and by several physician contributors. These questions are voted up or down through [[crowdsourcing]] among users to determine which questions more accurately reflect the specific specialty exam. This also ensures that out of date content is removed.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

Its board review programs are offered to individuals as well as medical schools, residency programs, teaching hospitals, and other medical facilities, both in the United States and abroad. It currently offers test reviews and questions for sixteen specialty fields:
* [[Cardiology]]
* [[Child Psychiatry]]
* [[Dermatology]]
* [[Echocardiography]]
* [[Emergency Medicine]]
* [[Otorhinolaryngology|ENT]]
* [[Family Medicine]]
* [[Gastroenterology]]
* [[Internal Medicine]]
* [[Neurology]]
* [[OBGYN]]
* [[Pathology]]
* [[Pediatrics]]
* [[Psychiatry]]
* [[Radiology]]
* [[Surgery]]&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;

Dr. Paul has stated the company plans to expand this to many more fields in the coming years.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

Each exam and question offers users feedback on their performance. It indicates where they stand in comparison to their peers, including data about what other users answered on a particular question. The statistics give users an accurate review of their performance in each section. User can customize practice tests to suit their exact needs, with advanced statistics available to offer premier test review. Board Vitals has given a guarantee that users will pass their board review.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

==Reception==
Dr. Paul was recently named among the top ten disruptive women in healthcare startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =10 Disruptive Women-Led Life Science Startups Selected for Springboard Enterprises’ 2014 Accelerator Class| work =Disruptive Women | url =http://www.disruptivewomen.net/2014/05/02/10-disruptive-women-led-life-science-startups-selected-for-springboard-enterprises-2014-accelerator-class/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gust.com'' named Board Vitals the 'Most Promising' startup in New York. The company has been featured in business profiles by several newspapers including ''CNN'', ''Forbes'', and ''Fox News''.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Online Tool Helping Medical Students Prep For Exam| work =Fox News| date =Mar 27, 2014| url =http://foxct.com/2014/03/27/online-tool-helping-medical-students-prep-for-exam/#ixzz2xBFiKVqO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Board Vitals has been used by over 100,000 clinicians for board certification preparation and continuing education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BoardVitals|url=https://www.boardvitals.com/about|website=BoardVitals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bursary''' is a [[Money|monetary]] award made by an institution to individuals or groups of people who cannot afford to pay full fees. In return for the bursary the individual is usually obligated to be employed at the institution for the duration as the bursary. According to ''[[The Good Schools Guide]]'', a bursary is "usually for helping out the impoverished but deserving and those fallen on hard times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/education-advice-and-help/scholarships-and-bursaries/money-matters.html?Itemid=52 |title=Help and advice on finding the right school for your child |publisher=The Good Schools Guide |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109161918/http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/education-advice-and-help/scholarships-and-bursaries/money-matters.html?Itemid=52 |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Hobsons UK Boarding Schools Guide'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardingschools.hobsons.com/advice/advice_uk_fees_funding]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404041740/http://www.boardingschools.hobsons.com/advice/advice_uk_fees_funding |date=April 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous [[independent school]]s have bursary capability, namely [[grant (money)|grant]]s from the school to help pay education fees. These are usually awarded after a "means test" of family income and are not necessarily dependent on examination performance, although some account of academic ability will be taken. Bursaries may be awarded in addition to [[scholarship]]s where{{where|date=February 2016}} financial need is demonstrated and the prospective student would otherwise be unable to enter the school.{{clarify|reason=Meaning unclear|date=April 2017}}

To obtain such a bursary, it is customary for parents to be asked by the school's bursar to fill in an application form, giving details of their financial circumstances, supported by documentary evidence, including capital assets. The application will be considered by the school in accordance with its bursary policy. The award will often only remain in force until the pupil has sat the next relevant public [[Test (assessment)|examination]]. Most schools will review bursaries annually to ensure that the justification for an award remains. In Britain any award made before [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] will not necessarily continue to the A-level stage. 

There are two types of bursary awarded by institutions (such as [[University|universities]]). The first is a means-tested bursary which is available for all students whose parents earn under a threshold value per annum. It is often given out using a sliding scale, with people at the lowest end of the [[Pay scale|scale]] receiving a full bursary and the monetary award decreasing in value with proportion to the parental earnings.

The second type of bursary, also known as a "scholarship" or "[[prize]]", is one based on performance. These awards are generally given for good performance in the exams preceding university or college entrance in which the student achieves grades above the standard entry. These can be awarded by the university or, sometimes, by companies.

The '''Centre for Alternative Technology''' (CAT) ({{lang-cy|Canolfan y Dechnoleg Amgen}}) is an [[ecology|eco]]-centre in [[Powys]], mid-[[Wales]], dedicated to demonstrating and teaching [[sustainable development]]. CAT, despite its name, no longer concentrates its efforts exclusively on [[alternative technology]], but provides information on all aspects of [[sustainable living]]. It is open to visitors, offers postgraduate degrees as well as shorter residential and one day courses; and publishes information on [[renewable energy]], [[sustainable architecture]], [[organic farming]], gardening, and sustainable living. CAT also runs education programmes for schools and sells environmentally friendly items through its on site shop, restaurant and mail order department.

==History==
[[File:Centre for Alternative Technology - geograph.org.uk - 27588.jpg|thumb|right|The Centre's forecourt and ticket office]]
CAT was founded by businessman-turned-environmentalist Gerard Morgan-Grenville, and opened in 1973 in the disused [[Llwyngwern]] [[slate]] [[quarry]] near [[Machynlleth]] (once served by the narrow-gauge [[Corris Railway]]), where it occupies a seven-acre (28,000 m²) site. The organisation was originally known as the "National Centre for Alternative Technology".

CAT was previously aligned to the Urban Centre for Appropriate Technology (UCAT), which was based in [[Bristol]] and has since evolved into the Centre for Sustainable Energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.org.uk Centre for Sustainable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visitor centre ==
In 1975 a permanent exhibition opened in order to generate wider interest. The {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} site with {{convert|7|acre|m2}} of interactive displays is the largest tourist attraction in the area. It is open all-year except Christmas, seven days a week. It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|265239|CENTRE FOR ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY CHARITY LIMITED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facilities and exhibits include: 
*the water-balanced CAT Funicular, the [[Centre for Alternative Technology Railway]]
*[[solar power|solar]], [[hydropower]] and [[wind power]]
*a [[low-energy house]]
*a site-wide electricity grid powered by [[renewable energy]]
*displays of [[organic gardening]] methods
*a [[hydraulic ram]] pump
*[[strawbale]] and [[rammed earth]] buildings
* Britain's largest green bookshop
* Vegetarian/ vegan restaurant
* Events, activities and courses take place throughout the year and are advertised on the website and through Facebook and Twitter.

== Education ==

The Centre offers a range of courses which are between a day and a week in length. Some of these courses are offered to the general public while others are accredited courses for professional installers.&lt;ref name=SHORTCOURSES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cat.org.uk/shortcourses/ |title=CAT Short Courses |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAT is involved with school education through training teachers, producing materials and offering special tours and materials on site.&lt;ref name=EDUCATION&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cat.org.uk/education/ |title=CAT Education Department |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre includes a Graduate School of the Environment. It offers postgraduate courses in renewable energy, architecture and environmental studies.&lt;ref name=GSE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gse.cat.org.uk/gse-about-us |title=Graduate School of the Environment |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre has run a Professional Diploma in Architecture course in ''Advanced Environmental and Energy Studies'', since 2008, which allows students to obtain an accredited Part II architectural qualification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/sustainability-masters/centre-for-alternative-technology-cat-machynlleth-wales-professional-diploma-in-architecture-part-ii-advanced-environmental-and-energy-studies/8620594.article ''Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT), Machynlleth, Wales; Professional Diploma in Architecture Part II: Advanced Environmental and Energy Studies''], The Architects' Journal, December 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales Institute for Sustainable Education===
{{Main|Wales Institute for Sustainable Education}}
In summer 2010, CAT inaugurated the [[Wales Institute for Sustainable Education|Wales Institute for Sustainable Education (WISE)]], a large educational building designed as a case study of [[sustainable architecture]]. The building contains a lecture theatre and accommodation&lt;ref name=VENUEHIRE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://venuehire.cat.org.uk/ |title=Venue Hire at CAT |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrates ecological building principles such as [[passive solar building design]] and [[heat recovery ventilation]] as well as low-impact building materials such as [[wood]], [[hemp]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[rammed earth]]. The external walls of the building are made from 500mm thick [[hempcrete]], whereas the lecture theatre has 7.2m high walls made from 320t of [[rammed earth]].&lt;ref name=WISE_INFO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.cat.org.uk/wise |title=CAT Information Service: The Wales Institute for Sustainable Education|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[building management system]] is used to monitor a wide variety of parameters inside the building, providing data for research projects by CAT's sustainable architecture students.
The building is used for teaching postgraduate degrees and short courses and is also available as a conference venue and exhibition space. 

In 2010, the WISE building was awarded the first place in the [[Daily Telegraph]]'s list of ''Top 10 Buildings 2010''&lt;ref name=TELEGRAPH&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/architecture/8195316/Top-10-buildings-of-2010.html |title=The Daily Telegraph: Top 10 Buildings of 2010|accessdate=2011-02-15 | location=London |first=Ellis |last=Woodman |date=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came 4th in [[The Guardian]]'s ''Top 10'' list of buildings for 2010.&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/dec/12/rowan-moore-architecture-review-2010 |title=The Guardian: The best architecture of 2010, by Rowan Moore|accessdate=2011-02-15 | location=London |date=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)]] Award in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Glancey [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/19/riba-architecture-awards-british-birds ''RIBA awards offer a bird's eye view of British architecture''], The Guardian, 19 May 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy ==
CAT originally relied on a collection of water, wind and solar power, but following power shortages it began to receive power from the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]]. Shortly afterwards, in 2004, a large new [[wind turbine]] was built using funds generated by selling shares in the project to the community, Bro Dyfi Community renewables. From 2009 September onwards CAT operates a [[microgrid]] system which includes elements of on- and off-grid operation.&lt;ref name=ISLAND_GRID&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/316730/first_island_power_grid_being_used_in_wales.html |title=The Ecologist: First island power grid being used in Wales |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MICRO_GRID&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/microgrid-system-centre-alternative-technology/ |title=Microgrid research at Centre for Alternative Technology |doi=10.1109/ISGTEurope.2011.6162725 |publisher=Mendeley.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAT gets its water from an existing man-made reservoir in the slate quarry on which it is based and processes its own sewage in its [[constructed wetland|reedbeds]].

== Regional impact ==
The presence of the Centre in the Dyfi Valley has brought an increased environmental emphasis to the area, which is now designated as a UNESCO [[Biosphere Reserve]].&lt;ref name=DYFI_BIOSPHERE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org.uk/dyfi_valley_awarded_unique_un_status |title=UK National Commission for UNESCO: Dyfi Valley awarded unique UN status |accessdate=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nearest town, [[Machynlleth]], CAT plc formerly operated a wholefood vegetarian café and a separate shop.  Following the closure of CAT plc, the CAT charity retained ownership of the vegetarian cafe but subsequently sold it to its workers.  The cafe is now run as a private enterprise but continues to operate as a vegetarian cafe. The wholefood shop was closed, as the building was not owned by CAT; however, a new wholefood shop Dyfi Wholefoods was opened by the staff who were made redundant. An industrial estate (the Dyfi Eco Park) near Machynlleth Railway Station houses the offices of Dulas Ltd, a renewable energy company started by ex-CAT employees.

'''''Criminal Justice: A Brief Introduction''''' is a book written by [[Frank Schmalleger]]. It is intended to serve as an introductory text in the study of the American [[criminal justice|criminal justice system]] . There have been eight editions with the latest written in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice: A Brief Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; The text is printed by [[Prentice Hall]] and [[Pearson Education]]. The publisher is [[Jeff Johnston]].

Schmalleger states, "Criminal justice is a dynamic and [[fluid]] field of study. As [[acceleration|accelerated]] change engulfs American [[society]], it is appropriate that a streamlined and up-to-date book be in the hands of students. The information age and all that it has wrought is here..."

Schmalleger adds, "It is my hope that the [[technology|technological]] and [[publishing]] [[revolution]]s will combine with growing social awareness to facilitate needed changes in our system; and will supplant self-serving system-perpetuated injustices with new standards of [[social equality|equity]], compassion, understanding, fairness, and justice for all."

In computing, a '''Digital Object Identifier or''' '''DOI''' is a [[persistent identifier]] or [[handle (computing)|handle]] used to uniquely identify objects, standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).&lt;ref name = "iso"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26324:ed-1:v1:en | title = ISO 26324:2012(en), Information and documentation — Digital object identifier system | publisher = [[ISO]] | date = | accessdate = 2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An implementation of the [[Handle System]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://handle.net/|title=The Handle System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doi.org/factsheets.html |title=Factsheets}}&lt;/ref&gt; DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports and data sets, and official publications though they also have been used to identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.

A DOI aims to be "resolvable", usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to [[metadata]] about the object, such as a [[URL]], indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as [[ISBN]]s and [[ISRC]]s which aim only to uniquely identify their referents. The DOI system uses the [[indecs Content Model]] for representing metadata.

The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Witten, Ian H.|author2= David Bainbridge|author3= David M.

==Nomenclature and syntax==
A DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a [[character string]] divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash.

: &lt;code&gt;prefix/suffix&lt;/code&gt;

The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier, and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal [[Unicode]] characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a [[case-insensitive]] manner. The prefix usually takes the form &lt;code&gt;10.NNNN&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;NNNN&lt;/code&gt; is a series of at least 4 numbers greater than or equal to &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt;, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.&lt;ref name="CrossRefDOI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossref.org/01company/15doi_info.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021021021703/http://www.crossref.org/01company/15doi_info.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-10-21 |access-date=10 June 2016 |title=doi info &amp; guidelines |website=CrossRef.org |publisher=Publishers International Linking Association, Inc. |date=2013 |quote=All DOI prefixes begin with "10" to distinguish the DOI from other implementations of the Handle System followed by a four-digit number or string (the prefix can be longer if necessary). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOIKeyFacts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIKeyFacts.html |access-date=10 June 2016 |title=Factsheet—Key Facts on Digital Object Identifier System |website=doi.org |publisher=International DOI Foundation |date=June 6, 2016 |quote=Over 18,000 DOI name prefixes within the DOI System}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like &lt;code&gt;10.NNNN.N&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="2.2.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html#2.2.2 |access-date=10 June 2016 |title=DOI Handbook—2 Numbering |website=doi.org |publisher=International DOI Foundation |date=February 1, 2016 |quote=The registrant code may be further divided into sub-elements for administrative convenience if desired. Each sub-element of the registrant code shall be preceded by a full stop.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the DOI name &lt;code&gt;10.1000/182&lt;/code&gt;, the prefix is &lt;code&gt;10.1000&lt;/code&gt; and the suffix is &lt;code&gt;182&lt;/code&gt;. The "10." part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,{{efn-ua|Other registries are identified by other strings at the start of the prefix. Handle names that begin with "100." are also in use, as for example in the following citation: {{cite document |last1=Hammond |first1=Joseph L., Jr.  |last2=Brown |first2=James E. |last3=Liu |first3=Shyan-Shiang S.  | date=May 1975  |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA013939 |title=Development of a Transmission Error Model and an Error Control Model l |journal=&lt;!-- --&gt; |volume=&lt;!-- --&gt; |publisher=Rome Air Development Center |series=Technical Report RADC-TR-75-138 |bibcode=1975STIN...7615344H  |hdl=100.2/ADA013939}}}} and the characters &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt; in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. &lt;code&gt;182&lt;/code&gt; is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the ''DOI Handbook'').

DOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, [[performance]]s, and abstract works&lt;ref name="doifaq2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 July 2018|origyear=update of earlier version|title=Frequently asked questions about the DOI system: 6. What can a DOI name be assigned to?|url=https://doi.org/faq.html#1|journal=|publisher=International DOI Foundation|volume=|pages=|accessdate=19 July 2018|via=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc.

The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the [[indecs Content Model]].

===Display===
The official ''DOI Handbook'' explicitly states that DOIs should display on screens and in print in the format &lt;code&gt;doi:10.1000/182&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-2811140"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html#2.6.1 |title=DOI Handbook – Numbering |date=13 February 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2014 |work=doi.org |author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630181440/http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html |archivedate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=no |at=Section 2.6.1 Screen and print presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the ''DOI Handbook'', [[CrossRef]], a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1000/182&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) instead of the officially specified format (for example, &lt;code&gt;[https://doi.org/10.1000/182 doi:10.1000/182]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=DOI Display Guidelines|url=http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/doi_display_guidelines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=New Crossref DOI display guidelines are on the way|url=http://blog.crossref.org/2016/09/new-crossref-doi-display-guidelines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the DOI.ORG domain), so it is a [[Persistent uniform resource locator|PURL]] &amp;mdash; providing the location of an [[HTTP proxy]] server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item.&lt;ref name="dd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Andy |last=Powell |title=Resolving DOI Based URNs Using Squid: An Experimental System at UKOLN |journal = D-Lib Magazine|date=June 1998|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june98/06powell.html| issn=1082-9873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CrossRef recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyper-linked to its appropriate URL – the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their [[Web browser|browser]] in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crossref.org/news/2011-08-02-crossref-revises-doi-display-guidelines/|title=Crossref Revises DOI Display Guidelines - Crossref|first=|last=ChrissieCW|website=www.crossref.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Major applications of the DOI system currently include:
* [[Scientific literature|scholarly materials]] (journal articles, books, ebooks,etc.) through [[CrossRef]], a consortium of around 3,000 publishers; [[Airiti]], a leading provider of electronic academic journals in Chinese and Taiwanese; and the Japan Link Center (JaLC) an organization providing link management and DOI assignment for electronic academic journals in Japanese.
* research datasets through [[DataCite]], a consortium of leading research libraries, technical information providers, and scientific data centers;
* [[European Union]] official publications through the [[Publications Office (European Union)|EU publications office]];
* the [[CNKI|Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure]] project at [[Tsinghua University]] and the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (ISTIC), two initiatives sponsored by the Chinese government. 
* Permanent global identifiers for commercial video content through the Entertainment ID Registry, commonly known as [[EIDR]].

In the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s publication service [[OECD iLibrary]], each table or graph in an OECD publication is shown with a DOI name that leads to an Excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs. Further development of such services is planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1787/603233448430 |title=We Need Publishing Standards for Datasets and Data Tables |date=2009|journal=Research Information |last=Green|first=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other registries include [[Crossref]] and the ''multilingual European DOI Registration Agency''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.medra.org |title=multilingual European DOI Registration Agency |publisher=mEDRA.org |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, [[Request for Comments|RFCs]] can be referenced as &lt;code&gt;doi:10.17487/rfc''&amp;hellip;''&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7669#section-3 |title=Assigning Digital Object Identifiers to RFCs § DOIs for RFCs |rfc=7669 |author=John R. Levine |author-link=John R. Levine |publisher=[[Internet Architecture Board|IAB]] |year=2015 |doi=10.17487/rfc7669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DOI and other special identifiers can help to unify information about references with different spelling in various language versions of Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=Włodzimierz |last2=Węcel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2017-09-23 |title=Analysis of References Across Wikipedia Languages |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320041870_Analysis_of_References_Across_Wikipedia_Languages |journal=Communications in Computer and Information Science |volume=756 |issue= |pages=561–573 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-67642-5_47 |access-date=2018-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features and benefits ==
The IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of [[Persistent identifier|persistent identification]], in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated. It also associates [[metadata]] with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the [[Handle System]] and the [[indecs Content Model]] with a social infrastructure.

The Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Grüttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&amp;pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.

The International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as [[GS1]] and [[ISBN]].

==Comparison with other identifier schemes==
A DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a [[First class (computing)|first-class entity]], rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html |title=DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifiers.html |title=DOI System and standard identifier registries |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOI system offers persistent, [[Semantic interoperability|semantically-interoperable]] resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as "identifiers" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other "identifier systems" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., [[Archival Resource Key|ARK]]).

A DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.

==Resolution==
DOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its &lt;code&gt;&lt;type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.

To resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as [https://doi.org/ doi.org].

Another approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (preferred)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI &lt;code&gt;10.1000/182&lt;/code&gt; can be included in a reference or [[hyperlink]] as &lt;code&gt;https://doi.org/10.1000/182&lt;/code&gt;. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal [[hyperlink]]. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.

Other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.&lt;ref name="capsh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 2016-10-17| date = 2016-03-03| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.&lt;ref name="impactstory"&gt;{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 2016-10-25 |accessdate=2017-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).&lt;ref name="capsh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="impactstory"/&gt;

An alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the [https://handle.net/tools/extensions/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like &lt;code&gt;hdl:4263537/4000&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;doi:10.1000/1&lt;/code&gt; directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, [[mail reader]], or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.

==IDF organizational structure==
The International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html#7.5 |title=DOI Handbook |chapter=Chapter 7: The International DOI Foundation |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It safeguards all [[intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.

The IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.

Registration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dona.net/mpa/|title=DONA Foundation Multi-Primary Administrators|access-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114120514/https://dona.net/mpa/|archive-date=14 January 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a [[not-for-profit]] cost recovery basis.

==Standardization==
The DOI system is an international standard developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1561 |title=Digital object identifier (DOI) becomes an ISO standard |publisher=iso.org |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation – Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval. The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/about_the_doi.html#TC46 |title=about_the_doi.html DOI Standards and Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was approved by 100% of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/about_the_doi.html#TC46 |title=Overviews &amp; Standards – Standards and Specifications: 1. ISO TC46/SC9 Standards |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final standard was published on 23 April 2012.&lt;ref name="iso" /&gt;

DOI is a registered URI under the [[info URI scheme]] specified by IETF {{IETF RFC|4452}}. info:doi/ is the infoURI Namespace of Digital Object Identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-uri.info/registry/docs/misc/faq.html#which_namespaces |title=About "info" URIs – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Info-uri.info |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOI syntax is a [[NISO]] standard, first standardised in 2000, ANSI/NISO Z39.84{{hyphen}}2005 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techstreet.com/standards/niso-z39-84-2005-r2010?product_id=1262088 |title=ANSI/NISO Z39.84{{hyphen}}2000 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier |publisher=Techstreet.com |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maintainers of the DOI system have deliberately not registered a DOI namespace for URNs, stating that:
{{quotation|URN architecture assumes a DNS-based Resolution Discovery Service (RDS) to find the service appropriate to the given URN scheme. However no such widely deployed RDS schemes currently exist.... DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution. If RDS mechanisms supporting URN specifications become widely available, DOI will be registered as a URN.|International DOI Foundation|Factsheet: DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications{{sfnp|International DOI Foundation|2012}}}}

[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Paul]] Writing His Epistles'', by [[Valentin de Boulogne]] or [[Nicolas Tournier]] (c. 16th century, Blaffer Foundation Collection, Houston, TX).]]

An '''epistle''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|s|əl}}; {{lang-el|ἐπιστολή}}, ''epistolē,'' "letter") is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal [[Didacticism|didactic]] letter.  The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in [[ancient Egypt]] as part of the [[Scribe|scribal-school]] writing curriculum. The letters in the [[New Testament]] from [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] to [[Early Christianity|Christians]] are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are known as [[Pauline epistles]] and the others as [[General epistles|catholic (i.e., "general") epistles]].

==Ancient Argon epistles==
The [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptians]] wrote epistles, most often for [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] reasons. [[Egyptologist]] Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth-dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Djedkare Isesi]]—in his many letters sent to his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]]—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre.&lt;ref name=wente&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters from Ancient Egypt: Society of Biblical Literature Writing from the Ancient World Series Volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn=978-1555404734|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.02262.0001.001|author=Edward F. Wente|translator = Edmund S. Meltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its existence is firmly attested during the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom]], and is prominently featured in the educational guide ''The Book of Kemit'' written during the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=wente/&gt; A standardized formulae for epistolary compositions existed by the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. The epistolary formulae used in the [[Ramesside Period]] found its roots in the letters composed during the [[Amarna Period]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]. Wente describes the "Satirical Letter" found on the [[Papyrus Anastasi&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by Egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic [[ostraca]] (over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists). Epistle letters were also written to the dead, and, by the Ramesside Period, to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|gods]]; the latter became even more widespread during the eras of [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Greek]] domination.&lt;ref name=wente/&gt;

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Epistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and particularly the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The letters of [[Cicero]] are one of the most important sources on the history of the late [[Roman Republic]] and preserve features of colloquial [[Latin]] not always in evidence in his speeches and treatises. The letters of [[Pliny the Younger]] likewise are studied as both examples of Latin prose with self-conscious literary qualities and sources for historical information. [[Ovid]] produced three collections of verse epistles, composed in [[elegiac couplet]]s: the ''[[Heroides]]'', letters written in the person of legendary women to their absent lovers; and the ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Ex Ponto]]'', written in first person during the poet's [[Ovid#Exile to Tomis|exile]]. The epistles of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], with their moral or philosophical ruminations, influenced later [[Church Fathers|patristic]] writers.

==Form of Christian epistles==
Epistles are written in strict accordance to formalized, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] tradition, especially the [[Pauline epistles]]. This reflects the amount of Hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers. Any deviancy is not the result of accident but indicates an unusual motive of the writer.

===Opening===
In contrast to modern letters, epistles usually named the author at the very beginning, followed by the recipient (for example, see [[Philippians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%201:1;&amp;version=31; 1:1]). The scribe (or more correctly, the [[amanuensis]]) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the ''episte'' (e.g., [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2016:22;&amp;version=31; 16:22]). In the absence of a [[postal system]], the [[courier]] may also be named (e.g. [[Ephesians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%206:21-22;&amp;version=31; 6:21–22]).

After the names of the author and recipient, Pauline epistles often open with the greeting, "Grace and peace to you." "Grace" was a common Hellenistic greeting, while "peace" ([[shalom]]) was the common [[Judaism|Jewish]] greeting; this reflected Paul's dual identity in Jewish faith and Hellenistic culture. There may also be a word of thanks to the audience. In secular letters, a prayer or wish for health followed.

===Body===
The body begins with a brief statement introducing the main topic of the entire body.

==New Testament epistles==
The epistles of the [[New Testament]] canon are usually divided as follows:

== Epistles of Apostolic Fathers ==
These are letters written by some very early Christian leaders, in the 1st or 2nd century, which are not part of the [[New Testament]]. They are generally considered to form part of the basis of Christian tradition. The ennobling word "epistle" is used partly because these were all written in Greek, in a time period close to when the epistles of the New Testament were written, and thus "epistle" lends additional weight of authority.

==Liturgical use==&lt;!-- Epistle (liturgy) redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Epistle to Galatians Illuminatad.jpg|thumb|Opening of the Epistle to the Galatians, [[illuminated manuscript]] for reading during [[Christian liturgy]].]]
In the context of a [[liturgy]], epistle may refer more specifically to a particular passage from a New Testament epistle (the Pauline epistles and the [[General epistles]])—sometimes also from the [[Book of Acts]] or the [[Revelation of John]], but not the [[Four Gospels]]—that is scheduled to be read on a certain day or at a certain occasion.

===Western churches===
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[Eucharist]], epistles are read between the [[Collect]] and the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]] reading. The corresponding [[Gregorian chant]]s have a special tone (''tonus epistolae''). When the epistle is sung or chanted at [[Solemn Mass]] it is done so by the [[subdeacon]]. Epistles are also read by an [[Elder (Christianity)#Lutheranism|Elder]] or [[Bishop#Lutheranism|Bishop]] in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], between the [[gradual]] and the Gospel.

===Eastern churches===
[[File:Kniga Apostol 1632 Drukarnya S Sobal.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Kniga Apostol'' (1632), [[lectionary]] in [[Church Slavonic]] for use in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].]]
In the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Byzantine Rite Catholic]]s the Epistle reading is called the ''Apostol'' (the same name is given to the [[lectionary]] from which it is read). The Apostol includes the Acts of the Apostles as well as the Epistles, but never the [[Apocalypse]] (Revelation of John).  Unlike the [[Latin Rite]] there are never readings from the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Apostle (in Liturgy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Epistle [[lection|lessons]] for every day of the year, except for weekdays during [[Great Lent]], when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated. These daily Epistle readings are a part of the [[Paschal cycle]], being ultimately dependent upon the date of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). There are also lessons appointed for the [[feast day]]s of numerous [[saint]]s and commemorations. There may be one, two, or three readings from the Apostol during a single Liturgy. The Epistle is read between the [[Prokeimenon]] and the [[Alleluia]]. The Epistle reading is always linked to a reading from the [[Gospel]], though some services, such as [[Matins]], will have a Gospel lesson, but no Epistle. A number of services besides the Divine Liturgy will have an Epistle and Gospel reading. Such services often include a Prokeimenon and Alleluia as well. The Epistle is chanted by the [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]], though at a Hierarchical Liturgy (a Divine Liturgy celebrated by a [[bishop]]), it is read by a [[deacon]]. The one who chants the Epistle also reads the verses of the [[Prokeimenon]].'''

==Medieval Epistles==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the art of letter writing was taught in numerous manuals, and the [[ars dictaminis]] became an important genre of instructional discourse. The necessity for letter writing was in large part due to the general deterioration of civil life and the decay of the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] system in the early [[Middle Ages]], factors that obliged literate people with business to transact to send letters instead of travel themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Malcolm |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 52–66 |chapter= The ''Art dictaminis'', the Formulary, and Medieval Epistolary Practice |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast number of letters and letter-writing manuals were written in the period's ''lingua franca'', [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poster |first1=Carol |last2=Utz |first2=Richard |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 285–300 |chapter= Appendix&amp;nbsp;B: A Bibliography of Medieval Latin ''Dictamen'' |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Network for Training in Economic Research''' (ENTER) is an exchange programme for graduate students in Economics.
Besides studying at their home university, graduate students can do one or two exchange semesters at the participating Economic departments in the network. Among those are the leading European Economic departments.
Participants are

The idea of the ENTER programme is to foster economic research and amplify the interaction between young researchers and supervisors from different institutions. Additionally, to the supervision by professors of their home university, ENTER participants profit from interchanging with researchers of the host university as well. Thus, they access a much larger body of fellows.

The ENTER network allows its Ph.D. students to join a partner institution and follow either the coursework of the first year or the thesis-writing phase. In order to obtain an ENTER degree, the student has to join the partner institution for at least one term. Moreover, the network allows master students to obtain a double degree. The ENTER Research Master programmes in Brussels, Madrid, Mannheim, Stockholm and Toulouse are two-year programme (120 ECTS credits) that rely on a common set of core courses in the first year and optional courses in the second year. In the second year, the student specializes in field courses and writes his master thesis. All courses are given in English. Participation is based on academic excellence and requires applying at the individual faculty.

Yearly held meetings called "Jamborees" focus on the presentation of current topics in Economics by ENTER participants. Furthermore, they should foster the links between junior and senior researchers of the same field. The ENTER Jamboree 2011 took place in Tilburg &lt;ref&gt;[http://enterjamboree2011.wordpress.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010 in Touluse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tse-fr.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=579&amp;Itemid=552]&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 1, 2011 [[Richard Blundell]] (UCL, London), [[Torsten Persson]] (University of Stockholm) and [[Jean Tirole]] (Université de Toulouse I) agreed to form the new scientific committee at ENTER. President will be Jean Tirole and Director will be Maurizio Zanardi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enter-network.org/1/news.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Floor-barre''' is a technique in ballet training that "takes the basic [[ballet barre]] training from the standing position to the floor, "taking the effort of standing out of the equation."

[[Zena Rommett]](R) originated Floor Barre in the 1960s in New York City one day in class, when she found herself telling the students at the ballet barre to "just lie down on the floor and start all over again." Zena Rommett spent her lifetime further refining and passing on her technique until her death at 89 in New York City. 
Floor-Barre(R), a registered trademark for the exclusive use of Zena Rommett and her legally certified Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) teachers,  strengthens the body, lengthens the muscles, and enhance the working of [[ballet]] dancers.  The name of the technique as first used in English by Zena Rommett states its essence, which takes the basic [[ballet barre]] training from the standing position to the floor, "taking the effort of standing out of the equation".
Since 1998 Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) Foundation holds August Certification/Renewal conferences at City Center of New York City, where teachers of Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) are certified and re-certified so that the technique will continue to progress instead of fossilizing. Summer conferences in Italy 
According to Rommett, the technique allows the trainees to enhance their precision and posture, making fixes that remain in their [[muscle memory]] and become evident as they go back to train in standing position. Rommett also claims that by training in this technique certain typical dancer injuries can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Magazine |last= |first= |title=Dance Magazine |trans-title=|date=March 2008 |publisher=DanceMedia, LLC |location= |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com |format= |accessdate=2013-09-08 |archiveurl=http://www.floor-barre.org/Floor-Barre/PRESS.html |archivedate=2013-09-08 |deadurl= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
The benefits of floor barre are limitless. Primarily, there will be less strain on the hip joints.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciandmed.com/mppa/journalviewer.aspx?issue=1116&amp;article=1217&amp;action=1|title=Medical Problems of Performing Artists - Medical Problems of Performing Artists|website=www.sciandmed.com|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, when a dancer is standing at the barre, their [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]] is forced beyond the individual’s range of motion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.performingartspt.com/downloads/ballet_dancer_student_article.pdf|title=The Ballet Dancer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;This means that the dancers are using gravity and their weight to forcibly turn their legs out in an attempt to reach that ‘ideal’ 180 degree turnout. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is not natural and can be quite dangerous for the joints. Floor barre emphasizes the importance in utilizing natural turnout by allowing movement that is both gravity resisted and assisted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Floor barre is also recommended for dancers recovering from injury because it enforces [[neutral spine]], which corrects improper posture, and is not too strenuous for the recovering body. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bronner|first=Shaw|last2=Ojofeitimi|first2=Sheyi|last3=Rose|first3=Donald|date=June 2008|title=Repair and Rehabilitation of Extensor Hallucis Longus and Brevis Tendon Lacerations in a Professional Dancer|url=https://www.jospt.org/doi/pdf/10.2519/jospt.2008.2749|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=362–370|doi=10.2519/jospt.2008.2749|issn=0190-6011}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a dance specific rehabilitation, it rebuilds strength and natural mobility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/11119c34345f6cf1a3ddaa6f8e29a5c2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=30487|title=Dance-specific, Graded Rehabilitation: Advice, Principles, and Schedule for the General Practitioner - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercises in floor barre can specifically target certain parts of the body such as the [[Psoas muscle|psoas muscles]], hamstrings, or pelvis while still allowing the dancer to focus on increasing center awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearns|first=Lauren W.|date=June 2010|title=Somatics in Action: How “I Feel Three-Dimensional and Real” Improves Dance Education and Training|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15290824.2010.10387158?needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Dance Education|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=35–40|doi=10.1080/15290824.2010.10387158|issn=1529-0824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dancers who over-rotate while utilizing their turnout can experience an overuse based syndrome known as [[Plantar fasciitis|Plantar Fasciitis.]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/jmrp/1089313x/v4n2/s5.pdf?expires=1538143247&amp;id=0000&amp;titleid=41000018&amp;checksum=D73C99E89B1AF9AB33D727E5059C4F61|title=Dance Physical Therapy for the Leg and Foot:
Plantar Fasciitis and Achilles Tendinopathy|last=[Grossman] [Wilmerding]|first=[Gayanne] [Virginia]|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is geared towards dancers and runners because of the constant heel rise to toe in their activities and exercises; it is caused by the excessive force used on that specific part of the foot, the plantar fascia. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For dancers, it is most likely developed from a repetitive [[Grand plié|grandplié]] or [[Relevé (dance)|relevé]]. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If a dancer has this condition, it is unnecessary to stop dancing unless the case is severe. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;Modifications in the movement and overall correcting the issue is enough.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It can resolve within several months and it can be repelled with the proper practice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''Foreign Service Institute''' ('''FSI''') is the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]'s primary training institution for employees of the U.S. foreign affairs community, preparing American diplomats as well as other professionals to advance U.S. foreign affairs interests overseas and in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|title=Hiring Window Is Open at the Foreign Service|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/jobs/21officers.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 20, 2008|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSI provides more than 800 courses—including over 70 foreign languages—to more than 170,000 enrollees a year from the [[Department of State]] and more than 50 other government agencies and the military service branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiser|first=Mindy|title=Foreign Service Institute Prepares Government Workers for Global Careers|url=https://www.washdiplomat.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15351:foreign-service-institute-prepares-government-workers-for-global-careers&amp;catid=1557&amp;Itemid=428|work=[[Washington Diplomat]]|date=May 5, 2017|access-date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSI is based at the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

The Institute's programs include training for the development of [[United States Foreign Service]] and Civil Service professionals, and for Foreign Service Nationals who work at U.S. posts around the world. Ranging in length from one day to two years, courses are designed to promote successful performance in each professional assignment, to ease the adjustment to other countries and cultures, and to enhance the leadership and management capabilities of the U.S. foreign affairs community. Other courses and services help family members prepare for the demands of a mobile lifestyle and living abroad, and provide employees and their families with important information about such critical and timely topics as emergency preparedness and cyber-security awareness, among others.

According to the Foreign Service Institute’s website, the Foreign Service Institute is the U.S. government’s “premier foreign affairs training  provider...dedicated to ensuring the career-long learning opportunities required for success in today’s global arena.  FSI promotes substantive, regional, and linguistic expertise, leadership finesse, personal resilience and innovative problem-solving.  FSI serves the U.S. Department of State and the entire U.S. government foreign affairs community as a strategic enabler of diplomatic excellence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Service Institute|url=https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=January 20, 2017|access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of the Foreign Service Institute is equivalent in rank to an [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]],&lt;ref name="FAM"&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 290 Foreign Service Institute (FSI)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=September 8, 2014|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is appointed by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. The FSI Director is the Chief Learning Officer responsible for professional training for the U.S. Department of State and federal foreign affairs agencies.

== History ==
The Foreign Service Institute was first proposed as an in-service, graduate-level training institute for State Department employees and others in the Foreign Service. A number of different training schools and programs preceded the Foreign Service Institute, including the Consular School of Application (1907), the Wilson Diplomatic School (1909), the Foreign Service School (1924), the Foreign Service Officers' Training School (1931) and the Division of Training Services (1945).

In 1946, President Truman signed legislation that enabled Secretary of State George C. Marshall to establish the Institute on March 13, 1947. The Foreign Service Institute was initially authorized in Title VII of the [[Foreign Service Act]]. The issuance of Departmental orders fulfilling this section of the Act were delayed by the need to first resolve certain administrative issues. The orders were ultimately issued and, on March 13, 1947, Secretary of State [[George Marshall]] announced the establishment of the Foreign Service Institute.&lt;ref name="ADST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adst.org/2016/05/the-battle-to-create-the-foreign-service-institute/|title=The Battle to Create the Foreign Service Institute|access-date=March 24, 2017|publisher=[[Association of Diplomatic Studies and Training]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the Foreign Service Institute opened in the Mayfair Building in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. at 2115 C Street NW, a building that was subsequently razed for the new [[Harry S Truman Building|State Department headquarters]].&lt;ref name="AllGov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Service Institute|url=http://www.allgov.com/departments/department-of-state/foreign-service-institute?agencyid=7180|publisher=AllGov.com|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute included four schools: Basic Officer Training, Advanced Officer Training, Management and Administrative Training, and Language Training.&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt; FSI then moved to leased space in Rosslyn, Virginia until October 1993, when it relocated to its current home. In 1954, the Wriston Report criticized the resources and support being devoted to FSI, and in the following year, FSI overhauled its curriculum, adding longer specialized training, putting a greater emphasis on language training, and opening up courses to wives of Foreign Service Officers.&lt;ref name="AllGov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='WRISTON REPORT' OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp78-04718a000100250049-2|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1993, FSI moved to the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and remains headquartered there today.&lt;ref name="AllGov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Foreign Affairs Training Center 2017 Master Plan Update|url=https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/136234|publisher=[[General Services Administration]]|date=April 7, 2017|access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, FSI celebrated the 70th anniversary of its founding, with the [[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]] releasing an e-book in honor of its anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FSI at 70: Future Forward: A History of the Foreign Service Institute|last=Honley|first=Steven|publisher=Arlington Hall Press|date=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Foreign Service Institute currently has four schools: Leadership and Management, Language Studies, Professional and Area Studies, and Applied Information Technology, along with the Transition Center and an executive office for administrative functions.&lt;ref name="FAM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OIG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspection of the Foreign Service Institute|url=https://oig.state.gov/system/files/209366.pdf|publisher=[[Inspector General of the Department of State]]|date=March 2013|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Language Studies''' ('''SLS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 297 School of Language Studies (FSI/SLS)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=December 23, 2013|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers instruction in more than 70 languages and proficiency testing in over 100 languages. Enrollments may be 8–44 weeks, depending on the difficulty of the language and the individual's proficiency objectives. The Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies also maintains a network of language field schools in Taipei, Yokohama, Seoul, and other regional programs in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia where a further 44 weeks of instruction is offered overseas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name="FAM"/&gt; Programs and courses of study also include self-study, early morning classes and distance learning courses. FSI is a co-creator of the speaking and reading language proficiency rating scales used throughout the U.S. government.  SLS is active within the U.S. government’s interagency community of language trainers and testers and frequently benchmarks with external foreign affairs agencies on language instruction.

The''' School of Professional and Area Studies''' ('''SPAS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 294 School of Area and Professional Studies (FSI/SPAS)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=July 13, 2011|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers training in foreign affairs specialties, such as consular, management tradecraft, political and economic affairs, public diplomacy, curriculum and staff development, office management, and orientation programs.

'''Francis Huberty James''' or in ''[[List of Protestant missionaries in China|Chinese]]:''  '''Xiu Yaochun   秀耀春''' (born ''Francis James'', 1851–1900) was a British Christian Missionary who went to China in 1876 as part of the [[OMF International|China Inland Mission (CIM)]]  founded by [[Hudson Taylor|J. Hudson Taylor]](1832–1905). 
 
He was influential in the early translation of the Chinese Language, wrote many manuals on the teaching/learning for elementary students of the Chinese Language and became a University of Peking professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.stanford.edu/east-asia-library/chinese-books-display-textbooks-end-19th-and-early-20-century-china |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403061113/http://lib.stanford.edu/east-asia-library/chinese-books-display-textbooks-end-19th-and-early-20-century-china |archivedate=2012-04-03 |df= }}"Chinese Books on Display: Textbooks at the Turn of 20th Century" Stanford University.  Says "Xiu Yaochun (秀耀春, Francis Huberty James, 1851-1900), missionary from Britain, taught in the Imperial University, Peking (京师大学堂). " Retrieved 14 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  He was killed during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] on 20 June 1900 and is considered a Christian martyr.

==Early years==
Francis James was born in June 1851 in [[Upton, Vale of White Horse|Upton, Berkshire]].  He was the third child of five born to John James  (born about 1824 also in Upton, died 1897) and Sarah Mitten (born about 1818 in Robertsbridge, Sussex and died in 1889), who were married in 1847.  He came from a long line of the James family all living at The Forge ([[Blacksmith]]) in the small village of Upton in Berkshire.  His great-grandfather, Francis James born 1763, and his grandfather, Richard James born 1797, were both the village blacksmiths, but his father John started up the business of a grocers and bakery together with Francis’ brothers John, Joseph and Matthew.  His sister, Martha, also worked in the new village store whilst her husband Richard Bellamy took over the job of blacksmith.  In the early 1900s the store also became a post office in the hands of John.  Francis followed suit and became a baker in the family business when was age 20.  From his mother he inherited 
his sympathetic disposition, and from his father the tenacity of purpose and strength of will which were his 
chief characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Coventry Forsyth. The China Martyrs of 1900&lt;/ref&gt;   Little is known of his movement between 1871 and 1876 when he left England for China.

==Work in China and the United States==
James was brought to China in 1876 by the China Inland Mission (CIM)to be a missionary. James and Joshua J. Turner&lt;ref&gt;wn.com/Overseas_Missionary_Fellowship&lt;/ref&gt; were the first Protestant Christian missionaries in [[Shanxi]] and begin to help out victims of the disaster and famine. James worked in Honan and in the north of the country for the following two years.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth 1904, page 473&lt;/ref&gt; He became fluent in Chinese, and taught at a university.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2007, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; He and two companions set out in 1876 with over 4000 Gospels and other books, as well as religious tracts. They travelled 1,700 miles in three months.  On their travels in 1877-78, they found widespread famine, which killed about one third of the population of one province.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2007, pages 144-146&lt;/ref&gt; The accounts of the famine published by James and a few other missionaries brought famine relief from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2007, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned the CIM in 1881, along with many other young members. 
In 1878 he married a CIM member, Marie Huberty, a French speaking Belgian (born about 1846 in [[Liège]], [[Belgium]] and died in [[Santa Cruz, California]], United States, date unknown).  She was a graduate of French Protestant School, Liege.  He took her maiden name as his own middle name. 
After a return to England in 1881, James joined the English Baptist mission group in Shantung, China.
James resigned the [[Baptists|Baptist group]] in 1892.&lt;ref name="Forsyth 1904, pages 473-474"&gt;Forsyth 1904, pages 473-474&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Theist]] about 1894.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Christian Literature Society for China 1900, pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; He lived for several years in the United States, where in 1895 he was awarded the [[Lowell Institute|Lowell Lectureship]] in Boston, and lectured on the history, beliefs and philosophies of China. He returned to China in 1897, having taken the post of translator at the Imperial Arsenal, near Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Coventry Forsyth. The China martyrs of 1900&lt;/ref&gt;  This position he held for about a year, and he was then invited to join and accepted a place and was appointed a professor at the [[Peking University|Imperial University in Peking]].&lt;ref name="Forsyth 1904, pages 473-474"/&gt; which appointment he held at the time of his death. He left his wife and children in the U.S. in 1893 to further the education of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Hale 1900 page 890&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two sons, Hubert Carey James, (born in [[Shanxi]], China in 1879 and died 1953 in [[San Mateo, California]]), who became an [[accountant]] and Harold Francis James, (born in Berkshire, England in 1881 and died 1957 in [[Calhoun, Illinois]]) who studied at the Academié Julian&lt;ref&gt;[[Académie Julian]]&lt;/ref&gt;   in Paris with [[Jean Paul Laurens]] (1838–1921) a French painter and sculptor and Harold became an artist, an artistic author and a college teacher.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.askart.com/askart/j/h_arold_francis_james/h_arold_francis_james.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3966483M/Who_was_who_in_American_art_1564-1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/search/Search_Grid.aspx?searchtype=BOOKS&amp;artist=5814&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold was profiled posthumously in "Who Was Who in American Art, 1564-1975" edited by Peter Hastings and published in 1999. He was also one of the artists included in "Biographical Directory of Kansas Artists Active Before 1945" compiled by Susan Craig and published in 2006.

In 1900, during the siege of Peking (the [[Boxer Rebellion]]), when many Christian churches and premises were burnt, and many native Christians were being killed, James secured refuge in Prince Su's palace, just across a canal from the besieged foreign legations, for about 3,000 endangered Chinese Christians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forsyth 1904, page 475"&gt;Forsyth 1904, page 475&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 June 1900, James left the relative safety of the British legation, and was captured by Chinese soldiers.&lt;ref name="Forsyth 1904, page 475"/&gt; Some sources state that he was decapitated and his head was stuck on a spear for public viewing, by orders of General [[Ronglu|Ronglu(Jung Lu)]] (1836–1903), who was directing the siege of the foreign legations.&lt;ref name="Forsyth 1904, page 475"/&gt;  Others state that he was shot.&lt;ref&gt;Beals page 82&lt;/ref&gt; His killing was the second of an eminent foreigner following the declaration of war by the Chinese government, the first being [[Clemens von Ketteler]], the German Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pages 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Christians were killed in the uprising, including 182 Protestant missionaries. The term [[China Martyrs of 1900]] was used by Protestant churches thereafter to describe the slayings.

'''Front Sight Firearms Training Institute''', also known as '''Front Sight''' and as '''Front Sight Resorts''', was founded in 1996 by Dr Ignatius Piazza. It is a privately owned and operated organization whose purpose is twofold: 1) to provide training, mostly on how to safely operate firearms in self-defense settings, also referred to as providing "comfort of skill at arms", and 2) an activism goal to "positively change the image of gun ownership in our lifetimes" by repudiating unfavorable views of gun owners put forth by various private gun control, and political, organizations.  It claims to have grown to be the largest gun training organization in the US, and larger than all the others combined (as measured in terms of annual students).&lt;ref&gt;Assorted statements in promotional emails and videos distributed by Frontsight, none of which I can directly find or link to right now.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Front Sight currently operates two locations, its main location near [[Pahrump, Nevada]] and a second location in [[Nikiski, Alaska]].

==History==
The original Front Sight facility was located on rented property near [[Bakersfield, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970327002137/http://frontsight.com/ Web Archive Snapshot - Front Sight in Bakersfield]&lt;/ref&gt; and operated from 1996 until 2002.

In 1998, a {{convert|550|acre|adj=on}} property in [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]], between [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Pahrump, Nevada]] (near [[Nevada State Route 160]] and Tecopa Road) was purchased and the operation gradually moved there. This location, called "Front Sight Nevada", provides facilities for training in firearms as well as climbing, rappelling, and other forms of self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3DC163EF936A25756C0A96F958260|title= A 'Sun City' for Gun Enthusiasts|newspaper= New York Times|first=EVELYN |last=NIEVES |date= May 15, 1999|accessdate= April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Front Sight Nevada facility is still under development. As of June 2014 the facility includes a {{convert|6000|sqft|adj=on}} classroom area that can seat 450 students, 24 shooting ranges for handgun, rifle, and shotgun (with both static and moving targets), 8 live-fire simulator ranges with shooting house, underground training simulators, a gunsmithing facility and armory, a martial arts and edged weapons gym, a rope, rappel and climb facility including zip lines, a pro shop, and food service for breakfast and lunch. An additional 26 shooting ranges are currently under construction.  These ranges will expand Front Sight’s capacity to 50 total ranges capable of training up to 2000 students on the property at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontsight.com/pages/facility.asp Front Sight Facilities] Retrieved July 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Front Sight acquired an extensive property on the [[Kenai Peninsula]] in [[Alaska]] in 2004. This location, called "Front Sight Alaska", previously focused on outdoorsmanship and includes training and activities such as big game hunting, fishing, kayaking, and bear safety,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontsight.com/alaska/ Front Sight Alaska]&lt;/ref&gt; but from lack of student demand, has scaled back many of these classes. Front Sight Alaska has very little on-site development at this time except the ranges. There is no armory, gunsmith, pro shop or food services.

In early 2012, [[Texas]] news sources revealed preliminary agreements had been signed for a Front Sight Texas campus, to be located in East [[Montgomery County, Texas|Montgomery County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/news/wakeboard-park-shooting-range-coming-to-east-county/article_2ddc761e-70d1-513b-ad77-6b2365bf02a9.html?mode=jqm|newspaper= The Courier of Montgomery County|date= February 10, 2012| title=Wakeboard park, shooting range coming to East County| accessdate= July 5, 2014|first=Brad |last=Meyer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ourtribune.com/article.php?id=13341|newspaper= The Tribune |date=February 20, 2012|title=A Disneyland for gun lovers|first=Cynthia |last=Calvert|location=Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front Sight ultimately opted not to open a third facility but instead focused on completing the Nevada complex.

In late March 2014, Front Sight broke ground on 26 additional ranges (in the "phase 3" area), in preparation of temporarily shutting down "phase 2" ranges to build the Front Sight hotel. The hotel was expected to open in the summer of 2016.

The new ranges became operational in late 2017, and in January 2018 Front Sight released a "construction progress update" showing ongoing construction of the hotel and related resort buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=2018-01-29 |title=Front Sight Early 2018 Construction Progress Update-Gun Training-Firearms Training-Pistol Training|language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkxdu212XKw |access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2018 no revised opening date has been announced.

===Notable Events===
Noted speaker and author on gun violence [[Dave Grossman (author)|Lt. Col. Dave Grossman]] has lectured and taken courses at Front Sight, having graduated from the Four Day Defensive Handgun course.&lt;ref name="GrossmanChristensen2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossman|first1=Dave|last2=Christensen|first2=Loren W.|title=On Combat: The Psychology and Physiology of Deadly Conflict in War and in Peace|year=2007|publisher=PPCT Research Publications|isbn=978-0-9649205-2-1|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Mark Wahlberg]] attended sniper shooting classes at Front Sight to prepare for the 2007 movie ''[[Shooter (2007 film)|Shooter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontsight.com/msn-vid.asp Mark Wahlberg interview]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Piazza and Front Sight were sued in a class action by certain members of the "First Family", an exclusive membership to the Front Sight facility, for failing to deliver on expectations made when the memberships were purchased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=4091067 A Gun and a Dream] KLAS TV report. Retrieved May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontsightlitigation.com/ Front Sight Litigation] Attorney webpage. Retrieved May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement was reached in 2007.
 
On May 11, 2009, due to Front Sight's legal counsel failing to appear to a hearing, [[James Ware (judge)|Judge James Ware]] of the U.S. District Court for Northern California ordered a temporary receiver be appointed to Front Sight.  This case is related to the class-action suit, brought by plaintiffs, regarding a multimillion-dollar shortfall in the class-action fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2009/May-15-Fri-2009/news/28773367.html Pahrump Valley Times] BUSINESS AS USUAL? - Front Sight assets seized&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 2009, Front Sight's legal counsel appeared at a settlement hearing and [[James Ware (judge)|Judge James Ware]] discharged the interim receiver, leaving Front Sight in control of all aspects of its business.  The termination of the receivership was made after the court received a copy of the receiver's report and based upon evidence presented at the May 18 hearing.&lt;ref&gt;ORDER DISSOLVING RECEIVERSHIP AND DISCHARGING RECEIVER, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA SAN JOSE DIVISION, Case No. C 05-04532 JW&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Since 2002, Front Sight has supported the [[Federal Flight Deck Officer]] Program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsa.gov/lawenforcement/programs/ffdo.shtm FFDO Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215063903/http://www.tsa.gov/lawenforcement/programs/ffdo.shtm |date=2006-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offering gun training for pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secure-skies.org/Pilots_In_Cockpit.php Centennial Journal Article - 120000 Pilots Still Not Armed in the Cockpit]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of mass school shootings, Front Sight offers free firearms training for up to three teachers from any school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontsight.com/news.asp?Action=ViewNews&amp;ID=45 Sierra Times Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=/Nation/archive/200103/NAT20010307b.html Cybercast News Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The majority of Front Sight courses involve firearms training, but there are many other classes available. Among the firearms courses offered are [[handgun]], [[shotgun]], [[rifle]] and [[submachine gun]]; these are available as two- or four-day classes and are offered at entry level as well as more advanced levels of training.  Classes typically run from 8am to 5pm with an hour break for lunch, and often include classroom lectures as well as practical training on ranges.  Upon completion of entry level classes, students pass a Skills Test and can either be awarded a 'Distinguished Graduate' certificate, a Graduate certificate, or a 'Certificate of Completion' depending on their score, which is based on a combination of marksmanship and timed accuracy at shooting, weapons handling, and malfunction clearances.

Advanced classes usually have prerequisites requiring intending students to have first attended and possibly to have either earned a Graduate or Distinguished Graduate grade in the Skills Test for the prerequisite class.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.frontsight.com/pdf/class-requirements.pdf?v2&lt;/ref&gt;

Other training includes empty hand defense, edged weapons, rappel and climb, child safety, youth achievement, corporate [[team building]], and [[armorer]]'s courses. Some of these classes are only available by invitation or to those who have completed necessary prerequisite courses.&lt;ref name="Lewis2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack Lewis (screenwriter)|title=Assault Weapons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2AbzqChZBYC&amp;pg=PA78|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2400-5|pages=78–79|chapter=The shooting schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilliard2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilliard|first=Frank|title=Home Invasion Prevention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UG1XAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|date=9 June 2009|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-0-557-04376-7|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two new classes were added in March 2018 - a two day advanced tactical handgun class, and a one day tactical awareness class.&lt;ref&gt;Sourced based on personal knowledge, their website,
 and discussion with Frontsight personnel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a student can begin a firearms course, they must pass a [[background check]] in excess of Federal requirements and may require a reference from an existing Front Sight member or previous student. People wishing to take courses who do not know a Front Sight Member or previous student may use upstanding members of society as references. Lifetime members must renew that background check once in every calendar year that they take a firearms course.&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beiser|first=Vince|title=Family Gun Fun|issue=3|volume=15|date=March 1999|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|page=62|journal = SPIN|issn=0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2014, there are approximately 100,000 households with Front Sight members, having grown from approximately 70,000 households in July 2013.

'''Klaus Holzkamp''' (30 November 1927, [[Berlin]] – 1 November 1995, Berlin) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Psychology|psychologist]]. 

==Research==
Klaus Holzkamp worked as a professor at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. He took a central role in defining [[Critical Psychology|critical psychology]] based on the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Loren R. Graham, Wolf Lepenies and Peter Weingart | year = 1983 | title = Functions and Uses of Disciplinary Histories | publisher = D. Reidel Publishing Company | location = [[Boston]] | page= 195| isbn = 90-277-1520-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holzkamp's main message is that mainstream psychology serves the interest of the power [[elite]] by disregarding the ability of humans to change their life circumstances. In a standard scientific study in the field of psychology the test setting is taken as a given, unchangeable fact, while in real life people may organize themselves and transform society.

He worked and lived together with his wife Christine Holzkamp-Osterkamp.

===Pupils===
Holzkamp's ideas have been conserved and transformed by several younger academic teachers like Karl-Heinz Braun (UAS Magdeburg), Ole Dreier, Barbara Grüter (U. of [[Bremen]]), [[Manfred Günther]] (SFBB), Wilhelm Kempf (U. of Konstanz), Wolfgang Maiers (U. of [[Magdeburg]], Morus Markard, Rainer Seidel or Irmingard Staeuble (all three: FU of Berlin).

==Selected works==
German books:
* ''Kritische Psychologie - Vorbereitende Arbeiten'' (1972)
* ''Grundlegung der Psychologie'' (1983)
* ''Lernen. Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung'' (1993)

The '''''Kollegstufe''''', '''''Oberstufe''''' or '''''Sekundarstufe II''''' is the [[Germany|German]] equivalent of the [[sixth form]] of [[secondary education]] in the upper stage (grades 12-13, or 11-12) of German [[high school]]s. Class groupings are dissolved and instead students choose an individual combination of courses.

The idea behind this concept is not to prepare students for [[university]], where they have to create their own timetable, as is sometimes claimed based on the mere analogy. The idea is to allow students to diversify and pick subjects of their personal preference. The Kollegstufe does not yet allow students to specialize on one or very few subjects like the university does, so a complex set of rules for the Kollegstufe ensures that important subjects (e.g. mathematics, languages) cannot be dropped, a sufficient coverage for different fields of education is achieved and the number of lessons per week covers the required minimum. If you finish the Kollegstufe successfully, which means you comply with all the regulations and pass the final exams, you get the "Abiturzeugnis", formally called "Zeugnis der Allgemeinen Hochschulreife", which entitles one to attend a German university.

The regulations for the Kollegstufe and also for the [[Abitur]] are different in the different [[States of Germany|"Länder"]] (federal states) of Germany. As educational matters are decided by the governments of the federal states, these differences can be quite big.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4887">'''Mary Jo Freshley''' (September 25, 1934) is a [[Korean dance]] professor. She teaches at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] and the [[Halla Pai Huhm]] Dance Studio. Freshley is one of the [[Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii|Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii's]] [[List of Living Treasures of Hawaii|Living Treasures of Hawaii]]. Even though she is not ethnically Korean, she is one of Hawaii's foremost experts on Korean dance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1005009723|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music : Australia and the Pacific Islands.|last=W.|first=Love, J.|date=1998|publisher=Taylor and Francis|others=Kaeppler, Adrienne.|isbn=9781351544320|location=CT|oclc=1005009723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46884137|title=Perspectives on Korean dance|last=Judy|first=Van Zile|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2001|isbn=081956494X|location=Middletown, Connecticut|pages=|oclc=46884137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Freshley was born on September 25, 1934 in [[Homeworth, Ohio]]. She earned an undergraduate degree from [[Bowling Green State University]] in 1956, and a master's degree in Education after that.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kapalama.ksbe.edu/archives/collections/freshley/Biography.php|title=KS Archives|website=kapalama.ksbe.edu|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught physical education in Michigan, and once she moved to Hawaii she also taught at [[Kamehameha Schools]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Dance ==
After moving to Hawaii in 1961, Freshley began learning the dances of many cultures, such as [[Hula|Hawaiian]], [[Okinawan dance|Okinawan]], and [[Japanese traditional dance|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Freshley began studying [[Korean dance]] under [[Halla Pai Huhm]] in 1962. She began assisting at the Halla Pai Huhm Dance Studio in 1973. Freshley has also studied with Kim Pyong-Sop and Kim Chon-Hung.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/256472669|title=From the land of hibiscus : Koreans in Hawaiʻi, 1903-1950|date=2007|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|others=Chʻoe, Yŏng-ho, 1931-|isbn=9781435665910|location=Honolulu|oclc=256472669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freshley took over the studio after Huhm's death in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taikoarts.com/classes/instructors/mary-jo-freshley/|title=Mary Jo Freshley|date=2017-10-10|work=Taiko Center of the Pacific|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she retired from her teaching position at [[Kamehameha Schools]], started teaching at the studio full-time, and founded the Halla Huhm Foundation. Much like Halla Huhm, she did not receive a salary from the dance studio, and used funding surpluses to bring guest instructors from Korea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Freshley's ethnic heritage as a European-American led to some criticism from the local Korean community, who believe that a Korean should have taken over Huhm's work and studio.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was also excluded from the studio's performance at the 1989 [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] because of her race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436168447|title=American aloha : cultural tourism and the negotiation of tradition|last=A.|first=Diamond, Heather|date=2008|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|isbn=9781441619716|location=Honolulu|oclc=436168447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She retired from the Halla Huhm Studio in 2001, but is still the director of the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/korea/halla_huhm/Studio/studio.html|title=Halla Huhm Dance Studio|website=www.hawaii.edu|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshley currently teaches at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manoa.hawaii.edu/liveonstage/staff-members/mary-jo-freshley-2/|title=Mary Jo Freshley {{!}} UHM Dept. of Theatre + Dance|website=manoa.hawaii.edu|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 she was honored as a [[List of Living Treasures of Hawaii|Living Treasure of Hawaii]] for her work in preserving Korean culture in Hawaii and for creating the studio's archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hongwanjihawaii.com/blog/2018/01/22/2018-living-treasures/|title=2018 Living Treasures of Hawaii to Be Honored at 43rd Annual Program|date=2018-01-22|work=Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israel]]i '''Ministry of Education''' ({{lang-he-n|מִשְׂרָד הַחִנּוּךְ}}, [[Romanization of Hebrew|translit.]] ''Misrad HaHinukh''; {{lang-ar|وزارة التربية والتعليم}}) is the branch of government charged with overseeing public education institutions in Israel. The department is headed by the Minister of Education, who is a member of the [[cabinet of Israel|cabinet]]. The ministry has previously included culture and sport, although this is now covered by the [[Culture and Sport Ministry|Ministry of Culture and Sport]].

==History==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13128 Ministry of Education in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|250px|Ministry offices on [[Street of the Prophets]] in [[Jerusalem]]]]
In the first decade of statehood, the education system was faced with the task of establishing a network of kindergartens and schools for a rapidly growing student population. In 1949, there were 80,000 elementary school students. By 1950, there were 120,000 - an increase of nearly 150 percent within the span of one year. Israel also took over responsibility for the education of Arab schoolchildren. The first minister of education was [[Zalman Shazar]], later president of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=VEUZbPc-h2gC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=first+education+minister+israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FLzeQN-VnC&amp;sig=szav00hZlOHR53fUxxFdWnRerUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6smKVYnLBsjxUPG5mtgJ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20education%20minister%20israel&amp;f=false The Retreat from Public Education: Global and Israeli Perspectives, Orit Ichilov]&lt;/ref&gt;    
Since 2002, the Ministry of Education has awarded a [[National Education Award]] to five top localities in recognizing excellence in investing substantial resources in the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The prize has been awarded to a variety of educational institutions including kindergartens and elementary schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3314">'''Open-space Learning''', or OSL, is a [[pedagogic]] methodology. OSL is a [[transdisciplinary]] pedagogy that is dependent on the use of physically open  spaces - in the sense that tables and chairs are absent - and an open approach to intellectual content and the role of the tutor. Participants in OSL, typically but not exclusively, learn in an 'embodied' way.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Nicholas, Jonathan Heron, Jonathan Neelands, Carol Chillington Rutter. ''Open-space Learning: a Study in Interdisciplinary Pedagogy''. London: Bloomsbury, 2011. Bloomsbury Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities. Print and Web. p.vi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The idea was to apply the practices and theories of the theatrical rehearsal room and the theatrical ensemble to the university curriculum. From these early aspirations developed a pedagogy that has now been used successfully in a dozen departments including Chemistry, Law, Business, English, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Medicine. OSL is a collaborative pedagogic practice and does not, therefore, have a single originator or author.

==Methods==

In OSL, the workshop is the fundamental activity of pedagogic interaction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/projects/osl-final/introduction/workshop_model/ Accessed 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of OSL activities include 'still image' or 'tableau', in which participants embody sometimes abstract ideas; 'theory building', in which participants create a narrative, a concept, or a 'theory' from a collection of materials relating to a particular subject; and simulation and roleplay.

==Theory==

OSL employs methods such as ‘enactive’ learning, ‘kinaesthetic’ learning and the various styles of teaching developed by practitioners such as [[Augusto Boal]] and [[Paulo Freire]]. Theoretically the work owes its greatest debt to thinkers like [[Vygotsky]], [[Howard Gardner]], and [[David A. Kolb]]. In terms of the suggestion that it promotes a style of teaching and learning that seeks to undermine a Cartesian separation of mind and body, its greatest debt is to work in Neuroscience by academics such as [[Andy Clark]], and to phenomenology of the kind developed by [[Husserl]]. OSL also has connections to ‘applied drama’, ‘applied theatre’, or ‘applied performance’. OSL can include any kind of learning in which the participants are required to engage with both mind and body in a workshop environment, and promotes a combination of 'mindfulness' and 'playfulness'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/projects/osl-final/ OSL website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

OSL approaches are often dependent upon removing obstacles and mediations between bodies and minds. They can have a positively disruptive relationship to digital technologies. Where participants in challenging learning situations might ordinarily seek escape into the internet, OSL brings them back to a more immediate and unmediated presence. This has the potential to frame and question digitally-dependent habits, if handled carefully. Technology may then be reintroduced, carefully and with conscious awareness of potential effects, to extend the time and place in which OSL occurs and has effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1272">A '''permission slip''' is a form that a [[school]] or other organization sends home with a [[student]] to a [[parent]] in which the parent provides authorization for minor children to travel under the auspices of the school or organization for an event, such as a [[field trip]].

Permission slips are required by law in many places in order for an organization to be allowed to take a student on a trip. While laws vary by jurisdiction, they are generally present in accordance with the laws [[minor (law)|minors]] must be given by their parents or [[legal guardian]]s to be transported by another adult.

Information that may be found on a permission slip may include the student's name, the location where the field trip will occur, and emergency contact info.

==Application to adult students at a school==

Some schools allow students who have reached the [[age of majority]] to sign their own permission slips; other schools continue to require that the  parent of the student must still sign the form.  Many [[adult]] students object to a continued requirement for parental signature, since there is no legal necessity for adults to obtain authorization from their parents to travel or participate in any activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4938">The '''Queensland Certificate of Education''' (QCE) is the certificate awarded to students completing their [[Secondary education|secondary schooling]] in [[Queensland]]. The QCE was introduced in 2008, to replace the Senior Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/senior/certificates-qualifications/senior-certificate|title=Senior Certificate (issued before 2008)|publisher=Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently issued by the Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority (QCAA).

==Structure==
The Queensland Certificate of Education is generally awarded to students completing Year 12, though alternative avenues of study are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/senior/certificates-qualifications/sep/sep-for-non-school-students|title=Senior education profile for non-school students|publisher=Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Queensland courses of study are awarded credits, which can contribute towards a QCE. These courses are divided into:&lt;ref name="Learning Options"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/senior/certificates-qualifications/qce/learning-options-requirements|title=QCE learning options and requirements|publisher=Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Core courses
* Preparatory courses
* Enrichment courses
* Advanced courses
Core courses are the most common form of education undertaken in Years 11 and 12 and include both Authority and Authority-registered subjects. Authority subjects are those whose syllabuses are maintained by the QSA and whose results contribute to a student's [[Overall Position]], which is the ranking used for entrance to tertiary education institutions, whereas Authority-registered subjects are developed from a Study Area Specification. Authority-registered subjects do not contribute to the Overall Position of a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/senior/a-z-subject-list|title=A–Z senior subject list|publisher=Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparatory and Enrichment courses are commonly [[Vocational Education and Training]] (VET) qualifications, which often result in [[Australian Qualifications Framework#Certificates I-IV|Certificate qualifications]]. Advanced courses are often university subjects completed alongside a student's regular secondary schooling.

===Assessment===
Students are assessed based upon the subjects which they undertake. A student's final grade is given as a Level of Achievement, of which there are five:
* Very High Achievement (VHA), roughly equivalent to an "A"
* High Achievement (HA), roughly equivalent to a "B"
* Sound Achievement (SA), roughly equivalent to a "C"
* Limited Achievement (LA), roughly equivalent to a "D"
* Very Limited Achievement (VLA), roughly equivalent to an "E"
Each of these achievement levels are split into 10 rungs, to further differentiate the achievement of individual students. A VHA10 is the highest mark a student can achieve for a subject and a VLA1 is the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsa.qld.edu.au/downloads/senior/snr_qa_mod_sample_completed_form_R6.pdf Sample completed Form R6 - Queensland Studies Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930214645/http://www.qsa.qld.edu.au/downloads/senior/snr_qa_mod_sample_completed_form_R6.pdf |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These marks, along with the weighting of subjects (determined by students' academic performance in the [[Queensland Core Skills Test]]) is responsible in determining a students [[Overall Position]].

==Award==
In order to be awarded a QCE, a student must be awarded at least 20 credits from their studies, in which at least 12 credits must come from Core courses. Core courses not fully completed may also contribute some credits, however the level of achievement must be at least a Sound Achievement (or Pass).&lt;ref name="Learning Options" /&gt; In addition, a student must pass the literacy and numeracy requirements. Even if failing to receive a QCE at the end of Year 12, a student may continue to work towards one, though credits expire after nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/senior/certificates-qualifications/qce/overview|title=QCE overview|publisher=Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student's result in the [[Queensland Core Skills Test]] also appears on their QCE as a letter grade.

'''Rowen House''' was an independent British boarding school founded in 1979 in [[Belper]], Derbyshire. The name was not a misspelling, but a reference to the Utopian thinker and eutopian practitioner, [[Robert Owen]]. This "educational experiment" used the power of the childhood group like [[Summerhill School]].&lt;ref name=nurture/&gt;

==Principles==
It was based on the principles developed by [[A. S. Neill]] at [[Summerhill School]], in turn deriving from those pioneered by [[Homer Lane]] in his [[Little Commonwealth]]. The children which it served were however substantially different.&lt;ref&gt;Purdy.B., (2012) ''The Summerhill Idea and the Working Class''[Journal of Libertarian Education http://www.libed.org.uk/index.php/articles/263-the-summerhill-idea-and-the-working-class]&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill children were those of fee-paying parents, who patronised it for ideological reasons. Rowen House was funded by state education authorities looking for respite care for behaviourally disordered girls from usually socially deprived backgrounds. A particularly apt phrase has been coined for them – "school phobic". Moreover, they were largely entering their teenage years.

Nevertheless, the basic Summerhill principles applied. That even children who resist being taught have an appetite to learn. Moreover, will learn self-control in an environment free of imposed control, where it is negotiated within a mutually supportive social community. In other words, democracy instead of authoritarianism.

==Background==
Its head, Bryn Purdy, had worked at Summerhill and had also been invited to join Wills in his Bromley project. After this, he applied its principles in an inner city "special" school set up by the Local Education Authority for day pupils.

As Shotton&lt;ref&gt;Shotton, .,(1993) ''No Master Highor Low'' {{ISBN|978-0951399736}} Bristol: Libertarian Education&lt;/ref&gt; was later to write ''What unites the Little Commonwealth . . . and Rowen House . . . is the importance attached to personal autonomy, the aversion to systems of reward and punishment, hostility to coercive pedagogy and the fundamental and central belief in [shared responsibility].''

However, in the 1970s, control of state education became more centralised, with more emphasis on what could be termed behaviourist principles. Accordingly, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the semi-formal approach to engaging the children in learning and self-discipline.

==The school==
Accordingly, Bryn Purdy and his wife bought a former orphanage in Belper to develop as an independent school to which various local authorities might refer children, specifically adolescent girls, who were finding it impossible to progress in more conventional educational settings.

Such children may have been subjected to a family background of neglect or violence, and to sustained bullying at school, to which they have reacted in the only way they knew how. As Purdy puts it ''"a teacher, through his or her headteacher, will bring the child to the attention of an educational psychologist, who may engage the help of a social worker. Then, after five years or so, when the child is at the end – '''no,''' when the child has '''cut''' his tether – the psychiatrist will call a Case Conference… the odd headteacher or social worker, or educational psychologist, who cares for the individual child, will press for his or her welfare, and, eventually, the child will arrive at our school."''

Purdy uses the term "unschool"… ''"When a child has suffered failure, for whatever reason, at school or at home, we feel that we must offer her something different, perhaps radically different, from the arena of failure in the past…  We aim to enter into as egalitarian a relationship with her as possible.  One of the means of achieving this is to hold an assembly each day which we call the 'Moot'."''&lt;ref&gt;Purdy, B., (1989) ''Girls Will be Grils: A Fictive Documentary About a Community of Adolescent Girls Under Stress,'' {{ISBN|978-0-9514336-0-7}} [http://www.eutopism.co.uk/books/01grils.htm Belper: Llaneill Press.]&lt;!-- the title is not a misprint --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Moot" was the morning meeting central to the school day, where each individual felt free to raise any issues that concerned it. Unlike other previous schools, such as the "Little Commonwealth", fining was not imposed for misdemeanours, since the children had virtually no money. Instead restitution was sought and agreed with the other children.

Initially characterised by outbursts of shouting and emotionality, frequently bordering on violence, as Purdy&lt;ref&gt;Purdy. B., (1997) ''A.S.Neill: Bringing happiness to some few children, {{ISBN|978-1-900219-03-7}} Nottingham: Educational Heretics Press.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it ''Each day, week, month, brought less shouting, less wrangling; more rationality, more humour.  The character of the Moot changed from a judicial 'court' to an exercise of conviviality, a daily conversation between friends.''

Although classes were voluntary, most children attended at least some of them most of the time and since each child was there voluntarily the lessons tended to be productive. Among the many parents, teachers, educationalists&lt;ref name=nurture&gt;[http://www.gender.org.uk/gendys/bookshop/harris.htm The Nurture Assumption]
Why Children Turn Out The Way They Do, Judith Rich Harris, 1999, {{ISBN|0-684-85707-3}}. Retrieved June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was an MP who felt moved to express praise in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number went on to attend a local college part-time to progress to 'A' level and, after leaving, some have gained degrees at university.Children who would have been otherwise deserted by the educational system have gone on to successful lives.&lt;ref&gt;Purdy. B., (2012) ''Some Virtuous Circles,'' [Journal of Libertarian Education http://mx1.libed.org.uk/index.php/articles/260-some-virtuous-circles]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] however, introduction of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] became compulsory.  The [[Office for Standards in Education|Inspectorate of Schools]] insisted that the Moot be removed from the timetable and that attendance at class be compulsory. This was exactly the environment that the children had come from, and with which they had been unable to cope.  While schools like Summerhill were sufficiently well known and well connected to continue (and won a ground-breaking tribunal appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 March 2000|title=Summerhill closure threat lifted|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk./1/hi/education/688152.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it became impossible for Rowen House to continue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4766">'''SESI Mathematics''' is a project developed by [[FIRJAN System]] with the aim of improving the teaching of math for high school students. The program consists of a series of initiatives, from the organization of training courses for teachers and distribution of educational kits, to the providing of physical spaces for students of [[SESI Rio]] and [[SENAI Rio]] network, as well as for those from selected state schools. Although the project has the pretension of being expanded to other Brazilian states, nowadays it only operates in the states of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Bahia]].

== History ==
SESI Mathematics was launched in 2012 by SESI Rio. The program counted on an initial investment of R$ 10&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The equivalent of US$ 4,525&amp;nbsp;mi in July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caxiasdigital.com.br/blog/firjan-lanca-programa-sesi-matematica-com-investimento-inicial-de-r-10-milhoes/|title=FIRJAN lança programa SESI Matemática com investimento inicial de R$ 10 milhões (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=30 September 2012|website=Caxias Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created based on the ''Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional'' (read "Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education"), motivated by the poor performance of Brazil in national&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebc.com.br/infantil/para-educadores/2013/01/rio-de-janeiro-ira-sediar-museu-de-matematica|title=Rio de Janeiro irá sediar museu de matemática (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=14 January 201|website=Portal EBC – Empresa Brasil de Comunicação}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international reviews, as well as in researches&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Related research: [http://www.firjan.org.br/lumis/portal/file/fileDownload.jsp?fileId=2C908CEC30E85C9501311ECC86C85567 "O que falta ao trabalhador brasileiro" (PDF – 243KB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519184700/http://www.firjan.org.br/lumis/portal/file/fileDownload.jsp?fileId=2C908CEC30E85C9501311ECC86C85567 |date=2014-05-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that indicated a lack of skilled people to work in areas related to the exact sciences, which require mastery of [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aconteceempetropolis.com.br/2014/02/17/programa-para-facilitar-o-aprendizado-de-matematica-sera-implantado-na-rede-municipal-de-ensino/|title=Programa para facilitar o aprendizado de matemática será implantado na rede municipal de ensino (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=17 February 2014|website=Acontece em Petrópolis, Portal de notícias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an agreement was signed between SESI Bahia and the [[List of Governors of Bahia|Government of Bahia State]] to extend the project to the schools of the state of [[Bahia]].&lt;ref name="bahia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correio24horas.com.br/detalhe/noticia/escolas-baianas-vao-adotar-sesi-matematica/|title=Escolas baianas vão adotar SESI Matemática (in Portuguese)|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=10 July 2013|website=Correio}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the project won the Idea Brasil award in the "[[Visual design|Design]] Strategy" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anacouto.com.br/pensamentos/novos-premios-idea-brasil-2013-2 |title=Novos Prêmios – Idea Brasil 2013 (in Portuguese)|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=2013|website=Ana Couto Branding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
The project's initiatives make use of online interactive technologies such as educational games as a way to encourage the teaching of students.

The games are developed by the English company Mangahigh.&lt;ref name="bahia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rj.gov.br/web/seeduc/exibeconteudo?article-id=1240549|title=Alunos do C. E.

== SESI Mathematics House ==
In partnership with the ''[[Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada]]'' (read "National Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics"), one of the initiatives of the project is the construction of a public space dedicated to temporary and permanent exhibitions of themes related to mathematics, among other activities. The space will be located at [[Barra da Tijuca]] (Rio de Janeiro, Brasil) and is scheduled to open in 2015.

'''Segs4Vets''', a continuing program which began in 2005, is a grass-roots effort sustained and administered by volunteers in the United States that provide [[Segway PT]] vehicles to disabled United States military personnel. The program which made its first presentation in September 2005 to three recipients who had sustained injuries in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] (OIF), was conceived and implemented with the assistance of Gen. Ralph "Ed" Eberhart, USAF (Ret), President of the Armed Forces Benefits Association.

Following its first presentation, the Segs4Vets program began the process of seeking a waiver which would allow the presentation of Segway's to active-duty military personnel who had been severely injured and permanently disabled while serving in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] (OIF) and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF). In August 2006, the Segs4Vets program became the only recipient of a blanket waiver from the United States military allowing a donation in excess of $1000 to active-duty military personnel.

The Segs4Vets program provides successful candidates with a universally designed mobility device which aims to draw attention away from their disability. The Segway is a tool that aims to help many of the mobility issues facing our disabled veterans, in a manner which is psychologically uplifting and physically beneficial. Since 2005, the organization has provided over 1200 Segways to wounded veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us/wounded-troops-get-free-segways-in-annual-ceremony-honoring-memorial-day-1.222290 |title=Wounded troops get free Segways in annual ceremony honoring Memorial Day |publisher=stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Severely Injured Marines and Sailors Initiative (SIMS)==
In May 2006, Colonel William J. O'Brien, USMC (Ret), the Director of the Department of the Navy's Severely Injured Marines and Sailors Initiative (SIMS), a pilot program enacted under Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy H.C. [[Barney Barnum]], to facilitate the full integration of injured service members into the Marine Corps and Navy, or to assist in their transition into the private sector, became aware of the Segs4Vets program. In July 2006, the small staff of the SIMS program, Colonel O'Brien, HMC Christine Jensen, USN, and Joseph Wade began collaborating with the Segs4Vets program to encourage it to serve more OEF &amp; OIF severely injured.

The results of this collaboration resulted in the first major Segs4Vets presentation ceremony on December 7, 2006 during a SIMS luncheon at the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia. In May 2007, the SIMS program concluded its work having identified gaps in coverage for the severely injured and recommended solutions for those deficiencies. However, that first Segs4Vets presentation ceremony set a standard for future Segs4Vets ceremonies held twice annually in Washington DC, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA. Colonel O'Brien, HMC Jensen, Joe Wade, and now retired Secretary Barnum continue to play an active role in the Segs4Vets program.

==Training Assessment Programs==
In 2006, the program began setting up training and assessment programs at military medical centers which provided rehabilitative care for OEF and OIF severely injured. These centers include [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in February 2006, [[National Naval Medical Center]] in May 2006, [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] in November 2006 and the Naval Medical Center San Diego in November 2008.

'''Seven Myths about Education''' is a book about education by [[Daisy Christodoulou]].

'''Sex differences in social capital''' are debated differences between men and women's ability to achieve their aims through social constructs such as trust, norms and networks.&lt;ref name=laurie&gt;Laurie, Nina; Andolina, Robert; and Radcliffe, Sarah (2005) 'Ethnodevelopment: Social Movements, Creating Experts and Professionalising Indigenous Knowledge in Ecuador' Antipode 37(3): 470-496&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social capital]] is often seen as the missing link in development; as social networks facilitate access to resources and protect the commons, whilst co-operation makes markets work more efficiently.&lt;ref name=putnam&gt;Putnam, Robert. (1993) Making Democracy Work. Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social capital has been thought of as women's capital as whereas there are gendered barriers to accessing economic capital, women's role in family, and community ensures that they have strong networks.  There is potential that the concept can help to bring women's unpaid 'community and household labour',&lt;ref name=moser&gt;Moser, Caroline (1993) Gender Planning and Development: Theory, Practice and Training London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; vital to survival and development, to the attention of economists.  However, research analysing social capital from a gendered perspective is rare, and the notable exceptions are very critical.&lt;ref name=molyneux&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x/abstract Molyneux, Maxine (2002) Gender and the Silences of Social Capital: Lessons from Latin America Development and Change 33 (2):167-188]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maclean&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x/abstract Maclean, Kate (2010) 'Capitalising on Women's Social Capital? Women-targeted Microfinance in Bolivia' Development and Change 41 (3) pp 495-515]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rankin&gt;[http://zunia.org/uploads/media/knowledge/Critique%20of%20Microfinance.pdf Rankin, K (2002) Social Capital, Microfinance and the Politics of development Feminist Economics 8 (1) pp 1-24] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316174707/http://zunia.org/uploads/media/knowledge/Critique%20of%20Microfinance.pdf |date=2012-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To summarise the debate, it is argued that [[communitarianism|communitarian]] theories of social capital naturalise the labour that women put into maintaining social networks and take advantage of rather than valorise their work in the community and family.&lt;ref name=molyneux/&gt;&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt; Communitarian theories of social capital are the most prominent in development literature (mostly inspired by Putnam's 1994 work) and it is assumed that an increase in social capital is inherently good and can support political participation and market efficiency.  Social capital is increased by building and fortifying the traditions and norms that underpin reciprocity, co-operation and trust.  Whilst this could be seen to valorise the feminised role in maintaining these norms and traditions that is overlooked by development theories based on increasing GDP and getting the prices right, it could also be argued to ossify patriarchal traditions and norms and rely on women's naturalised, unpaid labour in the household and community.

Assuming that social capital is inherently good overlooks hierarchies, power dynamics and difference within 'communities' and groups, and that norms can be downward levelling as well as supportive.&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt;  A [[Marxism|Marxist]] approach, inspired by the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (Bourdieu 1985), can bring out the 'downside' to social capital,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-7660.00212/abstract Mayoux, Linda (2001) 'Tackling the Downside: Social Capital, Women's Empowerment and Microfinance in Cameroon' Development and Change 32 pp 435-464]&lt;/ref&gt; and is argued to be crucial if the concept of social capital is to valorise rather than exploit women's labour.  Network theorists define social capital as 'aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network' (Bourdieu, 1985: 248), allowing the relationship between social networks and economic resources to be examined, and potentially exploitative or restrictive traditions, norms and relationships to be identified.&lt;ref name=rankin/&gt;

Other critics claim that the concept of social capital is wholly inappropriate to the feminist project.  Rather than being trapped in a paradigm that feminists have sought to problematise,  gendered critiques of value and the economy would do better to draw on the work of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] than Bourdieu (Adkins 2005), or focus on economic diversity rather than how social capital supports capitalo-centric development (Gibson Graham 1996).  However, given the prominence of social capital on the development agenda and the plethora of policy and academic work that refers to the term, it seems vital that the gendered dimensions of the debate be highlighted.

'''The Christian Brothers College of Montevideo''', commonly referred as Stella Maris College – Christian Brothers or just Christian, is a private, [[co-educational]], [[not-for-profit]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school run by the [[Christian Brothers of Ireland]]. The school, is located in the residential [[neighborhood]] of [[Carrasco Norte]], [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. The school's head master is Patricia Ponce de Leon. The school is a member of the [[International Baccalaureate Organization]] ([[International Baccalaureate Organization|IBO]]), currently offering the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma Program]] ([[International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme|IBDP]]).The College also offers valuable international exams such us the IGCSE programs and the A levels. It has a very long list of distinguished former pupils, including economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even [[Formula One|F1]] champions.

The school has also played an important part in the development of [[rugby union in Uruguay]], with the creation of [[Old Christians Club]], the school's [[alumnus|alumni]] club.

== Location ==

The school is located in the south-east [[neighborhood]] of [[Carrasco Norte]] in [[Montevideo]]'s metropolitan area.

== History ==

It was founded in 1955 by the Christian Brothers, the founders also of [[Colegio Cardenal Newman|Cardinal Newman College, Buenos Aires]].

By then many Uruguayans upper class Catholics were unhappy with the educational system of public schools were concerned that their children receive religious education. Between 1953 and 1954 efforts were made to the Christian Brothers for the congregation to be installed in Uruguay, and founded a school for boys in the exclusive suburb of Carrasco.

This created a committee composed of the Moor family, Davie, Surraco Germain, Manuel Pérez del Castillo and Stella Ferreira, Adolfo Gelsi Bidart, Enrique Rozada, Antonio Barreiro, Conrad Hughes, Francisco Ferrer, Rodolfo Anaya, Antonio Galan, Eduardo Strauch and Jorge Alvarez Olloniego. They also collaborated Gallinal Alberto Heber, William Strauch, Roberto Houni, Jorge Eduardo Aznárez and Berenbau.

After arduous negotiations, in early 1955, from Nairobi, Brothers Nairobi J. I. Doorley and J. V. Ryan arrived, with a mission to make final arrangements for the opening of the new school. They rented a house located at 6585 Republic of Mexico Promenade Corner Puyol. Brother Doorley returned to Buenos Aires and was replaced by Brother P. C. Kelly. Shortly after, Brothers J. V. O'Reilly and H. G. McCaig arrived.

Classes began on May 2, 1955. That year a polio epidemic forced authorities to postpone the start of courses. Brother Patrick Kelly, a devotee of the Virgin Mary and, since the school was facing the sea, decided to call it "Stella Maris", as the parish in the area.

The playground for physical activities and sports Carrasco was the beach in front of the house. Later, the Carrasco Polo Club allowed the use of their courts. The school grew rapidly. Of 93 students in 1955 went to 137 in 1956 and 279 in 1958. In 1957 he joined another house on the same block, in Potosi 1536, in the depths of the house of Puyol and the Rambla. In 1959 he began teaching school, with a first year and four teachers.
On March 12, 1961 opened the school's current location on the street Tajes Max, with the blessing of Cardinal Antonio María Barbieri. In late 1962 he graduated the first generation of students in fourth grade.
In 1963 he implemented the system of "Houses" (Casas), which identifies all the students into four groups: Prior, Sion, Iona and Newman, each with a color identificatorio. In 1972 the building was expanded, adding a new section for high school. In 1976 this area was completed with the construction of a second plant to high school, which includes a library and laboratories for physics, chemistry and biology.

In 1985 he joined the first generation of women to high school and, since 1989, joined the first generation of girls to primary school preparatory. Since that year the school became gradually to be mixed at all levels and have three groups by grade rather than the existing two. In 1991 the school added preschool from age four.
The Christian Brothers are not currently residing in Uruguay. In 1998 he left the school, although the institution remains the property of Edmund Rice Education Association, whose local address part three brothers of the congregation.

== The Andes Accident of 1972 ==
{{main|Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571}}

The school gained accidental fame when its [[Old Christians Club|alumni rugby team]] flew on [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]], which crashed into the [[Andes mountains]] on October 13, 1972. The story of the crash and rescue was first told in the 1974 book ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]'' and more recently in the 2006 book ''[[Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home]]''. The school also appeared in the documentary, ''[[Alive: 20 Years Later]]''.

Twelve of the 45 people on board the plane died in the crash, and more died of their injuries later. Another 8 perished in an avalanche.  The remaining survivors endured hunger, crash-related injuries, altitude sickness, and [[temperatures]] that fell to 30 degrees below zero at night.  On their eighth day in the mountains, they heard on the radio that the authorities had stopped searching for them.  When their scarce food reserves were gone, they were forced to eat those who had died in the crash.

On December 12, 3 of the remaining survivors set out to find help, hiking west across the [[Andes Mountains]] to reach [[Chile]].  After scaling the nearly 17,000-foot Mt. Seler, they realized that the trek for help would take them much longer than they had thought.  Therefore, to conserve their limited food supply, one of them returned to the crash site and the other two continued hiking west.

On 21 December 1972, the ninth day of their journey, they were found by [[huaso]]s who grazed livestock in the high country, and the next day, the world learned of the 16 survivors who had beaten death for 72 days in the [[Andes mountains]], in part by resorting to cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viven.com.uy/571/eng/accidente.asp Alive : The Andes Accident 1972 | Official Site|&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walden's Path | The Magnet School follows Studio Based Learning developed by John Dewey.

'''''The Novel: An Introduction''''' is a general introduction to [[narratology]], written by [[Christoph Bode]], [[Full Professor]] and Chair of Modern English Literature in the Department of English and American Studies at [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]]. The first edition of '''''Der Roman''''' was published 2005 at [[A. Francke Verlag]] ([[Uni-Taschenbücher|UTB]], [[Tübingen]] and [[Basel]]) in [[German language|German]]; in 2011, the second revised and extended German edition followed, as well as the English translation.

== Content ==
A [[preface]] precedes the nine thematic chapters; [[reference]]s and an extensive and commented [[bibliography]] conclude the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-graduates.net/wps/pgn/kd/det/KULT_online/1/924/bode-christoph-der-roman-eine-einfuumlhrung-stuttgart-utb-2005/ ''Der Roman'', a revision by Melina Gehring (in German)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928064820/http://www.post-graduates.net/wps/pgn/kd/det/KULT_online/1/924/bode-christoph-der-roman-eine-einfuumlhrung-stuttgart-utb-2005/ |date=2016-09-28 }}; Website  of [[Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen]]; retrieved August 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preface ===
The preface encourages a departure from the purely formal and narrow text analysis by repeatedly asking the question "What's the difference ?": What kind of effect would have resulted, if the narrator had described certain people, situations or circumstances in a different&lt;ref&gt;E. g. perspective, succession, tempus etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  way? And why did he or she choose not to do this? Taking this approach, the analysis proceeds from the ''How'' to the ''What''—and not vice versa. Acknowledgements conclude the preface.

=== Narrative theory and analysis of novels ===
Here, each thematic chapter is described in a short summary without quoting the various literature examples in the text of ''The Novel: An Introduction''.

==== Beginnings - What Do You Expect? ====
The chapter introduces the topic. It discusses the "beginning" and the "meaning" of a novel, the socio-cultural conventions/rules and the methodology of linking the individual events, which may be used in this narrative form, as well as the interactions of these elements. As a special case the [[autobiography|autobiographical novel]] (it's me, who tells) is treated. Finally, a brief discourse is made on capturing the attention of the novel reader: the very first sentences of the story.

==== The Modern European Novel: Predecessors, Origins, Conventions, Subgenres ====
Here, the historical development of the modern European novel is traced. The terms "fact" and "fiction" are explained, and told fiction, illusion and narrated realism be delineated. The diversity of types of novels is outlined.

==== The Object of Every Analysis: The ''How'' of the ''What'' (Discourse and Story) ====
The introduction to novel analysis is given. A summary table illustrates the thematic terms, which are used by various known narratologists ([[Gérard Genette]], [[Seymour Chatman]], [[Mieke Bal]], [[Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan]], [[Gerald Prince]], and [[Franz Karl Stanzel]]).

==== Time ====
Topics in this chapter are the "narrative time", that is, the approximate time required for the reader to read the novel, and the "[[telling time]]", i.e. the period that is covered by the novel. Their ratio, the "narrative pace" (narrative pace = telling time ÷ narrative time) may be changed several times within a novel by the narrator and thus be used to slow down (here it is important, here we remain longer) or to accelerate (lessening of importance) the narration.

Furthermore, the "order", the sequence of narrated events  - either natural succession or sequence [[anachronism]] ([[Prolepsis (rhetoric)|prolepsis]], i.e. anticipation); [[analepsis]], a flashback) - and the "frequency", that is the repeated narration of identical or equivalent events - discussed. Finally, the importance of using different [[Grammatical tense|tempi]] is elaborated.

==== Characters ====
With examples, Bode analyzes and documents character design and character development in the novel; "figure" means in the broadest sense: a person, a [[protagonist]], a being.

==== Teutonic Rosette or Gallic Taxonomy? Identifying the Narrative Situation ====
This chapter — with more than a quarter of the book the longest — two models of narrative theory, the typological model of [[Franz K. Stanzel]] (Bode:  "Teutonic Rosette") and the narrative theory of [[Gérard Genette]] (Bode: "Gallic Taxonomy"), are explained, compared and commented.

==== Multiperspectivity, Unreliability, and the Impossibility of Editing Out the Gender Aspect ====
This chapter covers aspects and interpretations of multi-perspective narration. It discusses the difficulty to objectively recognize "unreliable narration”, that is, "If the reader has reasonable grounds to distrust a tale". It also highlights the problems of the narrators gender and the described figure within the narrative.

==== Now You See It, Now You Don't: Symbolism and Space ====
Here the challenge is addressed, to recognize symbolism in a novel, meaning "if something appears particularly striking". Symbolism does not necessarily mean "a symbol". It rather refers to recognizing [[allegory|allegories]], [[metaphor]]s, [[metonymy|metonymies]], and to "decode" them, and to wonder why the narrator has just taken this choice of presentation.

"Space" refers to "semantic spaces", i. e. locations (nature, cities, rooms, etc.) described in the plot, which do not only stand for what they are but which the narrator used/constructed in parallel to the figure or the situation of the figure.

==== The End of the Novel and the Future of an Illusion ====
In the final chapter, Bode examines forms of presence or absence of experience(s) of the narrator in respect to his/her narration, the sense, orientation, and sense-making experiments in novels, and finally the future of the printed novel in an environment of ever stronger competition from visual media such as TV, cinema ([[video]], [[DVD]]) and audio available on the [[internet]].

=== Further reading ===
''Further Reading'' contains 16 referenced and annotated (by Bode) book titles on subjects of narrative theory/narratology, perspective structure, narrative text analysis and theory of the novel.

The bibliography contains about 400 references on about 30 pages.

== Reception ==
: "Appealingly wide-ranging in his choice of illustrative texts, Bode offers us tools for understanding how the narrative techniques of novels affect their content. While the book's topical arrangement facilitates selective reading, its lively and accessible style, nicely preserved in this translation, amply rewards sequential reading.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of Halmi's review of the English translation requested by the publisher; [http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405194472.html cited on the Wiley-Blackwell website.]&lt;/ref&gt;"
::'''Nicholas Halmi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-nicholas-halmi Nicholas Halmi, University of Oxford (Faculty of English)]&lt;/ref&gt; University College Oxford'''

: "Moreover, Bode’s clarifications of concepts, jargon and theories, as well as his persuasive emphasis on the ‘possibilities of the generation and construction of meaning’ (p. 256), will make the reader return to this multi-layered and meaningful introduction."
::'''Oana Sinziana Paltineanu,&lt;ref&gt;[https://dsh.ceu.edu/profiles/alumni/oana-sinziana_paltineanu Oana Sinziana Paltineanu, Central European University (Doctoral School of History)]&lt;/ref&gt; in European Review of History: Revue europeenne d'histoire'''&lt;ref&gt;Oana Sinziana Paltineanu: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13507486.2012.695609?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;journalCode=cerh20 Book review - The Novel: An Introduction], European Review of History: Revue européenne d'histoire, p. 487-489, 6th July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

: "With the provocative question "What do you expect?" Christoph Bode sets the tone for this delightful guide to the experience of novel-reading. Ranging from the beginnings of the European novel to twenty-first-century fiction, drawing examples from English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Scandinavian literature, and explicating European and Anglo-American narratological theories, this erudite book remains eminently accessible thanks to its focus on fundamental questions: How do stories begin – and why? Why does fiction evoke reality? How does a narrative manipulate time? Who speaks – and can we believe him or her? What is a symbol and why does it matter? Above all: what's the difference between one way of telling a story and another? In a refreshingly lively style, Bode's ''The Novel'' shows students and readers how to ask meaningful questions about the choices that authors make and how to make sense out of the answers.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of Esterhammer's review of the English translation requested by the publisher; [http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405194472.html cited on the Wiley-Blackwell website.]&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''Roots of Music, Inc.''' is a [[non-profit]] educational organization based in [[Orleans Parish]], [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=sos /&gt; The organization operates an after-school program which provides academic tutoring and music mentoring for at-risk middle school students ages 9–14.&lt;ref name=TP1&gt;[http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2015/09/the_roots_of_music_growing_up.html ''The Roots of Music Growing Up'', Times-Picayune 9-11-15. Retrieved 12-24-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

After [[Hurricane Katrina]], funding for public school music programs, specifically middle schools, was reduced or cut. [[Rebirth Brass Band]] snare drummer, [[Derrick Tabb]] and Allison Reinhardt developed a plan to establish a youth organization for music that would be citywide with the primary objective being to keep young children off the streets and provide a safe haven during peak times of gun violence - 3pm to 7pm. In 2007, Reinhardt and Tabb co-founded Roots of Music, Inc.&lt;ref name=sos&gt;[https://coraweb.sos.la.gov/CommercialSearch/CommercialSearchDetails.aspx?CharterID=787076_4CF52 Louisiana Secretary of State - Roots of Music, Inc.

[[File:Roots of Music drumline field practice.webm|thumb|left|Video of [[Derrick Tabb]] teaching The Roots of Music drumline a marching routine 12/15/15 (HD, with audio)]]Students accepted into the Roots of Music after-school program participate in both academic tutoring and are members of the Roots of Music Crusaders Band. They are transported by bus from about 40 schools in [[Orleans Parish]] Monday through Thursday to the group's headquarters in the [[Tremé]] neighborhood of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=TP1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=offbeat /&gt;

[[File:Rootsofmusic ardenjones brass001.jpg|thumb|Roots of Music instructor, Arden Jones, directing the brass section during practice 11/17/15]]For the first hour and a half of the after-school program, the students receive assistance with [[homework]] assignments and academic tutoring in core subjects as needed. The remainder of the time is dedicated to music education, song rehearsal and field practice ([[marching]]). Members of the [[Rebirth Brass Band]] and other [[New Orleans]] area music professionals support the program through mentoring and marching practice.&lt;ref name=offbeat /&gt;

After music education and rehearsal, the students receive a hot, nutritious meal provided by Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana, a member of the [[Feeding America]] network of [[food banks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://no-hunger.org/kids-cafe-after-school-meals-for-kids-in-need Second Harvest Kids Cafe. Retrieved 1-3-2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; After the meal, the children are transported via bus to their homes across [[Orleans Parish]].

There is no after-school program on Fridays, but the group practices on Saturdays, focusing wholly on music education, [[marching]] and field routines. The students receive a hot meal after Saturday practice and are transported home via the program's buses.&lt;ref name=TP1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gambit&gt;[http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/the-roots-of-music/Content?oid=1256842 ''The Roots of Music,'' Gambit Magazine, Alex Woodward, 2-22-10.

Aside from academic and music education, the organization strives to instill self-discipline, offers mentoring and guidance counseling and has the support of mental health professionals. The program is completely free to the participants and relies on grants and private and corporate donations for sustainability. Roughly 25% of the program's budget is earmarked for transportation services. Lack of transportation was cited as one of the issues plaguing the families of at-risk children in regard to their ability to participate in extra-curricular activities.&lt;ref name=TP1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gambit/&gt; Roots of Music, Inc. holds a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt status.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do IRS.gov Exempt Organization Search, retrieved 12-26-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application process and guidelines==

Students of the Roots of Music after-school program must be between the age of 9 and 14 years old, qualify for free or reduced lunch, and attend a school in [[Orleans Parish]]. The participants must also maintain a 2.5 grade point average in all classes, the same requirement as the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS). TOPS pays tuition and some fees for qualifying college students who chose to attend a select group of colleges in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osfa.la.gov/TOPS_O.htm Taylor Opportunity Programs for Students, Opportunity Award Guidelines.

'''Thomas S. Dee''' is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and the [https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-education-professor-appointed-endowed-chair Barnett Family Professor of Education] at [[Stanford University]], where he also directs the [https://gardnercenter.stanford.edu/ John W.

== Biography==

Thomas Dee earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in economics with a focus on [[public policy]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1990, followed by an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from the [[University of Maryland]] in 1994 and 1997. After his graduation, Dee worked as an assistant professor of economics at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (1997–99) and later also at Swarthmore College (1999–2005). There, he was promoted in 2005 to the position of associate professor and given the direction of the college's public policy programme. In 2010, Dee moved to the [[University of Virginia]] as research professor of education and professor of public policy and economics (2010–12), before further moving to [[Stanford University]] as professor of education in 2012. From 2015 to 2018, Dee directed the Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://cepa.stanford.edu/thomas-dee Profile of Thomas Dee at the Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis. Retrieved March 20, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; (CEPA) and served as Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]]. Additionally, Dee is affiliated with a number of institutions, including the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nber.org/people/thomas_dee Profile of Thomas Dee at NBER. Retrieved March 20, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; (NBER), the [[Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research]] (SIEPR), [[Center for Economic Studies|CESifo]], the [[Danish National Center for Social Research]], the [[American Enterprise Institute]], and the China Center for Human Capital and Labor Market Research at [[Central University of Finance and Economics]]. Furthermore, he has been affiliated with the [[Association for Education Finance and Policy]] and the [[Institute of Education Sciences]]. In terms of editorial duties, Dee sits on the editorial boards of the ''[[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]'' and ''[[Educational Researcher]]'' and has sat on the board of ''[[Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis]]'' in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/personal_cv/cv_dee.pdf Curriculum vitae of Thomas S.

== Research==

Thomas Dee's current research interests mostly revolve around education, including the [[economics of education]], the analysis and implementation of [[educational policy]], school finance, school reform, and [[high-stakes testing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/tdee Webpage of Thomas Dee on the website of Stanford University. Retrieved March 20, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier research has also focused on youth health, e.g. teenage traffic accidents and youth health behaviors such as smoking and drinking. According to [[IDEAS/RePEc]], Thomas Dee belongs to the top 3% of economists as ranked by their research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html#pde619 Ranking of economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc. Retrieved March 20, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on education===

Throughout his academic career, Dee has studied many topics related to education and education policy, e.g. competition between private and public schools, returns to education, and teacher incentives. Analysing the relationship between public school quality and the effect of competition from [[private school]]s, Dee finds that competition from the latter has a significant positive impact on the graduation rates of neighbouring public high schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecoedu/v17y1998i4p419-427.html Dee, T.S. (1998). Competition and the quality of public schools. ''Economics of Education Review'', 17(4), pp. 419-427.]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating the existence of returns to education in the form of [[civic engagement]] and attitudes, Dee argues that educational attainment strongly increases [[voter participation]], support for [[freedom of speech]] and newspaper readership (a measure of civic knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v88y2004i9-10p1697-1720.html Dee, T.S. (2004). Are there civic returns to education? ''Journal of Public Economics'', 88(9-10), pp. 1697–1720.]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the effectiveness of teacher incentives, Dee finds mixed evidence. In his evaluation of [[Tennessee]]'s Career Ladder Evaluation System, which rewarded teachers who increased student achievement, together with Benjamin J. Keys, he finds that the test scores in mathematics of students assigned to career-ladder teachers were 3 percentile points higher than otherwise, but that such an assignment had no significant impact on reading scores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/jpamgt/v23y2004i3p471-488.html Dee, T.S., Keys, B.J. (2004). Does merit pay reward good teachers? Evidence from a randomized experiment. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 23(3), pp. 471-488.]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, his evaluation of IMPACT, the high-powered teacher-evaluation system introduced by [[Michelle Rhee]] in [[Washington D.C.]], conducted with [[James Wyckoff]] finds that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improved the performance of remaining teachers, while financial incentives were effective in further improving the performance of high-performing teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/jpamgt/v34y2015i2p267-297.html Dee, T.S., Wyckoff, J. (2015). Incentives, selection, and teacher performance: Evidence from IMPACT. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 34(2), pp. 267-297.]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Dee has pioneered research on the impact of demographic similarity between students and teachers as well as on the impact of [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]], the flagship education programme of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]].

==== The impact of demographic similarity between teachers and students====

Analysing the impact on students' school achievement of being taught by a teacher of the same ethnic group in [[Tennessee]], Dee finds that assignment of students to a teacher of their own ethnicity significantly increased both black and white students' achievements in mathematics and reading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v86y2004i1p195-210.html Dee, T.S. (2004). Teachers, race, and student achievement in a randomized experiment. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 86(1), pp. 195-210.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vice versa, Dee has also studied how demographic similarity between students and teachers influences teachers' subjective evaluations of student behavior and performance and found students' racial, ethnic and gender characteristics to substantially colour teachers' perceptions of student performance. However, the former two effects mainly appear in conjunction with students coming from poor family backgrounds or living in the [[Southern United States|South]], which provides a strong argument for the recruitment of teachers from underrepresented minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v95y2005i2p158-165.html Dee, T.S. (2005). A teacher like me: Does race, ethnicity, or gender matter? ''American Economic Review'', 95(2), pp. 158-165.]&lt;/ref&gt; This research is complemented by Dee's study of the impact of being taught by a teacher of the same gender, which he finds to significantly improve the achievements of both male and female students as well as teachers' perceptions of student performance and engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/uwp/jhriss/v42y2007i3p528-554.html Dee, T.S.

(2006). The Why Chromosome. ''Education Next'', 6(4).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The impact of No Child Left Behind====

Together with [[Brian Jacob]], Thomas Dee has extensively researched the impact of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) - and its emphasis on test-based school accountability - on students, teachers, and schools. In particular, Dee and Jacob find that NCLB improved the math achievements of younger students, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, but failed to do so with regard to reading, raised school district expenditure, in particular on teacher compensation, and improved the quality of teachers, and resulted in a shift of teaching time towards math and reading as tested subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bin/bpeajo/v41y2010i2010-02p149-207.html Dee, T.S., Jacob, B.A. (2010). The impact of No Child Left Behind on students, teachers, and schools. ''Brookings Papers on Economic Activity'', 2010(2), pp. 149-194.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pam.20586 Dee, T., Jacob, B. (2011). The impact of No Child Left Behind on student achievement. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 30(3), pp. 418-446.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373712467080 Dee, T., Jacob, B., Schwartz, N.L. (2013). The effects of NCLB on school resources and practices. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 35(2), pp. 252-279.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on youth health and youth behaviour===

The other main area besides education on which Dee has conducted research is [[youth health]], e.g. teenage smoking and drinking, sexual activity, and traffic accidents. Analysing how teen drinking and youth traffic fatalities respond to beer taxes, Dee finds that - while results vary substantially between U.S. states - beer taxes are generally ineffective in reducing teen drinking and associated traffic fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v72y1999i2p289-315.html Dee, T.S. (1999). State alcohol policies, teen drinking and traffic fatalities. ''Journal of Public Economics'', 72(2), pp. 289-315.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another study on teen drinking, Dee finds teen drinking and smoking to be complementary behaviours, with the increase in minimum [[legal drinking ages]] (MLDA) from 18 to 21 having reduced the numbers of teen smokers by 3-5% and higher cigarette taxes having lowered the prevalence of teen drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jhecon/v18y1999i6p769-793.html Dee, T.S. (1999). The complementarity of teen smoking and drinking. ''Journal of Health Economics'', 18(6), pp. 769-793.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, while teens facing a lower MLDA were substantially more likely to drink, the raise in the MLDA had no significant effect on educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jlabec/v21y2003i1p178-209.html Dee, T.S., Evans, W.N. (2003). Teen drinking and educational attainment: evidence from two-sample instrumental variables estimates.

'''''Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs''''' ('''VWO''', meaning "preparatory scientific education" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is the highest variant in the secondary [[education in the Netherlands|educational system]] of the [[Netherlands]], attended by approximately a fifth of all Dutch high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steeds meer havo-leerlingen- en vwo-leerlingen|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2334337/steeds-meer-havo--en-vwo-leerlingen.html|website=www.nu.nl|accessdate=10 March 2017|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving primary or elementary school students are enrolled in different types of secondary schools, according to their academic ability. The course is a six-year course and successful completion allows the candidate admission to [[List of universities in the Netherlands|Dutch universities]]. The VWO is therefore a [[matriculation]] exam.

The VWO includes the so-called [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] variant, which differs from the regular VWO variant (also called [[Atheneum (school)|Atheneum]]) in that it has [[Latin]] and/or [[Ancient Greek|Classic Greek]] as an additional, compulsory part of the curriculum (some schools offer additional courses as well). A few schools offer only the Gymnasium variant, called 'Categoraal Gymnasium'. Of all VWO students, around a quarter follow gymnasium, accounting for approximately 5-6% of all Dutch high school students.

== Specialization ==
Prior to 2001, students had to choose at least 7 out of roughly 14 (options varied by school) topics on which they would ultimately take the national examinations. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and a modern foreign language most often, but not necessarily [[English language|English]] were the two compulsory topics, with five topics open for choice, which students picked according to their ability and interest. Students in the Gymnasium substream had to take at least one classical language ([[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]]). For others, the most commonly chosen topics included [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]] (applied and advanced), [[chemistry]], [[history]] and [[economics]] (macro and micro). Less common topics were [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[philosophy]].

Since the 2001 'Phase II' reforms of Dutch secondary education, candidates have to specialize in one or more of four 'profiles' at the start of their fourth year of study in the VWO. They contain a fixed set of topics which form a less fragmented study course to offer students a better and more holistic preparation for their university studies.

An addition to the Phase II is the [[Technasium]] program, in both VWOs (Atheneums and Gymnasiums), acting as sort of a fifth profile. It was originally designed to give students a look into the world of technology oriented professions is based around O&amp;O, Research and Design. Students work together in groups on assignments from actual companies and contests as diverse as designing a building, proposing a product involving solar energy or even developing a plan for the gentrification of an area. For the last two years, the school no longer acts as a contact person, and students must approach companies to find an assignment. The course is finished with a "meesterproef", literally a proof of mastery in which the students spend 160 hours a person on a project. 

In Phase II, all students are required to participate in the following courses: Dutch, English, mathematics (there are four different courses in mathematics: A/B/C/D), Latin or Ancient Greek/an additional foreign language (Gymnasium students are not required to follow an additional foreign language other than English), PE (in Dutch: 'bewegingsonderwijs of lichamelijk onderwijs'), ANW (General Nature Sciences, only in the fourth/fifth class, depending on the school), CKV (a general form of culture and art education in the Atheneum stream) or KCV (classical cultural education in the Gymnasium stream, similar to CKV, except from the fact that it focuses on the classical aspect) and "Maatschappijleer" (only in the fourth class, similar to social sciences). The content of some subjects has also changed: economics has become a total subject, instead of variations between economics 1 or 2, similar to the fact that students no longer have to choose between French 1 or 2 and German 1 or 2 but instead take French and German as whole subjects. On top of these subjects the students have to choose a study profile. The profiles are sets of classes that prepare for future studies. Each profile has a set of fixed and optional classes that can be chosen from.

The four profiles are:
* ''Cultuur en Maatschappij'' (C&amp;M) (literally, "culture and society") emphasizes [[history]], arts, and foreign languages (French, German and less frequently Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew and Turkish). Students following the profile are required to choose an extra foreign language and have to choose between mathematics A and C. Mathematics C is a simplified version of mathematics A, focusing on [[stochastics]] and in a lesser extent on statistics. This profile prepares for artistic and cultural training at the university.
* ''Economie en Maatschappij'' (E&amp;M) (literally, "economy and society") emphasizes history and economics. Students following the profile are required to choose between mathematics A and B, as mathematics C do not give access to economics classes. Mathematics B focuses on algebra and geometry, and sometimes mathematics A and B share content of the taught material, albeit mathematics A is a slightly simplified version of mathematics B in these cases. This profile prepares for economics training at university.
''Students following the first two profiles are required to follow history and in the second profile economics is also required. There are more optional additional courses in the first two profiles than in the last two profiles. The number of optional additional courses varies per school. Additional languages are considered to be part of the first profile, while geography and philosophy can be applied to both profiles.''
* ''Natuur en Gezondheid'' (N&amp;G) (literally, "nature and health") emphasizes biology and natural sciences. This profile requires biology and chemistry classes. You can choose between mathematics A and B, but B is recommended, as Physics (optional) and Chemistry require knowledge of this. This profile is necessary to attend medical training at university. It should however be noted that to study medicine physics is a required course in the Netherlands, and a "natuur en gezondheid" profile with physics and mathematics B doubles as a "natuur en techniek" one.
* ''Natuur en Techniek'' (N&amp;T) (literally, "nature and technology") emphasizes natural sciences. The mathematics B classes focus on algebra and geometry. This profile is necessary to attend technological and natural science training at university and to attend medical school.
The latter two profiles strongly overlap, so that it is possible to technically follow both profiles depending on the student's choice of optional topics. Students following Natuur en Gezondheid can do this by choosing mathematics B and adding physics to their curriculum; students following Natuur en Techniek can do this by adding biology. The main difference between the third and fourth profile is (depending on the school) the possibility to follow economy/geography/philosophy in combination with the N&amp;G profile, or mathematics D/NLT (Nature, Life and Technology) with the N&amp;T profile. It is possible to combine courses, which is quite common&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profielen in het vo|url=https://www.onderwijsincijfers.nl/kengetallen/voortgezet-onderwijs/deelnemersvo/profielen-in-het-vo|website=onderwijsincijfers|publisher=Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Profiles can be combined as well, for instance ''Natuur en Techniek'' with additional biology doubles as ''Natuur en Gezondheid''. Therefore, the four profiles are often put into two groups, the M-line for the first two profiles listed and the N-line for the last two listed.

Students can also choose to do an extra additional course. For instance, a student following ''Natuur en Techniek'' can attend a third foreign language if the school has sufficient facilities to do so or studies it in his spare time and participate only in the mandatory examinations. A student can choose to discontinue that subject, at all times.

== Research==

Steven Barnett's research focuses on the impact and economics of early care and education programmes, with a special focus on the [[Perry preschool]] and [[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]. With regard to the impact of the Perry Preschool Program, he finds that the net present value of the programme is positive due to increased earnings, reduced social welfare costs, delinquency and crime costs, and childcare costs, and that its benefits to taxpayers increased its cost.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, W.S. (1985). Benefit-cost analysis of the Perry Preschool Program and its policy implications. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 7(4), pp. 333-342.&lt;/ref&gt; 20 years later, Barnett has been able to confirm the maintenance of these effects, confirming that preschooling strongly increased the lifetime earnings and decreased the criminal activity of recipients, yielding enormously positive social and private returns on investment (e.g. benefits to the general public, assuming a 3% discount rate, already amount to $12.90 per dollar invested); the by far largest share of the programme's social gain accrues due to the reduction in male crime rates (with Milagros Nores, Clive R. Belfield and Lawrence Schweinhart).&lt;ref&gt;Nores, M. et al. (2005). Updating the economic impacts of the High/Scope Perry Preschool program. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 27(3), pp. 245-261.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Barnett and Belfield highlight the potential of increased preschool investments for the improvement of [[social mobility]], though they emphasize that the potential is strongly tied to the quality of preschool programmes, including highly qualified teachers and small group sizes in preschool.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, W.S., Belfield, C.R. (2006). Early childhood development and social mobility. ''The Future of Children'', 16(2), pp. 73-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20561">'''Writing about Writing (WAW)''', is a method or theory of teaching composition which puts emphasis on reading and writing about writing in the writing course, and reimagines [[first-year composition]] as an "introduction to writing studies." This is not to say WAW only teaches a first-year writing course as if it were an introduction to a writing major, but rather it advocates merging the ''how'' of writing with its practice. An introduction course to a writing major has both a different audience and purpose than a first-year composition course framed in WAW. The development of WAW is largely credited to Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs after the publication of their 2007 article "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."

==History==
Composition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia.&lt;ref name= Carter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Shannon|title=Writing about Writing in Basic Writing: A Teacher/Researcher/Activist Narrative|journal=Basic Writing e-journal|origyear=2009|year=2010|volume=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions"===
In 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed.  This course sought "to improve students' understanding of writing, [[rhetoric]], language, and literacy" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging "more realistic conceptions of writing."  &lt;ref name= DownsWardle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies']|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=58|issue=4|pages=552–584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it's frequently cited by those who have continued the work in the WAW movement.

In the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that "writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt;

The article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about "writing studies", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues.

The authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write "rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt; Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works.

==="Continuing the Dialogue"===
After its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled "Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting
Misconceptions.'" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first-year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being "that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit."&lt;ref name= follow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wardle|first=Elizabeth|title=Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write, "Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand."&lt;ref name=follow /&gt; Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing ''major'' and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, ''Writing about Writing: A College Reader'', which was published in 2011.

==Benefits==
In "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including:&lt;ref name=DownsWardle /&gt;
*an increased self-awareness about writing
*improved reading abilities
*improved confidence as a student
*raised awareness of research writing as conversation

WAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article "Writing about Writing in [[Basic writing|Basic Writing]]," Shannon Carter explains "a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt; She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines.

Many instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled "Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students," Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis—two goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, "Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products."&lt;ref name= Jonikka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charlton|first=Jonkka|title=Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students|journal=Basic Writing Online|origyear=2009|year=2012|volume=8/9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and responses==
As WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and "often in fundamental ways." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

In his response to Downs and Wardle's "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues.

Kutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend "the nuances of the composing process." He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, "While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more." &lt;ref name= Kutney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kutney|first=Joshua P.|title=Will Writing Awareness Transfer to Writing Performance? Response to Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle, 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=59|issue=10|pages=276–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's "dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge",&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Libby|title=Interchanges: Commenting on Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=59|issue=3|pages=503–511|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their "research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once."&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Downs published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out:&lt;blockquote&gt; My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to "FYC as Intro to Writing Studies" is about as magnanimous as their response itself – that is, not remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories – for me, Schwegler and Shamoon – planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable.&lt;ref name=Downs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|title=Response to Miles et al.|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He writes Miles et al. "seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner." His main contentions are:&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;
*Miles et al. seem only to respond to arguments Downs and Wardle didn't make rather than focusing on the ones they did.
*There is a major difference between the type of course he and Wardle advocate from first-year writing and a course that serves as in introduction to a writing major.
*Miles et al. grossly misinterpreted the types of readings that are purposed to be involved in WAW, as they are not all of an academic nature and nowhere in Downs' and Wardle's article do they say that it is.
*In regards to the criticism that first-year writing students will have a difficult time comprehending readings that are also taught to graduate students, Downs states that it's an "admirable goal" of writing programs to support this kind of learning, and cutting first-year students off from this type of learning is "unnecessarily limiting."
He concludes by writing "I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities."&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;

A response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be "lone pioneers" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference [[Peter Elbow]] as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slomp|first=David H.|author2=M. Elizabeth Sargent |title=Responses to Responses: Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2009|volume=60|issue=1|pages=171–175|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CCC/0603-feb09/CCC0603ResponseTeaching.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be "off-putting" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

As previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in "recruiting" more students to become majors in the field.&lt;ref name= Jonikka /&gt;

==''Writing about Writing: A College Reader''==
Published in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as "encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy." &lt;ref name=Bedford&gt;Bedford St. Martin's, [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writingaboutwriting-firstedition-wardle/ Writing about Writing] 10 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing. They list several reasons as to why WAW is a "smart choice" in terms of an approach to teaching first-year composition:&lt;ref name=WAW&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Writing about Writing: A College Reader|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*WAW engages students in a relevant subject
*WAW engages students' own area of expertise
*WAW helps students transfer what they learn
*WAW has been extensively class tested—and it works.

The book addresses several questions geared towards helping the student understand multiple components of writing: Why study writing? How do readers read and writers write?  How do you write? How have you become the readers and writer you are today? How do communities shape writing? How do you make yourself heard as college writer? A mixture of selected readings from both scholars, authors, and students are provided, as well as various activities and discussion questions associated with the readings.&lt;ref name=WAW /&gt;

'''Yatchy''' is an online [[social networking service]] headquartered in [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. Its website was launched on July 15, 2015 by Akshat Jain with his college friend and fellow student Diptesh Pandey. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to their friends, relatives and neighbors, but later allowed public to access it. Since 2016, anyone in general aged 12 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of the website, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. Its name comes from the [[yacht]], meaning  a boat or small ship, usually with sails, often with an engine, built and used for racing or cruising.

After registering to use the site, users can create a user [[User profile|profile]], add other users as "friends", exchange messages, post status updates and photos, share videos, use various web apps, receive notifications when others update their profiles, sell &amp; buy stuffs online from different sellers using Souk e-commerce platform, listen and upload [[music]], create &amp; conduct [[Opinion poll|poll]]s and [[quizzes]], create &amp; participate in [[Internet forum|forum]]s. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into different lists. Also, users can complain or block unpleasant people.{{TOC limit|2}}

== History ==

=== 2011-2015: SkyCloud and name change ===
Akshat wrote a program called skycloud on August 2, 2011 while attending [http://www.sunbeamschools.com Sunbeam English School], Laharatara, as a [[computer science]] project. The software written was comparable to a basic web based [[Operating system|Operating System]] which had its own set of pre-defined instructions, had its own [[software architecture]] and used "various internet [[programming language]]s and scripts such as [[HTML]], [[VBScript]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[XML]]" for [[third party software]] support.

The site was quickly forwarded to several members of the school. Akshat expanded on this initial project by creating a tool ahead of [[graduation]] 1st year exams that allowed users to buy stuffs directly from sellers and users could keep a track of their shopping by logging into their accounts.

The following year, Akshat began writing code for a new website in April 2014. He said that he was inspired by biopics on [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. On July 15, 2015, Akshat launched "[http://www.yatchy.com Yatchy]", located at [http://www.yatchy.com yatchy.com].

=== 2015–present: Public access and site developments ===

These sections optionally link to other social media accounts one has, any blogs one owns or have written or sites one is a contributor to. Customized or Vanity URLs were made available to the public.

=== Dislike ===
When the co-founders of yatchy were developing it, one of the main objectives was to provide users the ability not to express their likeliness about a particular subject but also to provide the ability to show their dislikeness for that subject. Therefore, yatchy has a [[dislike]] button along with the [[like]] button so that users can properly express their views to the world.
