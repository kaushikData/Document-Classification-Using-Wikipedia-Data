'''Bodily mutilation in film''' describes the apparent mutilation for theatrical purposes of a character in a film. Bodily mutilation is most usually portrayed in the context of [[Horror film|horror]], but is also used in other genres, such as medical dramas or war films. It is used primarily either to shock or fascinate the audience of a film, or to add a sense of realism to a film. Improved [[special effects]] in recent decades have seen an increase in the prevalence of bodily mutilation in film.

==Brief history==
===Early years===
[[File:Lon-Chaney-Jorobado.jpg|thumb|Lon Chaney as the phantom in the 1925 film ''The Phantom of the Opera'']]
In the early years of motion picture history, horror was often used in order to attract and intrigue audiences. To frighten and  fascinate the audience was the goal. [[Lon Chaney Sr.|Lon Chaney]] was well known for his portrayals in various horror films, but the subject in focus is his use of makeup to create his ghastly visages. He was known as “the man of 1,000 faces.” (Rickett 2000) Chaney was arguably one of the forerunners of makeup use in horror films. Some others include actors [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] But it was the man behind their makeup, [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]], who made them what they were (Rickett 2000). While these movie makers didn’t make films rife with violence and mutilation, their influence on later film makers was great. Early horror movies focused on suspense and monsters but as realism has progressed, movie makers have focused more on realistically portraying the horrible fate of whoever is unfortunate enough to fall victim to the fell devices.

===Advent of Horror===
Although there was a boom of monster and alien flicks in the 50s and movie makers using make up more for realistic depictions of violence and gore in the 60s,&lt;ref name="Rickett-p212"&gt;Rickett 2000, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; the advent of realism in horror as we now know it arguably began with the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''. This was the first of its kind as far as special effects used realistically to portray gruesome scenes. This movie, created by director [[William Friedkin]] with make up master [[Dick Smith (makeup artist)|Dick Smith]] directing the effects set the stage for countless other such films to be made.&lt;ref name="Rickett-p212" /&gt; After the release of The Exorcist and its subsequent popularity scary movies began to shift and the violent horror flick became a major genre. With effects greats [[Kevin Yagher]], [[Dick Smith (makeup artist)|Dick Smith]], and [[Tom Savini]] behind such classic horror films as ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), and ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978) this genre gained immense popularity (Rickett 2000). This craze peaked during the 80’s went down a little in the 90’s but with the movie ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996) horror movies were back in. As special effects continue to get better, so the horror films continue to grow even more violent, gruesome, and realistic in their portrayals of human mutilation as can be seen in the recent ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' films (2004,2005, 2006, 2007) as well as others such as ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005) and ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'' (2007). However horror films are not the only movies that have worked to realistically portray bodily mutilation.

===War Films===
War movies have often romanticized battle and violence for glory; but after the [[Vietnam War]], many movies worked to portray war in its true form, all the violence, brutality, and even the psychological distress included. This is shown in several films including ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978) and ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989). A great example is the classic film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998). In the beginning of this movie there is a 15-minute scene showing the landing of American troops at Omaha beach. In this scene there are untold amounts of blood and gore as German machine guns literally rip the U.S. soldiers apart. Other war movies such as ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' (2006), ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]'' (2001), and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (2006) work to show the effects of battle on the human body.

===Modern Media===
Nowadays, you can find body mutilation in many different kinds of movies. Some of the more common examples are in movies or shows that depict hospital or law enforcement. As hospital and police movies and TV shows gain popularity and attempt to make the situation more real, they have utilized techniques to make operations and crimes as realistic as possible. This includes breaks, burns, cuts, surgery, and violent attacks. This portrayal is often graphic, but accurate. Regardless of intent, movies have progressed greatly from the early years of Chaney and Pierce in the realistic portrayals of bodily mutilation.

==Notable names==
===Lon Chaney===
[[File:Lon Chaney, Sr. The Miracle Man.jpg|thumb|Lon Chaney Sr., still from The Miracle Man (1919)]]
Although not a pioneer when it comes to mutilation, Lon Chaney was the inspiration for many film makers who were. Born on April 1, 1883 in Colorado  Springs, Colorado to deaf mute parents, Lon Chaney did not have the easiest childhood (Anderson 1997).  However, this did not prevent him from becoming a magician with makeup. Throughout many various films, Chaney perfected his craft. He did his makeup for all the films he was in. Chaney’s makeup kit set the standard for later makeup departments in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1997, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; While his most widely known films are ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), perhaps some of his most important contributions to modern horror films and their emphasis on the mutilation came from his work in lesser known films. For example, Chaney used collodian to make realistic scars and deformities for his characters Singapore Joe in ''[[The Road to Mandalay (1926 film)|The Road to Mandalay]]'' (1926), Ricardo in ''[[Victory (1919 film)|Victory]]'' (1919), and Tiger Haynes in ''[[Where East is East]]'' (1929). Chaney died on August 26, 1930 in Los Angeles, California due to complications with throat cancer (Anderson 1997).

===Jack Pierce===
[[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] did the makeup man behind popular monster creatures ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) (Rickett 2000).

===Dick Smith===
Born on June 26, 1922, [[Dick Smith (makeup artist)|Dick Smith]] is one of the most influential men on the art of makeup. As [[John Caglione, Jr.|John Caglione Jr.]] put it, “No one will ever take over for Dick Smith. In forty-five years of doing makeup, I don’t think anyone’s touched him. He is the heavyweight champion of makeup (Timpone 1996).”  Master of makeup, Smith helmed many movies’ special effects, but he excelled in prosthetics and age makeup. Notable examples are that of [[Marlon Brando]] as the Don in ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and [[F. Murray Abraham]] as Salieri in ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984). He also did age makeup for [[Max von Sydow]] as Father Merrin in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' making this 44-year-old look 74 (Multimedia Publications 1986). In this movie he made maybe his greatest contribution to modern mutilation technique with the 360° turn of Linda Blair’s head. This scene complete with vomit spewing and severe facial distortions set the bar for future film makers. Although possibly his greatest contribution to horror, it was not his last. He later worked on other films including the 1977 film [[The Sentinel (1977 film)|The Sentinel]] in which he coordinated the effects for a gruesome nose and eye slashing (Timpone 1996) among other things.
[[File:Tom Savini 2007.png|thumb|A picture of Tom Savini]]

===Tom Savini===
Known as the King of Splatter (Rickett 2000), [[Tom Savini]] has quite a reputation for his work in horror movies much of which has included severe bodily mutilation in many circumstances. According to [[Anthony Timpone]] in his book ''Men, Makeup, and Monsters'', Savini started his career young. Earlier makeup artists provided him with inspiration. “Lon Chaney became a hero,” he said.&lt;ref name="Timpone-p63"&gt;Timpone 1996 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Drafted into the military during the Vietnam War, he became a combat photographer. He would practice his craft on the men he was with, but also got a taste of true gore. “I’ve seen the real stuff.”&lt;ref name="Timpone-p65"&gt;Timpone 1996 p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; While in Vietnam, Savini saw many gruesome sights including bodies in rigor mortis and even a dismembered arm. This may have provided him with material he would later use in his movies. And he did use gore and violence in his movies. Perhaps this is stated best by Timpone.

“Prior to Savini’s work on ''Dawn of the Dead'', realistic screen slaughter had rarely gone to the unrated extremes it would soon reach in the early 80s with Savini’s guidance. Via his macabre tricks, heads were severed, scalped, axed, exploded, and pierced. Machetes hacked off limbs, fangs tore through chunks of human flesh, and blood bags sprayed gallons of grue. Zombies, ghouls, demons, hideously disfigured maniacs, and other assorted Savini-created monsters racked up endless body counts.” &lt;ref name="Timpone-p65" /&gt;

This master of splatter was behind many horror films’ effects including ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'' (1978), ''[[Maniac (1980 film)|Maniac]],'' ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' (1984), ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' (1985), ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' (1986), and ''[[Two Evil Eyes]]'' (1990). “My job is to create the stuff as realistically as possible.” &lt;ref name="Timpone-p63" /&gt;

===Rick Baker===
[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] is known mainly for his work making ape films (Timpone 1996).  However, he is well known for his work on ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981), specifically the on screen transformation of the main character into a werewolf (Multimedia Publications 2986). While this may not be considered mutilation, the transformation is a radical change from human to monster and therefore evokes many of the same emotions.

===Kevin Yagher===
Mastermind behind the psychotic doll Chucky, [[Kevin Yagher]] is known for his work with animatronics (Timpone 1996). He also did effects for the Nightmare on Elm Street movies 2-4.

===Bob Keen===
[[Bob Keen]] did effects on the movies ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987) and ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990)

===Greg Nicotero===

==Movies and television shows==
''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973)
With the Linda Blair head turn and accompanying effects, this film inspired many film makers.

''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'' (1978)
This may not be a particularly fantastic movie, but the scene where Martin, the title character, slits the wrist of an unconscious girl shows a clever trick used to fool the audience into believing in the realism of the action.

''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978)
This film was very original. In fact, according to effects man Tom Savini, this film was largely improvised during its making. “We’d be sitting around thinking of ways to kill a zombie.” These ways include stabbing one in the ear with a screwdriver, and cutting one’s head to pieces with a helicopter’s rotors.&lt;ref&gt;Timpone 1996, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) and sequels

''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) and sequels

''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' (1981)
With its full on screen transformation and a scene where Eddie Quist gets acid flung into his face before a transformation, this movie shows the human body realistically distorted, and mutilated in the case of the acid, in a way new to film at the time.

''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981)
Released in the same year as The Howling, this movie also showed the change from man to wolf. It also shows some pretty gruesome undead. While released later than The Howling this movie used some innovative techniques developed by Rick Baker and who went on to win an Oscar for his makeup on the film. (Hollywood tricks of the trade page 133)

''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981)
This movie may not have been particularly successful or popular, but the makers were creative when faced with production problems, including having to come up with their own formula for fake blood. This consisted of corn syrup, food coloring, and instant coffee to thicken it (Multimedia Publications 1986).

''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984) and sequels

''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996) and sequels

''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' (1994-2009)

''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998)

''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' (2000- ) and spin offs (Miami, New York, etc.)

''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001)

''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' (2004) and sequels

''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005) and sequels

''[[Hatchet (film)|Hatchet]]'' (2006) and sequels

==Techniques==
The tricks of the trade are what make these effects convincing. The following are a few basic techniques or tricks that have been used to create the image of mutilation.
[[File:Fake blood.jpg|thumb|A jar of fake blood]]

===Blood===
[[Fake blood]] can be made in many different ways. One of the cheapest and easiest can be made with varying recipes including [[corn syrup]] and [[food dye]]. For example, in the movie ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' the makers used a mixture consisting of corn syrup, food coloring, and [[instant coffee]].&lt;ref&gt;Multimedia Publications 1986, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Fake blood is used in nearly every, if not every single, movie that has shown bodily mutilation, be it human or otherwise. Some effective uses of fake blood include use of a [[squib (explosive)|squib]], or small explosive device, with a metal plate between the actor and the squib and a [[package delivery|packet]] of fake blood to simulate the blood splatter that would accompany a [[gunshot]] for example. Another used for fake blood is seen in the movie ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'' when the main character cuts the wrist of a girl. This trick is accomplished by hiding a [[syringe]] or bulb behind the fake weapon and squeezing out the fake blood as the weapon is drawn across the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Multimedia Publications 1986, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scar effects===
Fake scars can be made in many different ways. Actor [[Lon Chaney]] used collodian.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1997, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, with the advent of latex and plastics there are many ways to make fake flesh and scarring.
[[File:Burn 2nd degree 3.jpg|thumb|A light burn]]

===Burns===
Burns are used in many films and correct technique can create a more effective visual. For first degree burns, merely put down a red foundation with a little purple on top. Use skin colored powder to prevent the “burn” from shining. For a second degree burn create fake blistering surrounded by the standard first degree reddening. To create the blistering, you can use petroleum jelly in saran wrap, or using pure gum latex and lifting the center after drying.  Third degree burns are severe and should reflect that in the effect. The skin is charred and broken. This effect can be achieved with the  latex, plastic wax material, or other plastic appliance. Be sure to color the burned flesh convincingly, then gradient from third degree burn, to second degree to first.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe 1995, p. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latex===
[[Latex]] is a synthetic rubber often used in special effects. Foamed latex is sometimes considered the "ultimate in prosthetic appliance."&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe 1995 p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be used in an inflatable bladder effect to make it seem like the actor’s skin is moving or rippling like Rick Baker’s werewolf change effect An American Werewolf in London. This is accomplished by covering an inflatable balloon of some type underneath a covering made of latex, urethane, or plastic molding.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe 1995 p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Latex can also be used to make scar effects or other more blatant mutilation. For example, with latex prosthetics, movie makers can make an actor appear to have more or less limbs than he should. They can also make the actor appear to be horribly wounded with flesh hanging and large gashes. To accomplish these tricks, the actor must first have a mold made of the part of him that will be replicated using latex. Take, as an example, one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. To make this actor seem to be rotting, they need to make a cast. The technicians prep the area of the body, say the face, to be cast. They must cover the hair and coat the eyebrows, eyelashes, and any other hair that can’t be covered with petroleum jelly. Then they must apply the alginate or other comparable substance, completely covering the molding area, keeping the mouth, nose, or both open for breathing. When that is finished, they layer the area with plaster bandages to create the cast. When all of it has dried and settled, they remove the cast from the actor and put it together again to create the mold. After this, they pour plaster of Paris into the mold to create a cast that is exactly like the actors face. From the cast they can get another mold which they then can use to sculpt any prosthetic attachments they need.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe 1995 p. 174-176&lt;/ref&gt; This can include fake limbs, fake skin, or growths. It is important to use the a good adhesive to apply the prosthetic. In his book Vincent Kehoe recommends one that is "easy to apply, set[s] rapidly, be dilutable for use, and be removable with a solvent that is not harmful to the skin.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe 1995 p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DC3 Music Group''' is a multi-media company that specializes in filming live concerts and behind the scenes content from musical artists. It was formed in 2008 by director and producer [[Daniel Catullo]], Peter Bowers, and mobile executive Brian Lisi.

The company's first project was ''[[Live from Amsterdam (DVD)|Live from Amsterdam]]'' by [[Alter Bridge]]. Shot in December 2008 the [[Heineken Music Hall]] in Amsterdam, the DVD was directed by [[Daniel Catullo]] and was released on [[Amazon.com]] in 2009.

==Philanthropy==
DC3 and its staff are active in supporting various charities, most notably ones for Haiti. The trip was known as [[Plane to Haiti]] and DC3 enlisted the support of many artists they work with for this mission, including [[Godsmack]], [[David Archuleta]], [[Julianne Hough]], [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Scott Stapp]], [[Alter Bridge]], and others. They partnered with the [[Wheelchair Foundation]], Medishare, and [[Partners in Heath]]. They transported over 35 medical professionals to Haiti and set up their own medical clinics and treated over 1,000 patients. They were one of the first relief groups to go to Leogone, where the epicenter was only 7 days after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]] that struck Haiti in early 2010.

DC3 is a major supporter of the [[Wheelchair Foundation]], Creative Visions and the Global Adolescent Project. Their staff regularly makes trips to third world countries on relief missions and they often raise money to support these charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archuletafanscene.com/2010/02/04/plane-to-haiti-founder-dan-catullo-thank-you-to-david-archuleta-fan/ Plane To Haiti Founder Dan Catullo Thank You to David Archuleta Fans » David Archuleta | David Archuleta FanScene]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Record==
In 2009 DC3 Music Group produced the DVD ''[[Creed Live]]''. The show was aired to [[United States Armed Forces|United States military troops]] all over the world on the [[American Forces Network]]. DC3 was awarded four [[Guinness World Records]] for this show, the most notable one for the most amount of cameras used in a live concert recording. DC3 used a total of 249 HD cameras to capture the show. The previous record was [[Justin Timberlake]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] with 47 cameras. There was an adjudicator on hand to certify the number of cameras and present the award to the band and the DC3 team on stage in front of over 20,000 fans after the show.  The show was produced by Peter Bowers and Lionel Pasamonte, and directed by Daniel Catullo.

'''''Deep Blood''''', also known as '''''Sharks''''' and '''''Sangue negli abissi''''' (literally: "Blood in the Abyss"), is a 1989 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] [[Exploitation film|sharksploitation]] [[drama (film and television)|drama]].

The credited director Raffaele Donato (as Raf Donato) only directed the first scene, while the remainder of the film was directed and lensed by [[Joe D'Amato]],{{sfn|Palmerini|Mistretta|p=79}} who also co-produced the film through his company Filmirage together with Variety Film.{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}}

== Synopsis ==
On a deserted beach, four boys, Miki, John, Jason and Alan, are told by an Indian the story of the monstrous marine being [[Wakan Tanka|Wakan]] and seal a blood pact, a bond of their friendship and mutual assistance in case of danger.

Ten years later, the boys reunite as young men and decide to go on a holiday together. But a killer [[shark]] ruins their plans. It attacks the beach community and kills John while he is swimming.

The three remaining friends decide to avenge John's death and hunt the beast. Their task will not be easy, since a legend says that the beast is an incarnation of an ancient [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] spirit that has taken the form of a killer shark. The boys set an underwater trap for the shark and lure it into an area in which they have planted powerful explosives, thereby successfully killing the beast.

==Production==
Joe D'Amato had got to know Raffaele Donato in 1975 on the set of ''[[Red Coats (film)|Red Coats]]'' and had later used him repeatedly as English dialogue coach.{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}} He found him again in the United States and wanted him on the project because he needed someone who could speak English well.{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}}

In an interview D'Amato gave for the book ''[[Spaghetti Nightmares]]'', he stated that Donato had wanted to direct a film himself, but had seen after directing the first scene, which also happened to be the first scene of the film at the beach, that this was not what he wanted. D'Amato had therefore finished the film on his own.{{sfn|Palmerini|Mistretta|p=79}}

The film for a time carried the working title ''Wakan''.{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}}  It was announced under the title ''Sharks (The Challenge)'' and as directed by "David Hills" (one of D'Amato's pseudonyms), but D'Amato stated that he finally decided to credit Rafaelle Donato for the release since he himself had already shot many films during that year and wanted to avoid that it became apparent he was doing everything himself.{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}} 

The shark scenes are extrapolated from stock footage bought from the [[National Geographic Society]].{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}} In the scene of the explosion killing the shark, footage from ''[[Great White (film)|Great White]]'' is used.{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}}

== Release ==
The tagline on the cover of a VHS release titled ''Sharks'' reads, "Where sharks prey, the ocean is a bloodbath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sharks VHS cover |url=http://snap361.net/ig-post/1491653652413636988_1646029598 |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, a VHS release was made by Avo Film.{{sfn|Gomarasca|Pulice|p=46}}

In Germany, the film was released by "VPS" on VHS titled ''Shakka - Bestie der Tiefe'' (literally: "[[Shakka (god)|Shakka]] - Beast of the Depth").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OFDb - VHS: VPS (Deutschland), Freigabe: FSK 12 von Shakka - Bestie der Tiefe (1990) |url=https://ssl.ofdb.de/view.php?page=fassung&amp;fid=5759&amp;vid=12565 |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Czech Republic]], the film was released on [[DVD]] by "Řitka video" in 2009, under the title ''Bestie z hlubin''. The DVD contains the Czech dub and the English original version with forced Czech subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdsleuth.blogspot.com/2009/05/joe-damatos-deep-blood-on-dvd-in-czech.html dvdsleuth - Joe D'Amato's Deep Blood on DVD in Czech]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 1999, Italian film critic Marco Giusti called the film a [[Z movie]] version of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.{{sfn|Giusti|1999|p=395}} He thought that the dialogues were slightly ridiculous, but that the small film was likable.{{sfn|Giusti|1999|p=395}}

They brought Dick Vs Dom to the 2015 BST Hyde Park Festival, they had five 20 minute slots where they did a smaller vision of Dick Vs Dom before introducing the next act onto the stage. The duo have a regular slot at Camp Bestival, where they do ''Dick vs Dom'' performing throughout the day, however they didn't return to [[Butlins]] in 2015 due to [[Stephen Mulhern]] touring butlins holiday camps that year.

: ''For the Soviet animation studio see page [[Studio Ekran]]''
'''Ekran''' ({{lang-ru|'''"Экран"'''}}, ''"Screen"'') was a Soviet-Russian type of geostationary [[satellite]], developed for a national system of [[Direct-To-Home]] [[television]].
The first satellite of Ekran series was launched in 1976. Each satellite in the Ekran series was designed to provide one TV and 2 [[radio]] program [[Television channel|channel]]s to [[Cable television|cable]] TV [[system]]s throughout the USSR and to individual home [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]s in northern [[Siberia]]. Ekran's downlink is in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] range. 

Early Ekran satellites used orbital positions in the range from 48 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s E to 95 degrees E, but recent Ekrans, including the current Ekran 20, have been stationed at 99 degrees E. These 3-axis stabilized satellites carry a single 24 MHz, 200 W transponder, feeding a 28 dB gain [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] transmitting on right-hand circular [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] to produce [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]]s in Siberia in the range 50 to 55 dBW at 714 MHz. The corresponding feeder link uses left-hand circular polarization at 6200 MHz. Therefore, almost every householder could receive the TV signal at home from Ekran's [[transponder]] using a simple [[Yagi-Uda]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. There were also various kinds of collective or individual satellite receivers, such as [[Ekran KR-10]], [[Ekran-KR-01]] and Ekran. Latest version of receiver represents a simple individual TV [[set-top box]] itself. A modified version of Ekran was called  Ekran-M. Ekran satellites have been replaced by improved geostationary craft for [[Direct-broadcast satellite|DBS]], such as  Gorizont, Gals, and Express.

On June 23, 1978 the Ekran-2 spacecraft exploded due to a catastrophic discharge of its battery, contributing to the increase in [[Space debris|Space Debris]] on the [[GEO orbit]].

The show premiered on June 1, 2006 with Diaz as the host.

Airing weekly on the ''Epic Fu'' web site and various online distribution channels, the show draws its content from current news stories centered on emerging art, music, technology and web culture.

=== News ===
[[File:Zadi behindthescenes epicfu.jpg|thumb|258px|Host Zadi Diaz behind the scenes during an episode of ''Epic Fu''.]]
Every episode of ''Epic Fu'' begins with host Zadi Diaz at her desk introducing the week's top stories. The news section often includes stories highlighting how technology and the web is affecting our culture in art, music, style and politics. News stories are also submitted by audience members.

=== Music ===
The show typically includes a music video intermission called "Music Video Spotlight" also known as "Sh!t We Like," which highlights an independent or unsigned band or musician.

=== Interviews ===
Interviews appear in the second half of the show and are generally conducted on-location. Guests include web personalities, technologists, artists, musicians, political figures, inventors, authors, television personalities, and off-beat types.

=== Community ===
[[File:Zadi chuckd.jpg|thumb|258px| Diaz with [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] at Comic-Con.]]
The Epic Fu community contributes regularly to the content of each episode in the form of news links, correspondent pieces, and response videos to "Campfire" discussions. The central hub for the show's community is called MIX, currently involving over 4,000 of the show's fans, and is located on the Epic Fu website. There, fans upload photos, videos, music, submit ideas, and begin discussions on forum threads. EPIC FU also uses social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook to connect with fans. The show regularly initiates collaborative projects to involve its community. Some of these have been a collaborative film, flash game battles, Alternate Reality Games (ARGs), and participation in an eco-challenge called ''Seven Days Without Plastic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nathan |url=http://www.greenthinkers.org/blog/2008/08/bpafree_epic_fu_lives_without.html |title=EPIC FU's 7 Days Without Without Plastic |work=GreenThinkers |date=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074119/http://www.greenthinkers.org/blog/2008/08/bpafree_epic_fu_lives_without.html |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating members are incorporated into the show.

== History ==
[[File:Epicfu newmediaexpo.jpg|thumb|258px| EPIC FU Producers Zadi Diaz and Steve Woolf giving keynote at New Media Expo 2008.]]
Epic Fu first premiered as JETSET (also referred to as ''Jet Set Show'') on June 1, 2006 and was geared towards a young audience. [[Amanda Congdon]] and [[Andrew Baron]] were initially tied to the first few episodes of the production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = [[Daniel Terdiman|Terdiman, Daniel]]|url=http://news.cnet.com/Behind-Rocketbooms-breakup-fireworks/2008-1025_3-6093051.html|title=Behind Rocketboom's breakup fireworks|work=Cnet|date=2006-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the partnership dissolved with the ''[[Rocketboom]]'' split in July 2006.

In April 2007, JETSET was the first established web show to sign with web video studio [[Next New Networks]] (NNN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gannes, Liz|url=http://newteevee.com/2007/04/01/jetset-signs-with-next-new-networks/|title=JETSET Signs with Next New Networks|work=NewTeeVee|date=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; NNN took the role of selling sponsorship and handling cross-promotion for the show. In its tenure with NNN, the show grew from 30,000-40,000 views per episode to 3 million views a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas, Michael|url=http://blog.nextnewnetworks.com/2007/12/31/we-did-it-100-million-views-in-one-year/|title=We did it!!! 100 million views in one year!!!|work=NextNewNetworks|date=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Smashface Productions decided to change the name of the show from JETSET to Epic Fu, citing a need to protect their intellectual property with a more original name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Woolf, Steve |url=http://blog.smashface.com/2007/10/from_jetset_into_epicfu_why_we.html |title=From JETSET into EPIC-FU: Why We Did It |work=Smashface Productions |date=2007-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207022947/http://blog.smashface.com/2007/10/from_jetset_into_epicfu_why_we.html |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year with NNN, Epic Fu was contemplating a move to television,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gannes, Liz|url=http://newteevee.com/2008/04/01/ntv-rerun-epic-fu-to-tv/|title=EPIC-FU to TV?|work=NewTeeVee|date=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then signed with West Coast digital studio [[Revision3]] in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=West, Jackson |url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/5013285/revision3-picks-up-epic-fu-after-departure-from-next-new-networks |title=Revision3 picks up Epic Fu after departure from NextNewNetworks |work=Valleywag |date=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327134314/http://valleywag.gawker.com/5013285/revision3-picks-up-epic-fu-after-departure-from-next-new-networks |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was notable because at the time EPIC FU was the highest profile web show to switch from one new media studio to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Whitney, Daisy|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/06/revision3_lands_epic_fu.php|title=Revision3 Lands 'Epic Fu'|work=TV Week|date=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership ended shortly after in December 2008, when Revision3 laid off nine employees, cancelled three original shows and eliminated two of its distribution deals, citing that the shows didn't fit with their long-term plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gannes, Liz|url=http://newteevee.com/2008/10/27/revision3-makes-layoffs/|title=Revision3 Makes Layoffs, as Does Smashface|work=NewTeeVee.com|date=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Epic Fu is independently run and distributed through [[Blip.tv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Learmonth, Michael|url=http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=138164|title=Blip.tv Brings Programs to YouTube, Ads to 'Channel Awesome'|work=AdAge.com|date=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gone Girl''''' is a 2014 American [[psychological thriller|psychological thriller film]] directed by [[David Fincher]] and written by [[Gillian Flynn]], based on her [[Gone Girl (novel)|2012 novel of the same title]]. The film stars [[Ben Affleck]], [[Rosamund Pike]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], and [[Tyler Perry]]. Set in Missouri, the story begins as a mystery that follows the events surrounding Nick Dunne (Affleck), who becomes the primary suspect in the sudden disappearance of his wife, Amy (Pike).

The film had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] on opening night of the 52nd [[New York Film Festival]] on September 26, 2014, before a [[Wide release|nationwide theatrical release]] on October 3. It was received well critically and was a commercial success, grossing $369 million, making it the highest-grossing film by Fincher.

Rosamund Pike's performance was particularly praised, and she received nominations for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]] for Best Actress. Additional nominations included a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]] for Fincher and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe Award]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay|BAFTA]], and [[20th Critics' Choice Awards|Critics' Choice Award]] nominations for Flynn's adapted screenplay, receiving the award for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-announced-updated-1201376916/|title=Golden Globe: 'Birdman,' 'Boyhood' and 'Imitation Game' Top Nominations|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The day of their fifth wedding anniversary, writing teacher Nick Dunne returns home to find his wife Amy is missing. Her disappearance receives heavy press coverage because Amy was the inspiration for her parents' popular ''Amazing Amy'' children's books. Detective Rhonda Boney does a walkthrough of their house and finds poorly concealed evidence of a struggle. The police conduct a [[forensic]] analysis and uncover the remnants of cleaned blood stains, leading to the conclusion that Amy was murdered. Suspicions arise that Nick is responsible, and his apathetic behavior is interpreted by the media as characteristic of a [[sociopath]].

Flashbacks reveal that Nick and Amy's marriage had disintegrated; both lost their jobs in the [[Great Recession|recession]] and moved from [[New York City]] to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, [[Missouri]]. Nick became lazy and distant, and began cheating on Amy with one of his students.  Boney unearths evidence of financial troubles and domestic disputes, and a witness states that Amy wanted to purchase a gun. She also finds a medical report indicating that Amy is [[pregnant]], of which Nick denies knowledge, and a diary supposedly written by Amy highlighting her growing isolation, ominously ending with the fear that Nick will kill her.

Amy is revealed to be alive and well, having changed her appearance and gone into hiding in a distant campground in the [[Ozarks]]. Upon learning that Nick was cheating on her, she resolved to punish him by framing him for her murder. Amy plans the framing in great detail: she befriends a pregnant neighbor to steal her urine for the pregnancy test, drains her own blood to leave traces of evidence of murder and fabricates a diary describing her fear of Nick. She also has Nick increase her [[life insurance]] so it looks like he murdered her for the money. By using the clues in a "treasure hunt" game she and Nick play on their anniversary, she ensures he visits places where she has planted the corroborating evidence of Nick's guilt for the police to discover. She anticipates Nick will be convicted and executed for her murder, and contemplates committing suicide after his conviction.

Nick hires Tanner Bolt, a lawyer who specializes in defending men accused of killing or raping their wives. Nick meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Tommy O'Hara, who says Amy falsely accused him of rape, and gradually deduces Amy's plan. He also approaches another ex-boyfriend, the wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy previously filed a [[restraining order]], but Desi refuses to share any details. When Amy's neighbors at the campground rob her of her remaining money, she calls Desi and convinces him that she ran away from Nick because he was abusing her. He agrees to hide her in his lake house, which is equipped with surveillance cameras.

Nick convinces his twin sister, Margo, of his innocence. After Nick's mistress reveals their affair at a press conference, Nick appears on a talk show to profess his innocence and apologize for his failures as a husband in the hope of luring Amy. His performance rekindles Amy's feelings for him, even as Boney arrests him for Amy's murder. Amy inflicts injuries on herself and uses Desi's surveillance cameras to her advantage, making it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She seduces Desi and kills him during sex by slitting his throat. Covered in Desi's blood, she returns home and names him as her captor and rapist, clearing Nick of suspicion.

When Boney questions Amy about the holes in her story, Amy accuses her of incompetence. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sides with Amy, forcing Boney to back down. Amy tells Nick the truth, saying that the man she watched pleading for her return on TV is the man she wants him to become again. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo, but they have no way to prove Amy's guilt.

Nick intends to leave Amy and expose her lies, but Amy reveals she is pregnant, having [[Artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] herself with Nick's sperm stored at a fertility clinic. Nick doubts the child is his and says he will take a paternity test. He then reacts violently to Amy's insistence that they remain married, but feels responsible for the child. Despite Margo's objections, Nick reluctantly decides to stay with Amy. The "happy" couple announces on television that they are expecting a child.

===Development===
[[File:Gone Girl Premiere at the 52nd New York Film Festival P1070636 (15347765806).jpg|thumb|[[David Fincher]] and [[Gillian Flynn]] at the film's premiere at the 52nd [[New York Film Festival]].]]
''Gone Girl'' is a [[film adaptation]] of Flynn's 2012 [[Gone Girl (novel)|novel of the same name]]. One of the film's executive producers, [[Leslie Dixon]], read the manuscript of the novel in 2011 and brought it to the attention of [[Reese Witherspoon]] (who was originally slated to play Amy) in December of that year. Witherspoon and Dixon then collaborated with Bruna Papandrea to further develop the manuscript—with Flynn's film agent, Shari Smiley, they met with film studios in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Cohen | first=Stefanie | url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303933704577533281470058056 | title=A Surprise Hit Spawns a Movie Deal | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=July 19, 2013 | accessdate=January 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the novel in June 2012, the 20th Century Fox studio [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the book in a deal with Flynn, in which the author negotiated that she would be responsible for the first draft of the screenplay. By around October 2012, Flynn was engaged in the production of the first draft while she was also involved in the promotional tour for her novel. A first-time screenwriter at the time, Flynn later admitted: "I certainly felt at sea a lot of times, kind of finding my way through."&lt;ref name="Gin"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gina McIntyre|title=Thrills, chills for Gillian Flynn in adapting 'Gone Girl'|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-ca-sneaks-gone-girl-20140907-story.html|accessdate=November 16, 2014|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn submitted her first draft screenplay to the Fox studio in December 2012, before Fincher was selected as the director for the project.&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/article2244292.html|title=Author Gillian Flynn says filming 'Gone Girl' went much better than expected|work=kansascity|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher had already expressed interest in the project, and after he finished reading Flynn's first draft, a meeting was scheduled between the director and author within days. Typically, authors are removed from film adaptations following the first draft and an experienced screenwriter takes over; but, on this occasion, Fincher agreed to work with Flynn for the entire project. Flynn later explained: "... he [Fincher] responded to the first draft and we have kind of similar sensibilities. We liked the same things about the book, and we wanted the same thing out of the movie."&lt;ref name="Joe"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joe Berkowitz|title=How Gillian Flynn Adapted Her Biggest Novel, 'Gone Girl,' Into Her First Screenplay|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3036579/how-gillian-flynn-adapted-her-biggest-novel-gone-girl-into-her-first-screenplay|website=Fast CoCreate|publisher=Monsueto Ventures|accessdate=November 16, 2014|date=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As further preparation, Flynn studied screenplay books and also met with [[Steve Kloves]], who wrote the screenplays for the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' series]].&lt;ref name="Joe" /&gt; Fincher also provided guidance and advised the author: "We don't have the ability to gift the audience with the characters' thoughts, so tell me how they're behaving."&lt;ref name="Corn"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Audie |last1=Cornish|title= David Fincher Talks 'Gone Girl,' Avoids Spoilers (Hooray!)|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=353017242|website=NPR|publisher=NPR|accessdate=November 15, 2014|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the production of the final screenplay, Fincher and Flynn engaged in an intensive back-and-forth working relationship: Flynn sent Fincher "big swaths" of writing, which he then reviewed, and Fincher would then discuss the swaths with Flynn by telephone. Eventually, some scenes were rewritten "a dozen times", while other scenes were unaltered.&lt;ref name="Gin" /&gt;

Following the release of the film, Flynn spoke of an overwhelming adaptation process, in which she tackled a 500-page book with an intricate plot; she explained that her experience working for a magazine meant that she "wasn't ever precious about cutting." As a consequence of the distillation process, most of the parental storylines were lost, so the mother of the character of Desi Collings does not appear in the film, and it was not possible to include flashbacks of Nick Dunne's dead mother.&lt;ref name="Vine"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jennifer Vineyard|title=Gone Girl's Gillian Flynn on Cool Girls and David Fincher|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/gone-girls-gillian-flynn-on-cool-girls.html|website=Vulture|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=November 16, 2014|date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the film's ending, Flynn revealed that she experimented with a "lot of iterations". One of the aspects that she was certain of was the presence of the media, which she described as the "third player", alongside Nick and Amy. In Flynn's words: "Once we got to the ending, I wanted it to wrap up quickly. I didn't want 8 million more loop-de-loops ... I had no problem tossing stuff out and trying to figure out the best way to get there."&lt;ref name="Joe" /&gt;

Flynn enjoyed the experience of making the film, and she expressed appreciation for Fincher's involvement, as he "really liked the book and didn't want to turn it into something other than what it already was", and he also reassured her, even when she second-guessed herself.&lt;ref name="Kan" /&gt; Fincher described Flynn's screenwriting work as "very smart", "crafty", and "extremely articulate".&lt;ref name="Gin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Corn" /&gt;

===Filming===
On September 11, 2013, the ''Gone Girl'' film crew began filming [[establishing shot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Gone Girl'' starts filming in Cape Girardeau|url=http://www.kfvs12.com/story/23414551/gone-girl-starts-filming-in-cape-girardeau|accessdate=September 13, 2013 |newspaper= KFVS12.com|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Principal photography]] began on September 15 in [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]], and was scheduled to last about five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Gone Girl'' movie filming scenes in Cape Girardeau|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/09/11/4473370/gone-girl-movie-filming-scenes.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916005139/http://www.kansascity.com/2013/09/11/4473370/gone-girl-movie-filming-scenes.html| archivedate=September 16, 2013| deadurl=yes| accessdate=October 5, 2014|newspaper=KansasCity.com|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sem"&gt;{{cite news|title=Producer: ''Gone Girl'' filming here|url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/2002405.html|accessdate=September 13, 2013|newspaper=semissourian.com|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some interior scenes were filmed in Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="sem" /&gt; with a door that could not be replicated being shipped there from Cape Girardeau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kristine |last=Hansen |url=https://www.realtor.com/news/unique-homes/gone-girl-house-missouri/ |title=Get the 'Gone Girl' House Before It Vanishes From the Market |website=Realtor.com |date=July 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to producer Ceán Chaffin, Fincher took, on average, as many as 50 takes for each scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegas.informermg.com/2014/10/01/gone-girl-movie-review/|title=GONE GIRL Movie Review|publisher=Lasvegas.informermg.com|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Flynn has said that, although Fincher is a visual director, he is meticulous about [[wikt:veracity|veracity]]—Fincher changed a scene in which Amy collects her own blood, as he thought it was unbelievable.&lt;ref name="Vine" /&gt;

Fincher later called Affleck "extremely bright" in regard to the manner in which he drew on his own experience with the media for the character of Nick Dunne. Fincher explained that Affleck "has a great sense of humor and great wit about what this situation is and how frustrating it is". Fincher described the behavior of the media in the film as "tragedy vampirism", but clarified that "''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[NPR]] are not in the flowerbeds of the Dunne house".&lt;ref name="Corn" /&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Gone Girl (soundtrack)}}
[[File:NIN2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Trent Reznor]] co-wrote the film's score.]]
On January 21, 2014, [[Trent Reznor]] announced that he and [[Atticus Ross]] would provide the [[Film score|score]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/trent_reznor/status/425680863968256001 |title=Twitter / trent_reznor: and yes, Atticus and I are |publisher=Twitter.com |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; marking their third collaboration with Fincher, following ''[[The Social Network]]'' and ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]''. Fincher was inspired by music he heard while at an appointment with a chiropractor and tasked Reznor with creating the musical equivalent of an insincere façade. Reznor explained Fincher's request in an interview:

{{quote|David [Fincher] was at the chiropractor and heard this music that was inauthentically trying to make him feel OK, and that became a perfect metaphor for this film ... The challenge was, simply, what is the musical equivalent of the same sort of façade of comfort and a feeling of insincerity that that music represented? [My primary aim was] to instill doubt [and] remind you that things aren't always what they seem to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Leah Pickett|title=Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross – Gone Girl OST|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/10/album-review-trent-reznor-and-atticus-ross-gone-girl-ost/|website=Consequence of Sound|publisher=Townsquare Music|accessdate=11 November 2014|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Critical response===
''Gone Girl'' received positive reviews&lt;!-- NOTE: Do not add "critical acclaim" without a WP:Reliable source supporting it. --&gt; from critics, with Pike's performance in particular earning praise. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 87%, based on 327 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Dark, intelligent, and stylish to a fault, ''Gone Girl'' plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike."&lt;ref name="tomatoes" /&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt; Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a B grade.&lt;ref name="mojo-3921"&gt;{{cite web |title= Weekend Report: Moviegoers Thrill to 'Gone Girl,' 'Annabelle' This Weekend |first= Ray |last= Subers |date= October 5, 2014 |url= http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3921 | publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-david-finchers-gone-738181 |first=Pamela |last=McClintock |title=Box Office: David Fincher's 'Gone Girl' Tops 'Annabelle' With Career-Best $38M |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 5, 2014 |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]]''{{'}}s critics praised the direction, script, editing, score, visual style, and performances, particularly from Pike, Affleck, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon, and Missi Pyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kyle Buchanan |author2= Lindsey Weber|title=What Were the Best Parts of Gone Girl?|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/what-were-the-best-parts-of-gone-girl.html|website=Vulture|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=December 4, 2014|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: "Superbly cast from the two at the top to the smallest speaking parts, impeccably directed by Fincher and crafted by his regular team to within an inch of its life, ''Gone Girl'' shows the remarkable things that can happen when filmmaker and material are this well matched."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Gone Girl' finds David Fincher at delightfully twisted best|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-gone-girl-review-20140926-column.html |first=Kenneth |last=Turan |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 25, 2014 |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' called the film a "brilliantly glacial adaptation ... This may not be the perfect film—but it is a perfect adaptation".&lt;ref name="TheEcon" /&gt;

Joshua Rothman wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that he enjoyed the film "in all its abstract, intellectual, postmodern glory" and that, similar to other post-modern narratives, the film adaptation is "decisively unreal ... [the] heroes and villains in Fincher's ''Gone Girl'' aren't people but stories". Rothman, who draws parallels between ''Gone Girl'' and Fincher's 1999 adaptation ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', decides that the film is ultimately a farce and has resonated with filmgoers because it expresses "a creepy, confused, and troubling part of us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joshua Rothman|title=What "Gone Girl" Is Really About|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/joshua-rothman/gone-girl-really|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=November 16, 2014|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Lane]] of ''The New Yorker'' wrote: "At first blush, ''Gone Girl'' is natural Fincherland ... so why doesn't the movie claw us as ''The Social Network'' did? Who could have predicted that a film about murder, betrayal, and deception would be less exciting than a film about a website?"&lt;ref name="theny" /&gt; ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s Ed Gonzalez awarded the film two out of four stars, concluding: "Fincher and Flynn should have gone further and truly grappled with the real horror that, by giving his relationship with Amy another chance, Nick is indulging in one of the great myths of feminism: that it emasculates men. Rather than undermine that noxiousness, Fincher enshrouds it in funereal brushstrokes that cast his ''Gone Girl'' as a fashionable tumbling into an abyss of willful denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ed Gonzalez|title=Film Review: Gone Girl|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/gone-girl|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=November 11, 2014|date=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to some of the criticisms of the film, Flynn said this: "The whole point is that these are two people pretending to be other people, better people, versions of the dream guy and dream girl, but each one couldn't keep it up, so they destroy each other".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maureen Dowd]] (12 October 2014), "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-lady-psychopaths-welcome.html Lady psychopaths welcome]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;SR11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender themes===
In a 2013 interview with ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' writer Novid Parsi, who described the ending of the novel as "polarizing", Flynn explained that she wanted the novel to counter the notion that "[["Women are wonderful" effect|women are naturally good]]" and to show that women are "just as violently minded as men are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Novid Parsi|title=Gillian Flynn on Gone Girl – Interview|url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/books/gillian-flynn-on-gone-girl-interview|website=Time Out Chicago|publisher=Time Out Media|accessdate=November 11, 2014|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2014 interview, Flynn admitted that the critical gender-related response did affect her: "I had about 24 hours where I hovered under my covers and was like: 'I killed feminism. Why did I do that? Rats. I did not mean to do that.' And then I very quickly kind of felt comfortable with what I had written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cara Buckley|title=Gone Girls, Found Talking With the Authors of 'Gone Girl' and 'Wild'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/arts/talking-with-the-authors-of-gone-girl-and-wild.html|accessdate=November 20, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 3, 2014, blog post for ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'', Natalie Wilson argues that by not addressing Amy's [[privilege (social inequality)|social privilege]] which affords her the "necessary funds, skills, know-how and spare time" to stage a disappearance—''Gone Girl'' is the "crystallization of a thousand [[Misogyny|misogynist]] myths and fears about female behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Natalie Wilson|title=Blog: What's Missing From the Gone Girl Debate?

In an October 6, 2014, article titled "''Gone Girl''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Biggest Villain Is Marriage Itself", ''Jezebel''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Jessica Coen wrote: "Movie Amy pales in comparison to the vivid character we meet in the book. Strip away Book Amy's complexities and you're left with little more than 'crazy fucking bitch.' That makes her no less captivating, but it does make the film feel a lot more misogynistic than the novel."&lt;ref name="Jez"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jessica Coen|title=Gone Girl's Biggest Villain Is Marriage Itself|url=http://jezebel.com/gone-girl-s-biggest-villain-is-marriage-itself-1642978659|website=Jezebel|publisher=Kinja|accessdate=November 11, 2014|date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coen concedes that this did not negate her enjoyment of the film, "as we ladies are well accustomed to these injustices."&lt;ref name="Jez" /&gt; ''Time''{{'}}s Eliana Dockterman wrote on the same date that ''Gone Girl'' is both "a sexist portrayal of a crazy woman" and a "feminist manifesto", and that this duality makes the film interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eliana Dockterman|title=Is Gone Girl Feminist or Misogynist?|url=http://time.com/3472314/gone-girl-movie-book-feminist-misogynist/|website=Time|publisher=Time|accessdate=November 11, 2014|date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoë Heller of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' wrote: "The problem with Amy is not that she acts in vicious and reprehensible ways, or even that her behavior lends credence to certain misogynist fantasies. The problem is that she isn't really a character, but rather an animation of a not very interesting idea about the female capacity for nastiness", concluding that "The film is a piece of silliness, not powerful enough in the end to engender proper 'disapproval': only wonder at its coarseness and perhaps mild dismay at its critical success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Hard Work of Marriage |first=Zoë |last=Heller|newspaper=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=December 4, 2014 |accessdate=December 21, 2014 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/dec/04/gone-girl-hard-work-marriage/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on October 6, 2014, Joan Smith criticized what she saw as the film's "recycling of [[rape myth]]s", citing research released in 2013 which stated that false allegations of rape in the UK were extremely rare.&lt;ref name="Joan"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joan Smith|title=Gone Girl's recycling of rape myths is a disgusting distortion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/06/gone-girl-rape-domestic-violence-ben-affleck#start-of-comments|accessdate=November 11, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote: "The characters live in a parallel universe where the immediate reaction to a woman who says she's been assaulted is one of chivalrous concern. Tell that to all the victims, here and in the US, who have had their claims dismissed by &lt;!--- This is the British spelling of the word, it is not a typo, as the Guardian is a British newspaper.

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IT ---&gt; police officers."&lt;ref name="Joan"/&gt; Writing for ''The Guardian'' on the following day, Emine Saner wrote that Smith's argument "wouldn't carry as much weight were this film set against a vastly wider range of women's stories, and characters in mainstream culture", but concluded with Dockterman's plea for the portrayal of "all sorts of women in our novels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Emine Saner|title=The Gone Girl backlash: what women don't want|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/07/gone-girl-backlash-david-fincher-misogynist-feminist?commentpage=1|accessdate=November 11, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Kroenert, of the Australian website Eureka Street wrote on October 8, 2014, that the film's predominant focus upon Nick's perspective "serves to obfuscate Amy's motives (though it is possible that she is simply a sociopath), and to amplify her personification of ... anti-women myths"; however, Kroenert concludes that ''Gone Girl'' is "a compelling rumination on the impossibility of knowing the mind of another, even within that ostensibly most intimate of relationships, marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tim Kroenert|title=Gone Girl promotes conversations about misogyny|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/(S(1hvle1mn0yvj3b45co1tsozp))/article.aspx?aeid=42063|website=EurekaStreet.com.au|publisher=Jesuit Communications Australia|accessdate=December 6, 2014|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in October 2014, Rosamund Pike stated she would return for a sequel if Gillian Flynn wrote the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Rosamund-Pike-Return-Gone-Girl-2-Person-Does-67648.html|title=Rosamund Pike Will Return For Gone Girl 2 If This Person Does|date=October 10, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Flynn said she was open to the idea of a sequel, but said it would be "a few years down the road" when the original cast and crew would be available again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11341710/Gone-Girl-2-could-happen.html|title=Gone Girl 2 'could happen'|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elakelaiset on strage.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Finnish Humppa-Band [[Eläkeläiset]] on stage]]

'''Humppa''' is a type of music from Finland. It is related to [[jazz]] and very fast [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]], played two [[beat (music)|beat]]s to a [[bar (music)|bar]] ({{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|2|2}}). Typical speed is about 220 to 260 beats per minute. Humppa is also the name of a few [[social dance]]s danced to humppa music. All dances involve bounce that follows the strong bass of the music. In [[Finnish language]], the word humppa can also be used for all [[Social dance|social dancing]]. The name humppa was invented by [[Antero Alpola]] for a radio show in the 1950s. He picked it up from [[Germany|German]] [[Oktoberfest]] where the locals used the word to describe the playing of the band. The band probably used a [[tuba]], as the sound of tuba on the first beat is like ''hump'', the second beat coming as a ''pa''.&lt;ref name="TANSSI"/&gt; (The related German style is known as [[oompah]].)

There are three different dances typically danced to humppa music, and they have existed long before the word "humppa" was coined. One form of Humppa dance is related to [[one-step]], which arrived in Finland 1913. In this kind of humppa, both dancers take a step on each first beat (on "hump") and progress to the direction of dance. This is danced making turns in [[closed position]] or making figures by changing various [[open position]]s. The second Humppa form is related to [[Two-step (dance move)|two-step]], which came to Finland in 1910. This Humppa has some [[rhythm]] and movement from [[samba]] and [[waltz]]. A third form of dance, ''Nilkku'', is based on a slow, slow, quick, quick rhythm. The first quick step hardly takes any weight and gives the dance an appearance of limping.&lt;ref name="TANSSI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tanssi.net/fi/lajit/humppa.html |title=Humppa |website=Tanssi.net |publisher= |access-date=22 December 2016 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1970s pop music and dancing alone almost killed social dancing, but revival of humppa since mid-1970s keeps the traditional social dancing alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanssit.fi/tanssin-abc/tanssilajit/humppa/ |title=Humppa |website=Tanssi.fi |publisher=Suomen Tanssistudiot |access-date=22 December 2016 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1944, two [[World War II]] fighter pilots, American pilot Hank Marlow and Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari, parachute onto an island in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] after a [[dogfight]] and engage in [[close quarters combat|close combat]], but the fight is interrupted by a giant [[ape]].

In 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former [[Special Air Service|British Special Air Service]] [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] James Conrad, a skilled [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]], to guide an expedition to map out a recently discovered island known as [[Skull Island]]. They are escorted by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Preston Packard and his subordinates. The group is joined by [[anti-war]] photographer Mason Weaver, who believes that the expedition is a [[clandestine operations|secret military operation]], and intends to expose it.

Arriving at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping [[Seismic bomb|seismic explosives]], developed by Randa's seismologist Houston Brooks, to [[Reflection seismology|map out]] the island and prove Brooks' [[Hollow Earth]] theory. However, the air unit is attacked by the same ape from 1944, scattering the survivors across the island. Packard regroups with some survivors, including Randa. After being confronted by Packard, Randa reveals his affiliation with the secret government organization Monarch, and its plan of using the expedition to prove the existence of monsters. Packard's group begins making their way to Major Jack Chapman, Packard's right-hand man, whose helicopter crash-landed elsewhere. Meanwhile, the other group of survivors, led by Conrad, try to reach a rendezvous point to meet a resupply team arriving in three days.

Conrad's group eventually encounters the local [[Iwi]] natives and an older Marlow. Marlow reveals the ape is [[King Kong|Kong]], the island's guardian, worshiped as a god by the natives for protecting them from many predators, including two-legged, lizard-like subterranean monsters dubbed "Skullcrawlers". He informs them that Kong attacked and destroyed the air unit because their bombs brought them to the surface; the Skullcrawlers are responsible for killing Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind. Marlow reveals that he and Ikari became friends, but Ikari was killed by a Skullcrawler some time ago.

As Chapman is ambushed and devoured by a Skullcrawler, Conrad's group helps Marlow complete a boat built from parts of Marlow and Ikari's downed planes. They ride down the river, and manage to secure communication with Packard's group. They regroup with Packard, who insists on searching for Chapman. Marlow leads them to a mass grave but are attacked by the same Skullcrawler that killed Chapman, killing Randa and others before dying in a flammable gas explosion triggered by Weaver. Learning about Chapman's death, Packard reveals his plan to kill Kong and avenge his fallen men. The group parts ways, with Packard's group retrieving weapons from Chapman's chopper and laying a trap for Kong at a nearby lake, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat.

While scouting the path ahead, Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong up close and, seeing his true peaceful nature, they resolve to save him. Packard's group lures Kong with the remaining seismic charges and incapacitates him with ignited [[napalm]]. Conrad, Weaver, and Marlow arrive and persuade the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses. A massive Skullcrawler emerges from the lake, and Packard is crushed by Kong. The Skullcrawler overpowers Kong but with the humans' help, the ape emerges victorious in the end. Conrad, Weaver, Marlow, and the few survivors reach the rendezvous point and leave the island as Kong sees them leave in his eye.

During the credits, Marlow returns home, reuniting with his wife, meeting his son for the first time, and watching a [[Chicago Cubs]] game on television. In a [[post-credits scene]], Conrad and Weaver are detained and recruited by Monarch. They are informed by Brooks that Kong is not the only monster king to roam the world and are shown archive footage of cave paintings depicting [[Godzilla]], [[Rodan]], [[Mothra]], and [[King Ghidorah]].

You get to see how many different views in regards to nature and how we should handle it are dealt with from many different perspectives".&lt;ref name="10things"/&gt; Larson further added that Weaver has an "interest and respect for nature" and "Through that she has a closer, more loving, and intimate relationship with Kong".&lt;ref name="10things"/&gt;}}

===Development===
Originally titled ''Skull Island'', the film was announced by Legendary Pictures at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], [[Universal Pictures]] was to be the distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/skull-island-movie/ |title=Legendary Announces King Kong Prequel 'Skull Island' Movie For 2016 [Comic Con 2014]|publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=July 27, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2014|last=Sciretta|first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legendary then moved the project to [[Warner Bros.]] in order to develop a crossover film featuring King Kong and [[Godzilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mendelson|first1=Scott|title=What King Kong/Godzilla Switcharoo Says About Universal And Warner Bros.

Legendary offered [[Joe Cornish]] the job of directing the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comic-Con: Legendary Wants Joe Cornish For 'Skull Island' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/comic-con-legendary-wants-joe-cornish-for-skull-island/|website=Deadline Hollywood|last=Fleming|first=Mike|date=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Peter Jackson]], who directed the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 version of ''King Kong'']], suggested [[Guillermo del Toro]], who Legendary worked with on ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' and ''[[Crimson Peak]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/peter-jackson-skull-island-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=Peter Jackson Would Like Guillermo Del Toro to Direct 'Skull Island'|publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=July 31, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2016|last=Han|first=Angie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, the studio announced that [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]] would direct the film.&lt;ref name=HiddlestonCast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/09/skull-island-tom-hiddleston-king-kong-835067/|title=Legendary's 'Skull Island'; Tom Hiddleston Stars, Jordan Vogt-Roberts Helms King Kong Origin Tale|last=Fleming, Jr.|first=Mike|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 16, 2014|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
The script saw a number of screenwriters attached before filming. Seeking the continuity between the King Kong and Godzilla worlds, [[Max Borenstein]] (writer of 2014's ''Godzilla'') wrote the first draft, while [[John Gatins]] was hired to write the second draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=King Kong Tale 'Skull Island' Gets Rewrite From 'Flight' Scribe John Gatins|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/skull-island-flight-scribe-john-gatins-rewrite-1201268217/|accessdate=October 31, 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing the script, Borenstein didn't want to repeat the "[[Beauty and the Beast]]" plot synonymous with ''King Kong'' movies, and took into account the outdated elements of the treatment of the island natives and the damsel in distress. His initial influence was ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', revealing,

{{Quote|"What popped into my head for the paradigm of the movie was ''Apocalypse Now''. That's obviously a war movie, but I liked the idea of people moving upriver to face a misunderstood force that they think of as a villain, but ultimately they come to realize is much more complicated."}}

Before Vogt-Roberts signed on as director, Borenstein had the idea of having the film begin during the Vietnam War and jump forward to the present day. After it was rejected, Borenstein instead had the film take place before the [[King Kong (1933)|original ''King Kong'' film]] in 1917 during World War I while keeping the ''Apocalypse Now'' concept, and the premise had Tom Hiddleston's character leading a rescue team to Skull Island to find his missing brother, who had gotten stranded there while searching for a "Titan Serum" believed to cure all illnesses. After this, the story was again retooled to take place in the present day.&lt;ref name="McKittrick"&gt;{{cite web|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|title='Every movie is its own beast.' Max Borenstein on Kong: Skull Island|url=https://creativescreenwriting.com/kong/|accessdate=March 10, 2017|publisher=''Creative Screenwriting''|date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sampson|first=Mike|title=Has the 'Kong: Skull Island' Plot Been Revealed?|url=http://screencrush.com/kong-skull-island-plot-details-revealed/|accessdate=August 9, 2018|website=ScreenCrush|date=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jordan Vogt-Roberts joined the project, he met with Borenstein and, liking the ''Apocalypse Now'' concept, pitched it to Legendary with the idea of the story taking place at the end of the Vietnam War, which the studio accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisenberg|first=Eric|title=One Change Kong: Skull Island Made To Its Script That Resulted In A Totally Different Movie|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1633919/one-change-kong-skull-island-made-to-its-script-that-resulted-in-a-totally-different-movie|publisher=''Cinemablend''|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that [[Dan Gilroy]] had also collaborated on the Borenstein/Gatins draft.&lt;ref name=HawkinsCast&gt;{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title='Straight Outta Compton's' Corey Hawkins Joins 'Skull Island' (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/straight-outta-compton-skull-island-corey-hawkins-1201557216/|accessdate=August 7, 2015|work=Variety|date=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2015, it was confirmed that [[Derek Connolly]] was also doing script rewrites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title='Jurassic World' Writer Heads to 'Kong: Skull Island' (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jurassic-world-writer-heads-kong-816144|accessdate=August 19, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borenstein worked a final pass on the screenplay before shooting began, and credited the screenplay to all of the writers, saying, "It was definitely collaborative in terms of what's on the screen, though none of us worked together. There are pieces of my work in there as well as the work of the other two writers and John Gatins, who was credited for story. Everybody had a really good hand in it."&lt;ref name="McKittrick"/&gt;

Gilroy revealed that many backstories and character moments were dropped from his draft, specifically for the characters of Mason Weaver and James Conrad, feeling that the film had room to explore them. Gilroy disclosed,

{{Quote|"Brie's [character] was somebody who was really war-weary and had taken photographs for far too long. She didn't believe in anything – so the first time she saw Kong, it was like an awakening. She comes [back to life]. Tom [Hiddleston]'s character was a guy whose unit had been attacked by a big monster out of Vietnam – so he was in search of this thing. Instead of them approaching him at the bar and giving him a job, I had him like, 'I want on board.' I like those characters a lot… but they didn't want to go with that."}}

Despite these ideas being dropped, Gilroy felt the film turned out to be a "good movie" regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/kong-skull-island-brie-larson-tom-hiddleston-backstories-cut/#images|title='Kong: Skull Island' Writer Dan Gilroy Reveals the Character Backstories Cut from His Script|first=Tommy|last=Cook|work=Collider|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, artist Joe DeVito sued producers of the film for using elements of his Skull Island universe, which he claimed that he created and the producers used without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cullins|first1=Ashley|title=Legendary, Warner Bros.

===Creature design===
[[File:Kong Skull Island creature design.jpg|thumb|right|Kong as designed for ''Kong: Skull Island'']]
The Visual Effects were done by ''[[Industrial Light and Magic]]'', ''[[Rodeo FX]]'', Hybride and Shade VFX. ''[[Industrial Light and Magic]]'' did the main visuals for Kong. While ''[[Rodeo FX]]'' did the Skull Crawler fight scene.
Director Vogt-Roberts stated that he wanted Kong to look simple and iconic enough that a third grader could draw him, and the image would still be recognizable.&lt;ref name="design"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/10/kong-skull-island-first-look-movie-monster|title=Kong: Skull Island unleashes exclusive first look at the movie monster|last=Smith|first=C. Molly|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 10, 2016|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogt-Roberts also wanted Kong to feel like a "lonely god, he was a morose figure, lumbering around this island," and took the design back to the 1933 incarnation, where Kong was presented as a "bipedal creature that walks in an upright position."&lt;ref name="design"/&gt; Vogt-Roberts additionally stated, "If anything, our Kong is meant to be a throwback to the '33 version. [Kong] was a movie monster, so we worked really hard to take some of the elements of the '33 version, some of those exaggerated features, some of those cartoonish and iconic qualities, and then make them their own…We created something that to some degree served as a throwback to the inspiration for what started all of this, but then also [had] it be a fully unique and different creature that — I would like to think — is fully contained and identifiable as the 2017 version of King Kong. I think there are very modern elements to him, yet hopefully, he feels very timeless at the same time."&lt;ref name="design"/&gt;

[[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' helped influence the design and approach of the monsters, Vogt-Roberts stated, "Miyazaki['s] Princess Mononoke was actually a big reference in the way that the spirit creatures sort of have their own domains and fit within that. So a big thing [was] trying to design creatures that felt realistic and could exist in an ecosystem that feels sort of wild and out there, and then also design things that simultaneously felt beautiful and horrifying at the same time."&lt;ref name="10things"/&gt; However, biophysical analysis of Kong and other creatures concludes that although biophysically they are viable, the ecosystem of the island could not support them.&lt;ref&gt;Monge-Nájera, Julian. (2016). "Ann's secret relationship with King Kong: a biological look at Skull Island and the true nature of the Beauty and Beast Myth". ''CoRis''. '''12''' (1): 13–28 (ISSN: 1659-2387).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-armed pit lizard from the 1933 ''King Kong'' film was used as a reference for the Skullcrawlers. They were also inspired by a number of other cinematic creatures; Vogt-Roberts stated, "That creature, beyond being a reference to a creature from the 1933 film, is also this crazy fusion of all of the influences throughout my life – like the first angel from ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion|Evangelion]]'', and No-Face from ''[[Spirited Away]]'', and Cubone from ''[[Pokémon]]''."&lt;ref name="fanfeb"/&gt;

==Influences==
Vogt-Roberts has cited a number of films that inspired ''Kong: Skull Island'', stating, "If I were going to break it down for people, I'd say you obviously have ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' and just the era of '70s filmmaking, with films like ''[[The Conversation]]'', too. Also ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' was an inspiration, and the South Korean film ''[[The Host (2006 film)|The Host]]'' as well. The entire ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' series was a big influence."&lt;ref name="fanfeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/director-jordan-vogt-roberts-on-why-kong-skull-island-is-unlike-any-other-king-kong-movie-751932|title=Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts On Why 'Kong: Skull Island' Is Unlike Any Other 'King Kong' Movie|last=Davis|first=Erik|work=Fandango|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogt-Roberts also cited ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' as an influence on the approach and design of the monsters.&lt;ref name="10things"/&gt; He cited Sachiel from ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', Cubone from ''[[Pokémon]]'', No-Face from ''[[Spirited Away]]'', and a creature from the 1933 ''King Kong'' as inspirations for the Skullcrawlers.&lt;ref name="fanfeb"/&gt;

The score was composed by [[Henry Jackman]]. Since the film takes place in the 1970s, Jackman blended '70s psychedelic guitars into the score. "The great thing about a monster movie is that it opens the door to use the symphony orchestra in its most sumptuous way," Jackman says. "[Director] Jordan [Vogt-Roberts] was happy to celebrate the gravity and history that comes with a full orchestra, but we also explored less traditional elements. That's a field day for a composer."&lt;ref name="production notes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2017/02/18/kong-skull-island-production-notes-and-high-res-photos/|title=Kong: Skull Island Production Notes|work=SciFi Japan|date=February 18, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score was recorded at [[Associated Independent Recording#AIR Lyndhurst Hall - Hampstead, London (1991-present)|AIR Lyndhurst Studios]] together with the [[London Voices]] and conducted by [[Gavin Greenaway]], with additional music by Alex Belcher, [[Halli Cauthery]] and [[Stephen Hilton]]. The soundtrack was digitally released on 3 March 2017 through [[WaterTower Music]].

Regarding the music used in the film, Vogt-Roberts stated, "I wanted to use songs from the Vietnam era and a myriad of hits from the '70s... [T]his provides a striking dichotomy, sets the tone and gives us great moments of fun. The music, which serves to both heighten the film's emotion and underscore the action, was one of the final creative elements to fall into place during post-production. It was the culmination of a massive undertaking that had taken the production to three continents."&lt;ref name="production notes"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Kong: Skull Island'' received generally positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/kong-skull-island-fan-reviews/|title='Kong: Skull Island': What Did You Think?|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|work=Collider|date=March 10, 2017|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/03/13/kong-skull-island-four-lessons-for-justice-league-and-the-dc-films-franchise/#40b23ec84168|title='Kong: Skull Island': Four Lessons For 'Justice League' And The DC Films Franchise|last=Mendelson|first=Scott|work=Forbes|date=March 13, 2017|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 335 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Offering exhilarating eye candy, solid acting, and a fast-paced story, ''Kong: Skull Island'' earns its spot in the movie monster's mythos without ever matching up to the classic original."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kong_skull_island |title=Kong: Skull Island (2017) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kong-skull-island |title=Kong: Skull Island Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CinemaScore/status/840452223805095936 |title=''Kong: Skull Island'' |publisher=[[CinemaScore]] on [[Twitter]] |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' lauded the film, giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four: "I saw little in [Vogt-Roberts'] [[The Kings of Summer|first feature]] to indicate the deftness and buoyant spirit he brings to ''Skull Island''. This time, the money's on the screen, but it bought a really good movie, too."&lt;ref name="CinemaScore2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-kong-skull-island-mov-rev-0307-20170307-column.html |title='Kong: Skull Island' review: Big budget buys dazzling effects and a really good movie too |publisher=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=March 8, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017}}{{rating|3.5|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Ryan of ''[[Uproxx]]'' gave the film a positive review, noting, "''Kong: Skull Island'' is still a hoot. It was a movie that was not at all on my radar as something I was dying to see and yet I had way too much fun watching it. I just wished it had embraced its craziness just a little bit more. (But, yes, there's still plenty of crazy to go around.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ryan|first=Mike|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/kong-skull-island-review/ |title='Kong: Skull Island' Is Ridiculous Fun |website=Uproxx |date=March 2, 2017|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a positive review as well, stating that "all the requisite elements are served up here in ideal proportion, and the time just flies by, which can rarely be said for films of this nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/kong-skull-island-review-982156|title='Kong: Skull Island': Film Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Anderson of ''[[Nerdist News]]'' found the film entertaining but flawed, saying, "It's certainly not a perfect movie, and a lot of the characters feel like sketches more than fully-fledged people, but it roars along enjoyably from start to finish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/kong-skull-island-is-big-raucous-monster-fun-review/|title=KONG: SKULL ISLAND IS BIG, RAUCOUS MONSTER FUN (REVIEW)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' awarded the film one out of five stars.

Jackson striking the right tone of crazy amid the chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lickona|first=Matthew|url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/movies/kong-skull-island/# |title=KONG: SKULL ISLAND 1.0 STARS|website=The San Diego Reader |date=March 2017|accessdate=May 30, 2017}}{{rating|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Klimek of ''[[NPR]]'' mentions how "''Kong'' is at its mediocre best when it pretends to be a nature documentary about Skull Island's bizarro flora and fauna," but lamented how "every time the movie threatens to get interesting, one of its hordes of ersatz, non-animated characters shows up and starts talking again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klimek|first1=Chris|title=In The Forgettable 'Kong: Skull Island,' A Great Cast, Cast Aside|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/03/09/518778017/in-the-forgettable-kong-skull-island-a-great-cast-cast-aside|website=NPR.org|language=en|date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' noted that what the film "yearns to be, is a pop-culture ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', with the human foe removed, the political parable toned down, and the gonzo elements jacked up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Anthony|title=The Current Cinema: "Kong: Skull Island"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/kong-skull-island-and-raw|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.R. Jones questioned the film's setting, saying "this ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' knockoff takes place neither in the Depression era, which gave us the original ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', nor in the present, when satellite photos would surely alert us to the existence of a 100-foot gorilla. Instead—and for no reason I can fathom, except perhaps the classic-rock tunes desired for the soundtrack—the story takes place in 1973, when the Vietnam war is winding down and President Nixon is being driven from office."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=J.R.|title=Kong: Skull Island|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/kong-skull-island/Film?oid=25527309|website=Chicago Reader|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1763">'''Leased access''' is airtime that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) mandates must be provided by [[cable television|cable]] operators (such as [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] and [[Charter Communications|Charter Spectrum]]) for use by independent cable programmers and producers who are not owned by the operators. Leased access airtime may be purchased on [[specialty channel]]s by individuals or groups with [[Professional liability insurance#Errors and omissions insurance|E&amp;O insurance]] for the purposes of airing [[television program]]ming content, usually [[local programming]].

The prices for leased access are subject to a maximum set by an FCC formula and therefore in theory cannot be manipulated by cable companies. Cable companies, however, can "manipulate" prices through lobbying the FCC. Indeed, in 1997, the FCC set maximum prices based on an "average implicit fee" formula which set the prices considered by cable programmers to be very high.  Lower prices would likely encourage increased usage of leased access by independent programmers.

Leased access is different from [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) [[cable TV]] channels, in that producers pay a fee to have a program on a leased access channel, as opposed to time on a [[public-access television]] channel, which is free or at minimum cost. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

"'''Lisa's First Word'''" is the tenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]]. It was first broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on December 3, 1992. In the episode, as the [[Simpson family]] gathers around [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] and tries to encourage her to say her first word, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] reminisces and tells the story of [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s first word. [[Elizabeth Taylor]] appeared for the voicing of Maggie's first word.

The episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]] and written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]]. After its initial airing on Fox, the episode was later released as part of a 1999 [[VHS|video]] collection: ''[[The Simpsons home media#Compilations|The Simpsons: Greatest Hits]]'', and released again on the 2003 DVD edition of the same collection. The episode features cultural references to two chains of fast food restaurants, [[Wendy's]] and [[McDonald's]], as well as a reference to the 1981 [[arcade game|arcade]] video game ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. "Lisa's First Word" received positive reception from television critics, and acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 16.6.

==Plot==
The Simpson family are trying unsuccessfully to get [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] to speak, inspiring [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] to share the story of [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s first word.

The story flashes back to March 1983 where [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], Marge and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] originally lived in an apartment on the Lower East Side of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Homer and Marge had to cope with Bart, who was two years old at the time. Marge reveals to her husband and their son that she is pregnant again, and points out to Homer that they will probably need a bigger place. After viewing several unsuitable properties, they buy [[742 Evergreen Terrace|a house on Evergreen Terrace]] with a $15,000 down payment from the sale of [[Grampa Simpson|Grampa]]'s house.

In 1984, the Simpsons move into their new home and meet their new neighbours, [[Ned Flanders]] and his family. Meanwhile, [[Krusty the Clown]] begins a promotion for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games with his [[Krusty Burger]] chain. The promotion is a scratch-off game where customers could win free Krusty Burgers if America wins a gold medal, but the game cards all feature events that "Communists never lose". However, Krusty receives word of the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet boycott]] of the Olympics and that he stands to lose $44,000,000 from all the free burgers he will have to give away. 

Bart is forced to give up his crib so it can be used for the new baby. Homer builds him a new bed shaped like a clown, [[coulrophobia|which terrifies Bart]]. When Lisa is born and gets all the attention, Bart takes an immediate dislike to her. Eventually, he is about to run away until Lisa says her first word, "Bart". Thrilled that his name is his sister's first word, Marge explains to Bart that Lisa adores him. He accepts her as his little sister and they both find it funny that they each call Homer by his name, rather than "daddy" as he wishes.

Back in the present day, Homer takes Maggie to bed, commenting on how the sooner kids learn to talk, the sooner they learn to talk back, and tells Maggie that he hopes she never says a word. But as soon as he turns off the light and closes the door, Maggie takes her pacifier out of her mouth and utters the word "daddy", before going to sleep.

==Production==
[[File:Elizabeth Taylor36.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Elizabeth Taylor]] provided the voice of Maggie's first word.]]

"Lisa's First Word" was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]], and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; ''The Simpsons'' writers [[Mike Reiss]] and [[Al Jean]] were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss thought it would be cute to have her say "daddy" when no one could hear her.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's First Word" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, "[[I Married Marge]]".&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Martin, Jeff |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's First Word" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

In the episode, Homer builds a scary clown-shaped bed for Bart. The scene was inspired by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown-shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss was scared of sleeping in it.&lt;ref name="Kirkland"/&gt; As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s song "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]", which was released the same year.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; The idea for this sequence came from [[animation director]] [[Chuck Sheetz]], who suggested it because the length of the final version of the episode was too short.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[Censorship|censors]] wrote a note concerning Homer's line, "Bart can kiss my hairy, yellow butt!" after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered "coarse", due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=20}}

Maggie's first word was provided by the [[Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]], who would also voice herself in the season four finale, "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]".&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; While promoting the episode, the producers initially did not reveal who the voice of Maggie would be, prompting speculation as to the identity of the actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311750,00.html |title=Face to Face: Maggie Simpson |accessdate=2008-01-19 |first=Lisa |last=Schwarzbaum |date=1992-09-11 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012212310/http://ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C311750%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was only one word, the voice came out "too [[sexual arousal|sexy]]" and Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied and thought it sounded like a baby.&lt;ref name=nyd&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2007/05/04/2007-05-04_at_film_fest_de_niros_lashed_picture_sho-2.html |title=In the Fox family, they live in fear of a Bart attack |author1=George Rush  |author2=Joanna Rush Molloy  |lastauthoramp=yes|accessdate=2008-07-31 |date=2007-05-04 |work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's First Word" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources, including John Ortved's ''The Simpsons'' history article "Simpsons Family Values" in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', have reported that after Taylor had been made to repeatedly record the line, she said "fuck you" to series creator [[Matt Groening]] and stormed out of the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/simpsons200708 |title=Simpson Family Values |accessdate=2012-05-26 |first=John |last=Ortved |date=August 2007 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening recounted this event on a 1994 appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt, Interviewed by Conan O'Brien, ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', Episode 250, October 7, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also quoted by the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' in 2007 as saying "We did 24 takes, but they were always too sexual. Finally Liz said, 'F— you,' and walked out."&lt;ref name=nyd/&gt; However, Groening later denied the story in the DVD commentary for the episode "[[Gump Roast]]",&lt;ref name="Gump"&gt;Groening, Matt.

==Cultural references==
The ''[[Media in The Simpsons#Journalism|Springfield Shopper]]'' headline from the day Lisa was born ("[[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] to [[Gary Hart|Hart]]: [[Where's the beef?]]") uses the then-current advertising slogan for [[Wendy's]].&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; Mondale, a candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]], used the "Where's the beef?" phrase at an election rally in 1984 while mocking one of his opponents.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Marge begins telling her story of Lisa's first word by saying: "This story begins in the unforgettable spring of 1983. Ms. Pac-man struck a blow for women's rights and a young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh", making references to the 1981 [[arcade game|arcade]] video game ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' and the American actor [[Joe Piscopo]].&lt;ref name="Kirkland"&gt;{{cite video |people=Kirkland, Mark |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's First Word" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode features an ''Itchy &amp; Scratchy'' cartoon called "[[List of Itchy and Scratchy cartoons#100-Yard Gash|100-Yard Gash]]", which uses the music from the 1981 film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997|p=102}}

The Olympic promotion by [[Krusty Burger]] is loosely based on a similar "[[scratchcard|scratch-and-win]]" promotion by [[McDonald's]], in which McDonald's visitors could win a [[Big Mac]], [[french fries]], a drink, or even a cash prize up to $10,000 if [[United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Team USA]] won a medal in the visitor's listed event. McDonald's lost millions on the promotion due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]] by the [[Soviet Union]], as happened to Krusty.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; At one point in the episode, [[Dr. Hibbert]] refers to Olympic gymnastic medalist [[Mary Lou Retton]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "Lisa's First Word" was watched by 28.6 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ABC’s Tuesday lineup ends up rosy |work=[[USA Today]] |author=Donna Gable |page=03.D |date=December 9, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most-watched episode of the season.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', said the episode is a "convincing portrait of young marriage and hardship in the days of [[Reaganomics]]—and the biggest name to guest voice gets the littlest, but the most significant, to say".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; When asked to pick his favorite season out of ''The Simpsons'' seasons [[The Simpsons (season 1)|one]] through [[The Simpsons (season 20)|twenty]], Paul Lane of the ''[[Niagara Gazette]]'' picked season four and highlighted "the sweetly funny" "Lisa's First Word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dzikiy |first=Phil |author2=Paul Lane  |title=Television: 20 years&amp;nbsp;— A 'Simpsons' extravaganza |work=[[Niagara Gazette]] |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Johnson at DVD Verdict named it "one of the greatest flashback episodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason4.php |title=DVD Verdict Review&amp;nbsp;— The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season |first=David |last=Johnson |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926155746/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason4.php |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Manley at DVDActive said in a review of ''The Simpsons: Greatest Hits'' DVD that it is "one of the better episodes and probably my personal favourite on the disc, although most Simpsons connoisseurs would probably go for the [[Bart Gets an "F"|previous episode]] [on the DVD]", and added that there are "some great parodies in the episode too".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/simpsons-the-greatest-hits.html |title=Simpsons, The: Greatest Hits (UK&amp;nbsp;— DVD R2) in Reviews |last=Manley |first=Dave |publisher=DVDActive |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''{{'}}s Gregory Hardy named it the fourteenth best episode of the show with a sports theme (the Olympics in this case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hitting 300 - For Sporting Comedy, 'The Simpsons' Always Score |last=Hardy |first=Gregory |date=February 16, 2003 |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |page=C17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Maggie was praised by critics.

==="Can't sleep, clown will eat me"===
[[File:Lisa's First Word.jpg|thumb|Young Bart in his clown bed, poorly constructed by Homer]]
Inspired by an event in ''The Simpsons'' writer Mike Reiss' childhood,&lt;ref name="Kirkland"/&gt; young Bart does not want to give up sleeping in the crib to make way for his newborn sister. Noticing Bart's affection for [[Krusty the Clown]] but unable to afford a professionally built Krusty-themed bed, Homer decides to build a bed with Krusty's likeness to please his son. However, because of Homer's poor handicraft skills, the bed takes on an [[Evil clown|ominous appearance]] and frightens Bart, especially in the darkened room. In his first night in the new bed, far from "laughing himself to sleep", Bart imagines that the face on the [[Headboard (furniture)|headboard]] of the bed comes to life, intoning with evil glee, "[[Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep|if you should die before you wake...]]", before collapsing into evil cackling.

The next morning, Bart is curled up into the [[fetal position]] on the floor next to the sofa downstairs, repeatedly uttering the phrase "can't sleep, clown will eat me..." The catchphrase inspired the [[Alice Cooper]] song "Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me" from the 2001 album ''[[Dragontown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00059,117508302B023D18.html |title=Some pop culture creations demonize the red-nosed men |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=2007-02-15 |work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has since found its way into popular use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7191721.stm |title=Why are clowns scary? |first=Finlo |last=Rohrer |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=2008-01-16 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[humorist]] ([[American English]]) or humourist ([[British English]]) is an [[intellectual]] who uses [[humor]] in writing or public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henry|first1=Patrick|title=Don't Call Me a Comedian|url=https://www.patrickhenryspeaker.com/2013/04/15/dont-call-me-a-comedian/|accessdate=December 7, 2017|date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humorists are distinct from [[comedian]]s, who are [[show business]] entertainers whose business is to make an audience laugh, though it is possible for some persons to occupy both roles in the course of their careers.

Despite the fact that the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] annually bestows a [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] (usually on comedians) since 1998, this award does not by itself qualify the recipient as a humorist. {{Asof|2017}} only two recipients, [[Steve Martin]] and [[Neil Simon]], are known as humorists, being humorous [[playwright]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8437">'''Mikro'67''' is the Bulgarian manufacturer for [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]], [[Gama_Toys|Gama]], [[Schuco]], [[NZG_Models|NZG]] and other diecast models.

In 1990 there were 96 toy manufacturers in Bulgaria - producers' co-operative societies and factories. 13 of them were forming the State Economic Group "ДСО МЛАДОСТ" / "DSO Mladost"). Nowadays there is only one toy manufacturer left - "МИР"/"MIR" (from the communist era) to "МИКРО" / "MIKRO" a.k.a. "МИКРО'67" / "MIKRO'67" (post-communist era). Nowadays both the Mikro and Mikro'67 names are used interchangeably.

== The factory ==
[[File:Mukpo factory.jpg]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In 1952 in one of the workshops of TPK (producers' co-operative society) Metalik differentiated team of workers for toys manufacturing. With a great effort and ambition the first toy was handmade - a wind-up chain tractor. The production list was growing - trucks, dumpers, diggers, a cannon, a car, a rocket and more. The volume of the production was growing, the number of the workers was growing and these were factors for the creation of a new independent factory.

In 1.1.1967 was established and independent producers' co-operative society for toys manufacturing with chairman Petar Petrov. A question has arisen - how to name the new manufacturer? With a number of opinions and suggestions, the most adequate of them was "Peace", because the peace is joy and carefree childhood for the children all over the world.

In 1971 the workers moved into a new building. Introducing of new technologies has begun. Typical for that time were the battery-operated toys - machine gun, telephone, SAU tank and more. The range of toys got wider.

An excitement for the workers was the changing the name from TPK Mir to Mir factory in 1.7.1971 and becoming a part of DSO Mladost, a part of Committee for Youth and Sport and later - a part from the Ministry of Light industry.

The adoption of new series of Tonka (USA) toys has begun. The production list grew up to 40 different toys. The unification of parts and products started. And yet another joy for the workers - for the first time the company logo crossed the Bulgarian border and toys were exported in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Cuba, Albania, Jordan. Almost 80% of the production was exported.

On August 1, 1980 the Mir factory name was changed to Mir Youth factory.
A turning point in the development came in 1983 - topyl printing, assembling the toy boxes with PVX glue, moulding, plastic parts metalling.

Also in 1983 was adopted a licensed technology of the English company Matchbox for toy making using the moulding method. 5 different casts were made and 8 more in 1984.
In 1984 the toys from the MUKPO series were awarded with gold medal at the International Fair in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The toys from the HOBBY series were evaluated with the highest rank for "K" quality.

The range of toys was growing continuously.
In November 1986 was formed a workers team for manufacturing of ski automates - licensed from the West Germany company Marker".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Matchbox ==
After making a deal with the Matchbox company in 1983 the factory initiated the production of the first five '''Matchbox''' ''Superfast'' models and the first few ''Superking'' models. The paint on all the models bearing pearl colors was not very durable, although this condition was later improved. The wheels sets were imported. Today it is very hard to find mint condition models from that time—even in Bulgaria. Up until 1989, 17 ''Superfast'' models and 7 Superkings models were introduced. Although all of the models had minor variations, they were essentially alike. Importantly, there was one primary condition for leasing the dies to the Bulgarian manufacturer - all the models produced were intended to be sold only to the Bulgarian market—with no export. Around 100 000-150 000 pieces of each casting were made. Additionally, after using the new dies, the factory was expected to return them.

In 1991, after the Cold War had ended, production began on the "second wave" of ''Superfast'' models. In the beginning there were again limited variations, but some of the early editions have the decals and the colors of the original models. After a few years business relations soured between the Matchbox company and their Bulgarian partner. It seemed that after opening the borders, many of these Bulgarian models were sold abroad and some were very popular. The '''Matchbox''' company eventually broke the contract with '''Mikro''', but they were unable get back the dies for some models. The results of this split are that the nowadays '''Mattel''' doesn't recognize Bulgarian models as authentic '''Matchbox''' and second - the explosion of thousands of new variations by color, tampos and wheels.

At the end of the 90's '''Mukro'67''' began offering advertising graphics on their models. Customers who wanted to personalize cars with a name, brand or a graphic could get a manufacturing deal for customized Bulgarian '''Matchbox''' models. There was a condition - the customer must order 100 pieces or more although the models may be different. This marketing tool was used by local companies to promote products targeting kids and youngsters and other companies related to auto care and auto parts. International '''Matchbox''' and other diecast models clubs also got some limited edition models for their members on special events. The quality of the models has slowly degraded. This and the uniform production list for more than 15 years, the higher prices and other issues are factors for the lower production nowadays. From time to time after running out of parts some new wheels variations appear - sometimes even '''Matchbox''' wheels get on a non-'''Matchbox''' models and vice versa.

== Gama ==



In 1985 parallel with the '''Matchbox''' models, production began on the '''Gama''' models. The first 1–2 years they were all kit models for assembling and available in only one color—pearl grass green. Later they started making the regular factory assembled models. Some '''Gama''' models are still in production.

== Schuco ==

[[Image:BMW-3ER REIHE-POLICE.jpg]]

In 1994 '''Mikro''' started making '''Gama'''/'''Schuco''' models for the German market. In the first few years of production they were unavailable on the Bulgarian market, but a limited number of models that didn't meet the German criteria for quality slipped from the factory and got into the hands of local collectors. '''Mikro''' was making mainly ''Opel'' models, although there were few ''BMW'' models and ''Mercedes Vito'', promotional models and construction and other vehicles. The models were made and boxed in cheap boxes, exported to Germany where they were then transferred into their original '''Schuco''' boxes. Unlike the '''Matchbox''' models, none of the '''Gama''' or '''Schuco''' models have a sign on the base plate ''"Made in Bulgaria"''. In fact some of them even have the "Made in Germany" or "Made in W. Germany" insignia. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that the country of manufacture could affect sales because some collectors consider that the German or Chinese editions would have better quality.

== Other models ==

[[Image:Kidco Burnin wheels.JPG]]

'''Mikro'67''' made and still make some pressed steel [[Buddy L]], [[Clover (toy company)|Clover]] and [[Tonka]] toys. Between 2004 and 2008 were made 5 [[NZG Models|NZG]] diecast models.

Only one diecast model is actually 100% designed and made in Bulgaria. A few models were based on [[Yaxon]], [[Kidco (company)|Kidco]], and [[Unimax]][https://web.archive.org/web/20100228200907/http://www.unimax.com.hk/] models.

[[Image:Tonka coca-cola truck bulgaria.jpg]]

== Media ==

The '''Mikro'67''' website [http://www.mikro67.com/ www.mikro67.com] is fairly updated and doesn't target the diecast models. Product/model catalogs never have been issued to customers or collectors, and there are only two known editions of brochures ( A4 size sheets) one from the 80's and one from 1991 intended for merchants or given to potential customers at toy and industrial fairs.

Many of the novels and short stories written or co-written by [[Stephen King]] take place in a [[multiverse]] created by the author.

== Fictional history, structure and worlds of Stephen King's multiverse ==
In the beginning, there was a magical presence known as the Prim—also referred as the "darkness behind everything"–from which [[List of The Dark Tower characters#Gan|Gan]] arose. When All-World was created, Gan appeared in metaphysical form as a giant edifice known as the Dark Tower, alongside six Beams, which are protected by twelve Guardians.

It is said that one of the Guardians, Maturin the Turtle, vomited out a universe as the result of a stomach ache. This universe includes the Keystone Earth, which is a reflection of the "real world" and also includes a fictional version of Stephen King himself. It is the universe of the Rose too.

Some people have the ability to travel between universes by "going Todash"; other ways are through rare artifacts like the Wizard's Rainbow, the Talisman, and the Lil Pink.

Gan uses Stephen King as a facilitator to tell the tale of the Gunslinger, so [[Roland Deschain]] could successfully go about his task of reaching the Tower. If the author died before completing his task, Roland would not have "known" how to further proceed on his quest to the Tower and, without any significant remaining opposition, the [[Crimson King]] would have finally toppled the Dark Tower and initiated "Discordia"—the event which all universes would have ceased to exist—and there would be no story created.

== ''Ka'' ==
''Ka'' is a plot element in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series. It is a word of the [[fictional language]] High Speech.

In the books, it is a mysterious force that leads all living (and unliving) creatures. It is the will of [[List of The Dark Tower characters#Gan|Gan]], the approximate equivalent of [[destiny]] or [[fate]], in King's fictional language of High Speech. ''Ka'' can be considered to be a guide, a destination, but is certainly not a plan—at least, not one that is known to mortals. Ka is not necessarily a force of [[good and evil|good or evil]]; it manipulates both sides, and seems to have no definite [[morality]] of its own. To this end, Ka resonates with the concept of [[karma]].

=== Concepts involving ''ka'' ===
Because of the importance of ''ka'' to the world of King's ''Dark Tower'', many phrases in the High Speech use the word ka, such as:

*ka-babbies: young ka-tet members.
*ka-tel: a class of apprentice gunslingers.
*ka-mai: ka's fool.
*ka-me: ka's wiseman; the opposite of ka-mai.
*kas-ka: a prophet
*ka-shume: a unique feeling that a ka-tet is destined to break soon.
*te-ka: ka's friend.
*Can'-Ka No Rey: the red fields of none, where the Dark Tower lies.
*tet-ka can Gan: the [[navel]] (specifically, the navel of [[Gan (Stephen King)|Gan]]).
*kas-ka Gan: singer of Gan's song/ prophet of Gan.
*ves-ka Gan: Song of the Turtle

==== ''Ka-tet'' ====
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted:[[Image:Book7-06-algul-siento-destroyed.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Roland's Ka-tet. Art by [[Michael Whelan]].]]--&gt; 
A ''ka-tet'' is a group of beings brought together by ''ka''. "We are ''ka-tet''. We are one from many," says [[Roland Deschain]] on the day before the Battle of Algul Siento.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower VII]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ka-tet'' is the belief that a group of people can be tied together by fate, or ''ka''. It is said that a group has shared "khef" or the water of life. Sometimes the symbol of water is used literally, as in a ritual Roland and his ''ka-tet'' performs the night before the battle of Algul Siento. In the seventh novel, Susannah Dean, who ends up understanding ka maybe more than Roland himself, comes to the understanding that in simple terms, "ka-tet" means family.

Roland's ''ka-tet'' includes himself, [[Eddie Dean (The Dark Tower)|Eddie Dean]], [[Susannah Dean]], [[Oy (Dark Tower)|Oy]], and [[Jake Chambers]]. Roland's previous ''ka-tet'' included himself, [[Cuthbert Allgood]], [[Jamie De Curry]], and [[Alain Johns]].

=== References in other works by King ===
{{wiktionary|ka}}
''Ka'' is mentioned in some of King's other books, including ''[[Hearts in Atlantis]]'', ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'' and ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''. The characters James Eric Gardener in ''[[The Tommyknockers]]'' and Rosie McClendon in ''[[Rose Madder (novel)|Rose Madder]]'' also ponder about ''ka''. It is mentioned in ''[[The Stand]]'' by Judge Farris when he observes a crow outside his window that he believes is [[Randall Flagg]] shortly before he is killed by Flagg's men. However, in this context it appears that "ka" refers to the [[Egypt]]ian word for life force.

The ''ka-tet'' concept has been frequently used by King, even in books that do not use the terms ''ka'' or ''ka-tet'', such as ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', ''[[The Stand]]'', ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'', ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'', ''[[Dreamcatcher (novel)|Dreamcatcher]]'', and ''[[Duma Key]]''. This may be compared to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s "[[karass]]".

== The Random and the Purpose ==
{{quote|''The Random and the Purpose are like the red and the black squares on a checker board, defining each other by contrast.''|Lachesis}}

The Random and the Purpose are concepts elaborating the "grammar" of All-World introduced in ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''. The Purpose and the Random are driving forces on the different levels (worlds or realities) the Dark Tower connects. There are even stronger forms like the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random. It is not totally clear whether these higher forms are multiple individual beings sharing a common aim, or if they are underlying forces not bound to personal forms. Both Purpose and Random have so-called agents, middlemen between ordinary human beings ("Short-Timers") and the god-like All-Timers. Clotho and Lachesis are agents of the Purpose, while Atropos is an agent of the Random. Central is the idea that Purpose and Random need to be in balance.

=== The Higher Random and the Higher Purpose ===
For each field exist higher beings which seem to be god-like. While arguably Gan or Maturin would belong to the Higher Purpose , the Crimson King or It are beings of the Higher Random .

{{quote|''[...] beyond the Short-Time levels of existence and the Long-Time levels on which Lachesis, Atropos and I exist, there are yet other levels. These are inhabited by creatures we could call All-Timers, beings which are either eternal or so close to it as to make no difference. Short-Timers and Long-Timers live in overlapping spheres of existence - on connected floors of the same building, if you like - ruled by the Random and the Purpose. Above these floors, inaccessible to us but very much a part of the same tower of existence, live other beings. Some of them are marvellous and wonderful; other are hideous beyond our ability to comprehend, let alone yours. These beings might be called the Higher Purpose and the Higher Random...or perhaps there is no Random beyond a certain level; we suspect that may be the case, but we have no real way of telling. We do know that it is something from one of these higher levels that has interested itself in Ed, and that something else from up there made a countermove. That countermove is you, Ralph and Louis.''|Clotho}}

'''''Nancy''''' is an American [[comic strip]], originally written and drawn by [[Ernie Bushmiller]] and distributed by [[United Feature Syndicate]]. The character of Nancy, a precocious eight-year-old, first appeared in the strip ''[[Fritzi Ritz]]'' about the airheaded [[flapper]] title character. Larry Whittington began ''Fritzi Ritz'' in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/fritzi-ritz-before-bushmiller-shes-come-a-long-way-baby/ "Fritzi Ritz Before Bushmiller: She’s Come a Long Way, Baby!"], ''Hogan's Alley'' #7 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and it was taken over by Bushmiller three years later.

== Publication history ==
On January 2, 1933, Bushmiller introduced Fritzi's niece, Nancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-lawrence-welk-of-cartoonists-ernie-nancy-and-the-bushmiller-society/|last= Harvey|first= R. C.|title=The Lawrence Welk of Cartoonists: Ernie, Nancy, and the Bushmiller Society|accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon she dominated the daily strip, which was retitled ''Nancy'' in 1938; Sluggo Smith, Nancy's friend from the "[[wikt:wrong side of the tracks|wrong side of the tracks]]" had been introduced earlier that year, and the strip's popularity soared. Fritzi Ritz devolved to a secondary character, and her boyfriend, Phil Fumble, eventually disappeared altogether. Comics historian [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia|Don Markstein]] ascribed the strip's success to Bushmiller's "bold, clear art style, combined with his ability to construct a type of gag that appealed to a very broad audience.&lt;ref name=toonop&gt;{{citation| title= Nancy| work= Don Markstein's Toonopedia| url=http://www.toonopedia.com/nancy.htm|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phil Fumble made a reappearance in the November 27, 2012, strip,&lt;ref name="phil"&gt;{{citation |title= Nancy|url= http://www.gocomics.com/nancy/2012/11/27| date= November 27, 2012| publisher= GoComics.com|last=Gilchrist |first= Guy |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a regular character as of early January 2013, with the intention of furthering his relationship with Aunt Fritzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Nancy|url= http://www.gocomics.com/nancy/2013/01/07| date= January 7, 2013| publisher= GoComics.com|last=Gilchrist |first= Guy |accessdate= 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fritzi Ritz'' continued as a [[Sunday strip|Sunday feature]] until 1968. At its peak in the 1970s, ''Nancy'' ran in more than 880 newspapers, before falling to 79 shortly before Gilchrist's retirement.&lt;ref name="tennessean"&gt;Schmitt, Brad. [https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/02/guy-gilchrist-nancy-comic-strip-sluggo/993404001/ "'Nancy' comic strip's Guy Gilchrist to step away after 22 years of Sluggo-ing it out,"] ''USA TODAY'' (Jan. 2, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Plastino]] worked on Sunday episodes of ''Nancy'' in 1982–1983 after Bushmiller died. During that period, [[David Letterman]] showed on TV a ''Nancy'' panel with Plastino's signature and made a joke about Plastino as a superhero name. (Letterman's writers were apparently unaware that Plastino was known for his superheroes.)

The strip has continued to the present day [[zombie strip|by different writers and artists]]. [[Mark Lasky]] briefly handled the strip in 1983 until his death from cancer at age 29. The strip was handed to [[Jerry Scott]] in 1984, who gradually started to draw the strip in a much different, more modern style than other incarnations. In 1994, the syndicate began seeking a replacement for Scott; applicants included [[Ivan Brunetti]]&lt;ref name=Brunetti&gt;[http://mikelynchcartoons.blogspot.ca/2007/08/i-almost-drew-nancy-by-ivan-brunetti.html I ALMOST DREW NANCY], by [[Ivan Brunetti]]; in ''Roctober'' magazine, #26 (1999/2000); archived online at MikeLynchCartoons.blogspot.com; retrieved October 25, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gary Hallgren]]&lt;ref name=Hallgren&gt;[http://www.garyhallgren.com/upload/portfolio/250_1.jpg garyhallgren.com gallery]; retrieved May 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1995, [[Guy Gilchrist|Guy and Brad Gilchrist]] were given control of the strip, returning the artwork to its traditional style;&lt;ref name=toonop/&gt; Guy Gilchrist subsequently became the sole author and illustrator.

On January 2, 2018, Gilchrist announced that after 22 years, his last ''Nancy'' strip would be February 18, 2018, which involved the marriage between the characters of Fritzi Ritz and Phil Fumble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/02/guy-gilchrist-nancy-comic-strip-sluggo/993404001/|title='Nancy' comic strip's Guy Gilchrist to step away after 22 years of Sluggo-ing it out|last=Schmitt|first=Brad|work=[[The Tennessean]]|date=January 2, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a two-month hiatus, the strip resumed on April 9 with "21st-century female perspective" from a person using the [[pen name]] Olivia Jaimes, the strip's first-ever female author. 75 newspapers still ran the strip. Jaimes said, "Nancy has been my favorite sassy grouch for a long time. I’m excited to be sassy and grouchy through her voice instead of just mine" and "the Nancy I know and love is a total jerk and also gluttonous and also has big feelings and voraciously consumes her world". [[Tom Spurgeon]] described Jaimes as funny and talented, with an approach to the character that both breaks with and pays homage to Bushmiller's version.&lt;ref name=Post1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/04/08/for-the-first-time-in-her-85-years-nancy-will-be-drawn-by-a-woman/?noredirect=on|title=For the first time in her 85 years, 'Nancy' will be drawn by a woman|last=Cavna|first=Michael|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 8, 2018|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Post2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/09/20/the-private-cartoonist-behind-nancy-will-make-her-public-debut-at-the-cxc-festival/?utm_term=.972bd745ac23 |title=The private cartoonist behind ‘Nancy’ will make her public debut at the CXC festival |author=Michael Cavna |date=September 20, 2018 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vulture"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/nancy-comic-artist-olivia-jaimes-gives-extended-interview.html |title=Olivia Jaimes, the Mysterious Cartoonist Behind ''Nancy'', Gives Rare Interview |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]] |date=November 26, 2018 |accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaimes updated the strip's technology, having Nancy frequently use her [[smartphone]], and learn [[robotics]]. The September 3rd, 2018 strip spawned an [[internet meme]]; it featured Nancy riding a [[Self-balancing scooter|hoverboard]], using a phone, wielding a [[selfie stick]], and proclaiming "Sluggo is [[wikt:lit|lit]]". Jaimes described her aim with that strip to "most upset the person who likes me the least... somebody who’s like,'Nancy sucks now'... what I imagine my greatest hater would despise most is Nancy interacting with every piece of technology using words you don’t understand."&lt;ref name="vulture"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Post2/&gt;

== Art style ==
Bushmiller refined and simplified his drawing style over the years to create a uniquely stylized comic world. ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' illustrates its entry on ''comic strip'' with a ''Nancy'' cartoon. Despite the small size of the reproduction, both the art and the gag are clear, and an eye-tracking survey once determined that ''Nancy'' was so conspicuous that it was the first strip most people viewed on a newspaper comics page.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In a 1988 essay, "[[How to Read Nancy]]", [[Mark Newgarden]] and [[Paul Karasik]] offered a probing analysis of Bushmiller's strip:

{{Quote|To say that ''Nancy'' is a simple gag strip about a simple-minded slot-nosed kid is to miss the point completely. Nancy only appears to be simple at a casual glance. Like architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]], the simplicity is a carefully designed function of a complex amalgam of formal rules laid out by the designer. To look at Bushmiller as an architect is entirely appropriate, for Nancy is, in a sense, a blueprint for a comic strip. Walls, floors, rocks, trees, ice-cream cones, motion lines, midgets and principals are carefully positioned with no need for further embellishment. And they are laid out with one purpose in mind—to get the gag across. Minimalist? Formalist? Structuralist? Cartoonist!&lt;ref name=fantcy&gt;{{cite web |title=Fantagraphics Books to Begin 'Nancy' Reprint Project |url=http://www.comicbookbin.com/fantagraphicsbooks093.html |website= Comicbookbin.com |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Comics theorist [[Scott McCloud]] described the essence of Nancy:
{{blockquote|Ernie Bushmiller's comic strip ''Nancy'' is a landmark achievement: A comic so simply drawn it can be reduced to the size of a postage stamp and still be legible; an approach so formulaic as to become the very definition of the "gag-strip"; a sense of humor so obscure, so mute, so without malice as to allow faithful readers to march through whole decades of art and story without ever once cracking a smile. ''Nancy'' is Plato's playground. Ernie Bushmiller didn't draw A tree, A house, A car. Oh, no. Ernie Bushmiller drew ''the'' tree, ''the'' house, ''the'' car. Much has been made of the "three rocks." Art Spiegelman explains how a drawing of three rocks in a background scene was Ernie's way of showing us there were some rocks in the background. It was always three. Why? Because two rocks wouldn't be "some rocks." Two rocks would be a pair of rocks. And four rocks was unacceptable because four rocks would indicate "some rocks" but it would be one rock more than was necessary to convey the idea of "some rocks." A ''Nancy'' panel is an irreduceable concept, an atom, and the comic strip is a molecule.&lt;ref&gt;McCloud, Scott. [http://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/nancy/index.html "Five Card Nancy,"] ScottMcCloud.com. Accessed Dec. 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cartoonist [[Wally Wood]] described ''Nancy''&amp;apos;s design more succinctly: "By the time you decided not to read it, you already had."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Sacks| first= Mike| title=Poking a Dead Frog| year= 2014| publisher= Penguin Books| page= 339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fritzi Ritz''', Nancy's paternal aunt, with whom she lives. She is drawn in a more realistic style than the children characters. The character was gradually phased out beginning in the mid-1980s before being dropped entirely by the end of the decade. She subsequently returned as a main character in 1995 when the strip was taken over by brothers Brad and [[Guy Gilchrist]]. In the current version of ''Nancy'', Fritzi acts as Nancy's full time carer.
* '''Phil Fumble''', Fritzi's boyfriend. A central character in the strip until disappearing in 1968, he made a reappearance in late 2012, subsequently marrying Frizti in Gilchrist's last strip.&lt;ref name="tennessean" /&gt; This marriage does not appear in the current version of the strip.
* '''Sluggo Smith''',&lt;ref name=April18/&gt; Nancy's best friend, introduced in 1938. Sluggo is Nancy's age and is a poor ragamuffin-type from the wrong side of the tracks. He is sometimes described as Nancy's boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Gilchrist |first=Guy |title= Nancy |url=http://www.gocomics.com/nancy/2013/11/01 |publisher= GoComics.com |accessdate=2014-05-30 |date=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Gilchrist |first=Guy |title= Nancy |url=http://www.gocomics.com/nancy/2014/05/24 |publisher=GoComics.com |accessdate=2014-05-30 |date=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as lazy, and his favorite pastime seems to be napping.

* '''Rollo Haveall''', the stereotypical but nonetheless friendly rich kid. In the early 1940s, the rich kid was known as '''Marmaduke'''. It is possible that the name was changed to avoid confusion with ''[[Marmaduke]]'', an unrelated comic strip by [[Brad Anderson (cartoonist)|Brad Anderson]] that debuted in 1954.{{Citation needed |date=April 2013}} In 2013, his father's name is given as Rollo Marmaduke Sr.&lt;ref name=Marmaduke&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.gocomics.com/nancy/2013/04/24 |title= Nancy |last=Gilchrist |first=Guy |publisher= GoComics.com |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Nancy's unnamed teacher''', an adult drawn in the style of Nancy, whose internal monologue often reflects on the difficulty and rewards of teaching.

* '''Oona Goosepimple''', the spooky looking child who lives in a haunted house down the road from Nancy's house. She originally appeared only in the comic book version of the strip, during John Stanley's tenure in the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/oona.htm Toonopedia entry for Oona Goosepimple]&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in the actual comic strip for the first time on October 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.gocomics.com/nancy/2013/10/16 |title= Nancy |last=Gilchrist |first=Guy |publisher= GoComics.com |date=October 16, 2013 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Bushmiller won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Humor Comic Strip Award for 1961 and the Society's [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] for Best Cartoonist of the Year in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reuben Award Winners 1946–present|url=http://www.reuben.org/reuben.html|accessdate=April 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420080045/http://www.reuben.org/reuben.html|archivedate=April 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the strip was selected as one of the 20 in the "[[Comic Strip Classics]]" series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps.

==Comic books==
There were first several Fritzi Ritz comic stories in comics published by United Feature. These include ''Fritzi Ritz'' No. 1 (1948), 3–7 (1949), #27–36 (1953–1954);  ''United Comics'' #8–36 (1950–1953); ''Tip Topper Comics'' #1–28 (1949–1954); St John published ''Fritzi Ritz'' #37–55 (1955–1957). Dell published ''Fitzi Ritz'' #56–59 (1957–1958)

Nancy appeared in comic books—initially in a 1940s comic strip reprint title from United Feature, later [[St. John Publications]] and later in a [[Dell Comics|Dell]] comic written by [[John Stanley (cartoonist)|John Stanley]]. Titled ''Nancy and Sluggo'', United Feature published #16–23 (1949–1954), St. John published #121–145 (1955–1957). Titled ''Nancy'', until retitled ''Nancy and Sluggo'' with issue #174, Dell published #146–187 (1957–1962). ([[Hy Eisman]] produced some of Dell's Nancy stories in 1960-61.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/getting-hy-on-comics-a-profile-of-hy-eisman/ "A Profile of Hy Eisman"], ''Hogan's Alley'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; Gold Key published #188–192 (1962–1963). Dell also published ''Dell Giants'' devoted to Nancy (#35, No. 45 and "Traveltime"), and a ''Four Color'' #1034.&lt;ref name=toonop/&gt; Nancy and Sluggo also appeared in stories in ''Tip Top Comics'' published by United Feature (#1–188), St. Johns (#189–210), and Dell (#211–225), ''Sparkler'' #1–120 (1941–1954) and ''Sparkle'' #1–33 (1953–1954) published by United Feature. Fritzi Ritz and Nancy appeared in several ''Comics on Parade'' (#32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 55, 57, 60–104) published by United Feature.

''Nancy'' was reprinted in the UK comic book, ''[[The Topper (comics)|The Topper]]'', from the 1950s through the 1970s. ''Nancy'' also had its own monthly comic book magazine of newspaper reprints in Norway (where the strip is known as ''Trulte'') during 1956–1959.

==Animation==
Nancy was featured in two animated shorts by the [[Terrytoons]] studio in 1942–1943: ''School Daze'' and ''Doing Their Bit''. In 1971, several newly created Nancy and Sluggo cartoons appeared on the Saturday morning cartoon series, ''[[Archie's TV Funnies]]'', which starred the Archie Comic Series characters running a television station. Nancy appeared along with seven other comic strip characters: [[Marty Links|Emmy Lou]], [[Broom-Hilda]], [[Dick Tracy]], [[Howard Post|The Dropouts]], [[Moon Mullins]], [[The Katzenjammer Kids|the Captain and the Kids]] and [[Smokey Stover]]. The series lasted one season. In 1978, she was also featured in several segments of Filmation's animated show ''[[Fabulous Funnies]]'', a repackaging of Archie's TV Funnies material minus the Archie characters wraparounds.

==Foreign versions==
Nancy has been translated into foreign languages.  In French, Nancy is called Philomène in Canada, and Zoé in France, where the strip is called ''Arthur et Zoé'' (Arthur being the French name of Sluggo).  The Philomène strip appeared in Canadian French-language newspapers on January 16, 2006. Nancy also appeared on the back cover of the popular Arabic children magazine [[Majid (comics)|Majid]] during the 80s, she was known as Moza while Sluggo was portrayed as her brother Rashoud.

McCloud also included a Nancy cameo in his book, ''[[Understanding Comics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/nancy/index.html 5-card Nancy]&lt;/ref&gt; When describing the "non-sequitur" transition type, several unrelated images appear between panels. One is an upside-down picture of Nancy being struck by lightning with the caption "Danger".
* Cartoonist [[Mark Newgarden]] has included Nancy in his work.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
*''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'' cartoonist [[Stephan Pastis]] (known for using other comic characters in his strip) portrayed Nancy and Sluggo as [[extra (acting)|extras]] to replace [[List of Pearls Before Swine characters|Rat and Goat]] during the 2003 "Pearls Labor Dispute".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2003/05/16|title=Pearls Before Swine by Stephan Pastis, May 16, 2003 Via @GoComics|last=Pastis|first=Stephan|website=GoComics|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' has run several parodies, including "Nansy", in which Nancy is transformed into the main character of several other comic strips, including ''[[Donald Duck]]'', ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' and ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', all with that same hyphen-nose and frizzy hairdo. Also in ''Mad'', Bushmiller gets the hardboiled treatment: "If Mickey Spillane Wrote Nancy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv234.html If Mickey Spillane Wrote Nancy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quino]]'s ''[[Mafalda]]'' bears a strong resemblance to the earlier ''Nancy'', which Quino mocks in one strip.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* Cartoonist [[Max Cannon]] often includes Stubbo, a boy drawn in Bushmiller's style, in his ''[[Red Meat]]'' strip.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The '''National Theatre of Albania''' ({{lang-sq|Teatri Kombëtar}}) is the main theatre in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://etc-cte.org/members_page.php?idm=51&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building of the theater dates since 1939 following the Italian occupation of Albania. It was previously a movie theatre and was primarily built to serve Italian soldiers as a form of entertainment or dopolavoro. It was later called the ''Kosovo Movie Theatre'' ({{lang-sq|Kinema Teater Kosova}}). The inauguration and naming to Professional Theatre of the State ({{lang-sq|Teatër Profesionist i Shtetit}}) occurred on May 24, 1945. Later the theatre was called Popular Theatre ({{lang-sq|Teatri Popullor}}). It held that name until June 1991 when it was called ''National Theatre''.&lt;ref&gt;http://teater.logoreci.com/historiku/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Albanian government decided to demolish the building of the theatre and has temporarily relocated it at ArTurbina on Sami Frasheri St in Tirana Re district of Tirana.

A new theatre will be constructed on the grounds of the current theater amidst criticism from some groups.

In the National Theatre of Albania have been shown unforgettable pieces, interpreted with high artistic values.  The following plays have left a lasting impression in the memory of spectators:

[[Image:New York State Theater by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|The classic [[proscenium]] style stage of the [[New York State Theater]].]]

==Types of theatres==
{{Main|Stage (theatre)}}
* [[Arena]]: The playing area is in the center of a large open space which usually seats thousands of people.
* [[Proscenium]]: The audience directly faces the playing area which is separated by a portal called the [[proscenium arch]].  The stage is often raised a few feet higher than the first rows of the audience.  The audience is on a rake, getting higher as the seating goes towards the rear of the house.
* [[Thrust stage|Thrust]]: The playing area protrudes out into the house with the audience seating on 3 sides.
* [[Theatre in the round]]: The playing area is surrounded by audience seating on all sides.
* [[Traverse stage|Traverse]]: The elongated playing area is surrounded by audience seating on two sides.
* [[Black box theatre]]: A bare-bones stage of various seating types.

==Stage==
[[Image:Stage Layout Plan.jpg|thumb|Areas of a typical (proscenium) stage.]]  
The area of the theatre in which the performance takes place is referred to as the stage.

===Stage directions or stage positions===
In order to keep track of how performers and set pieces move around the space, the stage is divided up into sections oriented based on the performers perspective to the audience. Movement is choreographed by blocking which is organized movement on stage created by the director to synchronize the actor's movement onstage in order to use these positions.

* Upstage: The area of the stage furthest from the audience.
* Downstage: The area of the stage closest to the audience.
* Stage Left: The area of the stage to the ''performer's'' left, when facing downstage (i.e. towards the audience).
* Stage Right: The area of the stage to the ''performer's'' right, when facing downstage (i.e. towards the audience).
* Center Stage: The center of the playing (performance) area.
* Center Line: An imaginary reference line on the playing area that indicates the exact center of the stage, travelling from up to downstage.
* Onstage: The portion of the playing area visible to the audience.
* Offstage: The area surrounding the playing space not visible to the audience.  Typically this refers to spaces accessible to the performers but not the audience, such as the wings, crossovers, and voms.

Note that for non-proscenium performance spaces, typically one direction is arbitrarily denoted as "downstage" and all other directions reference that point.

===Stage components===
* [[Apron stage|Apron]]: The area of the stage in front of the proscenium arch, which may be small or, in a [[thrust stage]], large. 
* Backstage: Areas of the theatre adjacent to the stage accessible only to performers and technicians, including the wings, crossover, and dressing rooms.  Typically this refers to areas directly accessible from the stage and does not include spaces such as the [[Control booth (theater)|control booth]] or [[Orchestra pit]]
* Crossover: The area used by performers and technicians to travel from stage left to right out of sight of the audience onstage created with masking and drapery.
* Plaster Line: An imaginary reference line on the playing area that indicates where the proscenium arch is.  Typically, the plaster line runs across the stage at the back face (upstage face) of the proscenium wall.
* [[Proscenium arch|Proscenium]]: The portal that divides the audience from the stage in traditional Western theatres.
* [[Prompt corner]]: Area just to one side of the proscenium where the [[stage manager]] stands to cue the show and prompt performers.
* [[Rake (theatre)|Rake]]: A slope in the performance space (stage), rising away from the audience.
* [[Safety curtain]]: A heavy fireproof curtain, in fiberglass, iron or similar material placed immediately behind the proscenium.
* [[Shell (theater)|Shell]]: A hard, often removable surface, designed to reflect sound out into the audience for musical performances. 
* [[Safety curtain#Related stage fire safety devices|Smoke Pocket]]: Vertical channels against the proscenium designed to contain the [[safety curtain]].
* [[Thrust stage]]: A performance space projecting well in front of the proscenium arch, usually with the audience on three sides.  
* [[Stage (theatre)#Proscenium stage|Wings]]: Areas that are part of a stage deck but offstage (out of sight of the audience). The wings are typically masked with [[Theater drapes and stage curtains#Legs, borders and tabs|legs]].  The wing space is used for [[performer]]s preparing to enter, storage of [[Set construction|set]]s for scenery changes and as a [[stagehand]] work area.  Wings also contain technical equipment, such as the [[fly system]].

==House==

The '''house''' can refer to any area which is not considered playing space or backstage area.  Outside the theatre itself this includes the lobby, coat check, ticketing counters, and restrooms.  More specifically, the house refers to any area in the theatre where the audience is seated.  This can also include aisles, the orchestra pit, control booth, [[balconies]] and [[Box (theatre)|boxes]].

* [[Orchestra pit|Orchestra or Orchestra Pit]]: In productions where live music is required, such as ballet, folk-dance groups, opera, and musicals, the orchestra is positioned in front and below of the stage in a pit. The pit is usually a large opening ranging from {{convert|4|-|6|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|20|-|40|ft|m}} long and {{convert|6|-|10|ft|m}} deep.  Some orchestra pits have lifts or elevators that can raise the floor of the pit up to the same height as the stage. This allows for easier movement of instruments among other things. Often an orchestra pit will be equipped with a removable pit cover which provides safety by eliminating the steep drop off and also increases the available acting area above. In most cases, some sort of lattice or sound port is built into the front of the orchestra pit, to allow audience members in the front rows to hear the music while still having a wall to keep them separated from the orchestra. The orchestra pit is the closest to the audience.
* [[Auditorium]]: The section of the theatre designated for the viewing of a performance.  Includes the [[patron]]s main seating area, [[balconies]], [[Box (theatre)|boxes]], and entrances from the lobby.  Typically the control booth is located in the back of the auditorium, although for some types of performance an [[Audio mixing (live audio)|audio mixing]] positing in located closer to the stage within the seating. 
* [[Vomitorium]]: A passage situated below or behind a tier of seats.
* [[Control booth]]: The section of the theatre designated for the operation of technical equipment, followspots, lighting and sound boards, and is sometimes the location of the stage manager's station.  The control booth is located in the theatre in such a way that there is a good, unobstructed view of the playing area without causing any (or minimal) distraction to the audience (i.e. preventing distracting light leak or noise), and is generally an enclosed space.
* [[Catwalk (theater)|Catwalks]]: A catwalk is a section of the house hidden in the ceiling from which many of the technical functions of a theatre, such as lighting and sound, may be manipulated.

===Front of house===
{{main|Front of house}}

* [[Lobby (room)|Lobby]]: The lobby is a room in a theatre which is used for public entry to the building from the outside.  Ticket counters, coat check, concessions and restrooms are all usually located in, or just off the lobby.
* [[Box office]]: A place where tickets are sold to the public for admission to a venue
* [[Marquee (sign)|Marquee]]: Signage stating either the name of the establishment or the play and the artist(s) appearing at that venue.

==Backstage or offstage==
The areas of a theatre that are not part of the house or stage are considered part of backstage.  These areas include dressing rooms, green rooms, offstage areas (i.e. wings), cross-overs, fly rails or linesets, dimmer rooms, shops and storage areas.

* Dressing rooms: Rooms where cast members apply wigs, [[make-up]] and change into [[costumes]]. Depending on the size of the theatre, there may be only a male and female dressing room, or there might be many (i.e. one for each member of the cast). Often in larger spaces, cast members in lead roles have their own dressing room, those in supporting roles share with one or two others and those in the background or "chorus" roles share with up to 10 or 15 other people. Dressing rooms generally feature a large number of switchable outlets for accessories like [[hair dryer]]s, [[straightening iron]]s, and [[curlers]]. They also feature mirrors, which are often lit. Sinks are present for the removal of makeup and sometimes a dressing room will have [[shower]]s and [[restroom]]s attached. Lockers, or costume racks are generally used for storage of costumes. In some performances, dressing rooms are used as a secondary [[green room]] because of space limitation or noise, especially by performers with long breaks between stage appearances.
* [[Green room]]: The lounge backstage.  This is the room where actors and other performers wait in when they are not needed onstage or in their dressing rooms.
* Crossover: A crossover is a hallway, room, or catwalk designed to allow actors in a theater to move from wings on one side of a stage to wings on the other side without being seen by the audience. Sometimes this is built as a part of the theater, sometimes exiting the building is required, and still other times the set includes a false wall to create a temporary crossover. A trap room, orchestra pit, or even the front of house can be used as crossovers.
* [[Fly system]]: A fly system is a system of ropes, counterweights, pulleys, and other such tools designed to allow a technical crew to quickly move set pieces, lights, and microphones on and off stage quickly by "flying" them in from a large opening above the stage known as a fly tower/flyspace.
* [[Catwalk (theater)|Catwalk]]: A catwalk is an elevated platform from which many of the technical functions of a theatre, such as lighting and sound, may be manipulated.
* Dimmer room: The room backstage which contains the [[dimmer|dimmer racks]] which power the lighting rig in the theatre.  Often dimmer racks may not be housed in dedicated room, instead they may be in a mechanical room, control booth, or catwalk, or even on the side of the stage as is often the case on Broadway, touring shows, or at corporate events.  When the dimmers are stored onstage, this area of the stage is known as the "Dimmer Beach". In the UK it is known as "Dimmer City".
* [[Scene shop|Shops]] and storage areas: Depending on the space available a theatre may have its own storage areas for old scenic and costume elements as well as lighting and sound equipment.  The theatre may also include its own lighting, scenic, costume and sound shops.  In these shops each element of the show is constructed and prepared for each production.
* Call board: Literally a backstage [[bulletin board]] which contains information about a theatrical production including contact sheets, schedules, rehearsal time changes, etc.
* {{anchor|Trap room}}Trap room: A large open space under the stage of many large theatres. The trap room allows the stage floor to be leveled, extra electrical equipment to be attached, and most importantly, the placement of trap doors onto the stage (hence the name). It is usually unfinished and often doubles as a storage area. It is often also used as a substitute for a crossover.

'''''Petpet Park''''' was a [[digital pet|virtual pet]] [[website]] launched by [[Nickelodeon Kids &amp; Family Virtual Worlds Group]]  (formerly [[Neopets]]) in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?comments=3536 Jellyneo News - Petpet Park Beta Now Open!]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22]&lt;/ref&gt; The site is created by the Neopets team, the creators of [[Neopets]] and [[Monkey Quest]]. The game featured a new virtual world focused on Neopets' companions, [[Petpets]]. There were nine Petpets species in ''Petpet Park'' to choose from.  Once chosen, users could help train them through games, activities and challenges and customise them and take them out to explore the park and meet friends.&lt;ref name="About Petpet Park"&gt;[http://www.petpetpark.com/help/about About Petpet Park]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2014, it was announced via ''[[Neopets]]'' that Petpet Park would cease all operations and be taken offline following its purchase by [[JumpStart]].&lt;ref name="GameOffline"&gt;[http://www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2014-09-08 Website. Retrieved on 2014-09-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company ==

[[Nickelodeon Kids &amp; Family Virtual Worlds Group]], formerly [[Neopets, Inc.]], develops and manages all virtual world initiatives for kids, preteens, teens and families for the Nickelodeon Kids &amp; Family Group. ''Petpet Park'' is a virtual world created based on one of their most popular properties, Neopets, an online youth-targeted virtual world where members adopt and care for a virtual companion who accompanies them through an array of games, communities and fantastical lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neopets.com/ Neopets.com]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Pppcelebration.png|left|200px|thumb|Petpet Park Celebration]]
On September 4  2008 [[Neopets]] began a ''Petpet Park'' mini plot to promote their new virtual world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnyneo.com/plots/PetpetPark/ Petpet Park Guide]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt; During this plot, users were asked to act as agents of the Petpet Protection League (PPL) in order to help Petpets crossing over from Petaria to Neopia arrive at ''Petpet Park'' safely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neopets.com/petpetpark/missions.phtml PPL Mission Headquarters]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt; Missions were given by a Cloud Bruce (type of Neopet) named Weltrude. Weltrude acts as head of the Petpet Protection League Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fgn-guild.com/gameguide/games/petpetpark/about.php FGN-Guild - About Petpet Park]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Over the course of several weeks, users could solve various puzzles and lead the six Petpet species safely to ''Petpet Park''. During the missions the users learned information about the Petpet species including temperament, favourite foods, and special skills in addition to the storyline of ''Petpet Park''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neopets.com/petpetpark/missions.phtml Petpet Protection League Mission Headquarters]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-28&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, the Mission Headquarters had updated and Mother Bruce gave out rewards to those players who helped the Petpets successfully. Prizes included Neopoints, a site theme and a Petpet Park wearable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnyneo.com/plots/PetpetPark/prizes.php SunnyNeo Petpet Park Plot Prizes]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site content ==
''Petpet Park'' revolves around [[Petpets]], small creatures of Neopia who accompany Neopets. Once adopted, users can customise their Petpet with clothing and feed them. Users can play games to earn Park Points (the currency of Petpet Park) to buy clothing and food, like pizza.
Users can also chat and interact with other users and play games.&lt;ref name="About Petpet Park"/&gt;

Users found breaking the rules set in the Terms and Conditions may have their account suspended or permanently "frozen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petpetpark.com/help/terms Petpet Park Terms &amp; Conditions]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petpets ===
There are 9 species of [[Petpets]] to choose from in ''Petpet Park''. Each one has its own traits, though they do not affect gameplay. As of January 1, 2011, there are 9 Petpets species, three of which are exclusive to the new morphing potions and possibly potential "limited edition" Petpets.

*'''Dipni''' - Dipnis are timid, wary Petpets that are easily startled. Despite this, they are still affectionate and shyly inquisitive, and they make gurgling noises when they're happy.
*'''Oukin''' - Oukins are normally tranquil Petpets, but their warning shriek can call other Oukins to their aid, making them quite a force to be reckoned with.
*'''Pinixy''' - Pinixy are active, rambunctious Petpets, always engaged in some physical activity or another, whether it's running, jumping, wrestling, or climbing.
*'''Hifflo''' - Hifflos are sweet, affectionate Petpets that possess great grace and a love for music. Though they like to relax, they can run very fast for short distances. It is said that a good song can lure in any Hifflo.
*'''Drym''' - Dryms are curious, mischievous Petpets, though they are more a source of amusement than they are troublemakers. They love digging for shiny objects, and they're especially fond of burrowing through snow.
* '''Kassegat''' - Kassegats are intelligent, clever Petpets that live in lush jungle areas. These agile Petpets love nothing more than exploring and eating jungle fruit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neopets.com/petpetpark/comic.phtml?chapter=1 Neopets - PPL Mission Profiles]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bandalu''' - Bandalus are wise and friendly creatures and are only attainable through Neocash morphing potions.
* '''Puxa''' - Puxa are swift agile creatures and are only attainable through Neocash morphing potions.
* '''Mumbat''' - Mumbats are mischievous, and fun-loving and are also free and through morphing potions.

=== Exclusive Content ===
Certain features on Petpet Park will require a user to buy a membership to access them. As on [[Neopets]], Petpet Park allows use of the NC Mall to purchase items to customise a user's [[Petpet]], but users can sample clothing before purchase. The NC Mall has been open on Petpet Park since July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petpetpark.com/help/faq  Petpet Park FAQ]. Website. Retrieved on 2009-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shutdown ==
On September 9, 2014, Neopets announced that they will close Petpet Park on September 18, 2014 after being purchased by [[JumpStart]].&lt;ref name="GameOffline" /&gt;

==Neopets end of control of the domain==
On May 2017, Neopets failed to pay for the domain for this website, current status is an advertising page auto generates advertising content, still linked to on Neopets beta page for the park posing a risk for account and information theft. Google has since stopped listing this domain as associated with the park.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neopets.com/petpetpark/celebration.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery Efforts== 
In February 2018, a group of players from the now discontinued game recovered files previously cached and archived prior to the closing of Petpet Park. Due to a lack of files, many have resorted to rebuilding the rooms from the game thus reviving some members from the art community of Petpet Park &lt;ref&gt;https://facebook.com/PetpetProject/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portnoy's Complaint''''' is a 1969 American novel by [[Philip Roth]]. Its success turned Roth into a major celebrity, sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of [[masturbation]] using various props including a piece of liver.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; The novel tells the humorous [[monologue]] of "a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor," who confesses to his psychoanalyst in "intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language."&lt;ref name="Saxton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brauner"/&gt; Many of its characteristics (such as comedic prose, themes of sexual desire and [[sexual frustration]], and a self-conscious literariness) went on to become Roth trademarks.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Portnoy's Complaint'' 52nd on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included this novel in its "''TIME'' 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html | work=Time | title=All Time 100 Novels | date=2005-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and themes==
Structurally, ''Portnoy's Complaint'' is a continuous monologue by narrator Alexander Portnoy to his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], Dr. Spielvogel; Roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by "the permissive conventions of the patient-analyst situation," which would "permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language that [...] in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic, exhibitionistic, and nothing but obscene."&lt;ref name="Saxton"&gt;Saxton (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brauner"&gt;Brauner (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;43–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel is set primarily in New Jersey from the 1940s to the 1960s. Portnoy is "a lust-ridden, mother addicted young Jewish bachelor",&lt;ref name="Saxton"/&gt; and the [[narration]] weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life; every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma: his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative (and, in his mind, degrading and shameful) acts of [[eroticism]];{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} also, much of his dilemma is that "his sense of himself, his past, and his ridiculous destiny is so ''fixed''."&lt;ref name="Saxton"/&gt; Roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book. On the first page of the novel, one finds this clinical definition of "Portnoy's Complaint", as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction:

{{quote|Portnoy's Complaint: A disorder in which strongly felt [[Ethics|ethical]] and [[Altruism|altruistic]] impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature&amp;nbsp;...}}

The title also alludes to the common literary form of ''complaint,'' such as "[[A Lover's Complaint]]", which typically presents the speaker's comments on being a spurned lover.

Other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of American Jews, their relationship to the Jews of [[Israel]], and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a Jewish family.

''Portnoy's Complaint'' is also emblematic of the times during which it was published. Most obviously, the book's sexual frankness was both a product of and a reflection on the [[sexual revolution]] that was in full swing during the late 1960s. And the book's narrative style, a huge departure from the stately, semi-[[Henry James|Jamesian]] prose of Roth's earlier novels, has often been likened to the [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] performances of 1960s comedian [[Lenny Bruce]].

The novel is notable for its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of [[masturbation]] using various props including a piece of liver&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88787165 |title="Portnoy's Complaint"? Self-love and self-loathing |publisher=npr.org |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Portnoy's mother later serves for dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/sep/07/portnoys-complaint-shocking-49 |title=''Portnoy's Complaint'' – Still shocking at 40 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-10-01 |location=London |first=Chris |last=Cox |date=2009-09-07 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Roth had begun work on ''Portnoy's Complaint'' in 1967, before publication of his novel ''When She Was Good'' that year. The piece had its genesis in a satirical monologue Roth had written to accompany a slide show proposed for inclusion in the risqué revue ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'' that would focus on the sexual organs of the rich and famous.

While the slide show would never come to fruition, Roth found part of the accompanying monologue about masturbation salvageable. Roth re-fashioned the material for the novel and sold a chapter of the book, entitled "Whacking Off", to ''[[Partisan Review]]''. Progress on the novel was slow because Roth was suffering from [[writer's block]] relating to his ex-wife, Margaret Martinson, and the unpleasant notion that any royalties generated by the novel would have to be split equally with her. In May&amp;nbsp;1968 Martinson was killed in a car crash in [[Central Park]]. Roth's writer's block lifted and following Martinson's funeral he traveled to the [[Yaddo]] literary retreat to complete the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Hofler, pp.&amp;nbsp;48-56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses, reviews and attacks==
The publication of the novel caused a major controversy in American public discourse. The two aspects that evoked such outrage were its explicit and candid treatment about sexuality and obscenities, including detailed depiction of masturbation, which was revolutionary in the late 1960s; and the irreverent portrait of [[Jewish identity]].&lt;ref name="Brauner"/&gt; It sparked an uproar in the Jewish community, even among [[New York intellectuals]] such as [[Irving Howe]] and [[Diana Trilling]].&lt;ref name="Brauner"/&gt;

==Censorship==
In 1969 the book was declared a "prohibited import" in Australia. The Australian publisher, [[Penguin Books]], circumvented the importation ban by having copies printed in Sydney in secret and stored in fleets of moving trucks to avoid seizure under state obscenity laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:C3xkMumKfl0J:https://www.crikey.com.au/2006/08/29/don-chipp-larrikin-censor-and-party-founder/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;lr=lang_de%7Clang_en |title=Don Chipp: larrikin, censor, and party founder |date=29 August 2006 |access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1967 agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and its states had put in place a uniform censorship effort against books on the federal banned books list. According to this agreement, books that were imported into the country would be handled by the Commonwealth, while the states would police local publication and distribution, using state laws to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sawer |first1=Geoffrey |title=Between the Lines |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110451496?searchTerm=%22Portnoy%27s%20Complaint%22&amp;searchLimits=sortby=dateAsc |accessdate=20 August 2017 |work=The Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=27 January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[South Australia]] bucked the system when it came to ''Portnoy's Complaint'', declaring that it would not prosecute sales of the work made to an adult who made a direct enquiry of the vendor, provided the books were kept behind the counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Alan |title=Agreement denied |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110458310?searchTerm=%22Portnoy%27s%20Complaint%22&amp;searchLimits=sortby=dateAsc |accessdate=20 August 2017 |work=The Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=1 September 1970 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to prosecute Penguin and any bookseller carrying the book were successful in Victoria and Queensland, but failed in Western Australia (where "works of recognised artistic, scientific or literary merit" were immune under the local statute, notwithstanding that they may have been obscene) and New South Wales, where prosecutors gave up after two trials resulted in hung juries. The book was removed from the federal banned list for importation in June 1971, the federal government recognising the absurdity that local publications could be sold legally in three states and the Australian Capital Territory. The ''Portnoy'' matter was a watershed in Australian censorship law, marking the last occasion on which the censorship of a literary publication came before the courts.&lt;ref name="The Censor's Library"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Nicole |title=The Censor's Library: Uncovering the Lost History of Australia's Banned Books |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=University of Queensland Press |location=St Lucia |isbn=978-0-7022-3916-8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GYMBq6cHuosC&amp;pg=PT218&amp;lpg=PT218&amp;dq=%22portnoy%27s+complaint%22+queensland+prosecution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fi1eQsxRE5&amp;sig=XLFOSLA6tvHGsWTi7MZ4qnR4og8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-0LrFgubVAhVIzbwKHRGeAEYQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=414 |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many libraries in the United States banned the book because of its detailed discussion of masturbation and its explicit language.&lt;ref name="Brauner"/&gt;

==Allusions to the title==
The popularity of the novel has caused the title to become a sort of shorthand for any form of sexual malaise or activity. In his autobiography, [[Dick Cavett]] wrote that on one occasion when a male guest was unable to appear on his talk show, Cavett jokingly told the studio audience the guest could not attend because he was "''suffering from Portnoy's Complaint''", a comment which the network censors decided to cut from the broadcast tape. [[Gore Vidal]] once quipped to [[Claire Bloom]], Roth's second wife: "''You have already had Portnoy's complaint [her previous husband]. Do not involve yourself with Portnoy''."

On the 8&amp;nbsp;September 2010, episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', as part of an extended segment on the amount of violence in major religious texts, [[Jon Stewart]] and [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] have a debate wherein Stewart claims the book as the main text of Judaism, in response to Oliver's demand of a disavowal regarding the violence depicted in portions of Hebrew sacred texts.

In her [[metafictional]] novel ''Culture Shock'' ([[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworth]] 1988), [[Valerie Grosvenor Myer]] wrote of a satirically presented married couple among her characters:&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us consider my Jean and Jack ... I weighted the scales by presenting them in the rôle of parents ... fictional parents are usually set up as Aunt Sallies to be knocked down ... Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Bennet, Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Nickleby, Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Portnoy; Old Capulet, Mr Dorrit, Dr Sloper.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Get Smart]]'' original TV series, in the fifth-season episode "Do I Hear a Vaults?", aired on 8&amp;nbsp;May 1970, Maxwell Smart alludes to the book being hidden in a public library.

The ''[[Mad Men]]'' character [[Don Draper]] is briefly shown reading the novel in the season seven episode of the series titled "The Monolith."

On the TV series ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', in the episode titled "Coke Dick and the first kick", a female writer for ''Rolling Stone'' magazine calls one of [[Hank Moody]]'s early novels "the retarded man's ''Portnoy's Complaint''".

In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Peter, Chris, &amp; Brian]]", [[Brian Griffin]] makes several references to ''Portnoy's Complaint'', clearly not having read the book and assuming it was about a "''[[port]] [[noise complaint]]''".

In the ''[[Bojack Horseman]]'' episode "Ruthie", [[Princess Carolyn]] remarks "Who knew Portnoy had so many complaints?" in response to fictional actress [[List of BoJack Horseman characters#Courtney Portnoy|Courtney Portnoy]].

A '''property designer''' or '''prop designer''' is a person who designs [[theatrical property|props]] for use in theatre, film, television, etc. Prop designers work in liaison with the [[costume designer]]s, [[set designer]]s and [[sound designer]]s, under the direction of the [[art director]] or [[technical director]].

However, the public seems to associate the term with home designer, or an [[interior designer]], a person who is considered a professional in the field of interior design or one who designs interiors as part of their job.

A '''rimshot''' is a [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcasting]] term for a station that attempts to reach a larger [[media market]] from a distant [[suburb]]an, [[exurb]]an, or even [[rural]] location.  The term is primarily used with [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations, and mainly in [[North America]].  The name derives not from the sound of a [[rimshot]] in music, but rather from [[basketball]], where the ball hits the rim of the basket, and may or may not go in.

Rimshot stations are often at a disadvantage compared to higher-[[signal strength|strength]] signals in a market.  Many rimshot operators attempt to serve the larger market with a signal that has deficiencies in the intended listening area, especially on the far side from where it is transmitted.

Many (if not most) rimshot stations are '''move-in'''s, having moved to about halfway between their [[city of license]] (which they are legally required to cover and serve) and the [[metro area]] which they actually care about.  In this manner, the [[broadcast range]] of the station ideally covers both.  Although stations have traditionally been required to keep their main studio in their community of license, this has become less and less meaningful as more and more have been granted [[waiver]]s to [[Consolidation (media)|consolidate]] [[radio studio]]s at a single location due to [[concentration of media ownership]].

In the U.S., it was [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] MM docket 80-90&lt;ref&gt;https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-83-259A1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that allowed FM stations to have closer spacing, thereby allowing move-ins, and some new stations as well.  This has generally been allowed, especially when it makes room for additional stations in outlying areas.  In these cases, the [[table of allotments]] is amended in a [[rulemaking]] proceeding, although this is not always a requirement to move a station in most cases, depending on each particular situation.

On an international level, stations which attempt to serve another country are called "[[border blaster]]s".  These are primarily Mexican [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations operating at very high power on [[Clear-channel station|clear channels]] to reach the [[American Southwest]] and beyond via [[skywave]] at night.

In Canada, the [[CRTC]] restricts most same-market duopolies in television to channels broadcasting in different languages. Hence, English-language duopolies in major Canadian markets have involved stations licensed to rimshot major cities or serve different portions of a larger metropolitan area (such as [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] for [[Vancouver]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]] for [[Toronto]], and [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]] for [[Ottawa]]).

A '''supervillain''' is a variant of the [[villain]]ous [[stock character]] that is commonly found in [[American comic book]]s, usually possessing [[superhuman]] abilities. A supervillain is the antithesis of a [[superhero]]. A female supervillain is sometimes called a '''supervillainess'''{{citation-needed|date=August 2018}}, although the word supervillain is commonly used for females also.

Supervillains are often used as [[foil (literature)|foils]] to present a daunting challenge to a superhero. In instances where the supervillain does not have superhuman, mystical, or alien powers, the supervillain may possess a genius intellect or a skill set that allows them to draft complex schemes or commit crimes in a way normal humans cannot. Other traits may include [[megalomania]] and possession of considerable resources to further their aims. Many supervillains share some typical characteristics of real world [[dictator]]s, [[gangster]]s, and [[terrorism|terrorists]], with aspirations of [[world domination]] or universal leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=006131;p=0 |title=Eury &amp; Misiroglu On The Supervillain Book |publisher=Comicon.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218045716/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=006131;p=0 |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like superheroes, supervillains are sometimes members of supervillain groups, such as the [[Sinister Six]], the [[Suicide Squad]], the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], the [[Injustice League]], the [[Legion of Doom]], and the [[Masters of Evil]].

'''Sydney John Chaplin''' (born '''Sydney John Hill''', 16 March 1885 – 16 April 1965) was an English actor. He was the elder half-brother of Sir [[Charlie Chaplin]] and served as his [[business manager]], and was the a half-uncle of the actor [[Sydney Chaplin (American actor)|Sydney Chaplin]] (1926–2009), who was named after him.

== Early life ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
Chaplin was born to 19-year-old Hannah Hill in London. Hannah claimed Sydney's father was a man named Sydney Hawkes, but his father's identity was never verified. The Chaplin surname was adopted following his mother's marriage to [[Charles Chaplin, Sr.]], a year after his birth. 

While Syd and brother Charlie were in the [[Cuckoo Schools]] in [[Hanwell]] following his mother's mental collapse, Syd was placed in the programme designed to train young boys to become seamen, on the [[Exmouth]] training ship docked at [[Grays]], Essex. He followed this training period with several years working on ships, receiving high marks from all of his employers. But his ambition was to get into the entertainment business and he left his final voyage with that in mind.

In 1905 Charlie and Sydney worked briefly together in one of their first stage appearances, ''Sherlock Holmes''. Syd was briefly cast as a villain in that play. In 1906 however, he landed a contract with [[Fred Karno]], of Karno's London Comedians and was to fight hard to bring Charlie into the company two years later. Charlie never achieved the sort of fame Syd did as a principal comedian for that company, but that was to be the only time that Syd was able to outdo his brother—at least in front of an audience.

After Charlie achieved worldwide fame in the 1910s, the brothers discovered they had another half-brother through their mother, [[Wheeler Dryden]], who had been removed from his mother's care as an infant and brought up abroad by his father. Wheeler was also an actor, and the brothers reunited in Hollywood in 1918, occasionally working together at Chaplin's studio through to the 1950s.

[[File:A Submarine Pirate 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Syd Chaplin at the periscope in a scene still from "A Submarine Pirate" (Keystone 1915).]]

== Career ==
As Charlie was negotiating his [[Keystone Studios|Keystone]] contract, he suggested Sydney be asked to join the company, and Syd and his wife Minnie Chaplin arrived in California in October 1914. Syd made a few comedies there, including the "Gussle" comedies, and the comedy short ''[[A Submarine Pirate]]'' in 1915, which, second to ''Tillie's Punctured Romance,'' was the most financially successful comedy Keystone ever made.

Following this success, Sydney decided to leave the screen to negotiate Charlie a better contract. After getting him a $500,000 contract with [[Mutual Film|Mutual]] on 27 February 1916, he got him his first million dollar ($1.25&amp;nbsp;million) contract on 17 June 1917 with [[First National Pictures|First National]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/charlie-chaplin_biography.htm Cobbles.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon he was handling the majority of Charlie's business affairs, including a failed sheet music business and a successful merchandising one, in addition to further contract negotiation. He also appeared in a few films during the First National era, such as ''Pay Day'' and ''The Pilgrim''. Sydney achieved his own million-dollar contract from [[Famous Players-Lasky]] in 1919, but a series of problems resulted in only one failed film, ''[[King, Queen, Joker]]'' (1921), disappearing from the screen once again. Later films include ''[[The Perfect Flapper]]'' (1924) with [[Colleen Moore]], ''A Christie Comedy'', ''[[Charley's Aunt (1925 film)|Charley's Aunt]]'' (1925) and five features for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], including ''[[The Man on the Box]]'' (1925), ''[[Oh, What a Nurse!]]'' (1926), ''[[The Missing Link (1927 film)|The Missing Link]]'' (1927), ''[[The Fortune Hunter (1927 film)|The Fortune Hunter]]'' (1927), and ''[[The Better 'Ole (1926 film)|The Better 'Ole]]'' (1926). The last is perhaps his best-known film today because of his characterisation of cartoonist [[Bruce Bairnsfather]]'s famous [[World War I]] character, [[Old Bill]], and the fact that it was the second Warner Bros. film to have a [[Vitaphone]] soundtrack.  It is also believed by many to have the first spoken word of dialogue, "coffee", although there are those who disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Eyman, Scott. ''The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution 1926–1930''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sydney's first film for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] (BIP), ''[[A Little Bit of Fluff (1928 film)|A Little Bit of Fluff]]'' (1928), proved to be his final film. In 1929, just as he was to begin work on a second film for the studio, ''Mumming Birds'', he was accused of biting off the nipple of actress Molly Wright in a [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name="sweet" /&gt; BIP settled out of court, conceding the truth of Wright's claims.&lt;ref name="sweet" /&gt; Following the scandal, he left England, leaving a string of unpaid tax demands.&lt;ref name="sweet" /&gt; By 1930 he was declared bankrupt.&lt;ref name="sweet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20031019/ai_n12748776|title=A Life in Full:The Other Chaplin|author=Sweet, Matthew|newspaper=[[The Independent]] | accessdate=31 July 2008}} {{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Gravestone of Sydney Chaplin.jpg|thumb|right|Gravestone of Sydney Chaplin]]

In addition to his importance in launching and promoting brother Charlie's career over the years, perhaps Chaplin's most important contribution to history is in the field of aviation. In May 1919, he, along with pilot Emery Rogers, formulated the first privately owned domestic American airline, the Syd Chaplin Airline Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Lisa K.|title=Syd Chaplin: A Biography|date=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6226-1|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zNhYqnze7rwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=sydney%20chaplin%20Clarens-Montreux%20Cemetery&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Santa Monica, California]]. Even though the corporation lasted only a year, in that time it accumulated many "firsts." Syd and partners had the first ever aeroplane showroom for their Curtiss aeroplanes. Emery Rogers conducted the first roundtrip Los Angeles to San Francisco flight in one 24-hour period. Charlie Chaplin took his first-ever aeroplane flight in one of Syd's planes, as did many other notable personages of the period. Chaplin got out of the aviation business right after legislation began to pass regarding pilot licensing and the taxation of planes and flights.

Chaplin married twice and had no children. His first wife, Minnie, died in France in September 1936 following surgery for breast cancer.&lt;ref name="sweet" /&gt; After [[World War II]], Sydney lived most of his final years in Europe. His second wife, Henriette (called Gypsy) survived him. After a long illness, he died one month after his 80th birthday, on 16 April 1965, in [[Nice]], France. Chaplin is buried beside his wife Gypsy in [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens-Montreux Cemetery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Scott|title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.

== In popular culture ==
Sydney was portrayed both as a teenager by actor Nicholas Gatt and as an adult by actor [[Paul Rhys]] in [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'', depicting his personal and professional relationship with Charlie.

==Production==
IDragons were honored to produce the web series based on all the recommendations they got from other people. Since ''The King of Fighters'' was commonly known for being 2D game, iDragons decided to make it a 3D series. In order to generate appealing fights, the development team bought an arcade game machine. The artists and scriptwriters were ordered to play everyday. Aware that ''The King of Fighters'' was also famous for its characters, iDragons produced sidestories centered around backstories. In regards to the plot, the team decided to incorporate elements from another SNK franchise, ''[[Fatal Fury]]'', alongside ''The King of Fighters'' believing fans were also looking forward to it. The first season closes with a scene where appears with his ''[[The King of Fighters XIV]]'' design on a new adventure. The cliffhanger remains as a secret according to the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jcphotog.wordpress.com/2018/10/03/the-king-of-fighters-destiny-interview-on-idragon-studio/|title=The King Of Fighters Destiny Interview On Idragon Studio|publisher=Jcphotog|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trick roping''' is an entertainment or competitive art involving the spinning of a [[lasso]] also known as a lariat or a "rope."  It is particularly associated with [[Wild West Shows|wild west shows]] or western arts in the United States.

The lasso is a well-known tool of American [[cowboy]]s, who developed rope spinning and throwing skills in using lassos to catch animals. Cowboys developed various tricks to show off their prowess with the lasso and demonstrations of these tricks evolved into entertainment and competitive disciplines.

There is a well-established repertoire of tricks that can be divided into three fundamental categories: "flat loop", "vertical loop" and "butterfly". In addition there are thrown loop tricks and tricks that involve the use of two ropes. Among the vertical loop tricks is the "Texas Skip", which involves the performer spinning the lasso in a wide loop in a vertical plane and jumping through the loop from one side to the other on each rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Well-known trick ropers include:

*[[Texas Jack Omohundro]], the first performer to introduce roping acts to the American stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Logan|first1=Herschel C.|title=Buckskin and Satin: The Life of Texas Jack and His Wife|date=1954||page=73|publisher=Stackpole|location=Harrisburg|url=https://archive.org/details/buckskinandstain007287mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Montie Montana]], who had a 60-year career as a trick roper, also appeared in several [[John Wayne]] movies.

*Actor and humorist [[Will Rogers]], known for his roles as a cowboy, was an expert at trick roping. Rogers' rope tricks were showcased in the 1922 silent film "The Ropin' Fool."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Ropin' Fool|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124857/|date = 1922-10-29|accessdate = 2016-02-23|first = Clarence G.|last = Badger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Vince Bruce, born April 4, 1955, died September 24, 2011: Internationally acclaimed as one of the best western acts in the world, Bruce made his Broadway debut in 1991, in the Tony Award-winning musical ''The Will Rogers Follies — A Life in Revue''. Appearing as the trick-roping star and portraying Rogers in this tribute to the cowboy and vaudeville star, Bruce remained with the show for two and a half years at New York’s Palace Theatre. For his act, he performed a spin with two ropes, a feat first devised 60 years earlier by Will Rogers himself. On July 21, 1991, at the Empire State Building, Vince set a new world record — 4,011 — for “Texas Skips”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vince Bruce - Obituaries|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8818953/Vince-Bruce.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|agency=The Telegraph|date=10 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Florence LaDue|Flores LaDue]] (1883-1951): the only cowgirl to claim three world championships for trick and fancy roping, Flores remained undefeated in the event. Flores and her husband, Guy Weadick, also a Trick Roper, organized and produced the first Calgary Stampede. Flores Ladue is reputed to have been the first trick roper to perform the trick known as the Texas Skip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flores Ladue|url=http://www.cowgirl.net/portfolios/flores-ladue/|website=National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Horse trainer]] [[Buck Brannaman]] began his career in a child trick roping act with his brother.

'''True North Sports and Entertainment Limited''' ('''TNSE''') is a [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]] based company that owns and operates [[Bell MTS Place]] in [[downtown Winnipeg]] and the [[Winnipeg Jets]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The company also owns the Jets' minor league affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]] of the [[American Hockey League]]. Aside from hockey, TNSE is also involved in real estate with [[True North Square]] and are active in bringing high-profile concerts and entertainment acts to Winnipeg.

== History ==

TNSE was founded in 2001 by Manitoba Moose co-owner [[Mark Chipman]] and several local investors. Their goal was to build a new entertainment and sports venue in [[downtown Winnipeg]] to help revive the city's downtown area and possibly one day bring an NHL franchise back to Winnipeg following the departure of the original [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]] franchise to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="cbc2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Winnipeg Jets deal: the investors who made it happen|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/story/2011/05/31/f-jets-investors-bios.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sportsnet3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chipman's plight to return the NHL to Winnipeg|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2011/05/31/chipman_winnipeg/|publisher=[[Rogers Sportsnet]]|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of the Moose was transferred to TNSE in 2003.&lt;ref name="TNSE"&gt;{{cite news|title=MTS Centre: Quick Facts|url=http://mtscentre.ca/arena/index.php|publisher=www.mtscentre.ca|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15,321-seat [[Bell MTS Place]] (formerly the MTS Centre) was completed in fall 2004 and became the new home of the Moose, replacing the [[Winnipeg Arena]]. The arena was built at a cost of $133.5 million on land acquired from [[Osmington Incorporated]], a real estate firm owned by Toronto billionaire [[David Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet|David Thomson]]. In exchange for the land, Osmington took a minority share in TNSE.  Chipman and Thomson, through their respective holding companies, now have complete ownership of TNSE.&lt;ref name="cbc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp21"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thomson not rich because he's stupid|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/hockey/thomson-not-rich-because-hes-stupid-122381563.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=May 21, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wpgsun"&gt;{{cite news|title=New owner Thomson cares about hockey |url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2011/05/31/new-owner-cares-about-hockey|publisher=Winnipeg Sun|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2010, TNSE opened the [[MTS Iceplex]], an arena and training complex located on the western edge of Winnipeg. The Iceplex features four ice surfaces and is used by several amateur teams, local [[minor hockey]], and recreational leagues.&lt;ref name="cbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2010/04/09/mb-mooseplex-mts-iceplex-winnipeg.html|title=Mooseplex renamed MTS Iceplex|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC.ca]]|accessdate=January 5, 2011|date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also serves as the practice facility for the Winnipeg Jets and Manitoba Moose.

TNSE realized its goal of landing an NHL franchise in May 2011, when it purchased the struggling [[Atlanta Thrashers]], subsequently relocating the club to Winnipeg and renaming it the Winnipeg Jets.  As a result, the Moose were relocated to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] for the 2011–12 season and rebranded as the [[St. John's IceCaps]], and became the top minor league affiliate of the Jets.&lt;ref name="cbc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tsn"&gt;{{cite news|title=AHL APPROVES MOVE OF MANITOBA MOOSE TO ST.

The second incarnation of the Manitoba Moose now share the MTS Centre with their NHL parent club and are one of only two AHL teams to have this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/hockey/ahl/True-North-will-move-their-AHL-franchise-back-to-Winnipeg-from-St-Johns-296130451.html?cx_navSource=d-top-story|title=Moose 2.0?

== Bringing the NHL back to Winnipeg ==
[[File:True North Sports &amp; Entertainment (logo).gif|thumb|Original logo of TNS&amp;E, which was used until 2015]]
In January 2007, Chipman was invited to meet with NHL executives, including commissioner [[Gary Bettman]], in [[New York City|New York]] to make a presentation about bringing an NHL team to Winnipeg, either through expansion or relocation.  TNSE wasn't alone—the NHL also met with interested parties from [[Houston]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Seattle]], and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]—but were most impressed by the presentation from the Winnipeg group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peg still on NHL's map|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/peg-still-on-nhls-map-45249137.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=May 17, 2009|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Bettman approached Chipman about the possibility of taking over the struggling [[Phoenix Coyotes]].  The Coyotes were on the verge of declaring [[Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and were purchased by the league out of bankruptcy court later that year.  In October, Chipman made a second presentation to the league about relocating a team to Winnipeg.&lt;ref name="ts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anatomy of an NHL deal|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/01/anatomy-of-an-nhl-deal|publisher=Toronto Sun|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Coyotes ownership issue remained unresolved in May 2010.  As the league was not prepared to cover the team's losses for another season, the league executive reached a tentative agreement to sell the Coyotes to TNSE, allowing them to relocate the franchise back to Winnipeg.  This was intended as a back-up plan, as the league's first choice was to keep the team in Arizona.  With no other investors in place, the league asked the [[Glendale, Arizona|City of Glendale]] to cover the Coyotes losses for the 2010–11 season.  Facing a tight deadline, city council voted in favor of the deal rather than risk losing the primary tenant of their arena.&lt;ref name="ts" /&gt;  According to Chipman, TNSE came "within ten minutes of acquiring (the Coyotes)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winnipeg came within 10 minutes of getting the Coyotes |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/we-missed-it-by-that-much-in-2010-124057719.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a failed bid to sell the team to Matthew Hulziser, the NHL and TNSE resumed their negotiations in spring of 2011.  Glendale city council decided to cover the teams losses for another year, so TNSE shifted their focus on another opportunity—to acquire the Atlanta Thrashers from the [[Atlanta Spirit, LLC|Atlanta Spirit group]]. On the morning of May 31, 2011, the sale was finalized and announced at a press conference held at the MTS Centre.  The sale and relocation of the team to Winnipeg was approved by the NHL Board of Governors on June 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHL board of governors confirms Winnipeg team
|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/NHL-board-of-governors-confirm-Winnipeg-team-124304924.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=June 21, 2011|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Chipman confirmed that the team would be known as the Jets at the 2011 NHL Entry Draft on June 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NUGENT-HOPKINS GOES FIRST, JETS TAKE SCHEIFELE IN NHL DRAFT|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=369895|publisher=TSN.ca|date=June 25, 2011|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jets played their inaugural game on October 9, 2011 in front of a sold-out crowd at the MTS Centre, losing 5–1 against the [[Montreal Canadiens]].

Although the Jets did not qualify for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] in their first season, the team was very successful off the ice.  It was widely believed that the Jets, playing in the league's [[Small market|smallest market]], would require assistance through the NHL's revenue sharing program to be financially viable.  However, the team's revenues in [[2011–12 NHL season|2011–2012]] exceeded expectations to the extent that they did not qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jets will not need NHL's revenue-sharing 
|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Jets-will-not-need-NHLs-revenue-sharing--146445605.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=April 6, 2012|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Forbes]]' 2012 NHL financial report, the Jets generated $105 million [[American dollar|US]] in revenue during their inaugural season, 16th best in the league, and posted [[operating income]] of $13.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHL Team Values 2012|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2012/11/28/nhl-team-values-2012-maple-leafs-first-hockey-team-worth-1-billion/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Forbes' 2013 report, the value of the franchise doubled within two years of TNSE's acquisition in 2011.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jets now worth twice what Chipman, Thomson paid: Forbes
|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/hockey/jets/Jets-now-worth-twice-what-Chipman-Thomson-paid-Forbes-233324601.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interesting quirk, when the lyric "True North strong and free" in [[O Canada]] is sung prior to Jets home games and some games when the Jets are the visiting team, fans commonly yell the "True North" portion. Presumably, this is a nod to the ownership group which brought the NHL back to Winnipeg.

==True North Square==
{{main|True North Square}}
'''True North Square''' is a plaza under construction in downtown Winnipeg. It is a joint venture between TNSE and [[James Richardson &amp; Sons]] and is being constructed at the site of the former Carlton Inn hotel, which True North purchased in June 2015 following months of negotiations with the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truenorthsquare.com/news/tnse-formally-announces-true-north-square/|accessdate=25 February 2016|publisher=TrueNorthSquare.com|title=TNSE Formally Announces True North Square}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/true-north-confirms-it-will-buy-downtown-land-to-build-true-north-square-1.3095679|title=True North confirms it will buy downtown land to build True North Square|publisher=cbc.ca|date=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of the project is a two-acre public park which will include green space and a public stage. Construction of the public portion of the plaza which will be partially funded by the provincial and city governments as will connecting the buildings to the [[Winnipeg Walkway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/true-north-square-announcement-1.3460488|title=True North Square anchors itself on luxury hotel, bank and booze|date=24 February 2016|publisher=CBC.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the plaza will include four mixed-used towers being constructed adjacent to the park, which will house a luxury hotel, office and retail space, and residential units. The towers, estimated at a cost of $400 million, are planned for completion in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/Bold-plans-introduced-for-True-North-Square-369985891.html|title=Bold plans introduced for True North Square|date=24 February 2016|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burton Cummings Theatre==
{{Main|Burton Cummings Theatre}}
The Burton Cummings Theatre for the Performing Arts is a 1,600-seat former vaudeville theatre-turned-music venue in downtown Winnipeg. TNSE assumed management of the venue in 2014 through a lease agreement with the not-for-profit theatre's board of directors. Under this arrangement, TNSE also commenced with badly needed repairs and upgrades to the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher="CBC.ca"|title=True North takes over Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg|date=12 May 2014|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/true-north-takes-over-burton-cummings-theatre-in-winnipeg-1.2640027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, TNSE exercised its option to purchase the building.

== Other venues ==
The MTS Centre Exhibition Hall was an exhibition centre operated by TNSE from 2010 to 2011.  It was located in the now-demolished [[A&amp;B Sound]] building across the street from the MTS Centre and hosted three exhibits during its existence. The first show, the controversial [[Bodies: The Exhibition]], ran from September 2010 to January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=True North unveils new exhibition hall|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Downtown-corner-getting-a-makeover-100451944.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=August 11, 2010|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]: The Artifact Exhibition, produced by [[RMS Titanic Inc]]., ran from February to July 2011.  It featured close to 200 of the over 5,500 collected artifacts from the doomed ocean liner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Titantic stays on at exhibition hall|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Titantic-stays-on-at-exhibition-hall-124074689.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final show, [[Da Vinci the Genius]] ran from August to November 2011.

==Charity==
The True North Youth Foundation, formerly the Manitoba Moose Yearling Foundation, is a non-profit organization created by TNSE.  The foundation raises funds for charitable causes and also runs its own projects: a children's summer camp, a youth hockey school, and ''Project 11'', which promotes mental wellness in schools and youth groups.  ''Project 11'', led by TNSE senior vice-president [[Craig Heisinger]], was created in response to the death of [[Rick Rypien]], a former Moose player who suffered from severe depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/rypien-would-be-loving-it-472060843.html|date=January 31, 2018|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|title=Rypien would have loved mental wellness summit, says Jets assistant GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early competition: early 1990s===
[[File:Royce Gracie 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Royce Gracie]] used [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] in the early years of UFC to defeat opponents of greater size and strength.]]

[[Art Davie]] proposed to [[John Milius]] and [[Rorion Gracie]] an eight-man single-elimination tournament called "War of the Worlds". The tournament was inspired by the Gracies in Action video-series produced by the [[Gracie family]] of Brazil which featured Gracie [[jiu-jitsu]] students defeating martial-arts masters of various disciplines such as [[karate]], [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]], and [[kickboxing]]. The tournament would also feature martial artists from different disciplines facing each other in no-holds-barred combat to determine the best martial art and would aim to replicate the excitement of the matches Davie saw on the videos.&lt;ref name="gentry39"&gt;
Gentry III, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', Milo Books, 2003, paperback edition, {{ISBN|1-903854-30-X}}, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Milius, a noted film director and screenwriter, as well as a Gracie student, agreed to act as the event's creative director. Davie drafted the business plan and twenty-eight investors contributed the initial capital to start WOW Promotions with the intent to develop the tournament into a television franchise.&lt;ref&gt;
Gentry III, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Evolution'', Archon Publishing, 2001, 1st ed., {{ISBN|0-9711479-0-6}}, pages 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, WOW Promotions sought a television partner and approached [[pay-per-view]] producers TVKO ([[HBO]]) and SET ([[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]), as well as [[Campbell McLaren]] and [[David Isaacs (UFC Cofounder)|David Isaacs]] at the Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). Both TVKO and SET declined, but SEG – a pioneer in pay-per-view television which had produced such offbeat events as a gender versus gender tennis match between [[Jimmy Connors]] and [[Martina Navratilova]] – became WOW's partner in May 1993.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
SEG contacted video and film art director Jason Cusson to design the trademarked "Octagon", a signature piece for the event. Cusson remained the Production Designer through ''UFC 27''.&lt;ref name="gentry39" /&gt; SEG devised the name for the show as ''[[UFC 1|The Ultimate Fighting Championship]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
Gentry III, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Evolution'', Archon Publishing, 2001, 1st Edition, {{ISBN|0-9711479-0-6}}, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

WOW Promotions and SEG produced the first event, later called ''[[UFC 1]]'', at [[McNichols Sports Arena]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] on November 12, 1993. Art Davie functioned as the show's booker and matchmaker.&lt;ref&gt;
Newport, John Paul, "Blood Sport", ''Details'', March 1995, pages 70–72.
&lt;/ref&gt; The show proposed to find an answer for sports fans' questions such as: "Can a wrestler beat a boxer?"&lt;ref&gt;
Willoughby, David P., ''The Super Athletes'', A.S. Barnes &amp; Co., Inc., 1970, {{ISBN|0-498-06651-7}}, page 380.
&lt;/ref&gt; As with most martial arts at the time, fighters typically had skills in just one discipline and had little experience against opponents with different skills.&lt;ref&gt;
Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.73
&lt;/ref&gt; The television broadcast featured [[kickboxing|kickboxers]] [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]] and [[Kevin Rosier]], [[savate]] fighter [[Gerard Gordeau]], [[karate]] expert [[Zane Frazier]], [[shootfighting|shootfighter]] [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Rikishi|sumo wrestler]] [[Teila Tuli]], [[boxing|boxer]] [[Art Jimmerson]], and {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking system#Black belt|black belt]] [[Royce Gracie]]—younger brother of UFC co-founder Rorion, whom Rorion handpicked to represent his family in the competition. Royce Gracie's submission skills proved the most effective in the inaugural tournament, earning him the first ever UFC tournament championship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAym2ZTfuuQ |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Submission (combat sports)|submitting]] Jimmerson, Shamrock, and Gordeau in succession. The show proved extremely successful with 86,592 television subscribers on pay-per-view.

It's disputed whether the promoters intended for the event to become a precursor to a series of future events. "That show was only supposed to be a one-off", eventual UFC president [[Dana White]] said. "It did so well on pay-per-view they decided to do another, and another. Never in a million years did these guys think they were creating a sport."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/ufc4.htm |title=How the Ultimate Fighting Championship Works |first=Jonathan |last=Strickland |work=[[HowStuffWorks.com]] |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art Davie]], in his 2014 book ''[[Is This Legal?]]'', an account of the creation of the first UFC event, disputes the perception that the UFC was seen by WOW Promotions and SEG as a one-off, since SEG offered a five-year joint development deal to WOW. He says, "Clearly, both Campbell and Meyrowitz shared my unwavering belief that War of the Worlds&lt;ref group=note&gt;The original working title for UFC&lt;/ref&gt; would be a continuing series of fighting tournaments—a franchise, rather than a one-night stand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Is This Legal?|last = |first = |publisher = Ascend Books|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-9912756-4-9|location = |pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no weight classes, fighters often faced significantly larger or taller opponents. [[Keith Hackney|Keith "The Giant Killer" Hackney]] faced [[Emmanuel Yarbrough]] at ''[[UFC 3]]'' with a {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} height and {{convert|400|lb|kg}} weight disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Many martial artists believed that technique could overcome these size disadvantages, and that a skilled fighter could use an opponent's size and strength against him. With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.

During this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].

In April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.

====Emergence of stricter rules====
[[File:Worsham nearly thrown from cage.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John McCarthy (mixed martial arts)|"Big" John McCarthy]] referees as [[Tank Abbott]] puts [[Cal Worsham]] against the cage at ''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'']]
Although UFC used the tagline "There are no rules" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].

In a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair—as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.

The UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.

''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called "The Superfight". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.

"The Superfight" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The "Superfight" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].

==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===
The violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&amp;ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.  McCain himself led a campaign to ban UFC, calling it "human cockfighting", even sending letters to the governors of all fifty US states asking them to ban the event.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.slate.com/id/46344|work=Slate.com|title=Fight Clubbed|first=David|last=Plotz|date =November 7, 1999|accessdate=March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-six states enacted laws that banned "no-hold-barred" fighting, including New York, which enacted the ban on the eve of ''[[UFC 12]]'', forcing a relocation of the event to [[Dothan, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="gentry106"&gt;Gentry III, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', Milo Books, 2003, Paperback Edition, {{ISBN|1-903854-30-X}}, pages 106, 123&lt;/ref&gt; The UFC continued to air on [[DirecTV]] PPV, though its audience remained minuscule compared to the larger cable pay-per-view platforms of the era.

In response to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and redesigned its rules to remove the less palatable elements of fights while retaining the core elements of [[strike (attack)|striking]] and [[grappling]]. ''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at ''[[UFC 21]]'', the UFC gradually re-branded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle.&lt;ref name=UfcHistory&gt;{{cite news|title=UFC History|date=November 20, 2007|url=http://www.completemartialarts.com/whoswho/ufc/ufchistory.htm|accessdate=January 20, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w5rk8ZW3?url=http://www.completemartialarts.com/whoswho/ufc/ufchistory.htm|archivedate=January 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by UFC commissioner [[Jeff Blatnick]] and referee [[John McCarthy (mixed martial arts)|John McCarthy]], the UFC continued to work with state athletic commissions.&lt;ref name=love-grappling&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/mma/post/_/id/14999/love-of-grappling-defined-jeff-blatnick |title=Love of grappling defined Jeff Blatnick - Mixed Martial Arts Blog - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blatnick, McCarthy, and matchmaker Joe Silva created a manual of policies, procedures, codes of conduct, and rules to help in getting the UFC sanctioned by the athletic commissions, many of which exist to this day.&lt;ref name=love-grappling/&gt; Blatnick and McCarthy traveled around the country, educating regulators and changing perceptions about a sport that was thought to be bloodthirsty and inhumane.&lt;ref name=love-grappling/&gt; By April 2000, their movement had clearly made an impact.&lt;ref name=love-grappling/&gt; California was set to become the first state in the U.S. to sign off on a set of codified rules that governed MMA.&lt;ref name=love-grappling/&gt; Soon after, New Jersey adopted the language.&lt;ref name=love-grappling/&gt;

As the UFC continued to work with the athletic commissions, events took place in smaller U.S. markets, and venues, such as the [[Sudduth Coliseum|Lake Charles Civic Center]]. The markets included states that are largely rural and less known for holding professional sporting events, such as Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Alabama. SEG could not secure home-video releases for ''[[UFC 23]]'' through ''[[UFC 29]]''. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000. Just two months later, the UFC held its first sanctioned event, ''[[UFC 28]]'', under the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]]'s "Unified Rules".&lt;ref&gt;Trembow, Ivan. [http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html New Jersey Commission Corrects Mainstream UFC Stories]. Ivan's Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the UFC's rules started to evolve, so too did its field of competitors. Notable UFC fighters to emerge in this era include Hall of Famers [[Mark Coleman]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Pat Miletich]], [[Chuck Liddell]], [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]], and [[Tito Ortiz]], as well as notables [[Vitor Belfort]], [[Mark Kerr (fighter)|Mark Kerr]], [[Pedro Rizzo]], [[Murilo Bustamante]], [[Frank Shamrock]], [[Mikey Burnett]], [[Jeremy Horn]], [[Pete Williams (fighter)|Pete Williams]], [[Jens Pulver]], [[Evan Tanner]], [[Andrei Arlovski]], and [[Wanderlei Silva]], among others.

===Zuffa era: early 2000s===
After the long battle to secure sanctioning, SEG stood on the brink of bankruptcy, when [[Station Casinos]] executives Frank and [[Lorenzo Fertitta]] and their business partner [[Dana White]] approached them in 2000, with an offer to purchase the UFC. A month later, in January 2001, the Fertittas bought the UFC for $2 million and created [[Zuffa|Zuffa, LLC]] as the parent entity controlling the UFC.

"I had my attorneys tell me that I was crazy because I wasn't buying anything. I was paying $2&amp;nbsp;million and they were saying 'What are you getting?{{' "}} [[Lorenzo Fertitta]] revealed to ''Fighter's Only'' magazine, recalling the lack of assets he acquired in the purchase. "And I said 'What you don't understand is I'm getting the most valuable thing that I could possibly have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what's going to make this thing work. Everybody knows that brand, whether they like it or they don't like it, they react to it.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmanews.com/news/82683|title=Lorenzo Fertitta Talks Buying UFC With Fighter's Only Mag|publisher=Fighter's Only|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ties to the [[Nevada Athletic Commission|Nevada State Athletic Commission]] ([[Lorenzo Fertitta]] was a former member of the NSAC), Zuffa secured sanctioning in Nevada in 2001. Shortly thereafter, the UFC returned to pay-per-view cable television with [[UFC 33]] featuring three championship bouts.

====Struggle for survival and turnaround====
The UFC slowly, but steadily, rose in popularity after the Zuffa purchase, due partly to greater advertising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mma/story/11809856|title=MMA news, fighter profiles and events – Mixed Martial Arts|work=cbssports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; corporate sponsorship, the return to cable pay-per-view and subsequent home video and DVD releases.

With larger live gates at casino venues like the [[Trump Taj Mahal]] and the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]], the UFC secured its first television deal with [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]]. ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' aired the first mixed martial arts match on American cable television in June 2002, as well as the main event showcasing [[Chuck Liddell]] vs. [[Vitor Belfort]] at ''[[UFC 37.5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/2347/chuck-liddell-on-the-best-damn-sports-show-tonight.mma |title=Chuck Liddell on "The Best Damn Sports Show" Tonight |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=May 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w5zHpRp4?url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/2347/chuck-liddell-on-the-best-damn-sports-show-tonight.mma |archivedate=January 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, FSN would air highlight shows from the UFC, featuring one-hour blocks of the UFC's greatest bouts.

[[File:WWE - Manchester 040498 (5).jpg|thumb|150px|UFC Hall of Famer [[Ken Shamrock]] was instrumental in the UFC's turnaround into a mainstream sport.]]
''[[UFC 40]]'' proved to be the most critical event to date in the Zuffa era. The event was a near sellout of 13,022 at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena|MGM Grand Arena]] and sold 150,000 pay per view buys, a rate roughly double that of the previous Zuffa events. The event featured a [[card (sports)|card]] headlined by a highly anticipated championship grudge match between then-current [[UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] [[Tito Ortiz]] and former UFC Superfight Champion [[Ken Shamrock]], who had previously left to [[professional wrestling]] in the [[WWE]] before returning to MMA. It was the first time the UFC hit such a high mark since being forced "underground" in 1997.&lt;ref name="ppvbuys"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-ufcs-pay-per-view.html |title=Mixed Martial Arts--- UFC's Pay-Per-View Buys Explode in 2006 |work=Ivansblog.com |last=Trembow |first=Ivan |date=July 13, 2006 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''UFC 40'' also garnered mainstream attention from massive media outlets such as [[ESPN]] and ''[[USA Today]]'', something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time.&lt;ref name="sports.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle |first=Dave |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dd-ufcforty051209 |title=UFC 40: Signs of life – UFC – Yahoo!

Despite the success of ''[[UFC 40]]'', the UFC was still experiencing financial deficits.

Penn]], [[Sean Sherk]], [[Matt Serra]], [[Ricco Rodriguez]], [[Robbie Lawler]], [[Frank Mir]], [[Karo Parisyan]], and [[Nick Diaz]].

====''The Ultimate Fighter'' and rise in popularity====
Faced with the prospect of folding, the UFC stepped outside the bounds of pay-per-view and made a foray into television. After being featured in a reality television series, ''[[American Casino]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmafacts.com/main.cfm?actionId=globalShowStaticContent&amp;screenKey=cmpNews&amp;show=forbes&amp;s=MMA |title=Mixed Martial Arts |publisher=Mmafacts.com |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w5zMwdZL?url=http://www.mmafacts.com/main.cfm?actionId=globalShowStaticContent&amp;screenKey=cmpNews&amp;show=forbes&amp;s=MMA |archivedate=January 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeing how well the series worked as a promotion vehicle, the Fertitta brothers developed the idea of the UFC having its own reality series.

[[File:The Ultimate Fighter Logo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Logo of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'']]Their idea, ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' (''TUF'') was –a reality television show featuring up-and-coming MMA fighters in competition for a six-figure UFC contract, with fighters eliminated from competition via exhibition mixed martial arts matches. It was pitched to several networks, each one rejecting the idea outright. Not until they approached [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]], with an offer to pay the $10&amp;nbsp;million production costs themselves, did they find an outlet.&lt;ref name="fertittas" /&gt;

In January 2005, [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]] launched ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 1]]'' in the timeslot following ''[[WWE Raw]].'' The show became an instant success, culminating with a notable season finale brawl featuring light heavyweight finalists [[Forrest Griffin]] and [[Stephan Bonnar]] going toe-to-toe for the right to earn the six-figure contract. The live broadcast of the season finale drew a very impressive 1.9 overall rating. Dana White credits ''TUF 1'' for saving the UFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=ki-trigg091009&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Trigg gears up for one more run |work=[[Yahoo!

On the heels of the Griffin/Bonnar finale, a second season of ''The Ultimate Fighter'' launched in August 2005, and two more seasons appeared in 2006. Spike and the UFC continued to create and air new seasons until the show moved to [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modules.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&amp;gid=2369 UFC and Spike TV Announce Continued Partnership]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Following the success of ''The Ultimate Fighter'', Spike also picked up ''[[UFC Unleashed]]'', an hour-long weekly show featuring select fights from previous events. Spike also signed on to broadcast live ''UFC Fight Night'', a series of fight events debuting in August 2005, and ''Countdown'' specials to promote upcoming UFC pay-per-view cards.

After a very successful run on Spike and with the upcoming announcement of the UFC's new relationship with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], Spike officials made a statement regarding the end of their partnership with the UFC, "''The Ultimate Fighter'' season 14 in September will be our last... Our 6-year partnership with the UFC has been incredibly beneficial in building both our brands, and we wish them all the best in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/spike-tv-announces-partnership-with-the-ufc-has-ended-tuf-14-will-be-the-last-on-the-network |title= Spike TV Announces Partnership with the UFC Has Ended, TUF 14 Will Be the Last on the Network |work= MMAWeekly.com |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the announcement of UFC's partnership with Fox in August 2011, ''The Ultimate Fighter'', which entered its 14th season in that September, moved to the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] network to air on Friday nights starting with season 15 in the Spring of 2012. Along with the network change, episodes are now edited and broadcast within a week of recording instead of a several-month delay, and elimination fights are aired live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/the-ultimate-fighter-goes-live-on-fx-starting-on-friday-nights-in-spring-2012 |title= The 'Ultimate Fighter' Goes Live on FX Starting on Friday Nights in Spring 2012 |work= MMAWeekly.com |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surging popularity and growth: mid–2000s===
[[File:UFC 88 - Time Square.JPG|thumb|200px|left|New York City [[Times Square]] ad for ''[[UFC 88|UFC 88: Breakthrough]]'' featuring [[Chuck Liddell]] vs. [[Rashad Evans]]]]
With increased visibility, the UFC's pay-per-view buy numbers exploded. ''[[UFC 52]]'', the first event after the first season of ''The Ultimate Fighter'' featuring eventual-UFC Hall of Famer [[Chuck Liddell|Chuck "The Iceman" Liddell]] avenging his defeat to fellow eventual-Hall of Famer [[Randy Couture]], drew a pay-per-view audience of 300,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dm-ufcfiftytwo052409&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=UFC 52: Chuck strikes back – UFC – Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; doubling its previous benchmark of 150,000 set at ''UFC 40''. Following the second season of ''The Ultimate Fighter'', the UFC's much-hyped match between Liddell and Couture drew an estimated 410,000 pay-per-view buys at ''[[UFC 57]]''.

For the rest of 2006, pay-per-view buy rates continued to skyrocket, with 620,000 buys for ''[[UFC 60|UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie]]''—featuring [[Royce Gracie]]'s first UFC fight in 11 years—and 775,000 buys for ''[[UFC 61]]'' featuring the highly anticipated rematch between [[Ken Shamrock]] and [[Tito Ortiz]], the coaches of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-61-surpasses-30-million-in-ppv-sales-2 |title=UFC 61 Surpasses $30 Million in PPV Sales |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |date=September 6, 2006 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization hit a milestone with ''[[UFC 66]]'', pitting Ortiz in a rematch against Liddell with over 1&amp;nbsp;million buys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/1857/report-ufc-66-falls-short-of-12-million-ppv-buys.mma |title=Report: UFC 66 Falls Short of 1.2 Million PPV ";Buys"; |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=January 30, 2007 |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818234952/http://mmajunkie.com/news/1857/report-ufc-66-falls-short-of-12-million-ppv-buys.mma |archivedate=August 18, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surge in popularity prompted the UFC to beef up its executive team. In March 2006, the UFC announced that it had hired [[Marc Ratner]], former Executive Director of the [[Nevada Athletic Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061216165349/http://www.ultimategrapplingmag.com/content/view/180/37/]&lt;/ref&gt; as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Ratner, once an ally of Senator [[John McCain|McCain's]] campaign against ''no holds barred'' fighting, became a catalyst for the emergence of sanctioned mixed martial arts in the United States. Ratner lobbied numerous athletic commissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/sports/othersports/24fight.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=A Boxing Regulator Changes Corners|first=John|last=Eligon|date=November 24, 2006|accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help raise the UFC's media profile in an attempt to legalize mixed martial arts in jurisdictions inside and outside the United States that had yet to sanction the sport.

In December 2006, Zuffa acquired the northern California-based promotion [[World Extreme Cagefighting|World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC)]] in order to stop the [[International Fight League|International Fight League (IFL)]] from making a deal with Versus (now [[NBCSN|NBC Sports Network]]). At the time, the UFC had an exclusive deal with Spike, so the purchase of the WEC allowed Zuffa to block the IFL from Versus without violating their contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dm-wec060509 |title=Brown-Faber rematch puts WEC at crossroads – UFC – Yahoo!

In December 2006, Zuffa also acquired their cross-town, Las Vegas rival [[World Fighting Alliance|World Fighting Alliance (WFA)]]. In acquiring the WFA, they acquired the contracts of notable fighters including [[Quinton Jackson]], [[Lyoto Machida]], and [[Martin Kampmann]].

The sport's popularity was also noticed by the sports betting community as BodogLife.com, an online gambling site, stated in July 2007 that in 2007 UFC would surpass [[boxing]] for the first time in terms of betting revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.prweb.com/releases/mma/betting/prweb530718.htm|title=UFC set to surpass boxing in betting revenue|first=Justin|last=Goff|work=MMAbettingblog.com|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=March 5, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410032815/http://www.prweb.com/releases/mma/betting/prweb530718.htm|archivedate=April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the UFC had already broken the pay-per-view industry's all-time records for a single year of business, generating over $222,766,000 in revenue in 2006, surpassing both [[WWE]] and boxing.&lt;ref name="biz.yahoo"&gt;

The UFC continued its rapid rise from near obscurity with [[Roger Huerta]] gracing the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and Chuck Liddell on the front of ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

====Pride acquisition and integration====
[[File:Fedor vs Coleman.JPG|thumb|left|A fight between [[Fedor Emelianenko]] and [[Mark Coleman]] in the Japanese, ring-based [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]] organization]]
On March 27, 2007, the UFC and their Japan-based rival the [[Pride Fighting Championships]] announced an agreement in which the majority owners of the UFC, [[Frank Fertitta III|Frank]] and [[Lorenzo Fertitta]], would purchase the Pride brand.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/news/story?id=2814235 |title=Source: UFC buys Pride for less than $70M |date=March 27, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hot List"&gt;''The Hot List'', ''[[ESPNews]]'', air date March 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial intentions were for both organizations to be run separately but aligned together with plans to co-promote cards featuring the champions and top contenders from both organizations. However, after purchasing Pride, Dana White felt that the Pride model was not sustainable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmafrenzy.com/623/dana-white-pride-is-a-mess/ |title=Dana White: "Pride is a Mess" |work=MMAFrenzy.com |date=June 26, 2007 |first=Kris |last=Karkoski |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization would likely fold with many former Pride fighters such as [[Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira|Antônio Rodrigo "Minotauro" Nogueira]], [[Maurício Rua|Maurício "Shogun" Rua]], [[Dan Henderson]], [[Mirko Filipović|Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipović]], [[Wanderlei Silva]], and others already being realigned under the UFC brand.&lt;ref name="fightNetwork"&gt;{{cite web

On June 18, 2008, Lorenzo Fertitta accommodated the UFC's growth by announcing his resignation from [[Station Casinos]] in order to devote his energies to the [[international business development]] of Zuffa, particularly the UFC. The move proved to be pivotal, as Fertitta helped strike TV deals in China, France, Mexico, and Germany as well as open alternative revenue streams with a new UFC video game and UFC action figures, among other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=ki-fertitta072309 |title=UFC full speed ahead with Fertitta on board |last=Iole |first=Kevin |work=[[Yahoo!

Fighters exposed to the UFC audience—or who became prominent—in the post-Pride era include [[Anderson Silva]], [[Jon Fitch]], [[Lyoto Machida]], [[Cain Velasquez]], and [[Jon Jones]], among others.

===UFC 100 and continued popularity: late 2000s – mid-2010s===
Popularity took another major surge in 2009 with ''[[UFC 100]]'' and the 10 events preceding it including ''UFC 90'', ''91'', ''92'', ''94'', and ''98''. ''UFC 100'' was a massive success garnering 1.6&amp;nbsp;million buys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=ki-carwin090209 |title=Carwin's star rises as UFC 106 nears |work=[[Yahoo!

''UFC 100'' was unique in that it drew significant interest from [[ESPN]], which provided extensive coverage of the event in the days preceding and following it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Nick |url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2009/7/24/960850/bloody-elbow-exclusive-major-espn |title=Exclusive: Major ESPN Executive Attends UFC 100 as a Guest of Dana White |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date=July 24, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ESPN would eventually devote additional coverage of the UFC and other MMA news with the television debut of ''[[MMA Live]]'' on ESPN2 in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/blog/cagewriter/post/-MMA-Live-moves-to-ESPN2-on-May-6?urn=mma,230191 |title='MMA Live' moves to ESPN2 on May 6 – Cagewriter – UFC – Yahoo!

However, the momentum gradually began to pick up in the first quarter of 2010 after victories from defending champions Georges St-Pierre and Anderson Silva, as well as Lyoto Machida's first career defeat to "Shogun" Rua for the UFC Light Heavyweight title. These fights segued into a very popular clash between former UFC Champions and rivals [[Rashad Evans]] and [[Quinton Jackson]]—rival coaches on ''[[The Ultimate Fighter: Heavyweights|The Ultimate Fighter 10: Heavyweights]]''—at ''[[UFC 114]]'', featuring the UFC's first main event headlined by black fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/05/25/rampage-jackson-rashad-evans-and-the-politics-of-race-in-mma/ |title='Rampage' Jackson, Rashad Evans and Politics of Race in MMA |work=MMAFighting.com |date=May 25, 2010 |last=Fowlkes |first=Ben |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event scored over 1&amp;nbsp;million pay per view buys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watchkalibrun.com/2010/6/24/1535463/meltzer-ufc-114-surpasses-1 |title=Meltzer: UFC 114 Surpasses 1 Million PPV Buys |last=Becker |first=Nick |date=June 24, 2010 |work=WatchKalibRun.com |accessdate=July 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w5zcvt3j?url=http://www.watchkalibrun.com/2010/6/24/1535463/meltzer-ufc-114-surpasses-1 |archivedate=January 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as Evans secured a unanimous decision victory.

[[File:UFC 129.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[UFC 129]]'' shattered previous North American gate and attendance records.]]

On November 5, 2016 the UFC had their first exhibition in New York City after years of being delayed by government officials and red tape with a dramatic first match, [[Conor McGregor]] vs. [[Eddie Alvarez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGrath|first1=Stephen|title=Conor McGregor Proves Class Disparity, And Deserves UFC Equity {{!}} The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/stephen-mcgrath/conor-mcgregor-the-proves_b_12958938.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====WEC merger====
[[File:Anthony Pettis WEC 53.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anthony Pettis|Pettis]] weighs in for the last WEC event]]
Zuffa, the parent company of the UFC, purchased [[World Extreme Cagefighting]] in late 2006 and held the first WEC event under new ownership on January 20, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/wec-fighter-salary-breakdown-2 |title=WEC Fighter Salary Breakdown |date=January 22, 2007 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter the WEC made its home on [[NBCSN|the Versus Network]] with its first event debuting on that network in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/wec-to-make-live-cable-tv-debut-on-june-3-2 |title=WEC to Make Live Cable TV Debut on JUNE 3 |date=April 4, 2007 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2010, Zuffa announced that WEC would merge with the UFC. The WEC held its final card on December 16, 2010. As a result of the merger, the UFC absorbed WEC's bantamweight, featherweight and lightweight weight divisions and their respective fighters. The UFC also made the last WEC Featherweight and Bantamweight Champions, [[José Aldo]] and [[Dominick Cruz]] respectively, the inaugural UFC Champions of their new weight divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Hawryluk, Matt. (October 28, 2010) [http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/10/28/1779797/dana-white-to-announce-ufc-merger-with-the-wec Dana White To Announce UFC Merger With the WEC]. Bloody Elbow. Retrieved on May 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed Harris, who started World Extreme Cagefighting with Scott Adams, had mixed emotions on the merger.  "It's kind of like when your kid goes off to college: at first you're not happy, but after you think about it for a while, you're really happy," Harris told MMAWeekly.com in an exclusive interview immediately following the announcement. "At the end of the day, I never imagined this thing would be where we're at today. I'm extremely proud and happy that I was involved with something that will now be part of what may be, some day, the largest sports organization in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-wec-merger-reed-harris-proud-to-see-his-baby-grow-up-mma |title=UFC-WEC Merger: Reed Harris Proud to See His Baby Grow Up |date=October 28, 2010 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strikeforce purchase====
[[File:Strikeforce cage 2011-01-07.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] cage]]
On March 12, 2011, [[Dana White]] revealed that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/03/12/zuffa-purchases-strikeforce/|title=Zuffa purchases Strikeforce|publisher=mmafighting.com|date=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; White went on to explain that Strikeforce will operate as an independent promotion, and that Scott Coker will continue to run the promotion. Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker announced the return of Fedor Emelianenko on an unspecified July or August event and said that Zuffa-owned company would continue to co-promote with M-1 Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/03/24/strikeforce-targeting-summer-return-for-fedor-fight-with-dan-he/|title=Strikeforce targeting summer return for Fedor, fight with Henderson unlikely|publisher=mmafighting.com|date=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the purchase, the UFC signed many of Strikeforce's top stars and champions, such as [[Jason Miller (fighter)|Jason Miller]], [[Nick Diaz]], [[Dan Henderson]], [[Alistair Overeem]], and [[Cung Le]]. Under Zuffa's ownership, Strikeforce made minor changes, including adopting the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts in full, closing the promotion's men's weight classes below lightweight, and ceasing promotion of amateur undercard bouts. After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended.

The final Strikeforce show was [[Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine]] on January 12, 2013, after which the promotion was dissolved and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.

On August 18, 2011, The Ultimate Fighting Championship and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced a seven-year broadcast deal through the [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] subsidiary, effectively ending the UFC's [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]] and Versus (now [[NBC Sports Network]]) partnership.  The deal includes four events on the main Fox network, 32 live Friday night fights per year on their cable network [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], 24 events following ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' reality show and six separate Fight Night events.

The promotion's first broadcast television event – [[UFC on Fox: Velasquez vs. dos Santos]] – broke form by showcasing only one fight to television viewers.  In the main event, [[Junior dos Santos]] abruptly dethroned then-undefeated UFC heavyweight champion [[Cain Velasquez]] by knock-out at 1:04 in the first round.  The telecast peaked with 8.8 million viewers tuning into the fight with an average audience of 5.7 million, making it by far the most watched MMA event of all-time and the most watched combat sports event since 2003's HBO bout between [[Lennox Lewis]] and [[Vitali Klitschko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/11/13/ufc-on-fox-debut-scores-big-most-watched-ufc-event-ever/110476/ |title=UFC on Fox Debut Scores Big – Most-Watched UFC Event Ever - Ratings &amp;#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date=November 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the other programming opportunities that emerged was a weekly UFC magazine-style show.  When asked about the potential for a weekly magazine-style series, UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta responded, "Not only weekly, but, potentially, multiple times per week you'll have a UFC magazine (show)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-ceo-lorenzo-fertitta-says-ufc-magazine-style-show-already-in-discussions |title=UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta Says UFC Magazine-Style Show Already in Discussions|date=August 18, 2011 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFC maintained production control of its product, including the use of its broadcast team of [[Mike Goldberg]] and [[Joe Rogan]]. Fox Sports produced the pre- and post-shows.

[[UFC on Fox 31]] is will be held on December 15, 2018 at [[Fiserv Forum]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/2018/07/07/new-arena-new-arena-host-ufc-dec-15-host-ufc-dec-15/764182002/|title=UFC is coming back to Milwaukee, this time to new arena|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this event will also mark the end of the UFC and seven years deal with Fox Sports after UFC signed a new broadcast  5 years deal with  [[ESPN]] is slated to begin in January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/23581729/espn-ufc-reach-five-year-television-rights-deal|title=UFC, ESPN agree to 5-year, $1.5B rights deal|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She would successfully defend her title six times over a grand total of 1,074 days, before she was defeated by [[Holly Holm]] on November 15, 2015, at [[UFC 193]].

On December 11, 2013, the UFC purchased the contracts of 11 female fighters from [[Invicta Fighting Championships]] to launch their 115-pound [[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]] division.

====International expansion====
The first UFC event to be held outside the [[United States]] was [[UFC 8]] in Puerto Rico, a US territory, in 1996. Subsequently, the UFC has visited 15 countries in [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Oceania]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].

[[Canada]] has hosted events 18 times, starting with [[UFC 83]] in 2008 and most recently in 2015 with [[UFC 186]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/03/tom-wright-ufc-186-plus-two-more-events-on-tap-for-canada-in-2015|title=Tom Wright: UFC 186, plus two more events, on tap for Canada in 2015|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Mike Bohn|date=March 6, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; UFC's biggest event to date was also in Canada, as [[UFC 129]] held at [[Rogers Centre]] featured a record-breaking attendance of 55,724.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/23448/ufc-129-sets-attendance-and-live-gate-records-55724-for-12-1-million.mma|title=UFC 129 sets attendance and live-gate records: 55,724 for $12.1 million|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Ultimate Fighter]] has had international editions as well: Brazil (since 2012), Australia (vs. United Kingdom - 2012), China (2013), Canada (vs. Australia - 2014), and Latin America (2014).

====TRT ban====
On February 27, 2014, the Nevada State Athletic Commission banned the use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT).  The UFC followed suit and banned the use of TRT for any of their events, including international markets where the UFC oversees regulatory efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-issues-statement-nevada-trt-decision/|title=UFC Issues Statement on Nevada TRT Decision|publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 27, 2014|accessdate= February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lawsuit ====
{{main|Zuffa#Class action lawsuits}}

In December 2014, an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust lawsuit]] was filed against Zuffa by several fighters, claiming the organization restricts fighters' control over their careers and earning potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/12037883/antitrust-lawsuit-filed-ufc-parent-company-claims-monopoly|title = Fighters claim UFC restricts earnings|date = December 16, 2014|accessdate = January 5, 2015|website = espn.com|publisher = |last = Barr|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2015, debate over venues and possible case dismissals ensued. Ultimately, the case moved to Nevada federal courts, where Zuffa was denied its motion to stay [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] for 15 years of its financial records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/5/14/8604095/ufc-fighter-monopoloy-lawsuit-zuffa-files-motion-to-stay-discovery-of-15-years/in/7162628|title=Zuffa files motion to stay discovery of '15 years of Zuffa's financial statements'|author=John S.

Nash|date=July 29, 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has caused an ongoing debate and struggle over how UFC sensitive information should be handled, and who may view it. Especially concerning MMAFA founder, Rob Maysey who has taken the lead in representing the former athletes and has stated he hopes to achieve reforms similar to the [[Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act|Ali Act]] (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3CiNZN7rd4|title=Wanderlei Silva &amp; MMAFA push for Muhammad Ali Act in MMA|date=August 3, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, a 12–16 month investigation began that is expected to last until sometime between September 2016 to January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/10/1/9430995/ufc-loses-two-motions-discovery-antitrust-lawsuit-mma-news/in/7162628|title=UFC loses two motions in antitrust lawsuit, full discovery to begin|author=Paul Gift|date=October 1, 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, both sides have provided well over 100,000 documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/11/17/9748132/ufc-lawsuit-update-plaintiffs-argue-discovery-108000-documents-produced-mma-news/in/7162628|title=UFC lawsuit: Promotion, fighters argue over discovery, 108,000 documents produced|author=Paul Gift|date=November 17, 2015|work=Bloody Elbow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Introduction of USADA====
On July 1, 2015, the UFC Anti-Doping Program was put into place, ran by the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] known as "USADA" to protect the rights of all clean athletes in the UFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufc.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/UFC-anti-doping-policy-EN.pdf|title=USADA|last=|first=|date=|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|publisher=U.S. Anti-Doping Agency|access-date=May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endeavor era===
In May 2016, ESPN originally reported that the UFC's parent company Zuffa, LLC was in talks to sell the company for $3.5 billion to $4 billion. (In 2015, the UFC had a reported [[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization|EBITDA]] of $200–250 million.) Because it was a privately owned company, no official comment was made from the UFC or Dana White regarding the sale. Companies initially interested in the sale were [[Wanda Group|Dalian Wanda Group]], [[China Media Capital]], and [[William Morris Endeavor|WME–IMG]] (Endeavor).&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|title=Sources: The UFC owners in advanced talks to sell business|url=http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/15503004/ufc-owners-advanced-talks-sell-promotion|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2016, it was officially announced that the UFC would be sold to a group led by WME–IMG, its owner [[Silver Lake Partners]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], and [[MSD Capital]], for $4.025 billion. At the time, it marked the largest-ever acquisition in sports. Lorenzo Fertitta stated that the new ownership, "with whom we've built a strong relationship over the last several years, is committed to accelerating UFC's global growth", and that they "share the same vision and passion for this organization and its athletes." Flash Entertainment (owned by the government of [[Abu Dhabi]]) will retain its 10% minority stake in the company.  White, who owned 9% of the UFC, stayed, having been given a stake in the new business.&lt;ref name="nyt-ufcsold"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.F.C.

As a result of the sale, Fertitta stepped down as chairman and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UFC sold to WME–IMG for $4 billion; Dana White will still run day-to-day operations|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2016/07/11/ufc-sale-wwe-img-dana-white/86937834/|website=USAToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; WME-IMG was renamed Endeavor in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7990536/wme-img-name-change-endeavor|title=WME {{!}} IMG Is Now Endeavor|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"/&gt;

In October 2016, ''[[MMAjunkie.com|MMAJunkie]]'' obtained an UFC financial report released by Endeavor, detailing that the promotion had reached a year-to-year high of $609 million in revenue during 2015. 76% of the total was credited to "content" revenue, covering media rights, PPV buys and UFC Fight Pass subscriptions; in turn, 42% of content revenue was credited to pay-per-view buys, followed by U.S. and international media rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ESPN partnership ====
In May 2018, UFC reached new U.S. media rights deals with [[Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]] and [[ESPN Inc.]], succeeding those with [[21st Century Fox]], which begin in January 2019. The five-year contracts are cumulatively valued at $300 million per-year for digital and linear rights, roughly doubling the amount paid by Fox in the final year of its previous contract, and include 42 events on ESPN platforms per-year. [[ESPN]] linear networks will televise preliminary cards for UFC PPV events, and 10 ''UFC on ESPN Fight Night'' events per-year. The subscription streaming service [[ESPN+]] will broadcast 20 exclusive events per-year under the branding ''UFC on ESPN+ Fight Night''; regardless of network, all ''Fight Night'' events will feature a full, 12-fight card, and their preliminaries will air exclusively on ESPN+. The ESPN+ service will also hold on-demand rights to UFC library and archive content, new seasons of ''[[Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series|Dana White's Contender Series]]'', and other new original content. UFC Fight Pass will be purchasable as an add-on for ESPN+ to stream pay-per-view events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/ufc-moving-to-espn-from-fox-deal-valued-billion|title=UFC Moving to ESPN From Fox in Deal Valued at $1.5B|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/5/23/17386740/what-we-know-about-ufc-broadcast-deal-espn-mma-news|title=What we know about the UFC’s $1.5 billion broadcast deal with ESPN|work=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/espn-enters-the-octagon-with-ufc-streaming-deal-1202384835/|title=ESPN Enters The Octagon With UFC Streaming Deal|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=2018-05-08|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2018/05/23/espn-ufc-television-rights-deal/635801002/|title=Report: ESPN wrestles UFC television-rights deal away from Fox Sports|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/5/23/17383356/report-espn-ufc-tv-rights-deal-300-million-mma-news|title=Report: ESPN lands UFC television rights deal, reportedly worth $150 million per year|work=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== M-1 Global partnership ====
On July 18, 2018, it was announced that UFC has entered into a partnership with Russian MMA promoter [[M-1 Global]]. M-1 Global will serve as a farm league to scout Russian fighters for UFC and will participate in organizing UFC events in Russia. The deal also gives M-1 champions the opportunity to sign with UFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/M1-Challenge-Announces-Partnership-with-UFC-to-Focus-on-Russian-MMA-Talent-139655|title=M-1 Challenge Announces Partnership with UFC to Focus on Russian MMA Talent|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/sport/433596-ufc-russia-m1-contract/|title=UFC signs with oldest Russian MMA promotion for 'UFC RUSSIA' development program|work=RT International|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/m-1/russian-mma-promotion-m-1-announces-deal-ufc/|title=Russian MMA promotion M-1 announces deal with the UFC {{!}} BJPenn.com|date=2018-07-18|work={{!}} BJPenn.com|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 15, 2018, the first UFC event in Russia was held at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow.

== UFC Anti-Doping Program ==
UFC Anti-Doping Program was launched in June 2015, 
On June 3, 2015, UFC announced join partnership with United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on anti-doping program &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/ufc-confirms-partnership-with-usada-details-of-out-of-competition-testing-program|title=UFC confirms partnership with USADA, details of out-of-competition testing program|date=2015-06-03|work=MMAjunkie|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2018, it was reported that UFC and USADA  grant the UFC's fighters time to go through adjudication process before an announcement is made with the results of the potential doping violation after several cases of fighters such as [[Anderson Silva]],[[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]] were flagged for potential doping violations but clear from punishment after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplement).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The set of "[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.

===Rounds===
UFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's "main event" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship "main event" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth "sudden victory" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.

==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===
[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|350px|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]
The UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named "The Octagon". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name "The Octagon".&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

The UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl. The standard octagon has a diameter of {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} high fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/octagon|title=The Octagon™ - Get Inside|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cage sits atop a platform, raising it {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the eight sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.bostonherald.com/ufc/view.bg?articleid=150552 UFC 62: Streaming en Espanol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115000341/http://sports.bostonherald.com/ufc/view.bg?articleid=150552 |date=November 15, 2006 }}. ''The Boston Herald''. July 30, 2006. Retrieved August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The mat, painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event.

For smaller venues and events, the UFC often uses a smaller cage, which is only {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2207778-the-pros-and-cons-of-fighting-in-a-smaller-ufc-octagon|title=The Pros and Cons of Fighting in a Smaller UFC Octagon|author=Kristian Ibarra|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightnomics.com/category/blog/hard-numbers-small-ufc-cage-part-1/|title=The Hard Numbers on the Small UFC Cage (Part 1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attire===
All competitors fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Tops are only approved for female competitors. Required safety equipment include padded gloves, [[Mouthguard#Sports|mouthguard]], and [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]s held in place with a [[jockstrap]] for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#8|title=Rules and Regulations - Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|work=ufc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open-fingered gloves have at least 1" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;/ 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ounces) that allow fingers to grab. To ensure compliance, fighters are checked by a State Athletic Committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring.&lt;ref name="njacb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |title=Mixed Martial arts Unified Rules of Conduct |publisher=[[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] |date=September 5, 2002 |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |archivedate=April 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the attire for UFC was very open. Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary "getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.

====Reebok Uniform====
On December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the "vast majority of the revenue" from the deal – taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program – will be paid directly to UFC fighters.&lt;ref name="ReebokUniform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official UFC rankings, with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.&lt;ref name="ReebokUniform" /&gt; The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.&lt;ref name="ReebokUniform" /&gt; In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing – not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances – and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots – similar to those seen with European soccer clubs – that the UFC may eventually sell to "a major, global brand" down the road.&lt;ref name="ReebokUniform" /&gt;

===Match outcome===
Matches may end via:
*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.
*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.
*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)
**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)
**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)
*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)
**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)
*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.
*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.
*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.

In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.

===Judging criteria===
The [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10–10 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10–8 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10–7 rounds are very rare.

When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match conduct===
*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.
*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.
*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.
*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / "trash-talking" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.

===Evolution of the rules===
*''[[UFC 1]]'' – Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.
*''[[UFC 2]]'' – Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).
*''[[UFC 3]]'' – The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.
*''[[UFC 4]]'' – After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.
*''[[UFC 5]]'' – The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.
*''[[UFC 6]]'' – The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.
*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' – This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.
*''[[UFC 8]]'' – Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.
*''[[UFC 9]]'' – To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|"Big John" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to "open the hand" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.
*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' – This event was the first to introduce the "no grabbing of the fence" rule.
*''[[UFC 12]]'' – The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&amp;nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&amp;nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as "Superfights").
*''[[UFC 14]]'' – The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&amp;nbsp;g (4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.
*''[[UFC 15]]'' – Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.
*''[[UFC 21]]'' – Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The "ten-point must system" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).
* ''[[UFC 28]]'' – The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.
* ''[[UFC 31]]'' – Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as [[Lightweight (MMA)|lightweight]]. Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in The Octagon between rounds.
*''[[UFC 43]]'' – In the event of a stoppage fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.
* ''[[UFC 94]]'' – After an incident where [[Georges St-Pierre]] was accused of putting [[vaseline]] on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into The Octagon. [[Petroleum jelly]] may now only be applied by UFC employed [[cutman|cutmen]].
* ''[[UFC 97]]'' – Foot-stomps are banned. (For this event only)
* ''[[UFC 133]]'' – Speedo style trunks are banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/post/2011/08/ebersole-nabs-bonus-for-beating-speedo-wearing-hallman/414124/1 |title=Ebersole nabs bonus for beating speedo-wearing Hallman |date=August 7, 2011 |last=Non |first=Sergio |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Ultimate Fighter''===
Fights that occur on ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' are classified as exhibition matches under NSAC sanctioning, and thus do not count toward the professional record of a fighter. Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.

For two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round ("[[sudden victory]]") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.

These exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.

Non-title fights have a one-pound leniency. In title fights, the participants must weight no more than that permitted for the relevant weight division. The Commission may also approve catch weight bouts, subject to their review and discretion.  For example, the Commission may still decide to allow the contest the maximum weight allowed is 177 pounds if it feels that the contest would still be fair, safe, and competitive.&lt;ref name="ufc.com"/&gt; In addition, there are five weight classes specified in the Unified Rules which the UFC does not currently use: Super Lightweight (165 pounds), Super Welterweight (175 pounds), Super Middleweight (195 pounds), Cruiserweight (225 pounds), and Super Heavyweight (&gt;265 pounds).

===Fighter salaries and contracts===
UFC fighters are paid per fight, with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash bonuses are also awarded for "Fight of the Night" and "Performance of the Night" (formerly awarded separately as "Knockout of the Night").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of these bonuses can sometimes be $80,000 USD (but are normally $50,000 USD). For less well-known fighters, they can be several times larger than the contracted amount for the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UFC Post-Fight Bonuses Now Set at $15,000 for Every Event|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ufc-post-fight-bonuses-now-030421521--mma.html|publisher=MMA Weekly|accessdate=April 13, 2013|date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contracted amounts generally have to be declared to the state athletic commission; however, the UFC also pays undisclosed locker-room bonuses to fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/15498/ufc-100-fighters-salaries-brock-lesnar-and-georges-st-pierre-top-earners-from-x-x-million-payroll.mma |title=UFC 100 fighters salaries: Lesnar and St. Pierre get top paydays in $1.8 million payroll |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |accessdate=July 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715131951/http://mmajunkie.com/news/15498/ufc-100-fighters-salaries-brock-lesnar-and-georges-st-pierre-top-earners-from-x-x-million-payroll.mma |archivedate=July 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, UFC fighters' contracts and merchandising rights have been the subject of dispute between fighters (represented by growing the Mixed Martial Arts Fighters Association) and UFC, which has attempted to defend existing regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/103397/ufc-mma-labor-unions-carrano-white-gsp-bill-culinary |title=No Holds Barred: Labor turmoil in the world of mixed martial arts. |accessdate=May 30, 2012 |date=May 30, 2012 |first=Jesse |last=Zwick |work=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement gives THQ exclusive rights to current and next-generation consoles as well as to PC and handheld titles. Also included are "certain wireless rights" which were not detailed. The licensing agreement was set to expire in 2011, although it appeared to have been extended to 2017. On June 6, 2012, during the E3 Exhibition, THQ had announced that they will be giving the license of UFC Undisputed to EA.

===Action figures===

====Round 5====
The first UFC action figure collectibles were released by Round 5 Corporation in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.round5mma.com/index.php Round 5 – The Official UFC Collectible]. Round5mma.com. Retrieved on May 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Series one of their figures includes [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton "Rampage" Jackson]], [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]], [[Tito Ortiz]], and [[Randy Couture]]. Series two (released on November 10, 2008) includes [[Wanderlei Silva]], [[Sean Sherk]], [[Rich Franklin]], and [[Anderson Silva]].

In July 2009, Round 5 acquired the UFC license through Jakks Pacific and subsequently released 5 more series under the UFC and Pride brands. 2 packs were released in August 2010 and includes a UFC Octagon cage and Pride ring display stand. Limited edition versions include fabric walk out tees or paint variations and are limited in number with foil and holographic packaging variances. Special edition and exclusive versions have been released at various UFC Fan Expo events.

====Jakks Pacific====
On June 10, 2008, it was announced that UFC had signed an exclusive four-year contract with [[Jakks Pacific]] to create action figures for UFC. {{As of|2009}} the schedule envisages the release of these figures in November 2009. They have currently been 8 series released and they feature special Legends, Pride, and WEC style figures as well. Three 2 packs series have also been released, as well as several expo and internet exclusives. There are also several different octagon cage playsets that have been released, including the "Octagon Playset", "Official Scale Octagon Playset", and "Electronic Reaction Octagon Playset". A Pridestyle ring playset was also originally planned; however, no news have been given on its status or release date since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringsidecollectibles.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=R&amp;Product_Code=UFCR-002&amp;Category_Code=UFCR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425062717/http://www.ringsidecollectibles.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=R&amp;Product_Code=UFCR-002&amp;Category_Code=UFCR|date=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Jakks UFC Octagon Official Scale Playset MMAFigs.com|url =http://www.mmafigs.com/index.php/mma_ufc_figure_newsline/3064-UFC-Octagon-Prototype-Preview-Videos.html|accessdate = June 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringsidecollectibles.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=R&amp;Product_Code=UFCR-004&amp;Category_Code=UFCR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123151435/http://www.ringsidecollectibles.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=R&amp;Product_Code=UFCR-004&amp;Category_Code=UFCR|date=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Untitled (Rape Scene)''''' is a [[color photograph]] documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9525/|title=Human Nature|date= July 26, 2004|publisher=''New York'' magazine|last=Stevens|first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; created from a 35mm slide by [[Cuban American]] artist [[Ana Mendieta]]. She made it during an April 1973 [[Performance art|performance]] while still a student at the [[University of Iowa]]. It is one of three photographs she created in reaction to the rape and murder of a woman on campus.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2004/09/art/ana-mendieta-earth-body-sculpture-and-pe|title=Ana Mendieta: Earth Body, Sculpture and Performance|work=The Brooklyn Rail|last=Heuer|first=Megan|date=September 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate Gallery]] in London, which owns the work, describes it this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mendieta invited her fellow students to her apartment where, through a door left purposefully ajar, they found her in the position recorded in this photograph, which recreated the scene as reported in the press. Some time later, Mendieta recalled that her audience "all sat down, and started talking about it. I didn’t move. I stayed in position about an hour. It really jolted them."&lt;ref&gt;''Ana Mendieta,'' p.127, note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, she commented that the rape had "moved and frightened" her, elaborating: "I think all my work has been like that&amp;nbsp;– a personal response to a situation ... I can’t see being theoretical about an issue like that."&lt;ref&gt;''Ana Mendieta,'' p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion she explained that she had created this work "as a reaction against the idea of violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;Viso 2004, p.256, note 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mendieta-untitled-rape-scene-t13355/text-summary|title= Untitled (Rape Scene)|publisher=Tate Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Art writer Megan Heuer describes the work as capturing the artist's interest in violence.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; Influenced by the work of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], ''Untitled (Rape Scene)'' also expresses Mendieta's desire to evoke a visceral reaction from her audience.&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5982">[[Brazil]] is the 13th largest video game market in the world as of 2017, and the largest in Latin America, with a revenue of 1,3 billion US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/infographics/the-brazilian-gamer-2017/|title=The Brazilian Gamer {{!}} 2017 {{!}} Newzoo|work=Newzoo|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games were not permitted for import into Brazil until the 1990s, and were then heavily taxed as non-essential goods. As a result, a [[black market]] developed around [[Copyright infringement|pirating games]], driven by the lack of official channels for purchasing games. Many game companies avoided expansion into the country for these reasons until the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techinbrazil.com/the-market-for-video-games-in-brazil|title=The Market for Video Games in Brazil|first=Marcelo|last=Teixeira|date=2 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blaming high tariffs, Nintendo officially left the market in 2015, but returned in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/10/7524759/nintendo-brazil-wii-u-3ds-tariffs-taxes|title=Nintendo ends console and game distribution in Brazil, citing high taxes|first=Owen S.|last=Good|date=10 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega once retained a strong foothold in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/brazil-is-a-video-game-alternate-universe-where-sega-beat-nintendo|title=Brazil Is An Alternate Video Game Universe Where Sega Beat Nintendo|date=27 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a three-episode series named ''Red Bull Parallels'', Red Bull explored the country's relation with gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/games/stories/1331829250246/the-history-of-video-games-in-brazil|title=Watch our video history of gaming in Brazil|first=Jon|last=Partridge|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
Since January 2008, the marketing of ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' is prohibited in the Brazilian territory{{which|date=December 2017}} by judicial decision. The judge argues that Counter-Strike and ''[[EverQuest]]'' games subvert social order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/informatica/ult124u364924.shtml Folha Online - Informática - Justiça proíbe Counter Strike em todo Brasil; Procon tenta recolher jogos - 18/01/2008]. .folha.uol.com.br. Retrieved on 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has since been lifted, although EverQuest is still illegal in physical form in [[Minas Gerais]].

==Video game development==
Video game development exists in Brazil since as early as 1983, when [[Renato Degiovani]] developed the first computer games in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] called "''Aventuras na Selva''" (later renamed ''Amazônia'') and "''Aeroporto 83''" (Airport 83) for a computer specialized magazine called "Micro Sistemas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/noticia/2014/04/conheca-renato-degiovani-o-pioneiro-na-industria-de-games-no-brasil.html|title=Conheça Renato Degiovani: o pioneiro na indústria de games no Brasil|work=TechTudo|access-date=2017-07-17|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gizmodo.uol.com.br/primeiro-desenvolvedor-brasileiro/|title=Entrevista: Renato Degiovani, o primeiro desenvolvedor brasileiro de jogos - Gizmodo Brasil|website=gizmodo.uol.com.br|language=pt|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years have passed with little to no significant development until the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], when several companies started creating [[Advertising in video games|advergames]] and/or [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]], and universities started offering game development degrees. [[Hoplon Infotainment|Hoplon]] was one of the first to be successful in the industry with [[Taikodom]].

The 2010s have been marked by a growing number of studios getting bigger relevance with proprietary [[indie game]] titles. The [[BIG Festival]] (Brazilian Independent Games Festival) was conceived in 2012 and is held every year in [[São Paulo]], gathering game industry professionals from the country and abroad and promoting indie titles for the Brazilian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigfestival.com.br|title=BIG Festival 2017 {{!}} Brazil's Independent Games Festival|website=bigfestival.com.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest game dev scenes are from [[São Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Brasília]].

====''Westworld'' (1973)====
{{Main article|Westworld (film)}}
''Westworld'' was the first theatrical feature novelist [[Michael Crichton]] directed, after one TV movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12461&amp;mainArticleId=245816 |title=Westworld |publisher=Tcm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first feature film to use [[#Digital image processing|digital image processing]] to [[pixellate]] photography in order to simulate an android's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html A Brief, Early History of Computer Graphics in Film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717074134/http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html |date=2012-07-17 }}, [[Larry Yaeger]], 16 Aug 2002 (last update), retrieved 24 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] and [[Saturn Awards|Saturn]] awards. The film was well-received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rottentomatoes.com/m/westworld/ |title=Westworld (1973) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is about amusement park robots that malfunction and begin killing visitors. It stars [[Yul Brynner]] as an android in a futuristic Western-themed amusement park, and [[Richard Benjamin]] and [[James Brolin]] as guests of the park.

====''Futureworld'' (1976)====
{{Main article|Futureworld}}
''Futureworld'' is the [[sequel]] to the Michael Crichton film. The sequel stars [[Peter Fonda]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]], [[Stuart Margolin]], [[John P. Ryan (actor)|John Ryan]], and [[Yul Brynner]], who makes a [[cameo appearance]] in a [[dream sequence]]. Other than Brynner, none of the cast members from the original film appear, and original writer-director Crichton was not involved.&lt;ref name="futureworld"&gt;Variety Staff. December 31, 1975. [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791173.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 "Futureworld"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is set two years after the Westworld tragedy, with the Delos corporation having reopened the park. The story starts when [[newspaper reporter]] Chuck Browning ([[Peter Fonda]]) and [[Broadcast journalism|TV reporter]] Tracy Ballard ([[Blythe Danner]]) are invited to review the park.&lt;ref name="futureworld"/&gt;

[[Image:Xuxa2006.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Xuxa in 2006]]
The '''Xuxa Park fire''' refers to a [[flash fire]] that erupted on a [[Brazil]]ian TV [[soundstage]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] during a 2001 taping of the children's television show ''[[Xuxa Park (Brazilian TV series)|Xuxa Park]]''. The incident is noteworthy for having been captured on [[videotape]], for the press coverage that followed, and for accusations about the fire made by some detractors of the show's host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terra.com.br/istoegente/77/reportagem/rep_os_minutos_xuxa.htm Os minutos mais decisivos da vida de Xuxa]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Fire ==
[[Image:xuxafire.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A still frame from video of the fire less than 10 seconds after it started]]
[[Image:xuxafire2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mere seconds later, the set is engulfed in flames, and smoke darkens the soundstage]]
On January 11, 2001, a taping of ''Xuxa Park'' was in progress on a soundstage of the Brazilian network [[Rede Globo]] with a live [[audience]] of about 300 people (most of whom were children) in attendance. As Xuxa and her dancers were performing a show-closing musical number, a small fire started in the set's mechanical "spaceship" (through which Xuxa would normally have exited the stage in another 2 minutes). For a few seconds, they continued their musical number, unaware of what was happening behind them. An alert [[stagehand]] quickly appeared with a small [[fire extinguisher]] and attempted to extinguish the flames, but suddenly the fire erupted violently, engulfing the "spaceship," and he was forced to retreat as others on stage also began to flee. The fire grew and spread quickly and intensively as children, dancers, stagehands, and audience members fled towards the exits to escape the heat, smoke, and melting plastic. Within less than a minute, the entire set was engulfed in flames. Kids were removed from the ferris wheel, which was a part of the scenery. The only one who failed to get out was Thamires. Leonilson, Xuxa's bodyguard, came back to remove her.

Though camera operators and other technicians fled with the others, the cameras continued to operate and feed the videotape machines as the [[conflagration]] grew. The footage was shown frequently on Brazilian news shows for days after the fire.

== Aftermath ==
Although no one died as a result of the fire (which was ultimately attributed to an electrical [[short circuit]]), many were treated for minor smoke inhalation, and four individuals were seriously injured by smoke inhalation and burns. These included Leonilson (nicknamed "Léo"), Xuxa's personal [[bodyguard]]; the show's resident [[clown]] Topetão; and two of the children. The two men helped save many of the children (including one who had become stuck in one of the on-set rides). All eventually recovered from their injuries.

Xuxa, who was not injured, nevertheless was strongly affected by the fire, and reportedly spent quite some time afterwards in a deep [[clinical depression|depression]]. She visited the fire victims and their families in the hospital frequently. ''Xuxa Park'' went on hiatus after the fire, and was ultimately cancelled. For a time, Xuxa felt unable to perform at all, especially with children. Eventually, she recovered from her malaise and returned to the public eye.

In 2015, the location became [[Monica's_Gang#M.C3.B4nica_Park|Monica Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8352">[[File:Emo Chic.jpg|thumb|Example of a participant in [[emo]] subculture]]
A '''youth subculture''' is a [[youth]]-based [[subculture]] with distinct styles, behaviors, and interests. Youth subcultures offer participants an identity outside of that ascribed by [[social institution]]s such as [[family]], [[employment|work]], [[home]] and [[school]]. Youth subcultures that show a systematic hostility to the dominant culture are sometimes described as [[counterculture]]s.

Youth [[music genre]]s are associated with many youth subcultures, such as [[hip hop culture|hip hop]], [[Punk subculture|punks]], [[emos]], [[rave]]rs, [[Juggalo]]s, [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] and [[Goth subculture|goths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=SAGCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Youth+subcultures+that+stems+from+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uYggnqXWuD&amp;sig=HaTfGytpEY_7IqwcKetExcsg32c&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUhdWw9pXWAhVm44MKHatDA5UQ6AEIaDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Youth%20subcultures%20that%20stems%20from%20music&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Subculture: Pop, Youth and Identity in a Postcolonial World|last=Huq|first=Rupa|date=2007-01-24|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134470655|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of subcultures often consists of the study of the [[symbol]]ism attached to clothing, music, other visible affections by members of the subculture, and also the ways in which these same symbols are interpreted by members of the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mheducation.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335202500.pdf|title=CULTURES OF POPULAR MUSIC|last=Bennett|first=Andy|date=2001|website=www.mheducation.co.uk/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socioeconomic class]], [[gender]], [[intelligence]], [[conformity]], [[morality]],  and [[ethnicity]] can be important in relation to youth subcultures. Youth subcultures can be defined as meaning systems, modes of expression or [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s developed by groups in [[subordinate]] structural positions in response to dominant systems — and which reflect their attempt to solve structural contradictions rising from the wider societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Brake, Michael (1985) ''Comparative Youth Culture: The sociology of youth culture and youth subcultures in America, Britain and Canada'', Routledge, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''scene'' can refer to an exclusive subculture or faction. Scenes are distinguished from the broad culture through either [[fashion]]; identification with specific (sometimes obscure or experimental) [[musical genre]]s or political perspectives; and a strong in-group or [[tribe|tribal]] mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Straw, Will (1991). "Systems of Articulation, Logics of Change: Communities and Scenes in Popular Music", ''Cultural Studies'', 5, 3, pp. 273, 368-88&lt;/ref&gt; The term can be used to describe geographic subsets of a subculture, such as the Detroit [[drum and bass]] scene or the London goth scene.

==Theories about youth subculture==
Early studies in [[youth culture]] were mainly produced by [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist sociologists]], and focus on youth as a single form of culture. In explaining the development of the culture, they utilized the concept of ''[[anomie]]''. [[Talcott Parsons]] argued that as we move from the family and corresponding values to another sphere with differing values, (e.g. the workplace) we would experience an "anomie situation."{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The generalizations involved in this theory ignore the existence of subcultures.

[[Marxist theory|Marxist theories]] account for some diversity, because they focus on classes and class-fractions rather than youth as a whole. Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson described youth subcultures as symbolic or ritualistic attempts to resist the power of bourgeois hegemony by consciously adopting behavior that appears threatening to the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Stuart &amp; Jefferson, Tony. ''Resistance Through Rituals: Youth Subcultures in Post-war Britain'', Routledge, London. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Marxists of the [[Frankfurt School]] of social studies argue that youth culture is inherently consumerist and integral to the divide-and-rule strategy of capitalism.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} They argue that it creates generation gaps and pits groups of youths against each other (e.g. [[mods and rockers]]), especially as youth culture is the dominant culture in the west.

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionist theorist]] Stan Cohen argues youth subcultures are not coherent social groupings that arise spontaneously as a reaction to social forces, but that mass media labeling results in the creation of youth subcultures by imposing an ideological framework in which people can locate their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Stan. ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'', Paladin, London. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; [[Post-structuralism|Post-structuralist theories]] of subculture utilize many of the ideas from these other theories, including hegemony and the role of the media. In his book, ''[[Subculture: The Meaning of Style]]'', [[Dick Hebdige]] describes subcultures as a reaction of subordinated groups that challenge the hegemony of the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, Dick. ''Subculture: The meaning of style'', Menthuen &amp; Co, London. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory accounts for factors such as gender, ethnicity and age. Youth can be seen as a subordinate group in relation to the dominant, adult society.

Historical theorist Steven Mintz claims that until about 1955, youth subculture as such did not exist.  Children aspired to (or were pulled into) adulthood as fast as their physical development allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, Steven. ''[[Huck's Raft: A History of American Childhood]]'', 2006, {{ISBN|0-674-01998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcel Danesi argues that since then, the media, advertisers and others have made youth the dominant culture of Western societies, to the point that many people retain what others consider to be immature attitudes far into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel. ''Forever Young: The 'Teen-Aging' of Modern Culture'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-8020-8851-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further supported by P. Lewis, who claims that youth culture did not originate until the 1950s, with the development of [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, P. ''The Fifties'', Heinemann, London. 1978&lt;/ref&gt; However, other historians have claimed that youth culture may have developed earlier, particularly in the inter-war period.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, D. ''The First Teenagers: The lifestyle of Young Wage Earners in Interwar Britain'', The Woburn Press, London. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; There were examples of new youth subcultures emerging throughout that period, such as the [[flapper]].

Subcultures may also be seen as extensions of [[crowds (adolescence)|crowds]], subcultures that emerge within a specific school. Certain crowds (jocks, geeks, preppies, druggies, emos) are found in many, even most, high schools across the United States, though the particular terms used by the [[adolescence|adolescents]] in them may vary (nerds instead of geeks, etc.). Most of these can be found in other western countries as well, with the exception of [[jock (athlete)|jocks]]. (The United States is unusual in having athletics specifically affiliated with schools, although similar athletic affiliation groups exist in British [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s.) &lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J. J. (2002). Adolescents in Western countries on the threshold of the 21st century. In B. Brown, R. Larson, &amp; T. Saraswathi (Eds.), ‘’The world’s youth: Adolescence in eight regions of the globe.’’ New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delsing, M. J. M. H., ter Bogt, Tom F. M., Engles, R. C. M. E., &amp; Meeus, W. H. J. (2007).
