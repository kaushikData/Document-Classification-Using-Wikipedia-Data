{{Ayyavazhi}}
The '''Akilam nine'''  is one of the sub-sections of [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] the Primary scripture of [[Ayyavazhi]]. It describes the events taking place immediately before and at the time of incarnation of Vaikundar in the world.

==Discussions with Vyakarar==
[[Thirumal]] discussed with [[Isurar]] regarding his birth in the world. After that he called the saint [[Vyakarar]] and inquired about the events that took place in the world from the beginnings and also the events that will take place till the end of times. After Vyakarar detailed about these events, he inscribed those in a stone in the [[Kayilai]].

==Saints in Tiruchendur==
As per the instructions given by Thirumal, many saints reached [[Tiruchendur|Chendur]] with him. After this, Thirumal beget a child in the ocean and sent him into the land of [[Detchanam]] for the purpose of destroying [[Kali]]. Seeing the arrival of Thirumal in Chendur, [[Muruga|Arumugan]] gave him a warm welcome and requested that everyone stay back in Chendur. Hearing this, [[Narayana]]r appreciated the rule of Murugan and called him son-in-law. He then spoke with Isar and reached the shores of Chendur sea.

==Incarnation of Vaikundar==
After this, the saints brought the body in which [[Vaikundar]] will incarnate, to the place where [[Vishnu]] resided. The body was actually born in the majestic land of [[Detchanam]]. Thirumal went into the sea and merged with [[Lakshmi]] and beget Vaikundar. Vaikundar was born out of the sea of Tiruchendur and Thirumal gave him the fourth [[Vinchai]].

'''''Angels in the Infield''''' is a 2000 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] television film, Directed by [[Robert King (writer)|Robert King]]. A follow up to the 1994 film ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1994 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]'', and the 1997 film ''[[Angels in the Endzone]]'', this motion picture is about a group of [[angel]]s trying to help a [[baseball]] team win a [[Final (competition)|championship game]], while at the same time helping to reunite the team's pitcher's family. The [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] are again featured, in a reprise of the role that the team played during ''Angels in the Outfield''.

==Plot==
When Eddie Everett ([[Patrick Warburton]]) was a rookie in 1992, he was one of the best pitchers of his time. He led the [[California Angels]] to the [[American League Championship Series]], where they played the [[Boston Red Sox]], and were one out away from making it to the World Series (this same situation occurred in real life, but in 1986, not 1992). When a rookie playing for the Red Sox [[hit (baseball)|hit]]s a [[ground ball]] to Eddie, he bobbles it and is unable to get him out, while the [[Baserunning|runners]] he let on [[base (baseball)|base]] score, losing a chance for the Angels to make it to the [[World Series]]. Ever since then, he had never been the same [[pitcher]], or the same person.

Six years later, Eddie and his wife, Claire, are divorced, and he has barely kept contact with their thirteen-year-old daughter, Laurel. However, at a game where the [[Anaheim Angels]] are playing the fictitious Arizona Crimson Devils, and they lose, Claire says that she is taking a job in Boston and is leaving Laurel with him. When he takes her back home, she realizes that his life isn't at all what she thought it'd be. He can't get over losing that game in his rookie year, and she prays that he can get a second chance.

After hearing this prayer, real angel, and former Angels pitcher Bob Bugler, is sent to help her. He and other angels help the team have an incredible winning streak, right when Eddie was about to get cut from the team. Soon, his game improves, as well as his relationship with Laurel.

As the season ends, the Angels and the Crimson Devils are forced to play in a one-game [[playoff]] to determine which team will represent their [[division (sport)|division]] in the [[postseason]]. The actual [[Satan|devil]] makes a deal with Randy Fleck, the Crimson Devils' star player who was also the one who hit the grounder that blew the 1992 ALCS for the Angels, for Eddie to lose the game, and everything he cares about, in exchange for his soul. He agrees.

The devil makes the game delayed thanks to rain, and Eddie leaves to see Laurel's ballet recital. To get him to the game faster, Bob speeds up the recital. When he gets to the game, the Crimson Devils are up 2-0 in the bottom of the eighth inning. The Angels soon score three runs thanks to a [[home run]] by a player who had a demon holding him back. When Laurel asks Bob why he didn't do anything about it, he replies that the angels aren't allowed to help in championships. When the ninth inning comes, Eddie gets two quick outs, but then a player hits a triple. Then, Fleck who blew the game for him in his rookie year comes to the plate, and he asks God what to do, then Bob comes up to him on the mound and tells him that his angel just arrived, and he looks in the stands to see Claire standing there. After this, he pitches to him, and he hits a ground ball just like the one he hit in their rookie year, but this time, he manages to get it, and he throws it to first to end the game, and save his career. He hugs Laurel after the game, and kisses Claire.

"'''Another Day in Paradise'''" is a song recorded by English drummer, singer-songwriter [[Phil Collins]]. Produced by Collins along with [[Hugh Padgham]], it was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from his number-one album ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989). As with his song for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], "[[Man on the Corner]]", the track has as its subject the problem of [[homelessness]];&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book |title= Rock N' Roll Gold Rush |author=Maury Dean |year=2003 |publisher=Algora |isbn=0-87586-207-1 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, the song was a substantial departure from the [[Dance music|dance]]-[[pop music]] of his previous album, ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985).

Collins sings the song from a third-person perspective, as he observes a man crossing the street to ignore a homeless woman, and he implores listeners not to turn a blind eye to homelessness because, by drawing a religious allusion, "it's just another day for you and me in [[paradise]]". Collins also appeals directly to [[God]] by singing: "Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do? Oh Lord, there must be something you can say."

The song was Collins' seventh and final [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] No. 1 single, the last No. 1 single of the 1980s and the first No. 1 single of the 1990s. It was also a worldwide success, eventually becoming one of the most successful songs of his solo career. It won Collins and Padgham the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year#Recipients|Record of the Year]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|1991 awards ceremony]], while it was also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year#Recipients|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance#Recipients|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video#Recipients|Best Music Video, Short Form]]. "Another Day in Paradise" also won an award for [[Brit Award for British Single of the Year#Winners and nominees|British Single]] at the [[1990 Brit Awards#Winners and nominees|1990 Brit Awards]]. Despite the awards gained following its release, the song also generated some controversy over its subject matter and has received a largely negative reaction from music critics.

Collins and [[David Crosby]]'s live performance of the song at the [[33rd Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy Awards]] was released on the 1994 album ''Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002IXZ/ |title=Grammy's Greatest Moments, Volume 1: Various Artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Collins's version was listed at 86th on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Greatest Songs of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-90.shtml |title=Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=1 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090425025152/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-90.shtml| archivedate= 25 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Another Day in Paradise" has since been covered by several artists, including [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], her brother [[Ray J]], Jam Tronik, [[Axxis]], [[Novecento (group)|Novecento]], and [[Hank Marvin]].

==Chart performance==
The song was another massive hit for Collins. On 23 December 1989, it became his seventh ({{As of|2018|April|alt=and to date, final}}) No. 1 single in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt; The song was also the final No. 1 song of the 1980s in the U.S., and remained at No. 1 for four weeks, which classifies the song as a hit from the 1990s as well. This song is notable for keeping [[Janet Jackson (singer)|Janet Jackson's]] "[[Rhythm Nation]]" from reaching No. 1. It also saw out the 1980s and saw in the 1990s at the top of the German singles chart. The song had already reached No. 2 in the UK in November of that year. The single version is slightly different from the album version in that it uses a shorter intro. [[David Crosby]] also provided backing vocals.

==Reception==
Music historian [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] wrote that "Another Day in Paradise" had been widely criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|date=14 Sep 2007|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music: Concise (5th Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&amp;pg=PA2006-IA1345&amp;lpg=PA2006-IA1345&amp;dq=%22the+widely+criticised+another+day+in+paradise%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JbkVzlVh0q&amp;sig=RQ-2rIR4x34EBnSdP0QgVlMVLmc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2Nz1U-fnOvLb7Abf0IFA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20widely%20criticised%20another%20day%20in%20paradise%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]]|isbn=1846098564|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins addressed the criticism from the English rock press at the time of its release, who found him unqualified to sing about the poor due to his wealth, by saying: "When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees. It's a misconception that if you have a lot of money you're somehow out of touch with reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/arts/the-pop-life-365789.html|title=The Pop Life|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=6 December 1989|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriter and political activist [[Billy Bragg]] was scathing of the song in an interview in 2000, drawing a contrast between Collins and a band he admired, [[the Clash]], stating: "Phil Collins might write a song about the homeless, but if he doesn't have the action to go with it he's just exploiting that for a subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20260660,00.html | title= Bragg-ing Rites | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Rob | last=Brunner | date=30 June 2000 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Andrew Collins (broadcaster)|Andrew Collins]] described the song as a "bland redress" for the subject of homelessness in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.newstatesman.com/node/194648 | title= Give music a chance | work=New Statesman | first=Andrew | last=Collins | date=24 February 2003 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' dismissed the track in 2007 as "a song that addressed the issue of homelessness with the same insight as [[Melanie C|Sporty Spice]]'s '[[If That Were Me]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/sep/19/iwishidneverheardofphil | title= I wish I'd never heard of Phil Collins ... | work=The Guardian | first=Caroline | last=Sullivan | date=19 September 2007 | accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2010, David Sheppard described the song's lyrics as "cringe-worthy" and gave it as an example of Collins "painting the bull's-eye on his own forehead" when it came to his negative status with music critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/m9nv | title= Phil Collins Going Back Review | publisher=BBC | first=David | last=Sheppard | accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for [[MSN]] in 2013, Hugh Wilson contrasted Collins's concern for the homeless in the song with his concern as a multimillionaire at the prospect of the UK's election of a tax-raising [[socialism|socialist]] government. Referring to Collins's statement that he would consider leaving the UK with the election of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, Wilson noted that the song led to "accusations of hypocrisy" because Collins had "bemoaned the plight of the homeless" in it. Wilson also said Collins became "an easy target when future elections came round".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://him.uk.msn.com/in-the-know/famous-men-and-their-misunderstood-politics-di-canio-fascist-row?page=7 |title=Famous men and their misunderstood politics |work=MSN |first=Hugh |last=Wilson |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222225551/http://him.uk.msn.com/in-the-know/famous-men-and-their-misunderstood-politics-di-canio-fascist-row?page=7 |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astrid Zydower''' (4 August 1930 – 27 May 2005) was a British sculptor.

==Biography==
Zydower was born in 1930 in a small village in the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] region which at that time was within the borders of Germany.&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth&gt;{{cite web |author=Madeleine Harmsworth|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/astrid-zydower-518289.html|title=Astrid Zydower|date=6 December 2005|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=2006|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 2, M to Z |ISBN=0 953260 95 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Jewish family, the Zydowers faced discrimination and oppression under the [[Nazi]] government so in 1939 the three Zydower children were evacuated to Britain on the last [[Kindertransport]] train to leave the territory before the start of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt; 
During [[The Holocaust]] both of Zydower's parents were deported to and then killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt; 

In England the three Zydower children were taken into foster care by a [[Quaker]] family, the Freemans, in [[Sheffield]].&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt; At first unable to speak English, Astrid Zydower struggled at school but did show a talent for drawing and went on to study at [[Sheffield School of Art]].&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt; From there she won a scholarship to the [[Royal College of Art]] in London where she was taught by [[Leon Underwood]] and [[John Skeaping]] and developed her ability as a sculptor.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt;
[[File:Virgin and Child - geograph.org.uk - 639615.jpg|thumb|''Virgin and Child''; part of the Nativity installed at Lincoln Cathedral]]

During the 1960s, Zydower taught at the [[Hornsey School of Art]] in north London and undertook a number of high profile, and often very large, sculptures commissions. In 1964, for the 400th anniversary of the birth of [[William Shakespeare]], she completed a series of life-size figures for [[Stratford, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt; Works by Zydower were commissioned for the [[Expo '67]] world trade fair in [[Montreal]] and subsequently for [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt; 

Among Zydower's students at Hornsey was Shirley Ann Shepherd, the wife of [[Charlie Watts]], the [[Rolling Stones]] drummer. This led to a number of commissions for Zydower from Watts and other members of the band. For Watts she produced a bust of [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and for [[Mick Jagger]] a head of [[Actaeon]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt; She produced a large Nativity scene for [[St Paul's Cathedral]] which was displayed there each Christmas for many years until it was transferred to [[Lincoln Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt; For the [[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot|Museum of the Jewish Dispora]] in Tel-Aviv, Zydower created a scene of group of ten men, a [[minyan]], preparing to enter a prayer room.&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt; A 1970 commission to create a bronze bust of Dame [[Marie Rambert]], founder of the [[Ballet Rambert]], led to a lifelong friendship and several other studies of ballet dancers, including members of the [[New York City Ballet]].&lt;ref name=MRambert&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw05206/Marie-Rambert?LinkID=mp03702&amp;search=sas&amp;sText=Marie+Rambert&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=1|title=''Marie Rambert''|date=|accessdate=6 September 2018|work=National Portrait Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt; In 1984, for the fountain on the central terrace of [[Harewood House]] in Yorkshire Zydower created a nine foot high bronze of [[Orpheus]] carrying a leopard.&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt; In later life she concentrated on etching, mainly of figures from Greek mythology, rather than sculpture.&lt;ref name=MHarmsworth/&gt;

Works by Zydower are held in both the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name=Tragedy&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O111820/a-tragedy-of-fashion-figurine-zydower-astrid/

'''Bando yoga''' or '''Burmese yoga''' is a form of [[yoga]] from [[Myanmar]] usually taught alongside [[bando]]. It is probably based on the internal training of [[Indian martial arts]] and is often referred to as peasant or slave yoga.  It was for the common man and also used by ancient warriors of northern [[Burma]] to maintain health and protect from illness and disease. Today it is practiced by ethnic Burmese in parts of [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Myanmar Martial Arts|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-arts/myanmar-arts-bandoyoga.htm|journal=www.myanmars.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bando really spread in Burma when Japanese invaded the country in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Burmese Martial Arts|url=http://www.combatbando.com/index.php/bando.html|journal=www.combatbando.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a collection of martial arts called [[Thaing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bando: the styles of Burmese Martial Arts|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-styles-of-burmese-martial-arts|journal=www.fightland.vice.com|date = 2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline includes the fighting and defensive behaviors of animals such as the [[cobra]], [[Pythonidae|python]], [[Viperidae|viper]], [[tiger]], [[leopard]], [[monkey]], [[bull]], [[boar]] and [[scorpion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bando Black belt|url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/category/bando/|journal=www.blackbeltmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bando yoga is used for three main purposes. These are for maintaining overall health, resisting illness and disease, and restoring or recovering from illness and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Yoga, Meditation Tour in Myanmar|url=http://www.silkroadgroup.com/Yoga_and_Meditation|journal=www.silkroadgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a yoga system for enlightenment but for developing and maintaining efficient functionality in our everyday life, whether it be as a worker/laborer, monk or warrior.

There are three systems of Burmese yoga:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yoga System|url=http://www.americanbandoassociation.com/about-bando-yoga|journal=www.americanbandoassociation.com|access-date=2015-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104121/http://www.americanbandoassociation.com/about-bando-yoga|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1993, CSI filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]&lt;ref&gt;Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Church of Scientology International, Washington, DC, August 18th, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 3, 1993 a request for "group exemption" for the affiliated "Scientology churches"/"Class V organizations".&lt;ref&gt;Form 8718 - Department of the Treasury/Internal Revenue Service - Request for Group Exemption Ruling under Sec. 501 (c) (3) - Church of Scientology International, Los Angeles, California, September 3rd, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service (IRS)]] eventually granted CSI's request for exemption.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22nd, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The granting of tax exemption to CSI and other Scientology corporations was preceded by years of continuous litigation between the IRS and the various entities of Scientology. According to former high-ranking executives, the Scientology organization had launched about 200 [[lawsuits]] against the IRS until 1991. During the same time, individual [[parish]]ioners of Scientology had initiated 2,300 [[Claim (legal)|claims]] against the agency, challenging the denial of tax deduction for their services at Scientology organizations. Late 1991, the dispute over Scientology's tax-exempt status began to resolve through high-level meetings between [[David Miscavige]] and the then [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner of the IRS]], Fred Goldberg, who encouraged a final resolution of the legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/article1012148.ece Scientology: The Truth Rundown, Part 1 of 3 in a special report on the Church of Scientology, By Joe Childs &amp; Thomas C. Tobin, Saint Petersburg Times, 2009-06-21, retrieved on 2009-06-21]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Corporate Activities - Licensing of Trademarks &amp; Service Marks===

Within the [[corporate structure]] of the Scientology network, the [[Religious Technology Center]] owns the right to license the [[Scientology]] [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]] through a so-called "assignment agreement" between RTC and the founder of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] on May 16, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, County of Los Angeles, California, May 16th, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

RTC and CSI entered a [[license agreement]] on May 18, 1982, granting CSI, the new "Mother Church of Scientology," the right to use and sub-license certain of the trademarks and service marks.&lt;ref&gt;"License Agreement - CSI (Marks)", License Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Church of Scientology International, California, May 18th, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally RTC and CSI signed on January 1, 1982 an "Organizational Covenant" granting CSI the right to deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its staff members.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Covenant-RTC-CSI-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between Church of Scientology International &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably Los Angeles, California, January 1, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSI presents itself as the "mother church" of the "Scientology religion." In this function, it exercises through various agreements with its subordinate organizations worldwide ultimate corporative control over those organizations and their activities.

In particular, CSI has entered the following types of agreements with other organizations:

* [[License]] Agreements that regulate the use of the service marks and trademarks in a similar way as between RTC and the AOs. In its function as sub-licensor, CSI has entered such agreements for example with the [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]],&lt;ref&gt;License Agreement CSI/Church (Marks) - License Agreement between Church of Scientology International and the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Los Angeles, California, May 26th, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientology Missions International]]&lt;ref&gt;License Agreement CSI/SMI and the Missions (Marks) - License Agreement between Church of Scientology International and Scientology Missions International, Los Angeles, California, May 19th, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Church of Scientology Western United States]] (prior "Church of Scientology of San Diego");&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles, California, License Agreement - CSI/Church (Marks) - License Agreement between Church of Scientology International and the Church of Scientology of San Diego, June 15th, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
* Service Agreements regulate the training of the organizations employees by CSI in its headquarters and the monetary compensation by the organizations;
* "[[Ecclesiastical]] Support Agreements," which acknowledge CSI's dominant role and control over all the functions and activities of the subordinate organizations and which guarantee a steady, weekly payment of 12.5% of the organizations' net income towards CSI. The organization has entered such agreements for example with the [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical Support Agreement between Church of Scientology International &amp; Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Los Angeles, California, January 1st, April 3rd &amp; 29th, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of Scientology Western United States]];&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical Support Agreement between Church of Scientology International &amp; Church of Scientology Western United States, Los Angeles, California, January 1st, March 18th &amp; April 24th, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Contracts Respecting Certain Religious Documents." These contracts regulate the use of files that the organizations has on their members and their staff. Ultimately it gives CSI the authority to control the use of them;
* "[[Motion Picture]] Exhibition Agreements" guarantee CSI the weekly payment of 11% of the revenue by the individual organizations for their use of Scientology training courses. It also forces the organizations to use certain equipment, such as tape recorders, which CSI provides for the same use. CSI has entered such agreements for example with the [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;Motion Picture Exhibition Agreement (Churches) between Church of Scientology International and Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Los Angeles, California, Clearwater, Florida, October 23rd &amp; November 25th, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of Scientology Western United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Mot-Agreem-CSI-CoS-WUS.pdf|Motion Picture Exhibition Agreement (Churches) between Church of Scientology International and Church of Scientology Western United States, Los Angeles, California, July 22nd &amp; August 2nd, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational Structure &amp; Management==
CSI consists of a numerous corporations and unincorporated entities that are connected together by contracts and, more importantly, by the internal policies and the so-called "Scientology command channels", which define their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cover sheet of the booklet "The Command Channels of Scientology, Exhibit of CSI's application for tax-exempt status, Los Angeles, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically CSI consists of the following principal organizations:

* The "Watchdog Committee" (WDC), an entity, is the highest management organization within CSI. Excluding RTC, it has the final say over all financial and personnel matters within the "Command Channels" of Scientology. In the "Command Channels" booklet its purpose is meagerly described as "establishing management units."&lt;ref&gt;Page 9 &amp; 10 of the Scientology Command Channels booklet, Chapter on Watchdog Committee, Los Angeles, California, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; WDC is headed by the WDC Chairman, who at the same time holds the position of "Commanding Officer" of the "Commodore's Messenger Organization International" (CMO Int.). The [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] is an enforcement and internal investigation unit, which operates on behalf of the WDC. CMO International also comprises the office of the "Senior Case Supervisor International" (C/S Int.), a technical supervision unit, the "LRH Personal Public Relations Office International" (LRH PPRO) and the "International Finance Office",&lt;ref&gt;Description of the "International Finance Office" by CSI, Response to question 3b by the IRS, pages 3-19 - 3-21, Year: 1992 - 1993&lt;/ref&gt; an office that supervises through its "Finance network" all financial matters of the various organizations.
* [[Golden Era Productions]] is another CSI-entity that is located at Gilman Hot Springs. It is the organization that is responsible for the production of Scientology films, audiotapes and E-meters and conducts worldwide marketing campaigns for Dianetics and Scientology.
* The "International Network of Computer Organized Management" (INCOMM) hosts the internal communications system and computer data banks. It safeguards all reports that are received by the Scientology management from the other organizations, as stated by CSI in an exhibit of CSI's application for tax-exempt status.&lt;ref&gt;Description of "INCOMM" by CSI, Response to question 4c by the IRS, pages 4-18 - 4-21, Year: 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "Senior Executive Strata," stands below the WDC. It is composed of the "International Management Executive Committee" (IMEC) and its staff. IMEC is considered as the strategic management unit within CSI, which does the planning, evaluation and the long-term management of Scientology organizations worldwide, as described in the "Command Channels"-booklet. IMEC is led by the "Executive Director International".&lt;ref&gt;Page 13 &amp; 14 of the Scientology Command Channels booklet, Chapter on Executive Director International and the Senior Executive Strata, Los Angeles, California, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* The next lower management unit is the "Flag Command Bureaux" (FCB).&lt;ref&gt;Page 17 - 25 of the Scientology Command Channels booklet, Chapter on Flag Command Bureaux and its sub-entities, Los Angeles, California, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; FCB includes various sub-entities, management units, networks and corporations. Among them are:
* The supervising authority "Flag Network Coordination Committee" (FNCC). This entity is composed of the heads of the different management units within the FCB under the guidance of the "Commanding Officer FCB." The FNCC supposedly meets on a daily basis and coordinates the activities of the networks within the FCB.&lt;ref&gt;Description of the "Flag Network Coordination Committee" by CSI, Response to question 3b by the IRS, pages 3-25 - 3-28, Year: 1992 - 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

This unit manages and controls the legal and intelligence operations of the [[Church of Scientology]] on a worldwide basis.
* The "Flag Bureaux" (FB). This is the entity that directly manages the [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]] (FSO) in Clearwater, the [[Freewinds|Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization]] (FSSO) in Netherlands Antilles, the [[Celebrity Centre|Celebrity Centre International]] (CC Int.) in Los Angeles, the organization "I HELP," which licenses "Field Auditors" and the "Flag Liaison Offices" (FLOs), "continental" management units that direct the lower organizations and missions on their specific "Scientology-continent."
* The organization [[Scientology Missions International]] (SMI). This is a Californian non-profit corporation, which controls and directs the "continental" SMI-offices and licenses the individual "Missions," smaller or "beginner" organizations of the Scientology-network.
* [[World Institute of Scientology Enterprises|World Institute of Scientology Enterprises International]] (WISE Int.), a Californian non-profit corporation, which controls and directs the "continental" WISE-offices and licenses independent Scientology businesses that use and sell the "LRH administrative technology."

|
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Central Authority'''
| The Caliphate – successor to the Prophet – is a political body headed by the Caliph (defunct since 1920).  In the past, four principles for appointing the Caliph recognized: consensus by the [[Ummah]], nomination by the preceding Caliph, selection by a committee, or by military force. The idea was that the Caliph was to be chosen from among those most capable. A fifth principle – descent from Mohammed’s Quraish tribe, was not always followed.  Sinlessness not a condition for leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/major-difference-between-shia-and-sunni | title = Major Difference Between Shia and Sunni | accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.al-islam.org/imamate-the-viceregency-of-the-prophet-sayyid-akhtar-rizvi/part-3-sunni-point-view |title= Part 3: The Sunni Point of View |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|The [[Imamate]] – a religious body headed by the Imam – is occupied by the hidden Mahdi.  Must be a male descendant of the lineage of Mohammad through his daughter Fatima, and must be chosen by God.  Imams are sinless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.al-islam.org/the-origins-and-early-development-of-shia-islam-sayyid-jafari/chapter-11-doctrine-imamate |title= Chapter 11: The Doctrine of the Imamate |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/creed-of-shia-explained/concept-of-imamate.html |title= Chapter 6: The Shia Concept of the Imamate |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.al-islam.org/imamate-the-viceregency-of-the-prophet-sayyid-akhtar-rizvi/part-2-shiite-point-view |title= Part 2: The Shi’ite Point of View |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|It is unnecessary to have one leader for the entire Muslim world.  The Ibadi Imamate – a religious, spiritual and political body with leadership of the Ummah – is headed by the Imam.  The Imam should be chosen for his knowledge and piety. The last 'true Imam' was Admad ibn Sa'id (ruled 1754–1783).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=348315&amp;p=2347041 |title= Ibadi Islam: History |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Current Leaders'''
|Imams (not in the same sense as Shia Imams who are divinely guided).
| Mujtahids (Grand Ayatollahs). 
|Imams (not in the same sense as Shia or Sunni).
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|'''Leadership'''
|Believe no one was appointed by Mohammad to be his successor.  Historically, the Caliph, a non-hereditary position that can theoretically be removed, has acted as leader.  The position of Caliph has been void since 1920.  Caliphs viewed as temporal leaders only, and held to be both a religious and political office.  The main task of the Caliphate was to see that [[Sharia]] law was applied in the community, that the borders of Islam were secure, and in general, to provide for the well-being of the citizens.  In the absence of the Caliphate, hierarchical structure often falls under the state, rather than clerical, control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/se/5806/580602.html |title= Islam: Sunnis and Shiites | accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/religion-shia2.htm |title= Shia Leadership |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dgAqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Demystifying+the+Caliphate+Historical+Memory+and+Contemporary+Contexts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_NBFVcasFdHFogTAvICIDg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AewAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Demystifying%20the%20Caliphate%20Historical%20Memory%20and%20Contemporary%20Contexts&amp;f=false | title = Demystifying the Caliphate: Historical Memory and Contemporary Contexts | isbn = 9780190257125 | author1 = Madawi Al-Rasheed | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkJpBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA426&amp;dq=caliph+non-hereditary+removed+1920&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oM9FvbvDKtGoogSR4IhwDw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AewAA#v=snippet&amp;q=caliphate&amp;f=false | title = A History of Islamic Societies | isbn = 9781139991506 | author1 = Ira M.

|Believe the true leader of the community is Imam [[Ali]] along with his descendants who were appointed by God to be the successor of Mohammad. View leadership as a hereditary class descending from Mohammad's lineage through his daughter Fatima.  The position of the Imam is currently held by the Mahdi.  Imams are infallible and the office is purely religious. Various Grand Ayatollahs act as central figures until the return of the Mahdi.  In absence of the Imamate, authority falls under various Grand Ayatollahs.

|Shiite learned class usually wear black or dark brown robes called an aba, which is a sleveless cloak that is open in front, along with either a white, black or green turban, with the turban's color often related to their lineage.  A black turban, or even a green turban, represents a Sayyid.  A Sayyid is someone who is a descendant of the Prophet Mohammad. A Shia cleric who cannot trace his lineage to the Prophet Mohammad thus wears a white turban.

Imams are treated as God's appointed representatives on Earth, and their tombs have become pilgrimage sites.

|When capitalized, Imam refers to those with the highest level of power and authority.  Imams are considered infallible leaders who are descended from the House of Ali.  Imams are seen as divine legates and interpreters of the Quran and provided guidance for daily life.  Various Shia sects have different numbers of Imams.

These branches consider each other to be on right path with different way of thinking.Eventhough Salafis respect these scholars they do not support blind following of them.They consider one of the four Imam’s contradictory opinion is only correct. But scholars are not punishable for their mistakes which are not deliberate. The four scholars warned that they should not be followed blindly.
|The main branches are the Zaydis ('Fivers'), the Ismailis ('Seveners'), and Ithna Ashariyya ('Twelvers'). The main distinction is the number of recognized Imams. The 'Fivers' do not agree to the infallibility of Imams{{fact|date=October 2017}} nor to the occultation of the Twelfth Imam Mahdi{{fact|date=October 2017}} and its school of law are more closely related to Hanafi Sunni than to other Shia schools.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3982">'''Flidas''' or '''Flidais''' (modern spelling: '''Fliodhas''', '''Fliodhais''') is a female figure in [[Irish Mythology]], known by the epithet ''Foltchaín'' ("beautiful hair"). She is believed to have been a goddess of cattle and fertility. In the recent past she has been popularly rendered as a woodland goddess akin to the Greek [[Artemis]] and Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], though scholars now believe this to be incorrect. &lt;ref name=Beck&gt;Beck, N. ''Goddesses in Celtic Religion''. ULL2, UCD, 2009. http://theses.univ-lyon2.fr/documents/getpart.php?id=lyon2.2009.beck_n&amp;part=159144 "A Celtic Deer Goddess?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monaghan&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

She is mentioned in the [[Metrical Dindshenchas]] as mother of Fand&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gwynne (ed &amp; trans, 1906), ''The Metrical Dindshenchas'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T106500C/index.html Vol 3] poem 49&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' as the mother of [[Fand]], [[Bé Chuille]] and [[Bé Téite]].&lt;ref name=monaghan/&gt; In the [[Middle Irish]] glossary ''Cóir Anmann'' ("Fitness of Names") she is said to be the wife of the legendary High King [[Adamair]] and the mother of [[Nia Segamain]], who by his mother's power was able to milk deer as if they were cows.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Leahy (ed &amp; trans, 1906), ''Heroic Romances of Ireland'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/hroi/hroiv2.htm Vol II] p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; This association with deer, and her subsequent attribution as a woodland goddess is based on an unlikely medieval folk etymology of her name as "flid ois" or "wetness of a faun."&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;Beck, N. ''Goddesses in Celtic Religion''. ULL2, UCD, 2009. http://theses.univ-lyon2.fr/documents/getpart.php?id=lyon2.2009.beck_n&amp;part=159144 "A Celtic Deer Goddess?"&lt;/ref&gt; This etymology may have been an effort to conflate Flidais with the deer maiden, [[Sadhbh]] from the [[Fenian Cycle]]. The myths relating to Fliodhais overwhelmingly focus only on cattle and milking.

Flidais is a central figure in ''[[Táin Bó Flidhais]]'' ("The Driving-off of Flidais's Cattle"), an [[Ulster Cycle]] work, where she is the lover of [[Fergus mac Róich]] and the owner of a magical herd of cattle. The story, set in [[Erris]], [[County Mayo]] tells how Fergus carried her and her cattle away from her husband, Ailill Finn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/flidais.html "The Driving of the Cattle of Flidais"] From Leahy, ''Heroic Romances'' Volume II pp. 108-128&lt;/ref&gt; During the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' (Cattle Raid of Cooley) she slept in the tent of [[Ailill mac Máta]], king of Connacht, and every seven days her herd supplied milk for the entire army.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cecile O'Rahilly]] (ed &amp; trans,  1967), [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T301035/index.html ''Táin Bó Cúailnge'' from the Book of Leinster], p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Táin Bó Flidhais]]'' she has a favoured white cow known as "The Maol" which can feed 300 men from one night's milking.&lt;ref&gt;Dunford, S. Táin Bó Flidhais (2008) Dublin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leahy, ''Heroic Romances of Ireland'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/hroi/hroiv2.htm Vol II] pp. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt; Another Ulster Cycle tale says that it took seven women to satisfy Fergus, unless he could have Flidais.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/conchobar2.html "The Tidings of Conchobar son of Ness"] ed. and trans. by Whitley Stokes.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}

In  [[Roman mythology]], '''Flora''' ({{lang-la|Flōra}}) is a [[Sabine]]-derived [[goddess]] of flowers&lt;ref&gt;H. Nettleship ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (1891) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; and of the season of [[spring (season)|spring]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythindex.com/roman-mythology/F/Flora.html|title=Flora|publisher=Myth Index |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a symbol for nature and flowers (especially the may-flower). While she was otherwise a relatively minor figure in Roman mythology, being one among several [[fertility goddess]]es, her association with the spring gave her particular importance at the coming of springtime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKhloris.html|title=
Khloris, goddess of flowers.|publisher=Theoi Project|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did her role as goddess of youth.&lt;ref&gt;H. Nettleship ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (1891) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  Her [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] counterpart is [[Chloris]].  

== Etymology ==
Her name is derived from the [[Latin]] word "flos" which means "flower". In modern English, "Flora" also means the plants of a particular region or period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/flora Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
Her festival, the ''[[Floralia]]'', was held between April 28 and May 3 and symbolized the renewal of the cycle of life, drinking, and flowers.&lt;ref name="NewLarousse"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Guirand | first1 = Felix | last2 = Aldington | first2 = Richard | last3 = Ames | first3 = Delano | last4 = Graves | first4 = Robert  | title = New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology | date = December 16, 1987 | publisher = Crescent Books | isbn = 0517004046 | page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was first instituted in 240 B.C.E, and on the advice of the [[Sibylline books]], she was also given [[Temple of Flora|a temple]] in 238 B.C.E.  At the festival, with the men decked in flowers, and the women wearing normally forbidden gay costumes, five days of farces and mimes were enacted&amp;nbsp;– [[ithyphallic]],&lt;ref&gt;P/ Green ed., ''Juvenal: The Sixteen Satires'' (1982) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; and including nudity when called for&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (1967) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; – followed by a sixth day of the hunting of goats and hares.&lt;ref&gt;H. Nettleship ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (1891) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23 another (rose) festival was held in her honor.&lt;ref name="NewLarousse" /&gt;

Flora's [[Greek mythology|Greek]] equivalent is [[Chloris]], who was a nymph. Flora is married to [[Anemoi|Favonius]], the wind god also known as Zephyr, and her companion was [[Hercules]].

Flora achieved more prominence in the neo-pagan revival of Antiquity among [[Renaissance]] [[humanism|humanists]] than she had ever enjoyed in ancient Rome.{{citeneeded|date=April 2015}}

==Music== 
Flora is the main character of the ballet ''[[The Awakening of Flora]]''. She is also mentioned in [[Henry Purcell]]'s [[Nymphs and Shepherds]].

==Sculpture==
There are many monuments of Flora, e.g. in [[Capitoline Museums]] in [[Rome]] (Italy), in [[Valencia]] (Spain) and [[Szczecin]] (Poland) (see [[Statue of Flora in Szczecin]]).

{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=all}}

'''Freedom of religion''' is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or [[belief]] in teaching, practice, [[worship]], and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[human right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|accessdate=5 December 2006|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201105738/http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|archivedate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ANDmIIpAmwC&amp;pg=PA29734|title=Congressional Record #29734 – 19 November 2003|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with a [[state religion]], freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not [[religious persecution|persecute]] believers in other faiths.
Freedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.

==History==
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Minerva als Symbol der Toleranz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Minerva]] as a symbol of enlightened wisdom protects the believers of all religions ([[Daniel Chodowiecki]], 1791)]]
Historically, ''freedom of religion'' has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while ''freedom of worship'' has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom ''from'' religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution.  Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of [[dhimmi]]s, literally "protected individuals" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.]]
In [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.

[[Cyrus the Great]] established the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the [[Cyrus Cylinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html Cyrus Cylinder], [http://www.livius.org/ livius.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard A. Taylor|author2=E. Ray Clendenen|title=Haggai, Malachi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC|date=15 October 2004|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8054-0121-9|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC&amp;pg=PA31 31–32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, [[Zoroastrianism]], Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the [[trial of Socrates]] in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token [[sacrifice]] was similar to refusing to take an [[oath of allegiance]]. This was the core for resentment and the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of early Christian communities]].

Freedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]] by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

Greek-Jewish clashes at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in 73 AD and 117 AD and in [[Alexandria]] in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.

The Romans tolerated most religions, including [[Judaism]] and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate [[Christianity]] until it was legalised by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]] in 311. The [[Edict of Milan]] guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.

===Muslim world===
Following a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of [[Medina]] (then known as ''Yathrib''), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] was declared by [[Muhammad]] in the [[Constitution of Medina]]. The Islamic [[Caliphate]] later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept ''[[dhimmi]]'' status and their adult males pay the punitive ''[[jizya]]'' tax instead of the ''[[zakat]]'' paid by Muslim citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Njeuma|first=Martin Z.|title=Fulani Hegemony in Yola (Old Adamawa) 1809-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQA4Q6fX7EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;ots=8pyCFSKL0V&amp;dq=Fulani%20Hegemony%20in%20Yola%20(Old%20Adamawa)%201809-1902&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-726-95-0|page=82|quote=Of all the various forms of taxation known to Islamic communities, it seems only two{{snd}} the zakat and the jixya were of importance in Adamawa.

The only privilege that was reserved for the Muslims was the seat of the caliphate, and this, because of certain religious functions attached to it, which could not naturally be discharged by a non-Muslim."

[[Religious pluralism]] existed in classical [[Islamic ethics]] and [[Sharia]], as the [[religious law]]s and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=C.

According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

===India===
{{Main article|Freedom of religion in India}}
Ancient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Who are the Jews of India? – The S. Mark Taper Foundation imprint in Jewish studies. University of California Press. 2000. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21323-4}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWX6pF2PTJwC&amp;pg=PA26.; "When the Portuguese arrived in 1498, they brought a spirit of intolerance utterly alien to India. They soon established an Office of Inquisition at Goa, and at their hands Indian Jews experienced the only instance of anti-Semitism ever to occur in Indian soil."&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of religion [[edicts]] have been found written during [[Ashoka the Great]]'s reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.

Although India is an 80% [[Hindu]] country, India is a secular state without any [[state religion]]s.

Many scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, [[Hinduism]], has long been a most tolerant religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Ludden|title=Contesting the Nation: Religion, Community, and the Politics of Democracy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1585-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC&amp;pg=257 257–58]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajni Kothari]], founder of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] has written, "[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajni Kothari|title=Communalism in Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Rainbow Publishers|isbn=978-81-86962-00-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22foundations+of+a+civilisation+that+is+fundamentally+non–religious%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]], the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the [[Mahabharata]], has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. "Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition," the Dalai Lama said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/42229/indias-religious-tolerance-lauded.html|title=India's religious tolerance lauded|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) ([[Ashoka]]). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a [[Edicts of Ashoka|just and humane society]]. Later he promoted the principles of [[Buddhism]], and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.

The importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of [[Ashoka]]:
{{Quote|King Piyadasi (Ashok) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, one must not exalt one's creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.}} 

On the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.

After the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-knapp.com/christian_persecution_in_india.htm|title=Christian Persecution in India: The Real Story|publisher=Stephen-knapp.com|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=The Constitution of India |format=PDF |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] counters this argument by saying that [[evangelical]] Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.

In September 2010, the Indian state of [[Kerala]]'s State Election Commissioner announced that "Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers".&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orthodoxherald.com/2010/09/18/%E2%80%98using-places-of-worship-for-campaigning-in-kerala-civic-polls-is-violation-of-poll-code%E2%80%99/|title='Using places of worship for campaigning in Kerala civic polls is violation of poll code'|newspaper=Indian Orthodox Herald|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"/&gt;

Even today, most Indians celebrate all religious festivals with equal enthusiasm and respect. [[Hindu]] festivals like [[Deepavali]] and [[Holi]], Muslim festivals like [[Eid al-Fitr]], [[Eid-Ul-Adha]], [[Muharram]], Christian festivals like Christmas and other festivals like [[Buddha Purnima]], [[Mahavir Jayanti]], Gur Purab etc. are celebrated and enjoyed by all [[Indian people|Indians]].

===Europe===

====Religious intolerance====
[[File:CONGRESS COLUMN-BRUSSELS-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (13).jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth century allegorical statue on the [[Congress Column]] in Belgium depicting religious freedom]]
Most Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews]] from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the [[Inquisition]] for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.

However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As early as 1380, [[John Wycliffe]] in England denied [[transubstantiation]] and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a [[Papal Bull]] in 1410, and all his books were burned.

In 1414, [[Jan Hus]], a [[Bohemia]]n preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the [[Council of Constance]]. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.

After the fall of the city of [[Granada]], Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the [[Treaty of Granada]], but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The [[Morisco]]s (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by [[Philip III of Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)|Philip III]].

[[Martin Luther]] published his famous 95 Theses in [[Wittenberg]] on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:

* The Bible only is infallible.
* Every Christian can interpret it.
* Human sins are so wrongful that no deed or merit, only God's grace, can lead to salvation.

In consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of [[indulgence]]s and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the [[Diet of Worms]] before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the [[Wartburg]] in the possessions of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], where he translated the [[New Testament]] into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.

However, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. [[Huldrych Zwingli]] preached reform in [[Zürich]] from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England]] was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and [[Thomas More]], who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.

In 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the [[Bern]]ese imposed the reformation on the canton of [[Vaud]] by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in [[Lausanne]] and destroyed all its art and statuary. [[John Calvin]], who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.

[[File:ReligiousFreedomStamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A U.S. postage stamp commemorating religious freedom and the [[Flushing Remonstrance]] ]]
The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when [[Mary I of England]] returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England]] was to restore the [[Church of England]] in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The [[King James Bible]] commissioned by King [[James I of England]] and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.

In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the [[Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day]] on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the "Michelade" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.

====Early steps and attempts in the way of tolerance====

Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and [[Utraquism|Utraquists]]. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the meantime, in Germany [[Philip Melanchthon]] drafted the [[Augsburg Confession]] as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the [[Peace of Augsburg]]. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.

In France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France]]. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The [[French Revolution]] then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Early laws and legal guarantees for religious freedom===

====Principality of Transylvania====
In 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's [[Edict of Torda]] declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of [[List of Hungarian monarchs|King of Hungary]], and [[List of Princes of Transylvania|Prince of Transylvania]] [[John Sigismund Zápolya]] (John II.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/103.html|title=History of Transylvania.

However, it was more than a religious tolerance; it declared the equality of the religions, prohibiting all kinds of acts from authorities or from simple people, which could harm other groups or people because of their religious beliefs. The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe. Therefore, the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lightbringers.net/content/story-francis-david-and-king-john-sigismund-establishment-transylvanian-unitarian-church|title=The Story of Francis David and King John Sigismund: The Establishment of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church|work=Lightbringers|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four religions ([[Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Unitarianism]]) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxs]], [[Sabbatarians]] and [[Anabaptists]] were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mult-kor.hu/20051125_erdely_es_a_habsburg_vallaspolitika_a_17_szazad_utolso_evtizedeiben "Kovács Kálmán: Erdély és a Habsburg valláspolitika a 17. század utolsó évtizedeiben"] ''Mult-Kor'' (25 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the [[Union of Utrecht]] (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), pp. 396–97&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Ciffs, N.J., p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding [[Plymouth Colony]] in Massachusetts in 1620. [[William Penn]], the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Poland====
[[File:Konfederacja Warszawska.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Original act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] 1573. The beginning of religious freedom in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]
The General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the [[Statute of Kalisz]] was issued by the Duke of [[Greater Poland]] [[Bolesław the Pious|Boleslaus the Pious]] on 8 September 1264 in [[Kalisz]]. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir III of Poland]] in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453 and [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]] in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinkoff|first=Nancy|title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-KmeZgY2hIC|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-930675-16-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f–KmeZgY2hIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=1539 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
{{Main article|Warsaw Confederation}}
The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Zamoyski, Adam. ''The Polish Way''.

===United States===
{{See also|Freedom of religion in the United States}}
Most of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] found it necessary to found a new colony in [[Rhode Island]] to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were the most active of the New England persecutors of [[Quakers]], and the persecuting spirit was shared by [[Plymouth Colony]] and the colonies along the [[Connecticut river]].&lt;ref name=PER/&gt; In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker [[Mary Dyer]], who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.&lt;ref name=PER&gt;Rogers, Horatio, 2009.

Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1634.&lt;ref name="Symbol of Enduring Freedom"&gt;Zimmerman, Mark, [http://issuu.com/columbia-magazine/docs/columbiamar10en?mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true Symbol of Enduring Freedom], p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen years later (1649), the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: "No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof." The Act allowed freedom of worship for all [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christians in Maryland, but [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] anyone who denied the divinity of [[Jesus]]. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J.

Williams gave the most profound argument: As faith is the free work of the [[Holy Spirit]], it cannot be forced on a person. Therefore, strict [[separation of church and state]] has to be kept.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte der Christenheit'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 943&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States in 1776. It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and the other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded the disestablishment of state churches{{snd}} [[Anglican]] and [[Congregationalist]]{{snd}} and the protection of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], written in 1779 by [[Thomas Jefferson]], proclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those sentiments also found expression in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the national constitution, part of the United States' [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] established the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.

===Canada===
{{Further information|Freedom of religion in Canada}}
Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide [[reasonable accommodation]] to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a [[Sikh]] [[turban]], when there is a ''[[bona fide]]'' occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a [[hard hat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-60-e.htm#a6 Freedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere. 2.2.2 Headcoverings].

===International===
On 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]]. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/36/a36r055.htm|title=A/RES/36/55.

However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states in its Article 14: ''"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.{{snd}} States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.{{snd}} Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr2int.htm Religious Rights – International Legal Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs===
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fb22.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal secular===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued in favour of freedom of religion.|alt=A man posing for a print]]
The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] noted in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'', that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country.  That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this [[free competition]] amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.

Smith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 643–49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hinduism===
Hinduism is one of the more broad-minded religions when it comes to religious freedom.&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/beliefs.htm|title=Hindu Beliefs|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It respects the right of everyone to reach God in their own way. [[Hindus]] believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal.

===Judaism===
[[File:Lesley and Rachel Detained.jpg|thumb|Women detained at Western Wall for wearing prayer shawls; photo from Women of the Wall]]
[[Judaism]] includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, [[Reform Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Humanistic Judaism]]. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as  peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Erica|last2=Galperin|first2=Misha|title=The Case for Jewish Peoplehood: Can We be One?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=978-1-58023-401-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC&amp;pg=PA71 71]|quote=The 'hood' is not only a geographic reference; it is a shared identity that may be characterized by joint assumptions, body language, certain expressions, and a host of familial-like behaviors that unite an otherwise dispirate groupe of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.

After the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not [[ Israeli apartheid| equal ]] with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.

Possibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.

The State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current{{clarify timeframe|date=January 2017}} government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem.  Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having "high" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Global restrictions on Religion (2009" http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women, including [[Anat Hoffman]], have been arrested at the [[Western Wall]] for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. [[Women of the Wall]] have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-arrest-5-women-at-Western-Wall-for-wearing-tallitot-309436 "Police arrest 5 women at Western Wall for wearing tallitot"] ''Jerusalem Post'' (11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the [[Knesset]] synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: "paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel."

Prior to this, [[Pope Pius IX]] had written a document called the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]. ''The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of "condemned propositions". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: "[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true" (15); "[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship"; "[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM|title=The Syllabus|author=[[Pope Pius IX]]|publisher=[[EWTN]]}}, [http://www.ewtn.com/ Global Catholic Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some [[Baptists]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Mainline (Protestant)|main line]] churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also affirms religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may"'', [http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng the eleventh Article of Faith].&lt;/ref&gt;

However others, such as African scholar [[Makau Mutua]], have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, "Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions."&lt;ref&gt;Mutua, Makau. 2004.

In their book ''[[Breaking India]]'', [[Rajiv Malhotra]] and [[Aravindan Neelakandan]] discussed the "US Church" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to "save" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise{{snd}} a "network" of organizations, individuals, and churches{{snd}} that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India.

[[Joel Spring]] has written about the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the ''Imperium romanum''. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be "civilized" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, "just as the ''civitas''; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human{{snd}} to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature{{snd}} one had now also to be Christian." After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis|author=Joel H.

[[Conversion to Islam]] is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert  from Islam to another religion. Certain [[Muslim-majority countries]] are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries{{who|date=February 2012}} having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United States |first=Department of State|title=2010 International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/index.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012|reason=this may be supportable, but I don't see clear support in the source cited}} 

Islamic theologians{{Who|date=October 2009}} quote the [[Qur'an]] ({{Cite quran|2|256|expand=no|q=There is no compulsion in religion}} and {{Cite quran|109|1|end=6|expand=no|q=Say: O you who reject faith, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship...To you be your religion, and to me be mine}}, i.e., Sura [[Al-Kafirun]]) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.

{{Cite quran|2|190|end=194|style=nosup}}, referring to the war against Pagans during the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[Medina]], indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them ([[right of self-defense]]) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.

In Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that [[Muhammad]] to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, "Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good." In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.

In addition, {{Cite quran|5|3|style=nosup}}, which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and {{Cite quran|53|38|end=39|style=nosup}} states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the [[afterlife]]. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/789970_3b7987b974024c298f48d68986fe0c80.pdf Islam and Belief: At Home with Religious Freedom], Abdullah Saeed (2014): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; "The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.{{cn span|However, many Muslims believe that this hadith was written in the context of war and therefore Prophet Muhammad stipulated that whichever Muslim rejects his religion, leaves from the main body of Muslims and betrays the Muslims in war should be executed as a punishment for his treachery towards the community of Muslims.

===Changing religion===
{{Main article|Religious conversion}}
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion ([[apostasy]]), and the right to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51555.htm|title=US State Department report on Greece|publisher=State.gov|date=8 November 2005|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar [[Makau Mutua]] criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls "proselytizing universalist faiths" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.&amp;nbsp;652):

{{Quote|...the (human) rights regime incorrectly assumes a level playing field by requiring that African religions compete in the marketplace of ideas. The rights corpus not only forcibly imposes on African religions the obligation to compete{{snd}} a task for which as nonproselytizing, noncompetitive creeds they are not historically fashioned{{snd}} but also protects the evangelizing religions in their march towards universalization ... it seems inconceivable that the human rights regime would have intended to protect the right of certain religions to destroy others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutua  |first=Makau |title=Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook |year=2004 |publisher= Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief|isbn=978-90-04-13783-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct quote should have page number.

Some Indian scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf|format=PDF|title=Re-examining Religious Freedom|first=Sankrant|last=Sanu|publisher=Manushi|year=2006|accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]], a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online2.church123.com/attach.asp?clientURN=christiansolidarityworldwide2&amp;attachFileName=09ae125dba76986113441ef1463aca8e.attach&amp;attachOriginalFileName=CSW_Briefing_Apostasy_April_2008.pdf|title=No place to call home|date=29 April 2008|publisher=Christian Solidarity Worldwide|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostasy in Islam====
{{Main article|Apostasy in Islam|Takfir|Mutaween}}
[[File:Rechtsgutachten betr Apostasie im Islam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Legal opinion on apostasy by the [[Fatwa]] committee at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], the highest Islamic institution in the world, concerning the case of a man who converted to Christianity: "Since he left Islam, he will be invited to express his regret. If he does not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the Islamic law."]]
In Islam, apostasy is called "''ridda''" ("turning back") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a "''murtad fitri''" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a "''murtad milli''" (apostate from the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }} from "Leaving Islam: Apostates speak out" by Ibn Warraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be [[Apostasy in Islam#Execution|put to death]] unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], and [[Hanbali]] schools of [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni [[Hanafi]] school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Heffening, W.|article=Murtadd| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online Edition|editor1=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an [[imam]].&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd" /&gt; At the same time, all schools of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adbul Qadir Oudah|title=Kitab Bhavan|year=1999|isbn=81-7151-273-9|publisher=Kitab Bhavan|location=New Delhi}}, Volume II. pp. 258–62; Volume IV. pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. A. Rahman|authorlink=S. A. Rahman|title=Punishment of Apostasy in Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC|year=2007|publisher=The Other Press|isbn=978-983-9541-49-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=PA132 132–42]|chapter=Summary and Conclusions|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=Pa132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though [[polygamy]] is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early [[LDS Church]] and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of [[psychedelic substance]]s by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.

In 1955, Chief Justice of California [[Roger J. Traynor]] neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: "Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not."&lt;ref&gt;''Pencovic v. Pencovic'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/45C2d97.htm 45 Cal. 2d 67] (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case of the ''[[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]'' in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and Procedure'', Daniel E. Hall. Cengage Learning, July 2008. p. 266.

In 2015, [[Kim Davis]], a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]]. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the ''[[Miller v. Davis]]'' lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] to state that "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=15 October 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale|title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education.

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/epperson-v-arkansas|title=Epperson V Arkansas - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the [[Boston martyrs]], a group of [[Quakers]] executed by the [[Puritans]] on [[Boston Common]] for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] between 1659–1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margery Post Abbott|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7088-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US proclaimed 16 January Religious Freedom Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060113-9.html Religious Freedom Day, 2006 – A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/library/hot_releases/January_16_2001_6.html Religious Freedom Day, 2001 – Proclamation by the President of the United States of America 15 January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern concerns==
In its 2011 annual report, the ''[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]]'' designated fourteen nations as "countries of particular concern". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were [[Rohingya people|Burma]], China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission's watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=10154|title=US commission names 14 worst violators of religious freedom|accessdate=11 July 2011|publisher=Christianity Today|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;^ {{Cite press release|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3595|title=USCIRF Identifies World's Worst Religious Freedom Violators: Egypt Cited for First Time|publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===
[[File:Religiousfreedom.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Freedom of religion by country (Pew Research Center study, 2009). Light yellow: low restriction; red: very high restriction on freedom of religion.]]
The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the [[United States State Department]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="prc-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2" /&gt; This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of [[communal violence]] and [[Religious terrorism|religion-related terrorism]].

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt;

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of ''government'' and ''social'' restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the ''overall'' highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high ''government'' restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to ''social'' hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in ''social'' hostilities but moderate in terms of ''government'' actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center]]. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the "very high" category of social hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx|title=Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion|date=20 September 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-05 |title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country |year=2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{God}}
The '''gender of God''' can be viewed as a literal or as an [[allegory|allegorical]] aspect of a [[deity]].  In [[polytheistic]] religions, gods are more likely to have literal [[sex]]es which would enable them to interact with each other, and even with humans, in a sexual way.

In most [[monotheistic]] religions, one cannot apply a [[gender]] to [[God]] in the usual sense, as God's attributes cannot be compared to those of any other being. Thus, the idea of a "divine gender" is ultimately considered an [[analogy]], used by humans in order to better relate to the [[concept of God]], with no sexual connotation.

Although God is an intangible spirit in many religions and therefore is thought to have no gender, debate over their "actual" [[sex]] nevertheless has passionately raged in recent decades. The preponderance of references to God in both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments are in the context of a masculine reference, often "Father". However, there are a significant number of feminine allegorical references to God, most often in some maternal role.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Gender of God in Judaism}}
Although the gender of God in Judaism is referred to in the [[Tanakh]] with masculine imagery and grammatical forms, traditional Jewish philosophy does not attribute the concept of sex to God, but does attribute gender.&lt;ref&gt;"G-d has no body, no genitalia, therefore the very idea that G-d is male or female is patently absurd. Although in the Talmudic part of the Torah and especially in Kabalah G-d is referred to under the name '[[Shekhinah|Sh'chinah]]' - which is feminine, this is only to accentuate the fact that all the creation and nature are actually in the receiving end in reference to the creator and as no part of the creation can perceive the Creator outside of nature, it is adequate to refer to the divine presence in feminine form. We refer to G-d using masculine terms simply for convenience's sake, because Hebrew has no neutral gender; G-d is no more male than a table is." [http://www.jewfaq.org/g-d.htm Judaism 101]. "The fact that we always refer to God as 'He' is also not meant to imply that the concept of sex or gender applies to God." Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, ''The Aryeh Kaplan Reader'', Mesorah Publications (1983), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Jewish [[aggadah|aggadic literature]] and [[Jewish mysticism]] do treat God as gendered. The ways in which God is gendered have also changed across time, with some modern Jewish thinkers viewing God as outside of the [[gender binary]].

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Cima da Conegliano, God the Father.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[God the Father]], [[Cima da Conegliano]], {{circa|1510–1517}}]]
{{Main|Gender of God in Christianity}}
Most [[Christianity|Christian groups]] conceive of God as [[Trinity|Triune]], having the belief that [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and God the [[Holy Spirit]] are distinct persons, but one being that is wholly God.&lt;ref&gt;Grudem, Wayne A. 1994. ''Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine.'' Leicester, England: Inter-Varsity Press; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan. Page 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Person}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God the Son ([[Jesus]] [[Christ]]), having been incarnated as a human man, is clearly masculine.  Classical western philosophy believes that God lacks a literal sex because it would be impossible for God to have a body (a prerequisite for sex).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|year=1274|location=Part 1, Question 3, Article 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=of Hippo |first=Augustine |title=Confessions |year=c. 397 |location=Book 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Classical western philosophy states that God should be referred to (in most contexts) as masculine by analogy. It justifies this by pointing to God's relationship with the world as begetter of the world and revelation (i.e. analogous to an active instead of receptive role in sexual intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=David|title=Why Matter Matters: Philosophical and Scriptural Reflections on the Sacraments|year=2002|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|location=Chapter Five: Why Male Priests?|isbn=978-1931709347 |author2=Peter Kreeft|authorlink=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others interpret God as neither male nor female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] #239 specifically states that "God is neither man nor woman: he is God".&lt;ref&gt;David Bordwell, 2002, ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'',Continuum International Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-86012-324-8}} page 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCCs239"&gt;"Deum humanam sexuum transcendere distinctionem.

==== Gender of the Holy Spirit ====
{{Main|Gender of the Holy Spirit}}
In [[Hebrew language]], in [[rabbinic literature]], the [[divine presence]] of God, the [[Holy Spirit]], the [[Shekhinah]] is [[feminine]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The New Testament also refers to the [[Holy Spirit]] as masculine in a number of places, where the masculine Greek word "Paraclete" occurs, for "Comforter", most clearly in the [[Gospel of John]], chapters 14 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;Nestle and others, ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th ed., (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgeselschaft, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; These texts were particularly significant when Christians were debating whether the New Testament teaches that the Holy Spirit is a fully divine person, or some kind of "force". All major English Bible translations have retained the masculine pronoun for the Spirit, as in John 16:13. Although it has been noted that in the original Greek, in some parts of John's Gospel, the neuter Greek word for "it" is also used for the Spirit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== Islam ===
{{Main|God in Islam}}
The oneness of God is of primary importance in the [[Quran]] and Islam. In Qur'an, Allah is most often referred to with the pronouns ''Hu'' or ''Huwa'', and although these are commonly translated as ''him'', they can also be translated gender-neutrally, as ''them''. This is also true of the feminine equivalent, ''Hiya''. Qur'an 112:3–4 states: "He begets not, nor is He begotten. And none is like Him [Them]."
Other references include the first person pronoun, and the [[relative pronoun]] ''ma'' (''that which''), as in the phrase "the heavens and that which created them" (Qur'an 91:5).

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main|God and gender in Hinduism}}
In [[Hinduism]], there are diverse approaches to conceptualizing God and gender. Many Hindus focus upon impersonal [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] ([[Brahman]]) which is genderless. Other Hindu traditions conceive God as [[Androgyny|androgynous]] (both female and male), alternatively as either male or female, while cherishing gender [[henotheism]], that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.&lt;ref&gt;John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, {{ISBN|978-0809138456}}, pages 74-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|What is Hinduism?|page=PR17}}, Hinduism Today, Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakti]] tradition conceives of God as a female. Other [[Bhakti]] traditions of Hinduism have both male and female gods. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine who is often a [[devi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adishakti.org/forum/concept_of_shakti_hinduism_as_a_liberating_force_for_women_1-18-2005.htm The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest of the Hindu scriptures is the [[Rigveda]] (2nd millennium BC). The first word of the Rigveda is the name [[Agni]], the god of fire, to whom many of the vedic hymns are addressed, along with [[Indra]] the warrior. Agni and Indra are both male divinities.

The Rigveda refers to a creator ([[Hiranyagarbha]] or [[Prajapati]]), distinct from Agni and Indra. This creator is identified with [[Brahma]] (not to be confused with [[Brahman]], the first cause), born of Vishnu's navel, in later scriptures. Hiranyagarbha and Prajapati are male divinities, as is Brahma (who has a female consort, [[Saraswati]]).
[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rigveda]]
There are many other gods in the Rigveda.&lt;ref name="Witzel"&gt;
[[Michael Witzel]], '[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/EJVS-7-3.pdf Autochthonous Aryans?] The Evidence from Old Indian and Iranian Texts', ''[[Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies]]'' '''7''' (2001): 1–118.&lt;/ref&gt;
They are "not simple forces of nature", and possess "complex character and their own mythology".&lt;ref name=Witzel /&gt;
They include goddesses of water (Āpaḥ) and dawn (Uṣas), and the complementary pairing of Father Heaven and Mother Earth.&lt;ref name=Witzel /&gt;
However, they are all "subservient to the abstract, but active positive 'force of truth'" ([[Rta]]),
"which pervades the universe and all actions of the gods and humans."&lt;ref name=Witzel /&gt;
This force is sometimes mediated or represented by moral gods ([[Aditya|Āditya]] such as [[Varuna|Varuṇa]]) or even Indra.&lt;ref name=Witzel /&gt;
The Āditya are male and Rta is personified as masculine in later scriptures (see also [[Dharma]]).

In some Hindu philosophical traditions, [[God]] is depersonalized as the quality-less [[Nirguna Brahman]], the fundamental life force of the universe. However, theism itself is central to Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;
"Religious theism which is central to Hinduism." Robert Lawson Slater, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1385227 Review] of Philip H. Ashby ''History and Future of Religious Thought: Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam''. ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' '''4''' (1964): 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many Hindus focus upon God in the neutral form,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Brahman]] being of neuter gender grammatically, there are prominent Hindu traditions that conceive God as female, even as the source of the male form of God, such as the [[Shakta]] denomination. Hinduism, especially of the [[Samkhya]] school, views the creation of the cosmos as the result of the play of two radically distinct principles: the feminine matter ([[Prakriti]]) and the masculine spirit ([[Purusha]]). Prakriti is the primordial matter which is present before the cosmos becomes manifest. Prakriti is seen as being "the power of nature, both animate and inanimate. As such, nature is seen as dynamic energy" (Rae, 1994). Prakriti is originally passive, immobile and pure potentiality by nature . Only through her contact with the kinetic Purusha she unfolds into the diverse forms before us. The idea of Prakriti/Purusha leads to the concept of the Divine Consort. Almost every [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon has a feminine consort ([[devi]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adishakti.org/forum/concept_of_shakti_hinduism_as_a_liberating_force_for_women_1-18-2005.htm The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
{{Main|Gender of God in Sikhism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
The [[Guru Granth]] consistently refers to God as "He" and "Father". However, it also says that God is indescribable. Thus, God in Sikhism has no gender. The [[Akal Purakh]] ("Timeless Being") is referred to as one of the gender, simply because the Granth is written in north Indian Indo-Aryan languages ([[Sant Bhasha|mixture]] of Punjabi and dialects of Hindi) which have no neutral gender.

It is described as energy that prevails throughout the universe.

== Animist religions ==
Animist religions are common among oral societies, many of which still exist in the 21st century. Typically, natural forces and [[shaman]] spiritual guides feature in these religions, rather than fully fledged personal divinities with established personalities. It is in polytheism that such deities are found. Animist religions often, but not always, attribute gender to spirits considered to permeate the world and its events. Polytheistic religions, however, almost always attribute gender to their gods, though a few notable divinities are associated with various forms of [[epicene]] characteristics—gods that manifest alternatingly as male and female, gods with one male and one female "face", and gods whose most distinctive characteristic is their unknown gender.&lt;ref&gt;
"We are yet more strongly reminded by the two-fold nature of Phanes of the epicene god-heads, who occur frequently in the Babylonian pantheon."
Gauranga Nath Banerjee, ''Hellenism in Ancient India'', (Read Books, 2007), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carol P. Christ]] is the author of the widely reprinted essay "[http://www.goddessariadne.org/#!why-women-need-the-goddess-part-1/cufo Why Women Need the Goddess]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= per Carol P Christ biography for Signs Out of Time Project|url=http://www.belili.org/marija/bios/carol_christ.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme goddess. This essay was presented as the keynote address to an audience of over 500 at the "Great Goddess Re-emerging" conference at the [[University of Santa Cruz]] in the spring of 1978, and was first published in ''Heresies: The Great Goddess Issue'' (1978), pgs. 8-13.&lt;ref name="goddessariadne.org"&gt;http://www.goddessariadne.org/#!why-women-need-the-goddess-part-1/cufo&lt;/ref&gt; Carol P.

{{Primary sources|date=February 2016}}

The term '''Great Work''' ('''''magnum opus''''') is a term used in [[Hermeticism]] and in certain occult traditions and religions such as [[Thelema]].&lt;ref&gt;Redgrove, Herbert Stanley, [http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=RedAlch.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=43&amp;division=div2 ''Alchemy: Ancient and Modern'', Section 43: Bernard Trévisan]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Copyright 1999, by the Rector and Visitors of the [[University of Virginia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Work signifies the spiritual path towards self-transcendence in its entirety. This is the process of bringing unconscious complexes into the conscious awareness, in order to integrate them back into oneself.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swan|first=Theresa|date=2010|title=INCORPORATING ALCHEMY INTO CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF

==In Hermeticism==
{{Main|Hermeticism}}
[[Eliphas Levi]] (1810–1875), one of the first modern [[ceremonial magic]]ians and inspiration for the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], discussed the Great Work at length, expanding it from the purely [[alchemical]] towards the more spiritual:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, there exists in nature [[Spiritual energy|a force which is immeasurably more powerful than steam]], and by means of which a single man, who knows how to adapt and direct it, might upset and alter the face of the world. This force was known to the ancients; it consists in a universal agent having equilibrium for its supreme law, while its direction is concerned immediately with the great arcanum of transcendental magic... This agent...is precisely that which the [[adepts]] of the middle ages denominated the [[Prima Materia|first matter]] of the Great Work. The [[Gnostics]] represented it as the fiery body of the Holy Spirit; it was the object of adoration in the secret rites of the [[Sabbath]] and the [[Temple]], under the hieroglyphic figure of [[Baphomet]] or the [[Androgyne of Mendes]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further defined it as such:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Great Work is, before all things, the creation of man by himself, that is to say, the full and entire conquest of his faculties and his future; it is especially the perfect emancipation of his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== In Alchemy and Psychology ==
The famous Alexandrian alchemist Zosimos described the purpose of alchemy as the perfection of the alchemist such that they could come into contact with the divinity within themselves&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Serena|date=2015|title=Fire in the depths of Kundalini yoga and alchemy: A depth psychological guide to transformation|url=|journal=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which in alchemy is represented as the Philosopher's Stone.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swan|first=Theresa|date=2010|title=INCORPORATING ALCHEMY INTO CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF
TRANSFORMATION:
TRANSPERSONAL EMBODIMENT THROUGH THE CONIUNCTIO|url=|journal=California Institute of Integral Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In daoist alchemy, the accomplishment of the Great Work is called the cultivation of the elixir, and deals with the same idea, which is realization of the innate divine nature within.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45843050|title=Understanding reality : a Taoist alchemical classic|last=century.|first=Zhang, Boduan, active 10th century-11th|date=1987|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|others=Liu, Yiming, 1734-1821., Cleary, Thomas F., 1949-|isbn=0585323852|location=Honolulu|oclc=45843050}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daoist alchemical process is meant to take the practitioner from a state of doing to a state of non-doing, in which they can realize their own divine nature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendrischke|first=Barbara|date=2016-12|title=New Publications On Daoist Internal Alchemy: Golden Elixir Press|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rsr.12637|journal=Religious Studies Review|language=en|volume=42|issue=4|pages=235–240|doi=10.1111/rsr.12637|issn=0319-485X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divine nature is called the Great Ultimate, which signifies a complete totality which lacks nothing and contains everything.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In western alchemy, the Great Ultimate is symbolized by the Ouroboros, a snake eating its own tail. This symbol shows the infinite nature of the divine, which has no beginning or end and is in constant change but never loses or gains anything.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The path to attainment of the Great Work, or union with the Great Ultimate is described through alchemical metaphor. The physical techniques of transmuting metals, dyes, and alloys in alchemical texts serve as an allegory for internal, psychological processes.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The alchemical idea that a metal must be reduced to its most basic form in order to be transmuted into gold is an allegory for the psychological idea that the rigid personality must be broken down to its basic form in order for any transformation of the personality to occur.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This idea of first breaking something down and then reconstructing it is also described by the alchemical maxim ''Solve et Coagula'', meaning dissolve and recombine, and it serves as a central tenant of the Great Work.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  The idea is further reinforced by the alchemical image of the phoenix, which dies and then is reborn from its ashes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cesarotti|first=William|date=2011|title=Tending the Fire: The Alchemy of Psychotherapy|url=|journal=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemy is known as the art of transformation, and this formula of ''Solve et Coagula'' is the underlying formula of transformation. This deals with transformation in the physical world, but it also deals with the transformation of the self. The ''Solve'' stage of the work of the transformation of the self occurs when the conscious ego meets the unconscious. The unconscious is much larger than the ego, and because of this the ego begins to dissolve. During this stage of the inner alchemical work, the old, rigid personality ceases to function when it is met with the vastness of the unconscious. This experience can lead to great confusion and fear, in what the alchemists call the phase of ''Nigredo'', or blackness. This period of blackness during which the ego is dissolved is painful, but necessary for any growth to occur. After the ego is broken down through confronting its shadow, it can then be re-formed in a new way, which is represented by the alchemical process ''Coagula.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There is another perspective of the path to the accomplishment of the Great Work. Whereas the previous perspective deals with duality as a vehicle to transformation of the personality, this perspective deals with the transcendence of duality altogether, in order to unite with the Great Ultimate. The daoists say that the perfection of the Great Ultimate, whose nature is unity, is obscured by Yin and Yang, or duality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, the accomplishment of the Great Work (which is the restoration of the wholeness of the Great Ultimate), occurs from the unification of opposite principles, which are represented in daoism as Yin and Yang.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/77000587|title=Great clarity : Daoism and alchemy in early medieval China|last=Fabrizio.|first=Pregadio,|date=2005|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=1429415991|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=77000587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same idea of the uniting of opposite principles is seen in western alchemy as well, where the attainment of the Great Work is described as the unification between the sulphur (which represents the masculine principle) and salt (which represents the feminine principle). It is also seen in yogic science as well, which describes the unification of the masculine channel for life energy, called the pingala, with the feminine channel, called the ida.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In western alchemy this unification of opposites is called ''coniunctio'', which is the alchemical marriage, or union of opposite principles which leads to the creation of the Philosopher's Stone, a metaphor for accomplishing the Great Work.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The esoteric, internal meaning of uniting opposites lies in the transcendence of perceived dualities within the psyche. In ego formation, some things are rejected, and pushed into the unconscious, whereas others are accepted and allowed to be a part of the conscious self. Because of this, a split in the psyche occurs, where the Self becomes dissociated from its shadow. The alchemical process is the process of undoing this split by integrating what has become made unconscious with the conscious self, and thus becoming whole. This is the essence of self-realization - the realization that all is a part of the self, and there is nothing outside of the self. It only appears that way because it has been made unconscious.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This is the essence of alchemy - the unification of the conscious with the unconscious so that the self can become whole.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==In Thelema==
{{Main|Thelemic mysticism}}

Within [[Thelema]], the Great Work is generally defined as those spiritual practices leading to the [[mysticism|mystical union]] of the Self and the All. Its founder, author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] re-iterated the idea of the unification of opposites, saying in his book ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Great Work is the uniting of opposites.  It may mean the uniting of the soul with God, of the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] with the [[macrocosm]], of the female with the male, of the ego with the non-ego."&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''[[Magick Without Tears]],'' "Letter C." New Falcon Publications, 1991. {{ISBN|1-56184-018-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the Great Work can describe specifically the moment of union between the self and the divine, it can also deal with the spiritual process in its entirety. Crowley also speaks on the Great Work as the conscious process of spiritual growth. He Crowley described his own personal Great Work in the introduction to ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In my third year at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], I devoted myself consciously to the Great Work, understanding thereby the Work of becoming a Spiritual Being, free from the constraints, accidents, and deceptions of material existence.&lt;ref name=book4&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;The aspect of conscious devotion to the Great Work is very important.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Serena|date=2015|title=Fire in the depths of Kundalini yoga and alchemy: A depth psychological guide to transformation|url=|journal=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By purposefully, consciously turning inward and choosing to pursue self-realization, the seeker seals themself in their very own ''vas hermeticum'', their very own alchemical vessel. This attitude of deliberate turning within is necessary for the Great Work. By consciously devoting oneself to the Great Work, and therefore sealing oneself within one's own ''vas hermeticum'', the inner heat of psychic struggle which is generated from this aids in the dissolution of ego boundaries and the integration of what is unconscious.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swan|first=Theresa|date=2010|title=INCORPORATING ALCHEMY INTO CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF

Within the system of the [[A∴A∴|A∴A∴ magical Order]] the Great Work of the Probationer Grade is considered to be the pursuit of self-knowledge to, as Crowley said in ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'', "obtain the knowledge of the nature and powers of my own being."&lt;ref name=confessions&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]],'' Penguin, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-14-019189-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Crowley continues, the Great Work should also be something that is integrated into the daily life of all:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I insist that in private life men should not admit their passions to be an end, indulging them and so degrading themselves to the level of the other animals, or suppressing them and creating neuroses. I insist that every thought, word and deed should be consciously devoted to the service of the Great Work. 'Whatsoever ye do, whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God'.&lt;ref name=confessions /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Crowley often discussed the idea of "succeeding" or "accomplishing" in the Great Work, he also recognized that the process is ongoing. From his ''[[Little Essays Toward Truth]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Quest of the [[Holy Grail]], the Search for the [[Philosopher's stone|Stone of the Philosophers]]—by whatever name we choose to call the Great Work—is therefore endless. Success only opens up new avenues of brilliant possibility. Yea, verily, and Amen! the task is tireless and its joys without bounds; for the whole Universe, and all that in it is, what is it but the infinite playground of the Crowned and Conquering Child, of the insatiable, the innocent, the ever-rejoicing Heir of Space and Eternity, whose name is MAN?&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''[[Little Essays Toward Truth]].'' [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/littleessays/man.html "Man."] New Falcon Publications, 1991. {{ISBN|1-56184-000-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This idea of an endless Great Work is also seen within classic alchemical perspectives. The idea of circumambulation, represented by the Ouroboros (a snake swallowing its own tail), suggests an endless cyclical process of first dissolving and then re-creating the personality, refining it each time. This idea is also seen in depth psychology as it is related to alchemy, where the Self continually, cyclically faces what it has repressed in order to integrate what has been repressed into itself.&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swan|first=Theresa|date=2010|title=INCORPORATING ALCHEMY INTO CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF
TRANSFORMATION:

The term also appears in the Benediction at the end of Crowley's [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]], where the Priest blesses the congregation with the words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The LORD bring you to the accomplishment of your true Wills, the Great Work, the [[Summum bonum|Summum Bonum]], True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.&lt;ref name=book4 /&gt;

[[File:Masaccio chapelle Brancacci.png|thumb|right|320px|[[Jesus]] and nine of the [[Twelve Apostles]] depicted with "Floating" disk haloes in perspective (detail from ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'', illustrating {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:24-27|KJV}}, by [[Masaccio]], 1424, [[Brancacci Chapel]]).]]

A '''halo''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἅλως}}, ''halōs'';&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|halo}} {{LSJ|a(/lws|ἅλως|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''nimbus''', '''[[Aureola|aureole]]''', '''glory''', or '''gloriole''') is a crown of light rays, circle or disk of light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/halo-art|title=halo – art|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that surrounds a person in art.  They have been used in the [[iconography]] of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures, and have at various periods also been used in images of rulers or heroes.  In the sacred art of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], among other religions, sacred persons may be depicted with a halo in the form of a circular glow, or flames in [[Asian art]], around the head or around the whole body—this last one is often called a [[mandorla]].  Halos may be shown as almost any color or combination of colors, but are most often depicted as golden, yellow or white when representing light or red when representing flames.

Further afield, [[Sumer]]ian religious literature frequently speaks of ''melam'' (loaned into [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''melammu''), a "brilliant, visible glamour which is exuded by gods, heroes, sometimes by kings, and also by temples of great holiness and by gods' symbols and emblems."&lt;ref&gt;J. Black and A. Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotmia'' (Austin, 1992) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Asian art ==
[[File:Menander II with nimbate Nike.jpg|thumb|350px|Coin of [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander II]] (90–85 BCE), displaying [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with a halo on the reverse.]]
The halo and the [[aureola]] have been widely used in Indian art, particularly in [[Buddhist]] iconography&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/publications/pdfs/asia/divided/d1_Art_S_Asia.pdf|title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Art of South Asia|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has appeared since at least the 1st century AD; the Kushan [[Bimaran casket]] in the [[British Museum]] is dated 60AD (at least between 30BC and 200AD).  The rulers of the [[Kushan Empire]] were perhaps the earliest to give themselves haloes on their coins, and the nimbus in art may have originated in Central Asia and spread both east and west.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt;

In Chinese and Japanese [[Buddhist art]] the halo has also been used since the earliest periods in depicting the image of [[Amitabha|Amitabha Buddha]] and others. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses haloes and aureoles of many types, drawing from both Indian and Chinese traditions, extensively in statues and [[Thangka]] paintings of Buddhist saints such as [[Milarepa]] and [[Padmasambhava]] and deities.  Different coloured haloes have specific meanings: orange for monks, green for the Buddha and other more elevated beings,&lt;ref&gt;including the [[Qianlong Emperor]] – see note below. Rhie, Marylin and Thurman, Robert (eds):''Wisdom And Compassion: The Sacred Art of Tibet'', p. 99, &amp; passim, 2000, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8109-2526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly figures have both a halo for the head, and another circular one for the body, the two often intersecting somewhere around the head or neck. Thin lines of gold often radiate outwards or inwards from the rim of the halo, and sometimes a whole halo is made up of these.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, pp 77, 176, 197 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In India the head halo is called ''Prabhamandala'' or ''Siras-cakra'', while the full body halo is ''Prabhavali''.&lt;ref&gt; Gopinatha  Rao, T. A. (1985). [https://archive.org/details/cu31924071128825 Elements of Hindu Iconography].  pps. 31-32. [[Motilal Banarsidass]]. {{ISBN|9788120808782}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate haloes and especially aureoles also appear in [[Hindu]] sculpture, where they tend to develop into architectural frames in which the original idea can be hard to recognise. [[Theravada]] Buddhism and [[Jainism]] did not use the halo for many centuries, but later adopted it, though less thoroughly than other religious groups.

In Asian art, the nimbus is often imagined as consisting not just of light, but of flames.  This type seems to first appear in Chinese bronzes of which the earliest surviving examples date from before 450.&lt;ref&gt;No doubt, as later, the same motif appeared in paintings, but none survive from this early.  L Sickman &amp; A Soper, "The Art and Architecture of China", Pelican History of Art, 3rd ed 1971, pp 86-7, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), LOC 70-125675&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the flames may be very formalized, as in the regular little flames on the ring aureole surrounding many [[Chola]] bronzes and other classic Hindu sculptures of divinities, or very prominent, as with the more realistic flames, and sometimes smoke, shown rising to a peak behind many Tibetan Buddhist depictions of the "wrathful aspect" of divinities, and also in Persian miniatures of the classic period.  This type is also very rarely found, and on a smaller scale, in medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;See Didron&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}  Sometimes a thin line of flames rise up from the edges of a circular halo in Buddhist examples.&lt;ref&gt;Often in paintings from the [[Dunhuang caves]], see Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" , 1990, British Museum publications, nos 42, 53, 54 etc, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tibetan paintings the flames are often shown as blown by a wind, usually from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

Halos are found in [[Islamic art]] from various places and periods, especially in [[Persian miniature]]s and [[Moghul]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art influenced by them.  Flaming halos derived from Buddhist art surround angels, and similar ones are often seen [[Depiction of Muhammad|around Muhammad]] and other sacred human figures.  From the early 17th century, plainer round haloes appear in portraits of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperors]] and subsequently [[Rajput]] and [[Sikh]] rulers;&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt; despite the more local precedents art historians believe the Mughals took the motif from European religious art, though it expresses a Persian idea of the God-given [[charisma]] of kingship that is far older.&lt;ref&gt;Crill &amp; Jariwala, 29 and note&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] avoided using halos for the [[sultan]]s, despite their title as [[Caliph]], and they are only seen on Chinese emperors if they are posing as Buddhist religious figures, as some felt entitled to do.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the [[Qianlong Emperor]] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Qianlong_Emperor_in_Buddhist_Dress.jpg the Qianlong Emperor in Buddhist Dress], and his father.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo1.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Apollo]] with a radiant halo in a Roman floor [[mosaic]] (late 2nd century, [[El Djem]], Tunisia)]]

The halo represents an [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] or the glow of sanctity which was conventionally drawn encircling the head. It first appeared in the culture of Hellenistic Greece and [[Rome]], possibly related to the [[Zoroastrian]] ''hvarena'' – "glory" or "divine lustre" – which marked the Persian kings, and may have been imported with [[Mithraism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=E. H.|date=1941|title=The Halo: A Further Enquiry into Its Origin|jstor=868232|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|volume=78|issue=457|pages=123–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Roman paintings have largely disappeared, save some [[fresco]] decorations, the haloed figure remains fresh in Roman mosaics. In a 2nd-century AD Roman floor mosaic preserved at [[Le Bardo|Bardo]], Tunisia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/Z2.4.html Illustrated].&lt;/ref&gt; a haloed [[Poseidon]] appears in his chariot drawn by [[hippocamp]]s. Significantly, the [[triton (mythology)|triton]] and [[nereid]] who accompany the sea-god are not haloed.

In a late 2nd century AD floor mosaic from Thysdrus, [[El Djem]],   (''illustration'') [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] is identified by his effulgent halo.  Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Illustration |accessdate= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BC to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964; Yalouris 1980).  Sometime after this mosaic was executed, the Emperor began to be depicted with a halo,&lt;ref&gt;Initially only dead and therefore deified Emperors were haloed, later the living [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11080b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; which was not abandoned when they became Christian; initially Christ only had one when shown on a throne as [[Christ in Majesty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11080b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Nimbus|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Christian art ==

[[File:ChristAsSol.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Early pre-4th century Mosaic of [[Sol Invictus]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1967 [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]], a standard library reference, in an article on ''[[Constantine the Great]]'': "Besides, the Sol Invictus had been adopted by the Christians in a Christian sense, as demonstrated in the Christ as [[Helios|Apollo-Helios]] in a [[mausoleum]] (c. 250) discovered beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's in the Vatican]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in Mausoleum M in the pre-4th-century necropolis [http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/Scavi.htm beneath] [[St Peter's Basilica]] – interpreted by many as representing Christ.]]

The halo was incorporated into [[Early Christian art]] sometime in the 4th century with the earliest [[icon]]ic images of Christ, initially the only figure shown with one (together with his symbol, the [[Lamb of God]]).  Initially the halo was regarded by many as a representation of the ''[[Logos]]'' of Christ, his divine nature, and therefore in very early (before 500) depictions of Christ before his Baptism by [[John the Baptist|John]] he tends not to be shown with a halo, it being a matter of debate whether his ''Logos'' was innate from conception (the Orthodox view), or acquired at Baptism (the [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] view).  At this period he is also shown as a child or youth in ''Baptisms'', though this may be a hieratic rather than an age-related representation.&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 135, figs 150-53, 346-54. {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kölner Meister eines Evangelienbuches 001.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' and ''[[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]'' of Christ, with cross haloes; the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]], [[angel]]s and [[prophet]]s have plain ones. (1025–50, [[Cologne]]).]]

A '''cruciform halo''', that is to say a cross within, or extending beyond, a halo is used to represent the persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], especially [[Jesus]], and especially in medieval art.  In Byzantine and Orthodox images, inside each of the bars of the cross in Christ's halo is one of the [[Greek letter]]s Ο Ω Ν, making up {{lang|grc|[[I Am that I Am|ὁ ὢν]]}}—"ho ōn", literally, "the Existing One"—indicating the [[divinity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Christian Symbols |url=http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |publisher=Catholic Biblical Association of Canada |accessdate=20 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223120343/http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |archivedate=23 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least in later Orthodox images, each bar of this cross is composed of three lines, symbolising the [[dogma]]s of the Trinity, the [[Divine simplicity|oneness of God]] and the [[Christology|two natures of Christ]].

In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-40) the juvenile Christ has a four-armed cross either on top of his head in the radius of the nimbus, or placed above the radius, but this is unusual.  In the same mosaics the accompanying angels have haloes (as, in a continuation of the Imperial tradition, does [[Herod the Great|King Herod]]), but not [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].  Occasionally other figures have crossed haloes, such as the seven doves representing the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] in the 11th century [[Codex Vyssegradensis]] [[Tree of Jesse]] (where [[Jesse]] and [[Isaiah]] also have plain haloes, as do the [[Ancestors of Christ]] in other miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs 20-22, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, triangular haloes are sometimes given to [[God the Father]] to represent the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo Nationalgallery.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423223708/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo |date=23 April 2007 }},  Late 15th century reliefs by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] on the portal of San Petronio, Bologna are an early example of the triangular halo. According to Didron, Adolphe Napoléon: ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages'', London, 1851, Vol 2, p30, this is "extremely rare in France, but common enough in Italy and Greece&lt;/ref&gt;  When he is represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|hand emerging from a cloud]], this may be given a halo.

Plain round haloes are typically used to signify [[saint]]s, the Virgin Mary, [[Old Testament]] prophets, angels, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], and some other figures. [[Byzantine emperor]]s and empresses were often shown with them in compositions including saints or Christ, however the haloes were outlined only.  This was copied by Ottonian and later Russian rulers. Old Testament figures become less likely to have haloes in the West as the Middle Ages go on.&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp.68-71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pope Paschalis I. in apsis mosaic of Santa Prassede in Rome.gif|thumb|right|180px|[[Pope Paschal I]] is depicted during his lifetime, so with a square halo, c. 820, [[Santa Prassede]], Rome.]]
[[Beatification|Beatified]] figures, not yet canonised as saints, are sometimes shown in medieval Italian art with linear rays radiating out from the head, but no circular edge of the nimbus defined; later this became a less obtrusive form of halo that could be used for all figures.&lt;ref&gt;The distinction is observed in the ''Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven'' (1423-4) by [[Fra Angelico]], [[National Gallery, London]], where only the beatified saints at the edges have radiating linear haloes.&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary has, especially from the [[Baroque]] period onwards, a special form of halo in a [[circle of stars|circle of twelve stars]], derived from her identification as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]].

'''Square haloes''' were sometimes used for the living in [[donor portrait]]s of about 500-1100 in Italy;&lt;ref&gt;only in Italy, according to Didron, Vol 2 p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving ones are of Popes and others in [[mosaic]]s in Rome, including the [[Episcopa Theodora]] head of the mother of the Pope of the day.  They seem merely an indication of a contemporary figure, as opposed to the saints usually accompanying them, with no real implication of future canonization. A late example is of [[Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Cassino]], later Pope, from a manuscript of 1056–86;&lt;ref&gt;see Didron, Vol 2 p.79 and Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Gregory the Great]] had himself depicted with one, according to the 9th-century writer of his ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'', [[John, deacon of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Diaconus gives the reason: ''circa verticem tabulae similitudinem, quod viventis insigne est, preferens, non-coronam'' ("bearing around his head the likeness of a square, which is the sign for a living person, and not a crown") ([[Migne]], ''Pat. Lat.'' 75, 231). The deacon of Rome was unaware of the Eastern tradition of depicting the emperor with a halo.  Surviving examples are rare, and seem to be becoming rarer; Bishop Ecclesius has a clear one in older photos of the mosaics in [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], which appears to have been removed in recent restoration [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:SanVitale16.jpg Cupola of the choir] – see: James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p100 &amp; photo p.93, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}.  Other surviving examples are [[Pope Hadrian I]] in a mural formerly in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome, donor figures in the church at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]  [http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html and two more Roman examples – items 3 and 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630131544/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html |date=30 June 2007 }}, one of Paschal's mother, the rather mysterious [[Episcopa Theodora]]. see also: Fisher, Sally.

James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p202, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scalloped haloes, sometimes just appearing as made of radiating bars, are found in the manuscripts of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] "Ada School", such as the [[Ada Gospels]].

The whole-body image of radiance is sometimes called the  '[[Aureola|aureole]]' or ''glory''; it is shown radiating from all round the body, most often of Christ or Mary, occasionally of saints (especially those reported to have been seen surrounded by one).  Such an aureola is often a [[mandorla]] ("almond-shaped" [[vesica piscis]]), especially around [[Christ in Majesty]], who may well have a halo as well.  In [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|depictions of the Transfiguration of Jesus]] a more complicated shape is often seen, especially in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, as in the famous 15th century icon in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp. 107-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Where gold is used as a background in [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[mosaic]]s and panel paintings, the halo is often formed by inscribing lines in the [[gold leaf]], and may be decorated in patterns ([[diapering]]) within the outer radius, and thus becomes much less prominent.  The gold leaf inside the halo may also be burnished in a circular manner, so as to produce the effect of light radiating out from the subject's head. In the early centuries of its use, the Christian halo may be in most colours (though black is reserved for [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], [[Satan]] and other evil figures) or multicoloured; later gold becomes standard, and if the entire background is not gold leaf, the halo itself usually will be.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Margaret Jensen, ''Understanding Early Christian Art'', p. 112, 2000, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-20454-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of the halo ===
[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|left|290px|[[Fra Angelico]]. ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]''.  Note the haloes of the kneeling figures at the front, seen from behind.]]

With increasing [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in painting, the halo came to be a problem for artists.  So long as they continued to use the old compositional formulae which had been worked out to accommodate haloes, the problems were manageable, but as Western artists sought more flexibility in composition, this ceased to be the case.  In free-standing medieval [[sculpture]], the halo was already shown as a flat disk above or behind the head.  When [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] came to be considered essential, painters also changed the halo from an aura surrounding the head, always depicted as though seen full-on, to a flat golden disk or ring that appeared in perspective, floating above the heads of the saints, or vertically behind, sometimes transparent.  This can be seen first in [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], who still gives Christ the cruciform halo which began to be phased out by his successors.  In northern Europe the radiant halo, made up of rays like a [[sunburst]], came into fashion in French painting around the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Hugh. ''Catalogue of the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum'', p. 43, 1986, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7141-0525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 15th century [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Robert Campin]] largely abandoned their use, although some other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artists continued to use them.&lt;ref&gt;Haloes were also often added by later dealers and restorers to such works, and indeed sometimes used to convert portraits into "saints". [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/neth/hd_neth.htm Intentional Alterations of Early Netherlandish Painting, Metropolitan Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italy at around the same time, [[Pisanello]] used them if they did not clash with one of the enormous hats he liked to paint.  Generally they lasted longer in Italy, although often reduced to a thin gold band depicting the outer edge of the nimbus, usual for example in [[Giovanni Bellini]].  Christ began to be shown with a plain halo.
[[File:Madonna Benois.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (attributed),  ''[[The Benois Madonna|Benois Madonna]]''.  Floating semi-transparent haloes in perspective.]]

[[Fra Angelico]], himself a [[monk]], was a conservative as far as haloes are concerned, and some of his paintings demonstrate the problems well, as in several of his more crowded compositions, where they are shown as solid gold disks on the same plane as the picture surface, it becomes difficult to prevent them obstructing other figures.  At the same time they were useful in crowded narrative scenes for distinguishing the main, identifiable, figures from the mass of a crowd. [[Giotto]]'s [[Lamentation of Christ]] from the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] has eight figures with haloes and ten without, to whom the viewer knows they are not meant to attach a specific identity. In the same way, a ''Baptism of Christ'' by [[Perugino]] in Vienna gives neither Christ nor [[John the Baptist]] haloes, as sufficiently recognisable without them, but a saint in the background, not usually present in this scene, has a ring halo to denote his status.&lt;ref&gt;If not their identity. The painting has been partly repainted, and the current appearance may not be the original one. [[:File:Pietro Perugino 077.jpg|Vienna Perugino]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], even most Italian painters dispensed with haloes altogether, but in the Church's reaction to the [[Protestant Reformation]], that culminated in the [[Art in the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation#Council of Trent|decrees on images of the Council of Trent]] of 1563, their use was mandated by clerical writers on religious art such as [[Molanus]] and Saint [[Carlo Borromeo]].  Figures were placed where natural light sources would highlight their heads, or instead more discreet quasi-naturalistic flickering or glowing light was shown around the head of Christ and other figures (perhaps pioneered by [[Titian]] in his late period). [[Rembrandt]]'s [[etching]]s, for example, show a variety of solutions of all of these types, as well as a majority with no halo effect at all.  The disk halo was rarely used for figures from [[classical mythology]] in the Renaissance, although they are sometimes seen, especially in the classical radiant form, in [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] art.

By the 19th century haloes have become unusual in Western mainstream art, although retained in iconic and popular images, and sometimes as a medievalising effect.  When [[John Millais]] gives his otherwise realist ''[[St Stephen]]'' (1895) a ring halo, it seems rather surprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-saint-stephen-n01563|title=‘Saint Stephen’, Sir John Everett Millais, Bt, 1895 – Tate|first=|last=Tate|website=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular graphic culture, a simple ring has become the predominant representation of a halo since at least the late 19th century, as seen for example in the logo for the [[Simon Templar]] ("The Saint") series of novels and other adaptations.

== Spiritual significance in Christianity ==
[[File:Ushakov Nerukotvorniy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eastern Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ "[[Not Made by Hand]]" with the Greek letters [[I Am that I Am|'''Ο''' &lt;big&gt;ὤ&lt;/big&gt; '''Ν''']]. [[Simon Ushakov]], 17th century.]]
The early [[Church Fathers]] expended much rhetorical energy on conceptions of God as a source of light; among other things this was because "in the controversies in the 4th century over the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, the relation of the ray to the source was the most cogent example of emanation and of distinct forms with a common substance" – key concepts in the theological thought of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Castelseprio (1957) in Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, p117, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, Chatto &amp; Windus, London, {{ISBN|0-7011-2514-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more [[Catholic]] interpretation, less dualistic in its assumptions, is that the halo represents the light of divine grace suffusing the soul, which is perfectly united and in harmony with the physical body.

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], an [[icon]] is a "window into heaven" through which Christ and the Saints in heaven can be seen and communicated with. The gold background of the icon indicates that what is depicted is in heaven. The halo is a symbol of the [[Uncreated Light]] (Greek: Ἄκτιστον Φῶς) or [[Divine grace|grace]] of God shining forth through the icon. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] in his ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Celestial Hierarchies]]'' speaks of the angels and saints being illuminated by the grace of God, and in turn illumining others.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Origins and usage of the different terms ==
[[File:Preobrazhenie.jpeg|thumb|Late Byzantine/Russian [[icon]] of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]. Christ is shown surrounded by a light blue aureole with white flashes of lightning (15th century,  attributed to [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]).]]

The distinction between the alternative terms in English is rather unclear.  The oldest term in English is "glory", the only one available in the [[Middle Ages]], but now largely obsolete. It came from the French "gloire" which has much the same range of meanings as "glory".  "Gloriole" does not appear in this sense until 1844, being a modern invention, as a diminutive, in French also. "Halo" is first found in English in this sense in 1646 (nearly a century after the optical or astronomical sense). Both "halos" and "haloes" may be used as plural forms, and halo may be used as a verb.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "glory", "gloriole" and "halo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Halo comes originally from the Greek for "threshing-floor" – a circular, slightly sloping area kept very clean, around which slaves or oxen walked to thresh the grain.  In Greek, this came to mean the divine bright disk.

Nimbus means a cloud in Latin and is found as a divine cloud in 1616, whereas as "a bright or golden disk surrounding the head" it does not appear until 1727.  The plural "nimbi" is correct but "rare"; "nimbuses" is not in the OED but sometimes used. "Nimb" is an obsolete form of the noun, but not a verb, except that the obsolete "nimbated", like the commoner "nimbate", means "furnished with a nimbus".  It is sometimes preferred by art-historians, as sounding more technical than halo.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "nimbus" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aureole", from the Latin for "golden", has been used in English as a term for a gold crown, especially that traditionally considered the reward of [[martyr]]s, since the Middle Ages (OED 1220).  But the first use recorded as a term for a halo is in 1848, very shortly after which matters were greatly complicated by the publication in 1851 of the English translation of [[Adolphe Napoléon Didron]]'s important ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages''.  This, by what the OED calls a "strange blunder", derived the word from the Latin "aura" as a diminutive, and also defined it as meaning a halo or glory covering the whole body, whilst saying that "nimbus" referred only to a halo around the head.  This, according to the OED, reversed the historical usage of both words, but whilst Didron's diktat was "not accepted in France", the OED noted it had already been picked up by several English dictionaries, and influenced usage in English, which still seems to be the case, as the word "nimbus" is mostly found describing whole-body haloes, and seems to have also influenced "gloriole" in the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "aureole".&lt;/ref&gt;

The only English term that unequivocally means a full-body halo, and cannot be used for a circular disk around the head is "[[mandorla]]", first occurring in 1883.  However, this term, which is the Italian word for "[[almond]]", is usually reserved for the [[vesica piscis]] shape, at least in describing Christian art.  In discussing Asian art, it is used more widely.&lt;ref&gt;For example by Sickman and Soper, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, there could be said to be an excess of words that could refer to either a head-disk or a full-body halo, and no word that clearly denotes a full-body halo that is not vesica piscis shaped.  "Halo" by itself, according to recent dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 1995, and Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; means only a circle around the head, although Rhie and Thurman use the word also for circular full-body aureoles.&lt;ref&gt;op &amp; pages cit.  The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 (link above) has a further set of meanings for these terms, including glory.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The new 4.25 acre temple   is located on a hill with a 360 degree view of the mountains and the plains.  The main floor has a prayer hall with seven shrines: Shiva Parvati, [[Durga]], [[Venkateshwara]] ([[Vishnu]]), Laxmi Narayan (Visnu), [[Rama]] &amp; [[Sita]], [[Radha]] &amp; [[Krishna]], and [[Saraswati]].&lt;ref&gt;Grand Opening of New Temple and Prana Pratishtha Celebrations, Mahesh Jha, Mandir Vani, Volume 19, No. 2, 1 Aug. 2015, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The deities were carved in marble at [[Jaipur]], India, except for the Venkateswara  granite image was carved at Tirupati. In the front granite [[Lingam|Shiva-Linga]] with [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] and an image of [[Ganesha]]. The shrines are surrounded by a [[parikrama]].  On the other side of the hall, there are smaller shrines for [[Hanumana]], [[Jagannath]] (with [[Balrama|Balram]] and Subhadra), [[Ayappa]], and Subramanya ([[Kartikeya]]) with [[Devasena|Devyani]] and [[Valli]].

The lower level, when fully finished later this year,  will have a large multi-purpose hall with a stage and a kitchen for preparation and serving of food. The hall opens to a patio. The hall will be used as a  cultural center for the celebrations such as weddings. No  alcohol, tobacco or meat is allowed, in accordance with temple conventions.

==History==

Starting in the 1960s, planning meetings were held at the residences of Dr. Tripathi, Dr. Ahuja, Dr. Gangadharam, Dr. K.C. Gupta, Dr. Vedanthan, Drs. Sagar, Nawal Sharma, and Katharine Nanda. In 1985, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of the Rockies was incorporated with Ved Nanda, a professor of International Law at University of Denver as the president,  and the Hindu Society of Colorado was merged in it. Initially a small house was purchased in Aurora, which could accommodate about 45 people.&lt;ref&gt;A vision is realized – a dream becomes a reality, Prof. Ved Nanda , Mandir Vani, Volume 19, No. 2, 1 Aug. 2015, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Kauai’s Hindu Monastery donated a Ganesh murti as the main deity for the Temple.

In 1996 a former church was purchased at Wadsworth Boulevard in 1996 and remodeled to serve as the temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindutempleofcolorado.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MandirVani-December2017Final.pdf  Major Milestones, Mandi Vani, Volume 21 No. 3 1 December 2017, p 14-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://extras.denverpost.com/news/news0205c.htm  Prayers for the lost,  Mark Obmascik, Denver Post, Feb. 5, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Some adjacent land was purchased for possible expansion, however the lot size was considered to be too small.

In 2007, 4.25 acres land land for the new temple was purchased for $500,000 in 2006 and the construction cost thus far has been about $4.5 million. Some of the donor families contributed more than $100,000. Professional contributors included the real-estate agent and the legal expert.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1503 Managing a Hindu Temple, Meeting the challenges of operating under American laws and tax codes, Katherine Nanda, July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Priests Acharya Kailash Chandra Upadhyaya (1998) and later Pandit Raghavendra Iyer (2006) were invited to serve.

==2015 Prana Pratishtha==
Nine Hindu priests, seven of whom came from all over the USA, and two local ones, conducted the  Prana Pratishtha (infusion of life) ceremonies.  Hundreds of local  Hindus from the Denver paerticipated in the  official opening of the new temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.denverpost.com/2015/06/07/hindu-temple-opens-with-havan-ceremony-in-centennial-colorado/#2  Hindu temple opens with havan ceremony in Centennial Colorado, Denver Post, JUNE 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Pandit Raghavendra Iyyer and then Kailash Chandra Upadyay  retired from the temple in 2016. The HTCC invited applications from potential priests and developed a criteria based on skills in Sanskrit/English/Indian languages, Music, computing, and experience as a temple archak and a purohit for sanskaras in India/overseas. The new priests are Acharya Shiv Kumar Mishra and Pundit Deepak Raghunath.&lt;ref&gt;Mandir vani, Volume 21 No.3 1 December 2017, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple Finances==
The temple currently has a building loan of $2.25 million requiring a monthly mortgage payment of $13,600. The temple seeks to build a building fund of $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Mandir Vani, Dec 2016, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which will allow the temple to refinance and significantly reduce the  monthly payment.  The temple still needs to construct a kitchen for the food distribution. A hall and stage are  needed for temple  programs and community celebrations such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries.

==Advisory Council and Management Committee==
The temple has instituted an advisory council with  eight Legacy Donors (more than $100,000 total donation), thirteen sponsors (more than $25,000 donation), and 26 patrons (more than $10,000 donation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindutempleofcolorado.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MandirVani-December2017Final.pdf  List of Advisory Council Members, Mandir Vani Volume 21 No. 3 1 December 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The Management Committee consists of thirteen individuals.

==Inclusive character of The Denver Hindu Temple==

Unlike many other temples, Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of the Rockies made a deliberate decision to include diversity. Venkateshwar is Vishnu as represented in the Southern tradition at [[Tirupati]], Laxmi Narayan is Vishnu as represented in the Northern tradition (see [[Laxminarayan Temple]]), Jagannatha is the presiding  deity of [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]] which represents the Eastern Tradition.  [[Ayappa]] is popular in Kerala and Subramanya (Murugan or Kartikeya) is popular in Tamil Nadu.

While most devotees are Hindus of Indian origin, Hindus of other origins and non-Hindus are welcome at the temple.

The '''''Horologion''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ὡρολόγιον}}; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: Часocлoвъ, ''Chasoslov'', {{lang-ro|Ceaslov}}) or '''''[[Book of hours]]''''' provides the [[Acolouthia|fixed portions]] (Greek: {{lang|grc|ἀκολουθίαι}}, ''akolouthiai'') of the [[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|Divine Service]] or the daily cycle of services as used by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches. Into this fixed framework of the services, are inserted numerous parts changing daily.

In its original sense, a ''horologion'' (Greek: ὠρολόγιον, "the hour-teller" from [[wikt:ὥρα|ὥρα]] ''hṓra'' "hour" and -[[wikt:λόγιος|λόγιον]]''-logion'', "teller") or [[Latin]] ''[[Horologium (disambiguation)|horologium]]'' was any device or structure for [[horology|keeping time]], such as a [[sundial]] or the [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]].

==Description==
[[Image:Horologe1.jpg|thumb|left|''Horologion'' in Romanian]]
The Horologion is primarily a book for the use of the Reader and [[Cantor (church)|Chanters]] (as distinguished from the [[Euchologion]], which contains the texts used by the [[Priest]] and [[Deacon]]). Several varieties of Horologia exist, the most complete of which is the '''Great Horologion''' (Greek: Ὡρολόγιον τò μέγα, ''Horologion to mega''; Slavonic: Великий Часословъ, ''Velikij Chasoslov'', Romanian: ''Ceaslovul Mare''). It contains the fixed portions of the [[Canonical hours#Daily Cycle of services|Daily Office]] ([[Vespers]], [[Compline]] (Great and Small), [[Midnight Office]], [[Matins]], the [[Little Hours]], the [[Inter-Hours]], [[Typica]], Prayers before Meals). The parts for the Reader and Chanters are given in full, the Priest's and Deacon's parts are abbreviated. The Great Horologion will also contain a list of [[Saints]] commemorated throughout the year (with their [[Troparion|Troparia]] and [[Kontakion|Kontakia]]), selected propers for Sundays, and moveable [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Feasts]] (from the [[Menaion]], [[Triodion]] and [[Pentecostarion]]), and various [[Canon (hymnography)|Canons]] and other devotional services. The Great Horologion is most commonly used in Greek-speaking churches.

Various editions of the Horologion are usually shorter; still giving the fixed portions of the Daily Office in full, but with the other texts much more abbreviated (all of which are found in full in the other [[Canonical hours#Liturgical books|liturgical books]]). In addition, such texts often also contain Morning and Evening Prayers, the Order of Preparation for [[Eucharistic discipline#Eastern Orthodox practice|Holy Communion]], and Prayers to be said after receiving Holy Communion.

'''Indult Catholic''' was a [[traditionalist Catholic]] [[loaded term]] used from the early 21st century until 2007 as a [[pejorative]] label applied to conservative Catholics who attended only the licit celebrations of the [[Tridentine Mass]] in Latin according to the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] and regulated by the local bishop through an [[indult]] that conformed to the 1984 [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] norms in the [[ecclesiastical letter]] ''[[Quattuor abhinc annos]]''.

==Description==
The Tridentine Mass was the normative usage of the [[Roman Rite]] Mass from the time of the [[Council of Trent]] until the liturgical reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]].

When the [[Mass of Paul VI]], the newer usage of the Roman rite of Mass, replaced the Tridentine Mass, the older usage of the Roman rite of Mass, {{Circa|1970}}, but prior to ''{{lang|la|Quattuor abhinc annos}}'', [[celebret]]s were issued by the [[Holy See]] to some priests permitting them to licitly celebrate the older usage, but bishops complained about this approach.&lt;ref name="Dinges1995"/&gt;{{rp|page=247}}
In 1971 [[Pope Paul VI]] permitted, in what is known as the [[John Heenan (cardinal)|Heenan]] or the [[Agatha Christie indult]], local bishops in the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]] to permit the occasional celebration of the older usage according to the 1967 modifications to the 1965 edition of the Roman Missal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship|date=1971-11-05|title=The "Heenan" indult|website=lms.org.uk|location=Vatican City|publisher=Latin Mass Society|publication-place=London|id=Prot. N. 1897/71|url=http://www.lms.org.uk/resources/documents/heenan-indult|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111061031/http://www.lms.org.uk/resources/documents/heenan-indult|archivedate=2011-01-11|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments issued an indult to diocesan bishops, in ''{{lang|la|Quattuor abhinc annos}}'', which permitted the diocesan bishops to grant indults, under certain conditions, to churches and oratories permitting celebration of the older usage in Latin according to the 1962 edition.&lt;ref name="QuattuorAbhincAnnos1984"&gt;{{cite web|author=Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments|date=1984-10-03|title=Quattuor abhinc annos|website=adoremus.org|location=St Louis|publisher=Adoremus|url=http://www.adoremus.org/Quattuorabhincannos.html|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825175334/http://www.adoremus.org/Quattuorabhincannos.html|archivedate=2004-08-25|deadurl=no}} Translation from ''L'Osservatore Romano'' (English ed.). 1984-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Traditionalist Catholics practise their faith outside the discipline of the Catholic Church and reject the doctrinal and liturgical reforms of [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref name="Dinges1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dinges|first=William D.|year=1995|chapter={{ '}}We are what you were': Roman Catholic Traditionalism in America|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1KFNeoVo-UC&amp;pg=PA241|editor1-last=Weaver|editor1-first=Mary J.|editor2-last=Appleby|editor2-first=R. Scott|title=Being right: conservative Catholics in America|location=Bloomington [u.a.]|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253329226}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=242}}{{efn|There is a distinction between conservative Catholics and traditionalist Catholics, the later, which are seen as "the most radicalized segment on the Catholic right and the most representative Catholic analogue to [[Christian fundamentalism|Protestant fundamentalism]]," have organized "counterchurch institutions" and are associated with "antidemocratic political ideologies."&lt;ref name="Dinges1995"/&gt;{{rp|page=242, 244–245}}}}
They claimed that no authorization was required for celebrating the older usage of the Roman rite of Mass. They decried those who accepted the conditions attached to the ''{{lang|la|Quattuor abhinc annos}}'' indult, applying to them the term ''indult Catholics'', and frequently did not recognise them as fellow traditionalists.

In 1988 following the [[Ecône consecrations|canonically illicit consecration, at Ecône]], Switzerland, of four [[Society of St. Pius X]] members as bishops by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], John Paul II recommended, in ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'', a "wide and generous application" of the norms in ''{{lang|la|Quattuor abhinc annos}}'' and established the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'']] to facilitate the return of traditionalist Catholics into full communion with the Holy See.

The term ''indult Catholic'' became useless as a [[polemic]] in 2007 when [[Pope Benedict XVI]] promulgated, in ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', a universal law for the Catholic Church which reformed the norms about the older usage of the Roman rite of Mass.{{efn|name=PCED2011instruction|The Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' issued an instruction in 2011 that elaborated on the way ''Summorum Pontificum'' must be fulfilled.&lt;ref name="PCED2011"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei''|date=2011-04-30|title=Instruction on the application of the apostolic letter ''Summorum Pontificum'' of His Holiness Benedict XVI given ''motu proprio''|website=vatican.va|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It replaced the norms in ''{{lang|la|Quattuor abhinc annos}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Ecclesia Dei}}'', which regulated through diocesan level indults, with universal church law.{{efn|name=PCED2011instruction}} Benedict XVI wrote that "precise juridical norms" regulating the use of the 1962 Missal were missing because some bishops "feared that the authority of the Council would be called into question."&lt;ref name="SummorumPontificum2007"/&gt; Benedict XVI wrote that while "fidelity to the old Missal became an external mark of identity" in the [[Society of St. Pius X]], "the reasons for the break which arose over this, however, were at a deeper level."&lt;ref name="SummorumPontificum2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pope Benedict XVI|date=2007-07-07|title=Summorum Pontificum|website=vatican.va|location=|publisher=|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob ben Hayyim Zemah''' (17th century) was a [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Portuguese]] [[kabalist]] and physician. He received a medical training in his native country as a [[Marrano]], but fled about 1619 to [[Safed]] and devoted himself to the [[Talmud]] and the casuists ("poseḳim") until 1625; then he went to [[Damascus]], where for eighteen years he studied [[kabbalah]] from the [[Zohar]] and the writings of [[Isaac Luria]] and [[Hayyim Vital]]. He finally settled at [[Jerusalem]] and opened a [[yeshivah]] for the study of the Zohar and other kabbalistic works, [[David Conforte]] being for some time one of his pupils (''Ḳore ha-Dorot,'' pp. 36a, 49a).

Jacob Ẓemaḥ was one of the greatest kabbalists of his period and was a prolific author, his works including treatises of his own as well as compilations of the writings of Ḥayyim Vital. He produced twenty works, of which only two have been published. The first of these is the ''Ḳol ba-Ramah'' (Korez, 1785), a commentary on the ''Idra,'' which he began in 1643, and for which he utilized the commentary of Ḥayyim Vital. In the preface to this work he maintained that the coming of the [[Messiah]] depended on repentance ("teshuvah") and on the study of kabbalah from the Zohar and the writings of Isaac Luria, the delay in the advent of the Messiah being because schools for such study had not been established in every town.

His second published work is the ''Nagid u-Meẓawweh'' (Amsterdam, 1712), on the mystical meaning of the prayers, this being an abridgment of a compendium which Ẓemaḥ composed on the basis of a more comprehensive treatise.

Among his unpublished works, special mention may be made of the ''Ronnu le-Ya'aḳob,'' in which he calls himself "the proselyte" ("ger ẓedeḳ"; ''Cat. Oppenheimer,'' No. 1062 Q). This treatise consists of notes recorded while studying under [[Samuel Vital]] and supplemented by his own additions. In his compilation of Ḥayyim Vital's writings, Ẓemaḥ pretended to have discovered many works of Vital which were unknown to the latter's son Samuel.

He died at Jerusalem in the second half of the 17th century.

'''Johannes Hans Balzli''', more commonly known as Johannes Balzli, was an Austrian/German author, newspaper editor, [[Theosophist]] and [[Armanist]], most notable for his biography of [[Guido von List]], entitled, ''"Guido v. List: [[Der Wiederentdecker Uralter Arischer Weisheit]] - Sein Leben und sein Schaffen" ''. ("Guido v. List - The Rediscoverer of Ancient Aryan Wisdom - His Life and His Work.")

==Biography==
The biography on List was published while Theosophists acknowledged List's nationalist popularization of their doctrines,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]] by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; that was published in [[Vienna]] by the [[Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft]] in 1917, and republished later in the 20th century by [[Adolf Schleipfer]].

This biography of List was the only book length biography of List that exists and indeed that has ever been written.

Balzli was the secretary of the [[Leipzig]] [[Theosophical Society]] and editor of occult magazine ''Prana (occult magazine)'' (1909–19) &lt;ref&gt;[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]] by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], pp. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; of which was initially edited by [[astrologer]] [[Karl Brandler-Pracht]].

During 1916 and 1917 List wrote several articles on the approaching national [[millennium]], which was supposed to be realized once the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had been defeated, Balzli published 2 of these predictions in ''Prana'' in 1917.

'''Kalki''', also called '''Kalkin''' or '''Karki'''&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Brockington|title=The Sanskrit Epics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HR-_LK5kl18C&amp;pg=PA287 |year=1998|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10260-4|pages=287–288 with footnotes 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is the tenth [[avatar]] of Hindu god [[Vishnu]] to end the [[Kali Yuga]], one of the four periods in endless cycle of existence (''krita'') in [[Vaishnavism]] cosmology. He is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by ending the darkest and destructive period to remove [[adharma]] and ushering in the [[Satya Yuga]], while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p188"/&gt; The description and details of Kalki are inconsistent among the Puranic texts. He is, for example, only an invisible force destroying evil and chaos in some texts, while an actual person who kills those who persecute others, and portrayed as someone leading an army of Brahmin warriors in some. His mythology has been compared to the concepts of [[Messiah]], [[Apocalypse]], [[Frashokereti]] and [[Maitreya]] in other religions.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p188"&gt;{{harvnb|Dalal|2014|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1999p629"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Wendy Doniger|author2=Merriam-Webster, Inc|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA629 |year=1999|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalki is also found in Buddhist texts. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the ''[[Kalachakra]]-Tantra'' describes 25 rulers, each named Kalki who rule from the heavenly [[Shambhala]]. The last Kalki of Shambhala destroys a barbarian Muslim army, after which Buddhism flourishes. This text is dated to about 10th-century CE.&lt;ref name="Lopez2015p202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2017p220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahla2006p90"/&gt;
However, some Muslims also claim that the prophet Muhammed was the Kalki avatar, because of his association with a flying white horse, and his father's name is similar in meaning to that of Vishnuyasha, the Father of Kalki.  Some prophecies of Kalki say that he will kill the sinful people and atheists by the millions. The Kalki Purana is the main cannon text about Lord Kalki. In the Kalki Purana Kalki is described as the Supreme Being, source and end of all other beings, and ruler of the universe and gods.

==Etymology==
The name Kalki means "white horse", "destroyer of filth", and "eternity".  &lt;ref name="Klostermaier2006p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Mythologies and Philosophies of Salvation in the Theistic Traditions of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFQ9DgAAQBAJ |year=2006|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-743-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars such as Otto Schrader to suggest that the original term may have been ''karki'' (white horse knight, from the horse) which morphed into Kalki. This proposal is supported by two versions of ''Mahabharata'' manuscripts (e.g. the G3.6 manuscript) that have been found, where the Sanskrit verses name the avatar to be "karki", rather than "kalki".&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Brockington|title=The Sanskrit Epics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HR-_LK5kl18C&amp;pg=PA287 |year=1998|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10260-4|pages=287–288 with footnotes 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Vaishnavism}}
Kalki is an avatara of Vishnu. Avatara means "descent" and refers to a descent of the divine into the material realm of human existence. The [[Garuda Purana]] lists [[Dasavatara of Vishnu#List|ten avatars]], with Kalki being the tenth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 73|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as the avatar who appears at the end of the Kali Yuga. He ends the darkest, degenerating and chaotic stage of the Kali ''Yuga'' (period) to remove [[adharma]] and ushers in the [[Satya Yuga]], while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p188"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1999p629"/&gt; He restarts a new cycle of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludo Rocher|editor=Ralph M. Rosen|title=Time and Temporality in the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=It9KMklf4R4C&amp;pg=PA91|date=22 March 2004|publisher=UPenn Museum of Archaeology|isbn=978-1-931707-67-1|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as a Brahmin warrior in the Puranas.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p188"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1999p629"/&gt;

===Wheel of Time Tantra===
In the Buddhist text ''Kalachakra Tantra'', the righteous kings are called Kalki (Kalkin, lit. chieftain) living in Sambhala. There are many Kalki in this text, each fighting barbarism, persecution and chaos. The last Kalki is called "Cakrin" and is predicted to end the chaos and degeneration by assembling a large army to eradicate the "forces of Islam".&lt;ref name="Lopez2015p202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2017p220"/&gt; A great war and Armageddon will destroy the barbaric Muslim forces, states the text.&lt;ref name="Lopez2015p202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2017p220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahla2006p90"&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Björn Dahla|title=Exercising Power: The Role of Religions in Concord and Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_rWAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Donner Institute for Research in Religious and Cultural History|isbn=978-952-12-1811-8|pages=90–91}}, '''Quote:''' "(...) the Shambala-bodhisattva-king [Cakravartin Kalkin] and his army will defeat and destroy the enemy army, the barbarian Muslim army and their religion, in a kind of Buddhist Armadgeddon.

==Development==
Kalki is mentioned in several hindu texts including the Agni Purana and Ramayana and Mahabartha. &lt;ref name=academy81&gt;{{cite book|title=Tattvadīpaḥ: Journal of Academy of Sanskrit Research, Volume 5|page=81|publisher=The Academy|year=2001|quote=Kalki, as an incarnation of Visnu, is not found in the Vedic literature. But some of the features of that concept, viz., the fearful elements, the epithet Kalmallkinam (brilliant, remover of darkness) of Rudra, prompt us to admit him as the forerunner of Kalki.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rabiprasad Mishra|title=Theory of Incarnation: Its Origin and Development in the Light of Vedic and Purāṇic References|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XvXAAAAMAAJ |year=2000|publisher=Pratibha |isbn=978-81-7702-021-2|page=146}}, Quote: "Kalki as an incarnation of Visnu is not mentioned in the Vedic literature."&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet "Kalmallkinam", meaning "brilliant remover of darkness", is found in the Vedic literature for [[Rudra]] (later Shiva), which has been interpreted to be "forerunner of Kalki".&lt;ref name=academy81/&gt;

Kalki appears for the first time in the great war epic ''Mahabharata''.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p104"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mahābhārata - Essays by Alf Hiltebeitel|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lLfHSOWKB-sC&amp;pg=PA531|year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18566-6|pages=89–110, 530–531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of Kalki in the ''Mahabharata'' occurs only once, over the verses 3.188.85–3.189.6.&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"/&gt; The Kalki avatar is found in the Maha-Puranas such as ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Horace |authorlink=Horace Hayman Wilson |title=Vishnu Purana |year=2001 |publisher=Ganesha Publishing |isbn=1-86210-016-0 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Matsya Purana]]'', and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of Avatāra and Divinity of Chaitanya|first=Janmajit|last=Roy|page=39 |publisher = Atlantic Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series|first=Alain|last=Daniélou|page=181|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the details relating the Kalki mythologies are divergent between the Epic and the Puranas, as well as within the Puranas.&lt;ref name="Mitchiner2000p68"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E. Mitchiner|title=Traditions Of The Seven Rsis|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=phGzVwTTp_gC|year= 2000|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-1324-3|pages= 68–69 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p104"/&gt;

In the ''Mahabharata'', according to Hiltebeitel, Kalki is an extension of the [[Parasurama]] avatar legend where a Brahmin warrior destroys Kshatriyas who were abusing their power to spread chaos, evil and persecution of the powerless. The Epic character of Kalki restores dharma, restores justice in the world, but does not end the cycle of existence.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p288"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-539423-8|pages=288–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kalkin section in the ''Mahabharata'' occurs in the Markandeya section. There, states Luis Reimann, can "hardly be any doubt that the Markandeya section is a late addition to the Epic. Making Yudhisthira ask a question about conditions at the end of Kali and the beginning of Krta — something far removed from his own situation — is merely a device for justifying the inclusion of this subject matter in the Epic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis González Reimann|title=The Mahābhārata and the Yugas: India's Great Epic Poem and the Hindu System of World Ages|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nXrXAAAAMAAJ|year =2002|publisher= Peter Lang|isbn= 978-0-8204-5530-3|pages= 89–99, quote is on page 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p63"/&gt; The coverage of Kalki in these Hindu texts is scant, in contrast to the legends of Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana and Krishna, all of which are repeatedly and extensively described. According to Dimmitt, this was likely because just like the concept of the Buddha as a Vishnu avatar, the concept of Kalki was "somewhat in flux" when the major Puranas were being compiled. This is because Kalki is a future avatar, prophesied in the past and predicted thousands of years ago. However, many Hindu people worship Lord Kalki and he has several temples in India.&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p63"&gt;{{harvnb|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|2012|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth may have developed in the Hindu texts both as a reaction to the invasions of the Indian subcontinent by various armies over the centuries from its northwest, and the mythologies these invaders brought with them.&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger2004p235"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Hindu Myths: A Sourcebook Translated from the Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ4IMQAACAAJ |year=2004 |publisher =Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-044990-7|pages=235–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Mitchiner, the Kalki concept was likely borrowed "in some measure from similar Jewish, Zoroastrian and other religions".&lt;ref name="Mitchiner2000p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

The Yuga Purana mythologizes in greater details the post-Maurya era Indo-Greek and Saka era, while the Manvantara theme containing the Kalki idea is mythologized greater in other Puranas.&lt;ref name="Mitchiner2000p69"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

===Kalki Purana===
A  text named [[Kalki Purana]] is a relatively recent text, likely composed in [[Bengal]]. Its dating [[floruit]] is the 18th-century.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|p=183 with footnotes}} Wendy Doniger dates the Kalki mythology containing ''Kalki Purana'' to between 1500 and 1700 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtZRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-1867-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kalki Purana'', Kalki marries princess Padmavati, the daughter of Brhadratha of Simhala.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|p=183 with footnotes}} He fights an evil army and many wars, ends evil but does not end existence. Kalki returns to Sambhala, inaugurates a new ''[[yuga]]'' for the good and then goes to [[Vaikuntha]] after ruling the world for 1000 years.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|p=183 with footnotes}}

The Kalki Purana states that Kalki will kill all the atheists and will have many powerful divine weapons obtained from Lord Shiva.  It is said that Kalki will obtain these after training under Lord Parasurama.  

The Kalki Purana describes Lord Kalki as the supreme deity even above Brahma and Shiva, and that he will kill all the sinful kings who have corrupted the world, and restore the dharma.

==Kalki Avatar in Sikhism==

[[File:Kalki Avatar.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kalki Avatar Punjab Hills, Guler, c. 1765.]]

The Kalki avatar appears in the historic Sikh texts, most notably in [[Dasam Granth]] as Nihakalanki, a text that is traditionally attributed to [[Guru Gobind Singh]].&lt;ref name="Rinehart2011p29"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Debating the Dasam Granth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58AVDAAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-975506-6|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

It includes Kalki as the twenty-fourth incarnation to lead the war between the forces of righteousness and unrighteousness, states Dhavan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Purnima Dhavan|title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HJ5idB8_QC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-975655-1|pages=1 55–157, 186 note 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features and iconography==
[[File:Kalki_avatar_idol_in_rani_ki_vav_patan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Statue Of god Kalki Avatar on wall of Rani Ki Vav (The Queens Stepwell) at Patan Gujarat India]]
[Lord [[Shiva]] said to Lord Kalki:] "This '''horse''' was manifested from [[Garuda]], and it can go anywhere at will and assume many different forms. Here also is a '''parrot''' [ [[Shuka]] ] that knows everything - past, present, and future. I would like to offer You both the horse and the parrot and so please accept them. By the influence of this horse and parrot, the people of the world will know You as a learned scholar of all scriptures who is a master of the art of releasing arrows, and thus the conqueror of all. I would also like to present You this sharp, strong '''sword''' and so please accept it. The handle of this sword is bedecked with jewels, and it is extremely powerful. As such, the sword will help You to reduce the heavy burden of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Bhumipati Das. ''Sri Kalki Purana''. 2nd ed. India: Jai Nitai Press, 2011. pp. 33–34 (ch 3, text 25–27).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, Lord Kalki picked up His brightly shining '''trident''' and '''bow and arrows''' and sets out from His palace, riding upon His victorious horse and wearing His '''amulet'''.&lt;ref&gt;Bhumipati Das. ''Sri Kalki Purana''. 2nd ed. India: Jai Nitai Press, 2011. p. 36 (ch 3, text 36).&lt;/ref&gt;

[Shuka said to Padmavati:] [Lord Kalki] received a sword, horse, parrot, and '''shield''' from Mahadeva, as a benediction.&lt;ref&gt;Bhumipati Das. ''Sri Kalki Purana''. 2nd ed. India: Jai Nitai Press, 2011. p. 84 (ch 8, text 24).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictions about birth and arrival==

In the cyclic concept of time (''Puranic Kalpa''), [[Kaliyuga]] is variously estimated to last between 400,000 and 432,000 years. In some Vaishnava texts, Kalki is forecasted to appear on a white horse, at the end of Kaliyuga, to end the age of degeneration and to restore virtue and world order.&lt;ref name="coulter2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, Volume 2|author1=James R. Lewis|author2=Inga B. Tollefsen|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalki Purana states that Kalki will be born to the family of Sumati and Vishnuyasha 
or alternatively .&lt;ref name="emperor"/&gt;{{sfn|Rocher|1986|p=183}} Awejsirdenee and Bishenjun,&lt;ref name=coulter2013/&gt; He appears at the end of Kali Yuga to restore the order of the world.&lt;ref name=coulter2013&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWxekbhM1yEC|author1=Charles Russell Coulter|author2=Patricia Turner|publisher=Routledge|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; Vishnuyasha is stated to be a prominent Brahmin headman of the village called [[Shambhala]]. He will become the king, a "[[Chakravartin|Turner of the Wheel]]", and one who triumphs. He will eliminate all barbarians and robbers, end ''adharma'', restart ''dharma'', and save the good people.&lt;ref name="incarnation"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mahabharata, Volume 2: Book 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfhJCgAAQBAJ|pages=597–598|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|author=J.A.B. van Buitenen}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, humanity will be transformed and will prevail on earth, and the golden age will begin.&lt;ref name="incarnation"/&gt;

In the Kanchipuram temple, two relief Puranic panels depict Kalki, one relating to lunar (daughter-based) dynasty and another to solar (son-based) dynasty.&lt;ref name="emperor"/&gt; In these panels, states D Dennis Hudson, the story depicted is in terms of Kalki fighting and defeating asura Kali. He rides a white horse called Devadatta, ends evil, purifies everyone's minds and consciousness, and heralds the start of Krita Yuga.&lt;ref name="emperor"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Body of God: An Emperor's Palace for Krishna in Eighth-Century Kanchipuram|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|author=D Dennis Hudson|pages=333–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{coord|42|59|08.66|N|83|30|34.05|W|type:city_scale:10000|display=title}}'''Louhelen Bahá'í School''' is one of three leading institutions owned by the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] of the United States. The others are [[Green Acre Bahá'í School]] and [[Bosch Bahá'í School]]. Louhelen is near [[Davison, Michigan]].

The school property was bought for Bahá'í purposes in 1930 by the new married couple Lou and Helen Eggleston and they hosted a picnic that year. The first "school" session was held in 1931 and was run via a committee organized by the national community through the 1930s and 40s. Innovations in the period were adding distinct sessions for youth and junior youth and practicum "laboratory" sessions. All the while the material setting was also advanced. In 1947 the Egglestons donated the school property valued over $50k and the National Spiritual Assembly of the US bought the residence which was organically part of the school. The work of maintaining the site was then kept by two committees and on-site managers though the Egglestons continued to associate with the school into the early 1950s. Lou died in 1953 while their daughter assisted the school in 1955. For a period of two years, however, the school was shut down as were all the [[Bahá'í schools]], in 1949 and 1950 to conserve resources for the cost of finishing the [[Bahá'í House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois)|Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette]] and to clearly establish the thrust of work of [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|promulgating the religion]] in Latin America.

Activities resumed and continued through the 1960s into the early 1970s. However a safety situation developed and in 1974 the school was closed by the national assembly. An investment of $1.8 million followed with plans drawn up and construction projects carried out from 1980 to 1982 and the school re-opened with some buildings restored, others replaced and the mission more explicitly being a residential college and conference center.

A number of subject areas have been advanced across the periods of the school. One was race unity, a subject at the school explicitly since 1932 when Maye Gift's talks on race led to a compilation that was well received in multiple reprints. The school welcomed inter-racial couples, members of diverse races, and a project supporting black students going to attend integrating schools in Greenville, SC, in 1964 was undertaken and a socioeconomic development program Understanding Racism initiative in 1986. Books were also developed from other presentations at the school - some of [[Stanwood Cobb]]'s work was gathered from working for a school session, and the text of ''The Divine Art of Living'' evolved from presentations. Moslem and Christian subjects were studied early on. Later a residential college program supported students who stayed at the school and were students in area colleges. Scholars of the religion gathered annually at the school in the form of the [[Association for Bahá'í Studies]] and the Irfan Colloquia and attracted performers like [[Andy Grammar]], and [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]]. The school also supported a grandparents-and-grandkids program of learning indigenous Indian cultural history. Jr youth projects have been posted to [[YouTube]].

== Early history ==

=== Pre-history ===

The [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] area was developed by Euro-Americans following the development of an [[Indiana Territory]] and its dissolution. Then, the region went through transitions from a [[Michigan Territory|territory]] to a state. Freeman Sweers established the farm near [[Davison, Michigan]] in the latter 1800s and sold to a D. P. Hall.&lt;ref name="Impact"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reconstruction of M-15 from I-75 to I-69, Oakland and Genesee Counties: Environmental Impact Statement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJ01AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA4 |year=2010 |pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Sweers bought into a development in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coral Gables sales for day over $100,000 |newspaper=The Miami News |location=Miami, FL |page=22 |date=4 Feb 1924 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15539425/freeman_sweers_of_davison_mi_buys_into/ | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the time of the [[Great Depression in the United States]] and in bad condition, the farm was bought by Lou (Lewis W.) and Helen Eggleston.&lt;ref name="Impact" /&gt; Lou was born about 1873, worked in heating industry, and then, at about the age of 50, Lou married Helen and bought the farm, then about 268 acres.&lt;ref name="LouBio"&gt;{{cite news |title='Natural' food, by Curt Haseltine |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |location=Detroit, MI |page=18 |date=16 Mar 1952 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15380368/profile_of_bahai_lewis_w/ | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen was daughter of E. D. and Mrs. Whitney, of Lansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Baha'i summer meet opens today |newspaper=Lansing State Journal |location=Lansing, MI |page=9 |date=27 Jun 1937 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15378103/louhelen_bahai_school_central_states/ | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1930 ====

Helen, still going by her maiden name of Whitney, sent a message to the ''[[Bahá'í News]]'', early monthly periodical of the religion, published in October 1930, of the intention of setting it up as a dairy farm "to operate as far as possible along Baha'i lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Baha'i farm in Michigan |magazine=Bahá'í News |issn=0195-9212 |page=6 |issue=45 |date=Oct 1930 |url=http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&amp;page=352 | access-date = Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LouhelenHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.louhelen.org/history |title=Louhelen history |date=2017 |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | access-date =Feb 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the extending troubles of the Depression that year, a "picnic" was held; it was one of two informal picnics Bahá'ís held in Michigan that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Reports from teaching committee; 4.

The name "Louhelen", a contraction of their first names, was originally used as in "Louhelen Ranch".&lt;ref name="LouBio" /&gt; Louhelen was also the name of their daughter and they also had a son Lewis Jr. both of which came along later.&lt;ref name="LouBio" /&gt;

=== Central States Baha'i School in the 1930s ===

==== 1931 ====

The July 1931 edition of ''Bahá'í News'' published the announcement of the program at the Central States Bahá'í Summer School, the first name of the school, August 1–9 with lodgings and two meals a day for $10-$12 for the week and noted correspondence should be sent to Helen Whitney Eggleston to an address in Detroit.&lt;ref name="BN53"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Central States Summer School |magazine=Bahá'í News |issn=0195-9212 |page=5 |issue=53 |date=July 1931 |url=http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&amp;page=425 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty included Harlan and Grace Ober, already active in the religion many years in the [[Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston|Boston area]] and [[Green Acre Bahá'í School]], Mabel and Howard Ives, [[Dorothy Beecher Baker|Dorothy Baker]], Fanny Knobloch, and Maye Harvey Gift.&lt;ref name="WO13"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Security that endures; glimpses of the Kitab-i-Iqan |author=Maye Harvey Gift |magazine=World Order |pages=278–84, 288 |date=Dec 1947 |volume=13 |issue=9 |url=https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File:World_Order_Vol13_Issue9.pdf&amp;page=28 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="centenary" /&gt; Mary Collison&lt;ref name="BN596"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Rebuilding Louhelen; US National Spiritual Assembly approves $1.8-million restoration of historic Michigan Bahá'í School |magazine=Bahá'í News |issn=0195-9212 |pages=10–11 |date=Nov 1980 |issue=596 |url=https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File:Baha%27i_News_596.pdf&amp;page=11 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Miss McKay were support staff.&lt;ref name="BN53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BN56"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Central states summer school 1931 |author=Bertha Kirkpatrick |magazine=Bahá'í News |page=4 |date=Nov 1931 |issue=56 |editor1=Sarah Walrath |editor2=Albert Windust |url=http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&amp;page=448 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obers and Ives planned the school as a committee.&lt;ref name="centenary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BN56" /&gt; 35 Baha'is and friends from six states attended all the sessions and about 50 others, mainly from Detroit and Flint, came as day students to one or more classes.&lt;ref name="LouhelenHistory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baha'i conducting school near Flint |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |location=Detroit, MI |page=4 |date=8 Aug 1931 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14565933/new_bahai_school_being_held_later/| access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker's entire family attended.&lt;ref name=Coppertogold&gt;{{cite book |author=Dorothy Freeman |title=From copper to gold: the life of Dorothy Baker |date=January 1984 |publisher=G.

Some 20 people attended the first day and about 90 total attended at least one day of activities.&lt;ref name="NineDays"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Nine days at Louhelen Ranch |author=Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick |magazine=Star of the West |pages=280–3 |date=Dec 1931 |volume=22 |issue=9 |url=http://starofthewest.info/viewer.erb?vol=22&amp;page=281| access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="centenary"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bahá'i centenary, 1844–1944: a record of America's response to Bahá'o'lláh's call to the realization of the oneness of mankind, to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Bahá'i faith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1fYAAAAMAAJ |year=1944 |publisher=Bahá'í publishing committee |pages=219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egglestons devoted themselves to developing the school's facilities. A small barn was partitioned into private rooms and became a [[Pullman (architecture)|Pullman type]] lodge, providing long narrow rooms. A dining porch was added to the main house to improve the serving of meals.&lt;ref name="LouhelenHistory" /&gt; 80 acres of the Eggleston farm were allotted to be used by the school.&lt;ref name="centenary" /&gt; A ravine was named Ridvan Garden.&lt;ref name="BN56" /&gt; Details were covered in the two main periodicals of the religion of the day - ''Bahá'í News'',&lt;ref name="BN56" /&gt; and ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'', the oldest large scale journal of the religion in the US, in December, 1931.&lt;ref name="NineDays" /&gt; Topics of the sessions included economics, the problem of greed and it's amelioration and another was practical and inspirational approaches to being trustworthy. There was also a daily class in public speaking, study of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s talks, a leading figure of the religion, children's classes, and international subjects. Recreational activities in the afternoon included swimming and horse-back riding. The author of the ''Star of the West'' article recalled there being a log cabin overlooking the ravine. Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick, a Baha'i since at least 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Publications |magazine=Bahá'í News |issn=0195-9212 |page=3 |date=Nov 1927 |issue=20 |url=http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&amp;page=158 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was present at this first session&lt;ref name="BN56" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NineDays" /&gt; and would long serve the school.

Noting the need for a center of activity between the coasts and the progress of the Eggleston and noted some 35 attendees with 90 at least some session. A message from [[Shoghi Effendi]], then head of the religion, was quoted "To achieve success in such manner the first year is certainly beyond what we could expect."&lt;ref name="BWv7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Horace Holley |title=Baha'i World |chapter=Current Baha'i activities; Louhelen Summer School |publisher=Baha'i Publishing Committee |series= |volume=vol 7 |date=1939 |pages=63–4 |url=https://bahai.works/Bahá’%C3%AD_World/Volume_7 |chapter-url=https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File%3ABW_Vol7_Pt1.pdf&amp;page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1932 ====

In 1932, the summer school became a recognized Bahá'í institution.&lt;ref name="centenary" /&gt; A committee was appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States consisting of Lou Eggleston, Dorothy Baker, and Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Baha'i summer schools; 3.

Several of the faculty – Vail, Gift, and Easterbrook being leaders from various Illinois communities – Urbana and Peoria especially – though Vail had already more of a nation visibility and had given up a likely winning career as a unitarian universalist minister and in the case of Easterbook position in the New Thought movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Lori L.

A meeting was arranged by local Rev. J. M. Pengelly&lt;ref name="BN70" /&gt; who became interested from the 1931 meeting where he attended the classes by Harlan Ober.&lt;ref name="BN199" /&gt; Pengelly also invited Ruth Moffett to address his church group.&lt;ref name="BN74" /&gt;

Average attendance during the school approached 60 (twice the previous year) and filled the accommodations.&lt;ref name="BN199" /&gt; An additional 10-20 from Detroit attended some days. 18-20 youth attended and some paid their way by service. Dorothy Baker supervised the youth who held their own forum, daily elected a chair from their own group and called for two short talks for each session followed by an open forum limiting the speaker to not comment further. Albert Vail's study of ''The Dawn-Breakers'', included instruction on Muslim history. Also $50 was gathered for donation to the Temple construction following a fundraiser by Orcella Rexford. She had attended at the urging of friends at the last minute and later wrote an article for ''Star of the West''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Baha'i summer school at Louhelen Ranch |author=Orcella Rexford |magazine=Star of the West |pages=194–6 |date=Sep 1932 |volume=23 |issue=6 |url=http://starofthewest.info/viewer.erb?vol=23&amp;page=194 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled driving past the ranch house on the winding driveway with a nine-sided building hosting water resources and staying in one of the new cabins. She noted the Pullman Lodge was two-story and that people had come from as far as California and Maine as well as one who had finished a round-the-world trip. Half the attendees were called youth and looked forward to "doing something". The closing night the youth presented an original play "O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us to see ourself as others see us" quoting [[Robert Burns]] and imitating various of the elders present.

Again the Egglestons looked at improving, adding, and remodeling buildings between this session and the next.

Dorothy Backer gave daily talks from ''The Dawn-Breakers''. Afternoon public meetings attracted a few visitors. Youth did the planning of evening events. Some 26 youth participated in total and included some non-Baha'is. Philip Sprague came late and gave a talk on the progress of the Temple. $500 was raised for it. Ruth Moffett gave a talk. [[Rúhíyyih Khanum|Mary Maxwell]], soon to marry Shoghi Effendi and change her name to Rúhíyyih Khanum, also gave two talks based on ''The Dawn-Breakers''. The final advertised program of faculty and topics was: Elizabeth Greenleaf ([[Kitáb-i-Íqán]],) Greenleaf and Harlan Ober (Baha'i Administration,) Dorothy Baker (''The Dawn-Breakers'',) Ober (religion and society,) Gretch Westervelt (new education,) Orcella Rexford (tomorrow,) Grace Obert (cycle of life,) Fanny Knobloch (Bahá'í Faith to South Africa,) Harlan Ober (New civilization,) and Baker (cosmic consciousness of unity.)&lt;ref name="BWV" /&gt;

Planned for June 30 to July 8, the faculty proposed were: Allen B.

At the time it was the only such session among any of the Baha'i schools.&lt;ref name="centenary" /&gt; However it happened July 10–13 instead of late June, and Dorothy Baker returned to lead the session assisted by Philip Sprague.&lt;ref name="BN82" /&gt; Mary Maxwell and James McCormick also assisted the youth group meeting.&lt;ref name="BWv7" /&gt; The youth group focused on dramatic re-enactments.&lt;ref name=Coppertogold/&gt;

The general session of nine days was to cost between $12.50 to $18.50. Detroit newspapers noted the gathering at Louhelen as well as the organizing committee including Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick and L. W. Eggleston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahai (sic) movement to hold conclave |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |location=Detroit, MI |page=4 |date=9 Jun 1934 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15378035/bahai_conference_at_louhelen_school/ | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conclave to be held by Bahai movement |newspaper=Detroit Times Saturday |location=Detroit, MI |page=10 |date=June 9, 1934 |url=https://www.genealogybank.com/nbshare/AC01170608203652011011513829052| access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also listed the members of the year's Detroit Assembly including Lou Eggleston as chair and Mrs. Eggleston as corresponding secretary.

Paine noted the school conference was 14 days long. Meditation and prayer, narratives of Baha'i history, principles of governance, and there was room for swimming and playing tennis, baseball or horse riding. Piano playing was also to be found as well as sing-alongs. She also noted the youth gathering for four days for the first time, and there was a conscious attempt to vary the faculty. She also states the goals of the schools:: to deepen one's knowledge of the religion, to have an opportunity for Baha'is to meet and find friendships, to inform seekers, and be a testing ground for spirit and precepts meet. A letter from Shoghi Effendi was addressed to that school's session.&lt;ref name="BNR119"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Extracts from Letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi |magazine=Baha'i National Review |page=6 |date=Apr 1982 |issue=119 |url=https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File:National_Bahai_Review_119.pdf&amp;page=6 | access-date = Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting the high goals of virtues, he said, ""the work in which you are engaged is dear and near to my heart and constitutes one of the most vital aspects of the manifold activities of our beloved Faith."&lt;ref name="BNR119" /&gt;

The 1935 season was scheduled to begin with a youth session June 24–27 with faculty and subjects as: Dorothy Baker (Baha'i Life), Bishop Brown (Baha'i approach to world problems), Shoghi Effendi's letters (run by the "Young People's Council"), What is the Baha'i movement (under the direction of the "Council"). This was followed by the general session June 29-July 7 with faculty and subjects: [[Horace Holley (Bahá'í)|Horace Holley]], (Baha'i activities,) [[Stanwood Cobb]], (''Security in a failing world'', based on his 1934 book,) Loulie Matthews (''Divine Art of Living'', material of which was gathered and published as early as 1940, see [[Bahá'í Faith on life after death#Bahá'íliterature|Bahá'í Faith on life after death]]), and a second general summer session August 19–24 not announcing faculty yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Baha'i Summer Schools - preliminary announcement 1935 program; 3.

Garreta Busey gave a class on public speaking. The general session followed with faculty Dorothy Baker, Glenn Shook, and Stanwood Cobb.&lt;ref name="BN107" /&gt; Baker's attendance was in the context of having given up her savings for [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] as a contribution for the Bahá'í Temple and her talks included her choice in a marriage partner being guided more by prayers than by her attraction to a willing suitor.&lt;ref name=Coppertogold/&gt;

The densest and largest concentration of Bahá'í youth in America was in the Midwest from the south of the Urbana-Peoria region north through Chicago to Milwaukee-Kenosha, and across America by far the largest gathering of youth to 1936 was at Louhelen.&lt;ref name=BN99/&gt;&lt;ref name=BW6-Youth/&gt;

A change in 1938 was an added youth session and changed one of the general sessions into a laboratory session as suggested by Marion Holley.&lt;ref name="BN199" /&gt; The laboratory session was added to allow students to concentrate on special projects; in 1938 it was a study project of 10 days by H.

Cobb's lectures developed for Louhelen classes in recent years were presented as a series of articles in ''World Order magazine'' across 1938 and collected and printed as a book as well.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite magazine |title=Summer school lectures in book form |magazine=Bahá'í News |page=6 |date=Nov 1938 |issue=120 |url=http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=102 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}

The Ketels worked registration, housing and meals; some money was spent on equipment and repairs, and total income was $4671 with expenses of $4477,&lt;ref name="BN222" /&gt; and tax-exemption for the school was obtained.&lt;ref name="BN222" /&gt; The youth session rate was $1.75 per day, and for the general session between $2 and $3 per day - the rates were generally half or less than for Green Acre and less than those of Geyserville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Summer schools rates and reservations; Louhelen |magazine=Bahá'í News |issn=0195-9212 |page=10 |date=May 1948 |url=http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=1144 | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Yeutter taught the junior youth school in June,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Local girl to teach religion at Baha'i &lt;!-- "Morjorie" is incorrect --&gt; |newspaper=Lansing State Journal |location=Lansing, MI |page=28 |date=23 Jun 1948 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10138592/bahai_morjorie_sic_margaret/| access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by a general session in later July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baha'i school to open third adult session |newspaper=Lansing State Journal |location=Lansing, MI |page=3 |date=26 Jul 1948 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10138629/bahai_classes_at_louhelen/ | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Haggard gave a talk on the Baha'i Temple in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baha'i Temple topic of talk |newspaper=Detroit Times |location=Detroit, MI |page=4 |date=August 7, 1948 |url=https://www.genealogybank.com/nbshare/AC01170608203652011011513864055| access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="An imaginary trip through the Baha'i House of Worship"… |newspaper=Lansing State Journal |location=Lansing, MI |page=11 |date=3 Aug 1948 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10138667/bahai_john_haggard_talk_at_louhelen/ | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Jamir, Paul Becker, and [[Firuz Kazemzadeh]] taught classes of the junior youth and youth session.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite news |title=Michael Jamir… |newspaper=Lansing State Journal |location=Lansing, MI |page=13 |date=9 Aug 1948 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10138714/bahai_michael_jamir_teaches_junior/ | access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}

It was now considered a tradition to begin each day of the session with prayer and meditation. The first program was a concert and then three periods of discussion followed. One was led by Donald Corbin on the history and growth of the administration including a play written by Ruhiyyih Khanum. The next was by Ellsworth Blackwell, his second appearance on campus, on "the challenging requirement". And the last was by Mrs. George A. True, chair of the program committee, with a panel including Edwin Earldley who was chair of the Louhelen maintenance committee reviewing a deep history of the school and operational procedures. A costume party was held the next day with a picnic supper at "the Glen". Alumni sent letters from Switzerland, Brazil, and Japan and audio wire recording were presented - a talk on [[The Seven Valleys]], another to accompany a slide presentation, and from the convention talk about Louhelen. Five alumni Latin American pioneers were also present. A letter of pioneers to Puerto Rico was intended for the Louhelen "homecoming" for alumni arrived too late but was published in ''Bahá'í News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Puerto Rico |magazine=Bahá'í News |issn=0195-9212 |page=10 |date=Oct 1948 |issue=212 |url=http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=03&amp;page=22| access-date =Jan 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first year without the founders directly involved with maintenance and conducting functions now taken on by committees.

The '''Miracle of Love''' is a [[new religious movement]] based in Denver, Colorado. Miracle of Love now goes by the name Center For the Golden One.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Until 2010 it was headed by two leaders, Kalindi La Gourasana and The Lady, described by the organization as fully realized spiritual masters. The group's stated mission is to break people free from the cycle of birth and death and bring them home to God in this lifetime.  The central guidance on how to do this derives from the teachings of Gourasana, a benevolent being.&lt;ref name=Breaking&gt;{{cite book|title=Breaking the cycle of birth &amp; death|author=Lord Gourasana|location=San Diego, CA |publisher=Miracle of Love|year=1996|edition=3rd|isbn=978-0-9651626-0-9|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Miracle of Love was started in 1987 by David Swanson, his wife Carole Seidman (who took the name Kalindi) and The Lady, and several other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miracle.org/gourasana-brochure.html|title=Who is Gourasana?|accessdate=2010-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308063340/http://www.miracle.org/gourasana-brochure.html|archivedate=2010-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is when the benevolent Being Gourasana is believed to have entered David Swanson's body as "an Incarnation of God manifesting on Earth".&lt;ref name=Breaking/&gt;  After David Swanson's death in 1995, Gourasana is said to have begun speaking through Kalindi.&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;{{cite news|date=March 17, 2006|title=Miracle of Love|first=JILL|last=KRAMER|work=[[Pacific Sun (newspaper)|Pacific Sun]]|url=http://www.pacificsun.com/story_archives/love_cult.html|location=San Rafael, California|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051901/http://www.pacificsun.com/story_archives/love_cult.html|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalindi died on April 18, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries &amp; Memorials|work=Denver Post|date=April 23, 2010|page=B.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=|title=Kalindi La Gourasana Obituary in Denver Post|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/denverpost/obituary.aspx?n=kalindi-la-gourasana&amp;pid=142120694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trademark request for "Gourasana Meditation Practice" was filed in 1996 by Church of Exodus in San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/index.jsp|title=Trademark #75138502|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|accessdate=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 press release announced that the Miracle of Love Seminar was being offered in a shorter, 5-day format led by Cole Kaplan, a disciple of Kalindi. The release says that the seminar was first offered in San Diego, California, in 1991, and that over 5,000 people had participated since then at locations in the U.S., Europe, South America, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Miracle of Love® Launches Powerful New 5-Day Seminar Format|date=March 23, 2009|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/kalindi/meditation/prweb2254774.htm|publisher=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
The Miracle of Love teaches that this material plane of existence is one of duality, with inevitable pain, suffering, and death, to which we are locked by our attachments, and these attachments cause us to be reborn in a cycle of [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name=Breaking/&gt;

The Miracle of Love teaches that people can break free of this cycle and achieve full union with God in this lifetime by surrendering the ego and separate will to God, following the guidance of the leaders, giving in service, and using the special assistance provided by Lord Gourasana in the ''Gourasana Meditation Practice'' to break material and conceptual attachments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gourasana Meditation Practice'' by Gourasana (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=March 2011}}

The Miracle of Love has been described by the ''[[Pacific Sun (newspaper)|Pacific Sun]]'' newspaper as having aspects of a [[large group awareness training]] (LGAT) group.&lt;ref name=Kramer/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="928">'''Mnestheus''' is a character from [[Roman mythology]], found in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. He is described by Virgil as the ancestral hero of the [[Memmia (gens)|Memmii]] and "Of the house of Assaracus". One of a handful of vaguely defined lieutenants under [[Aeneas]], he appears to be Aeneas's most senior captain, taking charge in Book 9 in his absence. He takes second place in the boat race during the funeral games of [[Anchises]] in Book 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">'''Moderately prosperous society '''({{zh|s=小康社会|p=xiǎokāngshèhuì}}) is a Chinese term, originally of [[Confucianism]], used to describe a society composed of a functional [[middle-class]]. The term is best known in recent years through its use by [[Hu Jintao]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] between 2002 and 2012, when referring to economic policies intended to realize a more equal distribution of wealth.

In the usages (''tifa'') of current General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]], the term "China dream" or "Chinese dream" has gained somewhat greater prominence. During the annual National Party Congress meeting of 2015, Xi unveiled a set of political slogans called the [[Four Comprehensives]], which include "Comprehensively build a moderately prosperous society."&lt;ref&gt;"China's Xi Jinping unveils new 'four comprehensives' slogans" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-31622571]) [[BBC]] 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
It has been loosely translated as a "basically well-off" society in which the people are able to live relatively comfortably, albeit ordinarily. The term was first used in ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' written as early as 3,000 years ago. ''Xiaokang'' may be associated with an [[Engel's law|Engel's coefficient]] of 40-50 percent.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Modern political discourse ==

Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] used the terms ''Xiaokang society'' in 1979 as the eventual goal of Chinese modernization.

The vision of a ''xiaokang'' society is one in which most people are moderately well off and [[middle class]], and in which economic prosperity is sufficient to move most of the population in mainland China into comfortable means, but in which economic advancement is not the sole focus of society.  Explicitly incorporated into the concept of a ''Xiaokang'' society is the idea that economic growth needs to be balanced with sometimes conflicting goals of social equality and environmental protection.

The current usage of the term also invokes [[Chinese philosophy]] in support of modern [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]].  In Chinese writings, a ''xiaokang'' society was the predecessor to the [[Great Unity]].  There is a rough correspondence between this progression and the progression in Chinese Marxism between a market socialist society and [[world communism]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}

The revival of the concept of a ''Xiaokang'' Society was in part a criticism of social trends in mainland China in the 1990s under [[Jiang Zemin]], in which many in China felt was focusing too much on the newly rich and not enough on mainland China's rural poor.  Furthermore, there has been a fear in some circles that Chinese society has become too materialistic placing material wealth above all other social needs.

In contrast to previous concepts such as the [[spiritual civilization]] and the campaigns against [[bourgeois liberalization]] in the 1980s, the concept of the ''Xiaokang'' society does not involve heroic self-sacrifice and does not place the material and the spiritual in opposition.  The vision of a ''Xiaokang'' society sees the need for economic growth to provide prosperity, but it sees the need for this prosperity to be broadly distributed.

In addition, the concept of a ''Xiaokang'' society is the first time in which the [[Communist Party of China]] has used a [[classical Chinese]] concept to legitimize its vision for the future of China. Its recent use has been associated with [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]] as a goal for [[mainland China]] to reach by the year 2020.

''Xiaokang'' is also a name for a semi-monthly magazine that is affiliated to the [[Qiushi]] Magazine, the party-run magazine in Beijing. Started in 2004, it mainly focuses on the political and economic development in China. Referred to itself as "Insight China", ''Xiaokang'' defines itself as a magazine that voices public opinions and discuss the current affairs regarding the Chinese Politics and social cultures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2044">The '''''Oracle of the Potter''''' is a [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Hellenistic Egyptian]] prophetic text, originally written in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]] in the 3rd century BC. However, there are only five remaining [[Greek language|Greek]] [[manuscript]] copies of the document on [[papyrus]] (parts of two manuscripts were rewritten, likely in the 2nd century BC following the failed rebellion of Harsiesis in 132-130 BC) dated to the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD during the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule of Egypt]].&lt;ref name="gozzoli 2006 297 298"&gt;Gozzoli (2006), pp. 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt; A potter is the [[prophet]] and [[protagonist]] of the story, an allusion to [[Khnum]], the "Lord of the potter's wheel" who fashioned the world in [[Egyptian mythology]].&lt;ref name="gozzoli 2006 297 298"/&gt;
The text was composed as anti-[[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] propaganda: the potter tells the king [[Amenhotep|Amenophis/Amenhotep]], who writes everything down and reveals it to all men, of the future chaos and destruction that will follow the unfair, foreign rule of the [[Typhon]]/[[Set (mythology)|Set]]-worshipping "beltwearers" (Greeks) whose city ([[Alexandria]]) will be deserted when they kill each other in the troubled times. [[Hephaestus]]/[[Ptah]] will return to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] along with [[Agathos Daimon]]/[[Shai]] (the patron [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] of Alexandria) who will abandon the beltwearers' city.

The story is comparable in style, tone, and subject matter to prophetic texts of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], such as the ''[[Prophecy of Neferti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gozzoli (2006), 301-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of the Pillar of Imus''' (Spanish: ''Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Imus'') is a venerated image of the [[Madonna and Child]] atop a pillar in Imus, Philippines. It is enshrined in the Cathedral of Imus. It is known as the Mother, Queen, and the Patroness of [[Diocese of Imus]] and the [[Province of Cavite]]. The image was given a [[canonical coronation]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2012.

==History==
According to the ''Official Archives of the Recollects in the Philippines'' this is the history of the devotion to the Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Imus that was brought in what was then known as "Hacienda de Imus".

In 1623 Fr. Martin Lumbreras Sanches Perez Peralta, ORSA (Blessed Martin de San Nicholas, 1598–1632) came to the Philippines. Fr. Martin, being a native of [[Zaragoza]], had a deep devotion to the Blessed Virgin under the title "[[Nuestra Señora del Pilar]]". He brought with him an image of Virgen del Pilar which was first brought to the church of [[San Nicholas de Tolentino]] at [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]] where it was enthroned on a small altar specifically made for the image. The devotion to the Virgen del Pilar grew within the walled city of Intramuros, a group in honor of the Virgin which was called "Obras Pias de la [[Nuestra Señora del Pilar]]" was formed by a devotee and named Juan de la Virgen del Pilar; this group's goal was to handle the funds of the Church.

On the 28th of May 1694 the [[Recollect]] Friars all agreed that the image of the Virgin of the Pillar be transferred from her small altar in the San Nicholas de Tolentino Church to the Casa Hacienda de Imus (Cuartel at present), the image was temporarily placed in the Enfermaria (a room where priests rest). On the 13th of March 1766 the Recollect Corporation approved a plan to construct a new church in the Hacienda in honor of the Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Imus that the people of Imus often referred to as '''"''Nana Pilar''"''' (Our Mother Pillar).

===The image===
Several miracles and explainable events are also narrated by the people of Imus attributed to Nana Pilar, the following are some of the accounts:

On the 27 of August 2010 Nana Pilar manifested her protection; there was an outing of the young clergy in [[Morong, Bataan]], where young priests, deacons and seminarians joined. While they were swimming in the beach a strong under current brought one of the deacons, Rev. Marco Cyril Convento (now a priest), to the deeper part of the sea. The deacon's companions were in distraught as they tried to save him from drowning. They were starting to fear the worse and started praying for him when all of a sudden the deacon was seen in the shallow part of the sea, without a single trace of injury. In thanksgiving they headed to the nearest church in the area; they were all astonished to find out that the town is also under the patronage of Nuestra Señora del Pilar. Reverend Convento and his companions attribute this miracle to no other than the Patroness of the [[Diocese of Imus]]: Nana Pilar, to whom they've dedicated their vocation.

Ms. Vida Ramirez Corral accounted two miracles that happened to her mother. First was in 2002, when her mother suffered a stroke caused by a large clot in her brain and an operation should be done immediately to prevent further complications, but as the doctors were about to start the surgery they were surprised to find out that the clot got smaller and the operation was no longer needed. Curious about such an astonishing find, Ms. Corral's mother told them that before the scheduled operation she was visited by Nana Pilar. The Virgin once again showed how powerful prayers through her intercession is when in 2003, Ms. Corral's mother was diagnosed with Cholelthiasis (stones in the gall bladder) and once again scheduled for an operation. Days before the surgery, tests were conducted to know the status of the patient, they find out that not a single trace of the stones could be found, and the operation was no longer needed. Once again Ms. Corral's mother accounted that Nana Pilar visited her in her dreams and touched her affected area.

In 2001 the Virgin of the Pillar manifested her love for her children when a miracle, through her intercession, happened; It was almost fiesta already when one of the seminarians of the Tahanan ng Mabuting Pastol Seminary, named Conrad Merdeguia, was stricken with [[Dengue]]. His platelets were severely low and that the worst thing that could happen to him is to die. Hoping that prayers could help, Bishop [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] who was the parish priest of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Pilar in [[Imus City]] asked Conrad's co-seminarians to dance during the [[Karakol]] for that year, with only one petition in mind: to ask Nana Pilar's intercession for Conrad's healing. Their prayers were quickly granted when a phone call from the hospital right after the Karakol that Conrad has miraculously recovered from [[Dengue]] already and was already out of danger. At present Mr. Merdeguia is already a professor in Theology in a school at [[Masbate, Philippines]].

Not know to many that a Saint of the Roman Catholic Church once served the Parish of Imus. He is St.[[Ezequiel Moreno]] OAR. It was in 1892 that Fr. Moreno was sent to be the Administrator of the Hacienda de Imus and to help the parish priest Fray Jose Maria Learte, ORSA with the [[Cholera]] epidemic that greatly affected the Hacienda. It is said that Fr. Moreno often prayed in front of the Image of Nana Pilar and ask for the cessation of the [[Epidemic]]; the outbreak did kill 3,200 Imuseño, but with the grace of God and intercession of the Blessed Mother it did stop. Fr. Moreno served Imus from 1882 to 1885. He was raised to the Altars as Saint of the Church on October 11, 1992, coincidentally on the eve of the feast of the Virgin of the Pillar, by [[Pope John Paul II]].

In the late 1940s as the Japanese soldiers were about to leave the county they had a plot to bomb the Isabel bridge near the Cuartel, but this never materialized because a mother carrying her son had stopped them from doing so. Later on when the Japanese soldier went by the church, he marveled at the countenance of the Virgin in the altar for he knew that he had seen the face before. He called the other soldiers and asked them to come and see for themselves the image of the Virgin in the altar. It was then that they all agreed that the Virgin in the Altar is the same woman who stopped them from bombing the Isabel bridge near Cuartel.

In recent times, the maternal protection radiated by Our Lady of the Pillar to Imuseños is frequently felt, be it through actual miracles or ones that are spiritual felt by her devotees, Nana Pilar's guidance and love has always reign in the hearts of the people of [[Imus]].

According to the devotees, the Town of Imus is steadfast because it is being overseen by its Mother and Queen. Calamities and misfortunes are minimized or eventually eliminated because of the loved being shown by the Virgin of the Pillar. Just like the Blessed Apostle James, in time of despair, Imuseños immediately run to their mother, Nana Pilar to ask for her intercession; in times of sickness, the also turn to Nana Pilar for her help and guidance, while some are healed others who are still in their beds with illness are given strength and the ability to accept the will of the Lord.

===Hacienda de Imus===
[[Imus City]] was formed part of the ''Hacienda de Imus'' owned by the [[Recollect]] Fathers in 1686. These include the Encomienda de Binakayan (Binakayan, Kawit) and Perez-Dasmariñas ([[Dasmariñas City]]) which is a former barrio of Imus.

Like [[Cavite City]] (originally called Cavite La Punta) and [[Noveleta, Cavite]] (La Tierra Alta) the Hacienda de Imus (now [[Imus City]]) use to be a barrio of Cavite el Viejo (now [[Kawit, Cavite]]), whose parish church was built by the Jesuits during the administration of Manila Archbishop, Garcia Serrano, from 1618 to 1329. For more than a century and a half the people of Imus had to endure walking or traveling 4.5 kilometers of dirt road to attend religious services or transact official business in the Cavite el Viejo. The difficulty of communication between Imus and Kawit was long-standing complaint of the Imuseños until another religious order, the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]], as a consequence to the British occupation of Manila in 1762, established a Parish Church in Imus, in what now known as Bayang Luma (now Bayanluma).

However, the church was far from the estate house acquired by the [[Recollect]] Corporation, and when the church was destroyed by a strong typhoon of September 1779, the [[Recollect]] Friars transferred it to Barrio Toclong and then finally to Sitio de Balangon, now the present site of the church.

In 1769, the workers of the Hacienda together with the ''Cabezas de barangay'' completed the relocation of their houses into a ''reduccion''. The reduccion was a process of resetting the people near the church called ''Bajo de Campanas'' to facilitate the evangelization of the people and also to put them under the control of the Spanish Authority. The people who refused to live within the reduccion were called ''taong labas'' which often times had the connotation of being lawless people.

With the establishment of the Recollect Church the people of Imus gained their religious emancipation from the [[Jesuit]] run parish of Cavite el Viejo. The Recollects, however, wouldn't be contented with the little victory. In 1774, Racollect Fary Pedro San Buenaventure, ORSA petitioned the government to "separate the inquilinos of Imus from the political jurisdiction of the government of Cavite el Viejo". After a considerable time of waiting, the petition was granted and Imus became an independent Municipality on October 3, 1795 (9 days before the Feast of Nuestra Señora del Pilar).

===Canonical Coronation===
[[Pope Benedict XVI]] acknowledged the petition of the miracles claimed by  devotees in 2012, authorizing the coronation of the image via a Papal bull.  The [[Canonical Coronation]] was carried out on 3 December  2012 in [[Imus Cathedral]] by [[Luis Antonio Tagle|Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle]] in celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the Diocese.

Prince '''Pashaura Singh''' (1821 – 11 September 1845) (also ''Peshawara Singh'') was one of the sons of [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]].&lt;ref name=Pashaura&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Pashaura Singh Kanvar (1821-1845) |last1=Khurana |first1=J. S. |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Rani Daya Kaur. After the assassination of Maharaja [[Sher Singh]] he made a bid for the throne of the [[Sikh Empire]].

==Emergence as a contender for the throne==
Little is recorded about the early life of  Pashaura Singh during the reigns of Ranjit Singh and his first four successors.  After the assassination, on 15 September 1843,  of Maharaha [[Sher Singh]] and his vizier Raja Dhian Singh Dogra, the Khalsa proclaimed [[Duleep Singh]] as Maharaja and Dhian Singh’s son, Hira Singh Dogra, as vizier. 

Later that year Pashaura Singh and his elder brother, Kashmira Singh, are recorded as having joined the camp of the holy man, Baba Bir Singh at Nauraṅgābād, near Tarn Tāran. The camp had become the centre of Sikh revolt against the dominance of the Dogras and was a base for several Sikh sardars and commanders and a volunteer army of 1,200 musket men and 3,000 horse.&lt;ref name=Bir&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Bir Singh Baba (1768-1844) |last1=Khurana |first1=J. S. |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1844 Hira Singh despatched a force of 20,000 men and 50 cannon under the command of Mian Labh Singh to destroy Bir Singh’s camp. Bir Singh told his men not to fight “How can we attack our brethren?”  He was killed by a shell while meditating over the Holy Book. Kashmira Singh was also killed in the cannonade, but Pashaura Singh escaped.&lt;ref name=Bir/&gt;

Pashaura Singh visited Lahore later in 1844 in an unsuccessful attempt to form an alliance with Hira Singh, who, however had his own problems.  He had lost favour with the Khalsa, because of several unpopular actions, including: his involvement in the death of Bir Singh, his confiscation of the [[jagir]]s of some of the army commanders, and his attempt to poison the Regent, Maharani [[Jind Kaur]]. He escaped from Lahore with several loads of gold and silver stolen from the treasury, but was pursued by the army, who killed him on 21 December 1844.&lt;ref name=Hira&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Hira Singh Dogra (1816-1844) |last1=Sukhdev Singh Charak |first1= |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed bid for the throne==
During the second half of 1844, Pashaura Singh travelled around the Punjab seeking support against the Dogras. He crossed the [[Sutlej River]] and visited the British cantonment at [[Firozpur|Ferozepur]]. However, the British were unresponsive, being already in negotiation with [[Gulab Singh]] Dogra, brother of Dhian Singh.&lt;ref name=Pashaura/&gt;

On learning of the death of Hira Singh, Pashaura Singh returned to Lahore on 1 January 1845. He was received with honour and goodwill in the court, and was offered presents of jewels, elephants and horses. Some of the army commanders proposed that he should be made Maharaja in place of the six-year-old Duleep Singh. However, some influential members of the Supreme Council of the Khalsa and the regimental committees supported the young Maharaja and his mother, Maharani Jind Kaur. They requested him to return to his estates, with a promise of an increase in his jagir, and the army ordered him to leave Lahore.&lt;ref name=Pashaura/&gt;

A new vizier, the Maharani’s brother, Jawahar Singh, was appointed on 14 May 1845 and immediately despatched artillery against a force being assembled by Pashaura Singh. The Prince capitulated, but was allowed to go free.

==Attock rebellion==
Two months later, in July 1845, Pashaura Singh took the fort at [[Attock]] with a handful of [[Pashtun people|Pathan]] followers and declared himself to be the ruler of the Punjab. He raised fresh levies and, with the money that the fort yielded to him, tried to obtain help from the chiefs within the kingdom, from [[Jhelum|Jehlum]] to [[Khyber Pass|Khaibar]], and even opened negotiations with [[Dost Mohammad Khan|Dost Muhammad]].

After hearing of the rebellion in Attock, Jawahar Singh ordered [[Chattar Singh Attariwalla]] and [[Malik Fateh Khan Tiwana]] to recapture the fort and defeat Pashaura Singh. The prince was forced to surrender the fort on 30 August 1845 and place himself at the disposal of Chattar Singh, after receiving assurances of safe passage to Lahore and the retention of his estates at [[Sialkot]].

However, Jawahar Singh considered that the Prince posed too great a threat to his nephew, the young Maharaja, and sent instructions that Pashaura Singh be disposed of immediately. The prince was secretly removed from his personal bodyguard on 11 September 1845, and taken back by Fateh Khan Tiwana to Attock where he was strangled. For his part in this, Jawahar Singh was speared to death by the army on 21 September 1845 in front of his sister, the agonised Maharani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Jawahar Singh (1814-1845) |last1=Khurana |first1=J.

'''Patiala Shahi Pagg''' ([[turban]]) is a turban style based upon the turban style of old kings. This is also known as ''Tehdi Pagg''. It was also known as Kharbuja Pagg.It is the most common among all turbans and usually worn in the north part [[India]], specially in [[Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnapatiala.com/patiala-special/the-punjabi-pagg-and-the-evolution-of-the-patiala-shahi-pagg/|title=The Punjabi Pagg and the Evolution of the Patiala Shahi Pagg- Apna Patiala|website=www.apnapatiala.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patialashahiturban.com|title=Home - Patiala Shahi Turban|website=Patiala Shahi Turban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of this turban is really royal. There are two parts of this turban. One is left and other is right. Both look similar, but comparatively to one side, other looks inverted.Its completely different from Morni or Pochvi Dastar which is mostly of pointed shape

'''Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|p|l|ɑ:|s}}; {{IPA-fr|pjɛʁ simɔ̃ laplas|lang}}; 23 March 1749&amp;nbsp;– 5 March 1827) was a French scholar whose work was important to the development of [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[physics]] and [[astronomy]]. He summarized and extended the work of his predecessors in his five-volume [[Traité de mécanique céleste|''Mécanique Céleste'']] (''[[Celestial Mechanics]]'') (1799–1825). This work translated the geometric study of [[classical mechanics]] to one based on [[calculus]], opening up a broader range of problems. In statistics, the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian interpretation]] of probability was developed mainly by Laplace.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, Stephen M. (1986). ''The History of Statistics: The Measurement of Uncertainty before 1900''. Harvard University Press, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laplace formulated [[Laplace's equation]], and pioneered the [[Laplace transform]] which appears in many branches of [[mathematical physics]], a field that he took a leading role in forming. The [[Laplace operator|Laplacian differential operator]], widely used in mathematics, is also named after him. He restated and developed the [[nebular hypothesis]] of the [[origin of the Solar System]] and was one of the first scientists to postulate the existence of [[black hole]]s and the notion of [[gravitational collapse]].

Laplace is remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time. Sometimes referred to as the ''French [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'' or ''Newton of France'', he has been described as possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of any of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Laplace, Pierre Simon |volume=16 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was Napoleon's examiner when [[Napoleon]] attended the [[Ecole Militaire]] in Paris in 1784.
Laplace became a count of the [[First French Empire|Empire]] in 1806 and was named a [[marquess|marquis]] in 1817, after the [[Bourbon Restoration]].

==Early years==
Some records of Laplace's life were burned in 1925 with the family [[château]] in [[Saint Julien de Mailloc]], near [[Lisieux]], the home of his great-great-grandson the Comte de Colbert-Laplace. Others had been destroyed earlier, when his house at [[Arcueil]] near Paris was looted by house breakers in 1871.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;"Laplace, being Extracts from Lectures delivered by [[Karl Pearson]]", ''[[Biometrika]]'', vol. 21, December 1929, pp. 202–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laplace was born in [[Beaumont-en-Auge]], Normandy on 23 March 1749, a village four miles west of [[Pont-l'Évêque, Calvados|Pont l'Eveque]]. According to [[W. W. Rouse Ball]],&lt;ref&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] ''A Short Account of the History of Mathematics'', 4th edition, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; his father, Pierre de Laplace, owned and farmed the small estates of Maarquis. His great-uncle, Maitre Oliver de Laplace, had held the title of Chirurgien Royal. It would seem that from a pupil he became an usher in the school at Beaumont; but, having procured a letter of introduction to [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], he went to Paris to advance his fortune. However, [[Karl Pearson]]&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt; is scathing about the inaccuracies in Rouse Ball's account and states:
{{quote|Indeed [[Caen]] was probably in Laplace's day the most intellectually active of all the towns of Normandy. It was here that [[Laplace]] was educated and was provisionally a professor. It was here he wrote his first paper published in the ''Mélanges'' of the [[Royal Society of Turin]], Tome iv. 1766–1769, at least two years before he went at 22 or 23 to Paris in 1771. Thus before he was 20 he was in touch with [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in [[Turin]]. He did not go to Paris a raw self-taught country lad with only a peasant background! In 1765 at the age of sixteen Laplace left the "School of the Duke of Orleans" in Beaumont and went to the [[University of Caen]], where he appears to have studied for five years and was a member of the Sphinx. The '[[École Militaire]]' of Beaumont did not replace the old school until 1776.}}

His parents were from comfortable families. His father was Pierre Laplace, and his mother was Marie-Anne Sochon. The Laplace family was involved in agriculture until at least 1750, but Pierre Laplace senior was also a [[cider]] merchant and ''[[syndic]]'' of the town of Beaumont.

Pierre Simon Laplace attended a school in the village run at a [[Benedictine]] [[priory]], his father intending that he be ordained in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. At sixteen, to further his father's intention, he was sent to the [[University of Caen]] to read theology.&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Laplace}}. Retrieved 25 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university, he was mentored by two enthusiastic teachers of mathematics, [[Christophe Gadbled]] and Pierre Le Canu, who awoke his zeal for the subject. Here Laplace's brilliance as a mathematician was quickly recognised and while still at Caen he wrote a memoir ''Sur le Calcul integral aux differences infiniment petites et aux differences finies''. This provided the first intercourse between Laplace and Lagrange. Lagrange was the senior by thirteen years, and had recently founded in his native city [[Turin]] a journal named ''Miscellanea Taurinensia'', in which many of his early works were printed and it was in the fourth volume of this series that Laplace's paper appeared. About this time, recognising that he had no vocation for the priesthood, he determined to become a professional mathematician. Some sources state that he then broke with the church and became an atheist.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  Laplace did not graduate in theology but left for Paris with a letter of introduction from Le Canu to [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] who at that time was supreme in scientific circles.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Whittaker (Vol. 33, No. 303 (Feb. 1949), pp. 1–12), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3608408?uid=2474910407&amp;uid=3738256&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2474910417&amp;uid=2474910407&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21104214965391 "Laplace"], The Mathematical Gazette.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his great-great-grandson,&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt; d'Alembert received him rather poorly, and to get rid of him gave him a thick mathematics book, saying to come back when he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.

Another account is that Laplace solved overnight a problem that d'Alembert set him for submission the following week, then solved a harder problem the following night. D'Alembert was impressed and recommended him for a teaching place in the ''[[École Militaire]]''.&lt;ref name="gillsipie3n4"&gt;Gillispie (1997), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

With a secure income and undemanding teaching, Laplace now threw himself into original research and for the next seventeen years, 1771–1787, he produced much of his original work in astronomy.&lt;ref name="ball"&gt;Rouse Ball (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1780–1784, Laplace and French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] collaborated on several experimental investigations, designing their own equipment for the task.{{cn|date=May 2018}} In 1783 they published their joint paper, Memoir on Heat, in which they discussed the kinetic theory of molecular motion. In their experiments they measured the [[specific heat]] of various bodies, and the expansion of metals with increasing temperature. They also measured the boiling points of [[ethanol]] and [[ethyl ether|ether]] under pressure.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Laplace further impressed the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], and already by 1771 Laplace felt entitled to membership in the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. However, that year admission went to [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]] and in 1772 to [[Jacques Antoine Joseph Cousin]]. Laplace was disgruntled, and early in 1773 d'Alembert wrote to [[Lagrange]] in Berlin to ask if a position could be found for Laplace there. However, Condorcet became permanent secretary of the ''Académie'' in February and Laplace was elected associate member on 31 March, at age&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;ref name="gillsipie5"&gt;Gillispie (1997), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1773 Laplace read his paper on the invariability of planetary motion in front of the Academy des Sciences. That March he was elected to the academy, a place where he conducted the majority of his science.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/ils202fall11/home/student-wikis/group5/ "Effects of the Scientific Community on Laplace"] Retrieved on 10 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 1788,&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 99. However, Gillispie (1997), p. 67, gives the month of the marriage as May.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Several sources give the date of marriage as 1788, but Pearson quotes the great-great-grandson as saying that Sophie (his great-grandmother) was born in 1787.--&gt;&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt; at the age of thirty-nine, Laplace married [[Marie-Charlotte de Courty de Romanges]], an eighteen-year-old woman from a 'good' family in [[Besançon]].&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was celebrated at [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris]]. The couple had a son, Charles-Émile (1789–1874), and a daughter, Sophie-Suzanne (1792–1813).&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie (1997), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis, probability, and astronomical stability==
Laplace's early published work in 1771 started with [[differential equations]] and [[finite differences]] but he was already starting to think about the mathematical and philosophical concepts of probability and statistics.&lt;ref name="gillispiech2"&gt;Gillispie (1989), pp. 7–12&lt;/ref&gt; However, before his election to the ''Académie'' in 1773, he had already drafted two papers that would establish his reputation. The first, ''Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements'' was ultimately published in 1774 while the second paper, published in 1776, further elaborated his statistical thinking and also began his systematic work on [[celestial mechanics]] and the stability of the Solar System. The two disciplines would always be interlinked in his mind. "Laplace took probability as an instrument for repairing defects in knowledge."&lt;ref name="gillispie14n15"&gt;Gillispie (1989). pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace's work on probability and statistics is discussed below with his mature work on the analytic theory of probabilities.

===Stability of the Solar System===
Sir [[Isaac Newton]] had published his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 in which he gave a derivation of [[Kepler's laws]], which describe the motion of the planets, from his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. However, though Newton had privately developed the methods of calculus, all his published work used cumbersome geometric reasoning, unsuitable to account for the more subtle higher-order effects of interactions between the planets. Newton himself had doubted the possibility of a mathematical solution to the whole, even concluding that periodic [[Miracle|divine intervention]] was necessary to guarantee the stability of the Solar System. Dispensing with the hypothesis of divine intervention would be a major activity of Laplace's scientific life.&lt;ref name="eb2001"&gt;Whitrow (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally regarded that Laplace's methods on their own, though vital to the development of the theory, are not sufficiently [[accuracy and precision|precise]] to demonstrate the [[stability of the Solar System]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Celletti, A. | author2=Perozzi, E. | last-author-amp=yes | date=2007 | title=Celestial Mechanics: The Waltz of the Planets | location=Berlin | publisher=Springer | isbn=0-387-30777-X | pages=91–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, the Solar System is understood to be [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], although it happens to be fairly stable.

One particular problem from [[observational astronomy]] was the apparent instability whereby Jupiter's orbit appeared to be shrinking while that of Saturn was expanding. The problem had been tackled by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1748 and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] in 1763 but without success.&lt;ref name="whittakerb"&gt;Whittaker (1949b)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, Laplace published a memoir in which he first explored the possible influences of a purported [[luminiferous ether]] or of a law of gravitation that did not act instantaneously. He ultimately returned to an intellectual investment in Newtonian gravity.&lt;ref name="gillispie29to35"&gt;Gillispie (1989). pp. 29–35&lt;/ref&gt; Euler and Lagrange had made a practical approximation by ignoring small terms in the equations of motion. Laplace noted that though the terms themselves were small, when [[Integral|integrated]] over time they could become important. Laplace carried his analysis into the higher-order terms, up to and including the [[Cubic function|cubic]]. Using this more exact analysis, Laplace concluded that any two planets and the sun must be in mutual equilibrium and thereby launched his work on the stability of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="gillispie35n36"&gt;Gillispie (1989), pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald James Whitrow]] described the achievement as "the most important advance in physical astronomy since Newton".&lt;ref name="eb2001"/&gt;

Laplace had a wide knowledge of all sciences and dominated all discussions in the ''Académie''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Laplace.html School of Mathematics and Statistics], [[University of St Andrews]], Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace seems to have regarded analysis merely as a means of attacking physical problems, though the ability with which he invented the necessary analysis is almost phenomenal. As long as his results were true he took but little trouble to explain the steps by which he arrived at them; he never studied elegance or symmetry in his processes, and it was sufficient for him if he could by any means solve the particular question he was discussing.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

==Tidal dynamics==
{{main|Theory of tides}}

===Dynamic theory of tides===
While [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] explained the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] gave a description of the static reaction of the waters on Earth to the tidal potential, the ''dynamic theory of tides'', developed by Laplace in 1775,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/2011112017524/short-notes-on-the-dynamical-theory-of-laplace.html&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ocean's real reaction to [[tidal force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/luanne/pages/ocean420/notes/tidedynamics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace's theory of ocean tides took into account [[friction]], [[resonance]] and natural periods of ocean basins. It predicted the large [[amphidromic]] systems in the world's ocean basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"&gt;http://www.pearsonhighered.com/samplechapter/0132401223.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kess/JGGHBA/2009/v30n5/JGGHBA_2009_v30n5_671.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Newton's three-body diagram.PNG|400px|right|Newton's three-body model]]The equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and Moon but ignoring the Earth's rotation, the effects of continents, and other important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanho.co.za/tides/tide_theory.pdf Tidal theory] website South African Navy Hydrographic Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/swojtal/SFWpage/161Stuff/161Lect17/sld012.htm |title=Dynamic theory for tides |publisher=Oberlin.edu |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/645fall2003_web.dir/ellie_boyce/dynamic.htm|title=  Dynamic Theory of Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |title=Dynamic Tides – In contrast to "static" theory, the dynamic theory of tides recognizes that water covers only three-quarters o |publisher=Web.vims.edu |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113022202/http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |title=The Dynamic Theory of Tides |publisher=Coa.edu |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219161027/http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beacon.salemstate.edu/~lhanson/gls214/gls214_tides{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/St-Ts/Tides.html |title=Tides – building, river, sea, depth, oceans, effects, important, largest, system, wave, effect, marine, Pacific |publisher=Waterencyclopedia.com |date=27 June 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocean.tamu.edu/wormuth/tidestxt.html |title=TIDES |publisher=Ocean.tamu.edu |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Newton's three-body diagram.PNG|400px|right|Newton's three-body model]]Since measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Floor Anthoni |url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/tides.htm |title=Tides |publisher=Seafriends.org.nz |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, Laplace formulated a single set of linear [[partial differential equation]]s, for tidal flow described as a [[barotropic]] two-dimensional sheet flow. [[Coriolis effect]]s are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the [[fluid dynamic]] equations. But they can also be derived from energy integrals via [[Lagrange's equation]].

For a fluid sheet of [[average]] thickness ''D'', the vertical tidal elevation ''ζ'', as well as the horizontal velocity components ''u'' and ''v'' (in the [[latitude]] ''φ'' and [[longitude]] ''λ'' directions, respectively) satisfy '''Laplace's tidal equations''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/group/dave/pdf/LTE.frame.pdf|title= The Laplace Tidal Equations and Atmospheric Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] rewrote Laplace's momentum terms using the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] to find an equation for [[vorticity]]. Under certain conditions this can be further rewritten as a conservation of vorticity.

==On the figure of the Earth==
During the years 1784–1787 he published some memoirs of exceptional power. Prominent among these is one read in 1783, reprinted as Part II of ''Théorie du Mouvement et de la figure elliptique des planètes'' in 1784, and in the third volume of the ''Mécanique céleste''. In this work, Laplace completely determined the attraction of a [[spheroid]] on a particle outside it. This is memorable for the introduction into analysis of [[spherical harmonics]] or '''Laplace's coefficients''', and also for the development of the use of what we would now call the [[gravitational potential]] in [[celestial mechanics]].

===Spherical harmonics===
[[File:Rotating spherical harmonics.gif|frame|right|Spherical harmonics.]]
In 1783, in a paper sent to the ''Académie'', [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] had introduced what are now known as [[associated Legendre function]]s.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt; If two points in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] have [[polar co-ordinates]] (''r'', θ) and (''r''&lt;nowiki&gt; '&lt;/nowiki&gt;, θ'), where ''r''&lt;nowiki&gt; '&lt;/nowiki&gt; ≥ ''r'', then, by elementary manipulation, the reciprocal of the distance between the points, ''d'', can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{d} = \frac{1}{r'} \left [ 1 - 2 \cos (\theta' - \theta) \frac{r}{r'} + \left ( \frac{r}{r'} \right ) ^2 \right ] ^{- \tfrac{1}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression can be [[power series|expanded in powers]] of ''r''/''r''&lt;nowiki&gt; '&lt;/nowiki&gt; using [[Negative binomial theorem|Newton's generalised binomial theorem]] to give:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{d} = \frac{1}{r'} \sum_{k=0}^\infty P^0_k ( \cos ( \theta' - \theta ) ) \left ( \frac{r}{r'} \right ) ^k.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[sequence]] of functions ''P''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(cosф) is the set of so-called "associated Legendre functions" and their usefulness arises from the fact that every [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the points on a circle can be expanded as a [[series (mathematics)|series]] of them.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

Laplace, with scant regard for credit to Legendre, made the non-trivial extension of the result to [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] to yield a more general set of functions, the '''[[spherical harmonics]]''' or '''Laplace coefficients'''. The latter term is not in common use now.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

===Potential theory===
This paper is also remarkable for the development of the idea of the [[scalar potential]].&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt; The gravitational [[force (physics)|force]] acting on a body is, in modern language, a [[vector (geometry)|vector]], having magnitude and direction. A potential function is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] function that defines how the vectors will behave. A scalar function is computationally and conceptually easier to deal with than a vector function.

[[Alexis Clairaut]] had first suggested the idea in 1743 while working on a similar problem though he was using Newtonian-type geometric reasoning. Laplace described Clairaut's work as being "in the class of the most beautiful mathematical productions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences | author=Grattan-Guinness, I. | date=2003 | location=Baltimore | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn=0-8018-7396-7 | pages=1097–1098 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1098&amp;lpg=PA1098&amp;dq=laplace+potential+1784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rouse Ball alleges that the idea "was appropriated from [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who had used it in his memoirs of 1773, 1777 and 1780".&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt; The term "potential" itself was due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]], who introduced it in his 1738 memoire ''Hydrodynamica''. However, according to Rouse Ball, the term "potential function" was not actually used (to refer to a function ''V'' of the coordinates of space in Laplace's sense) until [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]]'s 1828 [[An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism]].&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Clairaut/RouseBall/RB_Clairaut.html W. W. Rouse Ball ''A Short Account of the History of Mathematics'' (4th edition, 1908)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| publisher = ''Nottingham'' | date = 1828 | arxiv = 0807.0088|bibcode = 2008arXiv0807.0088G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laplace applied the language of calculus to the potential function and showed that it always satisfies the [[differential equation]]:&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2V={\partial^2V\over \partial x^2 } +
{\partial^2V\over \partial y^2 } +
{\partial^2V\over \partial z^2 } = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

An analogous result for the [[velocity potential]] of a fluid had been obtained some years previously by [[Leonhard Euler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Morris|last=Kline|title=Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times|volume=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1972|pages=524–525|isbn=0-19-506136-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Leonhard|last=Euler|authorlink=Leonhard Euler|title=General principles of the motion of fluids|year=1757|journal=Novi. Comm. Acad. Sci. Petrop.|pages=271–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laplace's subsequent work on gravitational attraction was based on this result. The quantity ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' has been termed the '''concentration''' of ''V'' and its value at any point indicates the "excess" of the value of ''V'' there over its mean value in the neighbourhood of the point. [[Laplace's equation]], a special case of [[Poisson's equation]], appears ubiquitously in mathematical physics. The concept of a potential occurs in [[fluid dynamics]], [[electromagnetism]] and other areas. Rouse Ball speculated that it might be seen as "the outward sign" of one of the ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' forms in [[Immanuel Kant#Kant's theory of perception|Kant's theory of perception]].&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

The spherical harmonics turn out to be critical to practical solutions of Laplace's equation. Laplace's equation in [[spherical coordinates]], such as are used for mapping the sky, can be simplified, using the method of [[separation of variables]] into a radial part, depending solely on distance from the centre point, and an angular or spherical part. The solution to the spherical part of the equation can be expressed as a series of Laplace's spherical harmonics, simplifying practical computation.

==Planetary and lunar inequalities==
===Jupiter–Saturn great inequality===

Laplace presented a memoir on planetary inequalities in three sections, in 1784, 1785, and 1786. This dealt mainly with the identification and explanation of the [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] now known as the "great Jupiter–Saturn inequality". Laplace solved a longstanding problem in the study and prediction of the movements of these planets. He showed by general considerations, first, that the mutual action of two planets could never cause large changes in the eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits; but then, even more importantly, that peculiarities arose in the Jupiter–Saturn system because of the near approach to commensurability of the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn.&lt;ref name="Arago1874"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arago|first=François|translator-first=Baden | translator-last=Powell |translator-link=Baden Powell (mathematician)|title=Laplace: Eulogy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeBDDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP5|accessdate=21 March 2018|year=1874|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context ''commensurability'' means that the ratio of the two planets' mean motions is very nearly equal to a ratio between a pair of small whole numbers. Two periods of Saturn's orbit around the Sun almost equal five of Jupiter's. The corresponding difference between multiples of the mean motions, {{nowrap|(2''n&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5''n&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, corresponds to a period of nearly 900&amp;nbsp;years, and it occurs as a small divisor in the integration of a very small perturbing force with this same period. As a result, the integrated perturbations with this period are disproportionately large, about 0.8° degrees of arc in orbital longitude for Saturn and about 0.3° for Jupiter.

Further developments of these theorems on planetary motion were given in his two memoirs of 1788 and 1789, but with the aid of Laplace's discoveries, the tables of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn could at last be made much more accurate. It was on the basis of Laplace's theory that [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] computed his astronomical tables.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

===Books===
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}
Laplace now set himself the task to write a work which should "offer a complete solution of the great mechanical problem presented by the Solar System, and bring theory to coincide so closely with observation that empirical equations should no longer find a place in astronomical tables." The result is embodied in the ''Exposition du système du monde'' and the ''Mécanique céleste''.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

The former was published in 1796, and gives a general explanation of the phenomena, but omits all details. It contains a summary of the history of astronomy. This summary procured for its author the honour of admission to the forty of the French Academy and is commonly esteemed one of the masterpieces of French literature, though it is not altogether reliable for the later periods of which it treats.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

Laplace developed the [[nebular hypothesis]] of the formation of the Solar System, first suggested by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and expanded by [[Immanuel Kant]], a hypothesis that continues to dominate accounts of the origin of planetary systems. According to Laplace's description of the hypothesis, the Solar System had evolved from a globular mass of [[incandescence|incandescent]] gas rotating around an axis through its [[centre of mass]]. As it cooled, this mass contracted, and successive rings broke off from its outer edge. These rings in their turn cooled, and finally condensed into the planets, while the sun represented the central core which was still left. On this view, Laplace predicted that the more distant planets would be older than those nearer the sun.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ebsolar"&gt;Owen, T. C. (2001) "Solar system: origin of the solar system", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Deluxe CDROM edition&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, the idea of the nebular hypothesis had been outlined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1755,&lt;ref name="ebsolar"/&gt; and he had also suggested "meteoric aggregations" and [[tidal friction]] as causes affecting the formation of the Solar System. Laplace was probably aware of this, but, like many writers of his time, he generally did not reference the work of others.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;

Laplace's analytical discussion of the Solar System is given in his ''Mécanique céleste'' published in five volumes. The first two volumes, published in 1799, contain methods for calculating the motions of the planets, determining their figures, and resolving tidal problems. The third and fourth volumes, published in 1802 and 1805, contain applications of these methods, and several astronomical tables. The fifth volume, published in 1825, is mainly historical, but it gives as appendices the results of Laplace's latest researches. Laplace's own investigations embodied in it are so numerous and valuable that it is regrettable to have to add that many results are appropriated from other writers with scanty or no acknowledgement, and the conclusions&amp;nbsp;– which have been described as the organised result of a century of patient toil&amp;nbsp;– are frequently mentioned as if they were due to Laplace.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], who assisted Laplace in revising it for the press, says that Laplace himself was frequently unable to recover the details in the chain of reasoning, and, if satisfied that the conclusions were correct, he was content to insert the constantly recurring formula, "''Il est aisé à voir que...''" ("It is easy to see that..."). The ''Mécanique céleste'' is not only the translation of Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' into the language of the [[differential calculus]], but it completes parts of which Newton had been unable to fill in the details. The work was carried forward in a more finely tuned form in [[Félix Tisserand]]'s ''Traité de mécanique céleste'' (1889–1896), but Laplace's treatise will always remain a standard authority.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;
In the years 1784–1787, Laplace produced some memoirs of exceptional power. The significant among these was one issued in 1784, and reprinted in the third volume of the Méchanique céleste.{{cn|date=May 2018}} In this work he completely determined the attraction of a spheroid on a particle outside it. This is known for the introduction into analysis of the potential, a useful mathematical concept of broad applicability to the physical sciences.

==Black holes==
Laplace also came close to propounding the concept of the [[black hole]]. He suggested that there could be massive stars whose gravity is so great that not even light could escape from their surface (see [[escape velocity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, P.-S. (1799).

==Arcueil==
[[File:Laplace house Arcueil.jpg|thumbnail|Laplace's house at Arcueil.]]
{{main|Society of Arcueil}}
In 1806, Laplace bought a house in [[Arcueil]], then a village and not yet absorbed into the Paris [[conurbation]]. [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] was a neighbour—their gardens were not separated&lt;ref name=Fourier&gt;Fourier (1829)&lt;/ref&gt;—and the pair formed the nucleus of an informal scientific circle, latterly known as the Society of Arcueil. Because of their closeness to [[Napoleon]], Laplace and Berthollet effectively controlled advancement in the scientific establishment and admission to the more prestigious offices. The Society built up a complex pyramid of [[patronage]].&lt;ref&gt;Crosland (1967), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806, Laplace was also elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

==Analytic theory of probabilities==
In 1812, Laplace issued his ''Théorie analytique des probabilités'' in which he laid down many fundamental results in statistics. The first half of this treatise was concerned with probability methods and problems, the second half with statistical methods and applications. Laplace's proofs are not always rigorous according to the standards of a later day, and his perspective slides back and forth between the Bayesian and non-Bayesian views with an ease that makes some of his investigations difficult to follow, but his conclusions remain basically sound even in those few situations where his analysis goes astray.&lt;ref name="stigler"/&gt; In 1819, he published a popular account of his work on probability. This book bears the same relation to the ''Théorie des probabilités'' that the ''Système du monde'' does to the ''Méchanique céleste''.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt; In its emphasis on the analytical importance of probabilistic problems, especially in the context of the "approximation of formula functions of large numbers," Laplace's work goes beyond the contemporary view which almost exclusively considered aspects of practical applicability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Laplace,_Pierre-Simon_Marquis_de/ "Laplace, Pierre-Simon Marquis de"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 10 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace's Théorie analytique remained the most influential book of mathematical probability theory to the end of the 19th century. The general relevance for statistics of Laplacian error theory was appreciated only by the end of the 19th century. However, it influenced the further development of a largely analytically oriented probability theory.

===Inductive probability===
In his ''Essai philosophique sur les probabilités'' (1814), Laplace set out a mathematical system of [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive reasoning]] based on [[probability]], which we would today recognise as [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]]. He begins the text with a series of principles of probability, the first six being:

# Probability is the ratio of the "favored events" to the total possible events.
# The first principle assumes equal probabilities for all events. When this is not true, we must first determine the probabilities of each event. Then, the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible favoured events.
# For independent events, the probability of the occurrence of all is the probability of each multiplied together.
# For events not independent, the probability of event B following event A (or event A causing B) is the probability of A multiplied by the probability that A and B both occur.
# The probability that ''A'' will occur, given that B has occurred, is the probability of ''A'' and ''B'' occurring divided by the probability of&amp;nbsp;''B''.
# Three corollaries are given for the sixth principle, which amount to Bayesian probability. Where event {{nowrap|''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ {''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}} exhausts the list of possible causes for event ''B'', {{nowrap|Pr(''B'') {{=}} Pr(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Then
::: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A_i \mid B) = \Pr(A_i)\frac{\Pr(B\mid A_i)}{\sum_j \Pr(A_j)\Pr(B\mid A_j)}.&lt;/math&gt;

One well-known formula arising from his system is the [[rule of succession]], given as principle seven. Suppose that some trial has only two possible outcomes, labelled "success" and "failure". Under the assumption that little or nothing is known ''a priori'' about the relative plausibilities of the outcomes, Laplace derived a formula for the probability that the next trial will be a success.

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\text{next outcome is success}) = \frac{s+1}{n+2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the number of previously observed successes and ''n'' is the total number of observed trials. It is still used as an estimator for the probability of an event if we know the event space, but have only a small number of samples.

The rule of succession has been subject to much criticism, partly due to the example which Laplace chose to illustrate it. He calculated that the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has never failed to in the past, was

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\text{sun will rise tomorrow}) = \frac{d+1}{d+2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the number of times the sun has risen in the past. This result has been derided as absurd, and some authors have concluded that all applications of the Rule of Succession are absurd by extension. However, Laplace was fully aware of the absurdity of the result; immediately following the example, he wrote, "But this number [i.e., the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow] is far greater for him who, seeing in the totality of phenomena the principle regulating the days and seasons, realizes that nothing at the present moment can arrest the course of it."&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated from the 6th French edition by Frederick Wilson Truscott and Frederick Lincoln Emory. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1902, p. 19. Dover Publications edition (New York, 1951) has same pagination.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probability-generating function===
The method of estimating the ratio of the number of favourable cases to the whole number of possible cases had been previously indicated by Laplace in a paper written in 1779. It consists of treating the successive values of any [[function (mathematics)|function]] as the coefficients in the expansion of another function, with reference to a different variable. The latter is therefore called the [[probability-generating function]] of the former. Laplace then shows how, by means of [[interpolation]], these coefficients may be determined from the generating function. Next he attacks the converse problem, and from the coefficients he finds the generating function; this is effected by the solution of a [[finite difference equation]].&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

===Least squares and central limit theorem===
The fourth chapter of this treatise includes an exposition of the [[method of least squares]], a remarkable testimony to Laplace's command over the processes of analysis. In 1805 [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] had published the method of least squares, making no attempt to tie it to the theory of probability. In 1809 [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had derived the normal distribution from the principle that the arithmetic mean of observations gives the most probable value for the quantity measured; then, turning this argument back upon itself, he showed that, if the errors of observation are normally distributed, the least squares estimates give the most probable values for the coefficients in regression situations. These two works seem to have spurred Laplace to complete work toward a treatise on probability he had contemplated as early as 1783.&lt;ref name="stigler"&gt;Stigler, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

In two important papers in 1810 and 1811, Laplace first developed the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] as a tool for large-sample theory and proved the first general [[central limit theorem]]. Then in a supplement to his 1810 paper written after he had seen Gauss's work, he showed that the central limit theorem provided a Bayesian justification for least squares: if one were combining observations, each one of which was itself the mean of a large number of independent observations, then the least squares estimates would not only maximise the likelihood function, considered as a posterior distribution, but also minimise the expected posterior error, all this without any assumption as to the error distribution or a circular appeal to the principle of the arithmetic mean.&lt;ref name="stigler"/&gt; In 1811 Laplace took a different non-Bayesian tack. Considering a linear regression problem, he restricted his attention to linear unbiased estimators of the linear coefficients. After showing that members of this class were approximately normally distributed if the number of observations was large, he argued that least squares provided the "best" linear estimators. Here it is "best" in the sense that it minimised the asymptotic variance and thus both minimised the expected absolute value of the error, and maximised the probability that the estimate would lie in any symmetric interval about the unknown coefficient, no matter what the error distribution. His derivation included the joint limiting distribution of the least squares estimators of two parameters.&lt;ref name="stigler"/&gt;

==Laplace's demon==
{{Main|Laplace's demon}}
In 1814, Laplace published what is usually known as the first articulation of [[causal determinism|causal or scientific determinism]]:&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt;
{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay'', New York, 1902, p. 4.&lt;!--Nice translation, but it's not the one in this edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This intellect is often referred to as ''Laplace's demon'' (in the same vein as ''[[Maxwell's demon]]'') and sometimes ''Laplace's Superman'' (after [[Hans Reichenbach]]). Laplace, himself, did not use the word "demon", which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: ''"Une intelligence... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux."''

Even though Laplace is known as the first to express such ideas about causal determinism, his view is very similar to the one proposed by [[Roger Joseph Boscovich|Boscovich]] as early as 1763 in his book ''Theoria philosophiae naturalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cercignani |first1=Carlo |authorlink1=Carlo Cercignani |title=Ludwig Boltzmann, The Man Who Trusted Atoms |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-850154-4 |chapter=Chapter 2: Physics before Boltzmann |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplace transforms==
{{main|Laplace transform#History}}
As early as 1744, [[Euler]], followed by [[Lagrange]], had started looking for solutions of [[differential equation]]s in the form:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness|Grattan-Guinness]], in Gillispie (1997), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; z = \int X(x) e^{ax} \,dx\text{  and  }z = \int X(x) x^a \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
The Laplace transform has form:
:&lt;math&gt; F(s) = \int f(t) e^{-st}\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
This integral operator transforms a function of time (t) into a function of position or space (s).

In 1785, Laplace took the key forward step in using integrals of this form to transform a whole differential equation from a function of time into a lower order function of space; The transformed equation was easier to solve than the original because algebra could be used to manipulate the differential equation into a simpler form. The inverse Laplace transform was then taken to convert the simplified function of space back into a function of time.&lt;ref&gt;Grattan-Guinness, in Gillispie (1997), pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deakin (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other discoveries and accomplishments==
===Mathematics===
Amongst the other discoveries of Laplace in pure and applied mathematics are:
* Discussion, contemporaneously with [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]], of the general theory of [[determinant]]s, (1772);&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;
* Proof that every equation of an even degree must have at least one [[real number|real]] [[quadratic function|quadratic]] factor;&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;
* [[Laplace's method]] for approximating integrals
* Solution of the [[linear partial differential equation]] of the second order;&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;
* He was the first to consider the difficult problems involved in equations of mixed differences, and to prove that the solution of an equation in finite differences of the first degree and the second order might always be obtained in the form of a [[continued fraction]];&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt; and
* In his theory of probabilities:
** [[de Moivre–Laplace theorem]] that approximates binomial distribution with a normal distribution
** Evaluation of several common [[definite integral]]s;&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt; and
** General proof of the [[Lagrange reversion theorem]].&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

===Surface tension===
{{main|Young–Laplace equation#History}}
Laplace built upon the qualitative work of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] to develop the theory of [[capillary action]] and the [[Young–Laplace equation]].

===Speed of sound===
Laplace in 1816 was the first to point out that the [[speed of sound]] in air depends on the [[heat capacity ratio]]. Newton's original theory gave too low a value, because it does not take account of the [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] [[Gas compression|compression]] of the air which results in a local rise in temperature and [[pressure]]. Laplace's investigations in practical physics were confined to those carried on by him jointly with [[Lavoisier]] in the years 1782 to 1784 on the [[specific heat]] of various bodies.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

==Politics==
===Minister of the Interior===
In his early years Laplace was careful never to become involved in politics, or indeed in life outside the ''Académie des sciences''. He prudently withdrew from Paris during the most violent part of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crosland (2006), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1799, immediately after seizing power in the coup of [[18 Brumaire]], Napoleon appointed Laplace to the post of [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]]. The appointment, however, lasted only six weeks, after which Lucien, Napoleon's brother, was given the post. Evidently, once Napoleon's grip on power was secure, there was no need for a prestigious but inexperienced scientist in the government.&lt;ref name=GGp333&gt;Grattan-Guinness (2005), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon later (in his ''[[Mémoires de Sainte Hélène]]'') wrote of Laplace's dismissal as follows:&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

{{quotation | Géomètre de premier rang, Laplace ne tarda pas à se montrer administrateur plus que médiocre; dès son premier travail nous reconnûmes que nous nous étions trompé. Laplace ne saisissait aucune question sous son véritable point de vue: il cherchait des subtilités partout, n'avait que des idées problématiques, et portait enfin l'esprit des 'infiniment petits' jusque dans l'administration.

(Geometrician of the first rank, Laplace was not long in showing himself a worse than average administrator; from his first actions in office we recognized our mistake. Laplace did not consider any question from the right angle: he sought subtleties everywhere, conceived only problems, and finally carried the spirit of "infinitesimals" into the administration.) }}

Grattan-Guinness, however, describes these remarks as "tendentious", since there seems to be no doubt that Laplace "was only appointed as a short-term figurehead, a place-holder while Napoleon consolidated power".&lt;ref name=GGp333/&gt;

===From Bonaparte to the Bourbons===
[[File:Pierre-Simon-Laplace (1749-1827).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Laplace.]]
Although Laplace was removed from office, it was desirable to retain his allegiance. He was accordingly raised to the senate, and to the third volume of the ''Mécanique céleste'' he prefixed a note that of all the truths therein contained the most precious to the author was the declaration he thus made of his devotion towards the peacemaker of Europe. In copies sold after the [[Bourbon Restoration]] this was struck out. (Pearson points out that the censor would not have allowed it anyway.) In 1814 it was evident that the empire was falling; Laplace hastened to tender his services to the [[Bourbons]], and in 1817 during the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] he was rewarded with the title of [[marquis]].

According to Rouse Ball, the contempt that his more honest colleagues felt for his conduct in the matter may be read in the pages of [[Paul Louis Courier]]. His knowledge was useful on the numerous scientific commissions on which he served, and, says Rouse Ball, probably accounts for the manner in which his political insincerity was overlooked.&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;

Roger Hahn in his 2005 biography disputes this portrayal of Laplace as an opportunist and turncoat, pointing out that, like many in France, he had followed the debacle of Napoleon's Russian campaign with serious misgivings. The Laplaces, whose only daughter Sophie had died in childbirth in September 1813, were in fear for the safety of their son Émile, who was on the eastern front with the emperor. Napoleon had originally come to power promising stability, but it was clear that he had overextended himself, putting the nation at peril. It was at this point that Laplace's loyalty began to weaken. Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to the quick by Napoleon's insensitivity in an exchange related by [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]]: "On his return from the [[Battle of Leipzig|rout in Leipzig]], he [Napoleon] accosted Mr Laplace: 'Oh! I see that you have grown thin—Sire, I have lost my daughter—Oh! that's not a reason for losing weight. You are a mathematician; put this event in an equation, and you will find that it adds up to zero.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political philosophy===
In the second edition (1814) of the ''Essai philosophique'', Laplace added some revealing comments on politics and [[governance]]. Since it is, he says, "the practice of the eternal principles of reason, justice and humanity that produce and preserve societies, there is a great advantage to adhere to these principles, and a great inadvisability to deviate from them".&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay'', New York, 1902, p. 62. (Translation in this paragraph of article is from Hahn.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Noting "the depths of misery into which peoples have been cast" when ambitious leaders disregard these principles, Laplace makes a veiled criticism of Napoleon's conduct: "Every time a great power intoxicated by the love of conquest aspires to universal domination, the sense of liberty among the unjustly threatened nations breeds a coalition to which it always succumbs." Laplace argues that "in the midst of the multiple causes that direct and restrain various states, natural limits" operate, within which it is "important for the stability as well as the prosperity of empires to remain". States that transgress these limits cannot avoid being "reverted" to them, "just as is the case when the waters of the seas whose floor has been lifted by violent tempests sink back to their level by the action of gravity".&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay'', New York, 1902, p. 63. (Translation in this paragraph of article is from Hahn.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hahnp185&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

About the political upheavals he had witnessed, Laplace formulated a set of principles derived from physics to favour evolutionary over revolutionary change:
{{Quote|Let us apply to the political and moral sciences the method founded upon observation and calculation, which has served us so well in the natural sciences. Let us not offer fruitless and often injurious resistance to the inevitable benefits derived from the progress of enlightenment; but let us change our institutions and the usages that we have for a long time adopted only with extreme caution. We know from past experience the drawbacks they can cause, but we are unaware of the extent of ills that change may produce. In the face of this ignorance, the theory of probability instructs us to avoid all change, especially to avoid sudden changes which in the moral as well as the physical world never occur without a considerable loss of vital force.&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay'', New York, 1902, pp. 107–108. (Translation in this paragraph of article is from Hahn.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In these lines, Laplace expressed the views he had arrived at after experiencing the Revolution and the Empire. He believed that the stability of nature, as revealed through scientific findings, provided the model that best helped to preserve the human species. "Such views," Hahn comments, "were also of a piece with his steadfast character."&lt;ref name=Hahnp185/&gt;

==Death==
Laplace died in Paris in 1827. His brain was removed by his physician, [[François Magendie]], and kept for many years, eventually being displayed in a roving anatomical museum in Britain. It was reportedly smaller than the average brain.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt; Laplace was buried at [[Père Lachaise]] in Paris but in 1888 his remains were moved to [[Saint Julien de Mailloc]] in the canton of Orbec and reinterred on the family estate.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie (1997), pp. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb is situated on a hill overlooking the village of St Julien de Mailloc, Normandy, France. [[File:Tomb of Pierre-Simon Laplace.JPG|thumb|right|Tomb of Pierre-Simon Laplace]]

==Religious opinions==
===''I had no need of that hypothesis''===
A frequently cited but potentially [[apocryphal]] interaction between Laplace and Napoleon purportedly concerns the existence of God. Although the conversation in question did occur, the exact words Laplace used and his intended meaning are not known. A typical version is provided by Rouse Ball:&lt;ref name="ball"/&gt;
{{Quote|Laplace went in state to Napoleon to present a copy of his work, and the following account of the interview is well authenticated, and so characteristic of all the parties concerned that I quote it in full. Someone had told Napoleon that the book contained no mention of the name of God; Napoleon, who was fond of putting embarrassing questions, received it with the remark, 'M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.' Laplace, who, though the most supple of politicians, was as stiff as a martyr on every point of his philosophy, drew himself up and answered bluntly, ''Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse-là.'' ("I had no need of that hypothesis.") Napoleon, greatly amused, told this reply to [[Lagrange]], who exclaimed, ''Ah! c'est une belle hypothèse; ça explique beaucoup de choses.'' ("Ah, it is a fine hypothesis; it explains many things.")}}

An earlier report, although without the mention of Laplace's name, is found in Antommarchi's ''[[The Last Moments of Napoleon]]'' (1825):&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''], vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Je m'entretenais avec L...... je le félicitais d'un ouvrage qu'il venait de publier et lui demandais comment le nom de Dieu, qui se reproduisait sans cesse sous la plume de Lagrange, ne s'était pas présenté une seule fois sous la sienne.  C'est, me répondit-il, que je n'ai pas eu besoin de cette hypothèse.  ("While speaking with L...... I congratulated him on a work which he had just published and asked him how the name of God, which appeared endlessly in the works of Lagrange, didn't occur even once in his.  He replied that he had no need of that hypothesis.")}}

In 1884, however, the astronomer [[Hervé Faye]]&lt;ref name=Faye&gt;Faye, Hervé (1884), ''Sur l'origine du monde: théories cosmogoniques des anciens et des modernes''. Paris: Gauthier-Villars, pp. 109–111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pasquier&gt;Pasquier, Ernest (1898). [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/phlou_0776-5541_1898_num_5_18_1596 "Les hypothèses cosmogoniques (''suite'')"]. ''Revue néo-scholastique'', 5&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; année, N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 18, pp. 124–125, footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; affirmed that this account of Laplace's exchange with Napoleon presented a "strangely transformed" (''étrangement transformée'') or garbled version of what had actually happened. It was not God that Laplace had treated as a hypothesis, but merely his intervention at a determinate point:
{{Quote|In fact Laplace never said that. Here, I believe, is what truly happened. Newton, believing that the [[secular phenomena|secular]] perturbations which he had sketched out in his theory would in the long run end up destroying the Solar System, says somewhere that God was obliged to intervene from time to time to remedy the evil and somehow keep the system working properly. This, however, was a pure supposition suggested to Newton by an incomplete view of the conditions of the stability of our little world. Science was not yet advanced enough at that time to bring these conditions into full view. But Laplace, who had discovered them by a deep analysis, would have replied to the [[First Consul]] that Newton had wrongly invoked the intervention of God to adjust from time to time the machine of the world (''la machine du monde'') and that he, Laplace, had no need of such an assumption. It was not God, therefore, that Laplace treated as a hypothesis, but his intervention in a certain place.}}

Laplace's younger colleague, the astronomer [[François Arago]], who gave his eulogy before the French Academy in 1827,&lt;ref&gt;Arago, François (1827), ''Laplace: Eulogy before the French Academy'', translated by Prof. Baden Powell, ''Smithsonian Report'', 1874&lt;/ref&gt; told Faye of an attempt by Laplace to keep the garbled version of his interaction with Napoleon out of circulation. Faye writes:&lt;ref name=Faye/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pasquier/&gt;
{{Quote|I have it on the authority of M. Arago that Laplace, warned shortly before his death that that anecdote was about to be published in a biographical collection, had requested him [Arago] to demand its deletion by the publisher. It was necessary to either explain or delete it, and the second way was the easiest. But, unfortunately, it was neither deleted nor explained.}}

The Swiss-American historian of mathematics [[Florian Cajori]] appears to have been unaware of Faye's research, but in 1893 he came to a similar conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Cajori, Florian (1893), ''A History of Mathematics''. Fifth edition (1991), reprinted by the [[American Mathematical Society]], 1999, p. 262. {{isbn|0-8218-2102-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] said in 1999,&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/lectures/dice.html |last=Hawking |first=Stephen |title=Does God Play Dice? |year=1999 |work=Public Lecture |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000708041816/http://www.hawking.org.uk/lectures/dice.html |archivedate=8 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I don't think that Laplace was claiming that God does not exist. It's just that he doesn't intervene, to break the laws of Science."

The only eyewitness account of Laplace's interaction with Napoleon is from the entry for 8 August 1802 in the diary of the British astronomer Sir [[William Herschel]]:&lt;ref&gt;William Herschel's diary of his trip to Paris, as quoted on p. 310 of ''The Herschel Chronicle'', Constance A. Lubbock, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013, {{isbn|1107650011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The first Consul then asked a few questions relating to Astronomy and the construction of the heavens to which I made such answers as seemed to give him great satisfaction. He also addressed himself to Mr Laplace on the same subject, and held a considerable argument with him in which he differed from that eminent mathematician. The difference was occasioned by an exclamation of the first Consul, who asked in a tone of exclamation or admiration (when we were speaking of the extent of the sidereal heavens): 'And who is the author of all this!' Mons. De la Place wished to shew that a chain of natural causes would account for the construction and preservation of the wonderful system. This the first Consul rather opposed. Much may be said on the subject; by joining the arguments of both we shall be led to 'Nature and nature's God'.}}

Since this makes no mention of Laplace saying, "I had no need of that hypothesis," [[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Daniel Johnson]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Daniel (18 June 2007), [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2007/06/18/the-hypothetical-atheist "The Hypothetical Atheist"], ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "Laplace never used the words attributed to him." Arago's testimony, however, appears to imply that he did, only not in reference to the existence of God.

===Views on God===
Born a Catholic, Laplace appears in adult life to have inclined to [[deism]] (presumably his considered position, since it is the only one found in his writings). However, some of his contemporaries thought he was an [[atheist]], while a number of recent scholars have described him as [[agnostic]]. 

Faye thought that Laplace "did not profess atheism",&lt;ref name=Faye/&gt; but Napoleon, on [[Saint Helena]], told General [[Gaspard Gourgaud]], "I often asked Laplace what he thought of God. He owned that he was an atheist."&lt;ref&gt;''Talks of Napoleon at St. Helena with General Baron Gourgaud'', translated by Elizabeth Wormely Latimer. Chicago: A. C. McClurg &amp; Co., 1903, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Hahn, in his biography of Laplace, mentions a dinner party at which "the geologist [[Jean-Étienne Guettard]] was staggered by Laplace's bold denunciation of the existence of God". It appeared to Guettard that Laplace's atheism "was supported by a thoroughgoing [[materialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; But the chemist [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]], who knew Laplace well in the 1820s, wrote that Laplace "provided materialists with their specious arguments, without sharing their convictions".&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, Jean-Baptiste (1885). ''Discours et éloges académiques'', Vol. II. Paris: Gauthier-Villars, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kneller&gt;Kneller, Karl Alois. ''Christianity and the Leaders of Modern Science: A Contribution to the History of Culture in the Nineteenth Century'', translated from the second German edition by T. M. Kettle. London: B. Herder, 1911, [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/karl-alois-kneller/christianity-and-the-leaders-of-modern-science-a-contribution-to-the-history-of-hci/page-6-christianity-and-the-leaders-of-modern-science-a-contribution-to-the-history-of-hci.shtml pp. 73–74]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hahn states: "Nowhere in his writings, either public or private, does Laplace deny God's existence."&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (1981), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Expressions occur in his private letters that appear inconsistent with atheism.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; On 17 June 1809, for instance, he wrote to his son, "''Je prie Dieu qu'il veille sur tes jours. Aie-Le toujours présent à ta pensée, ainsi que ton père et ta mère'' [I pray that God watches over your days. Let Him be always present to your mind, as also your father and your mother]."&lt;ref name=Pasquier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Œuvres de Laplace''. Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1878, Vol. I, pp. v–vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian S. Glass, quoting Herschel's account of the celebrated exchange with Napoleon, writes that Laplace was "evidently a deist like Herschel".&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Ian S. (2006). ''Revolutionaries of the Cosmos: The Astrophysicists''. Cambridge University Press, p. 108. {{isbn|0-19-857099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Exposition du système du monde'', Laplace quotes Newton's assertion that "the wondrous disposition of the Sun, the planets and the comets, can only be the work of an all-powerful and intelligent Being".&lt;ref&gt;[[General Scholium]], from the end of Book III of the ''Principia''; first appeared in the second edition, 1713.&lt;/ref&gt; This, says Laplace, is a "thought in which he [Newton] would be even more confirmed, if he had known what we have shown, namely that the conditions of the arrangement of the planets and their satellites are precisely those which ensure its stability".&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, ''[https://archive.org/details/expositiondusys05laplgoog Exposition du système du monde]'', 6th edition. Brussels, 1827, pp. 522–523.&lt;/ref&gt; By showing that the "remarkable" arrangement of the planets could be entirely explained by the laws of motion, Laplace had eliminated the need for the "supreme intelligence" to intervene, as Newton had "made" it do.&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, ''Exposition'', 1827, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace cites with approval Leibniz's criticism of Newton's invocation of divine intervention to restore order to the Solar System: "This is to have very narrow ideas about the wisdom and the power of God."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz to [[Antonio Schinella Conti|Conti]], Nov. or Dec. 1715, in H. G. Alexander, ed., ''The Leibniz–Clarke Correspondence'' (Manchester University Press, 1956), Appendix B. 1: "Leibniz and Newton to Conti", p. 185 {{isbn|0-7190-0669-4}}; cited in Laplace, ''Exposition'', 1827, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; He evidently shared Leibniz's astonishment at Newton's belief "that God has made his machine so badly that unless he affects it by some extraordinary means, the watch will very soon cease to go".&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz to Conti, 1715, in Alexander, ed., 1956, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a group of manuscripts, preserved in relative secrecy in a black envelope in the library of the ''Académie des sciences'' and published for the first time by Hahn, Laplace mounted a deist critique of Christianity. It is, he writes, the "first and most infallible of principles ... to reject miraculous facts as untrue".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; As for the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], it "offends at the same time reason, experience, the testimony of all our senses, the eternal laws of nature, and the sublime ideas that we ought to form of the Supreme Being". It is the sheerest absurdity to suppose that "the sovereign lawgiver of the universe would suspend the laws that he has established, and which he seems to have maintained invariably".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

In old age, Laplace remained curious about the question of God&lt;ref name=Hahnp202&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently discussed Christianity with the Swiss astronomer Jean-Frédéric-Théodore Maurice.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn (2005), pp. 202, 233&lt;/ref&gt; He told Maurice that "Christianity is quite a beautiful thing" and praised its civilising influence. Maurice thought that the basis of Laplace's beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast to his conviction that the invariability of the laws of nature did not permit of supernatural events.&lt;ref name=Hahnp202/&gt; After Laplace's death, [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] told Maurice, "You know that I do not share your [religious] opinions, but my conscience forces me to recount something that will surely please you." When Poisson had complimented Laplace about his "brilliant discoveries", the dying man had fixed him with a pensive look and replied, "Ah! we chase after phantoms [''chimères'']."&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan, Augustus]] (1872). ''A budget of paradoxes'', Longmans, Green, and co, London, p. 3. Compare [[Edmund Burke]]'s famous remark, occasioned by a parliamentary candidate's sudden death, about "what shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue".&lt;/ref&gt; These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the ultimate "[[vanitas|vanity]]" of earthly pursuits.&lt;ref name=Hahnp204&gt;Hahn (2005), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace received the [[last rites]] from the [[curé]] of the Missions Étrangères (in whose parish he was to be buried)&lt;ref name=Kneller/&gt; and the curé of Arcueil.&lt;ref name=Hahnp204/&gt;

However, according to his biographer, Roger Hahn, it is "not credible" that Laplace "had a proper Catholic end",  and he "remained a skeptic" to the very end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pierre Simon Laplace, 1749–1827: A Determined Scientist|date=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674018921|author=Roger Hahn|page=204|quote=The Catholic newspaper La Quotidienne [The Daily] announced that Laplace had died in the arms of two curés (priests), implying that he had a proper Catholic end, but this is not credible. To the end, he remained a skeptic, wedded to his deterministic creed and to an uncompromised ethos derived from his vast scientific experience.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace in his last years has been described as an agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pierre Simon Laplace, 1749–1827: A Determined Scientist|date=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674018921|author=Roger Hahn|page=202|quote=Publicly, Laplace maintained his agnostic beliefs, and even in his old age continued to be skeptical about any function God might play in a deterministic universe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics and the Search for Knowledge|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195042306|author=Morris Kline|page=214|quote=Lagrange and Laplace, though of Catholic parentage, were agnostics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics and the Imagination|date=2001|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=9780486417035|author=Edward Kasner|author2=James Newman|author3=James Roy Newman|page=253|quote=Modern physics, indeed all of modern science, is as humble as Lagrange, and as agnostic as Laplace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excommunication of a comet===
In 1470 the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Bartolomeo Platina]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comet Lore|date=1910|author=E. Emerson|publisher=Schilling Press, New York|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Pope Callixtus III]] had asked for prayers for deliverance from the Turks during a 1456 appearance of [[Halley's Comet]]. Platina's account does not accord with Church records, which do not mention the comet. Laplace is alleged to have embellished the story by claiming the Pope had "[[excommunication|excommunicated]]" Halley's comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Legend of 1P/Halley 1456|author=C. M. Botley|journal=The Observatory|volume=91|year=1971|pages=125–126|bibcode=1971Obs....91..125B}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Laplace actually said, in ''Exposition du système du monde'' (1796), was that the Pope had ordered the comet to be "[[exorcism|exorcised]]" (''conjuré''). It was Arago, in ''Des Comètes en général'' (1832), who first spoke of an excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913 |last=Hagen |first=John G. |wstitle=Pierre-Simon Laplace |volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|last=Stein |first=John |wstitle=Bartolomeo Platina|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigge, William F.

{{God}}
'''Polytheism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πολυθεϊσμός, ''polytheismos)'' is the worship of or belief in multiple [[deity|deities]], which are usually assembled into a [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of [[God (male deity)|god]]s and [[goddess]]es, along with their own [[religion]]s and [[ritual]]s. In most religions which accept polytheism, the different gods and goddesses are representations of forces of nature or [[ancestral worship|ancestral principles]], and can be viewed either as autonomous or as aspects or [[emanationism|emanations]] of a [[creator deity]] or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute principle]] ([[monism|monistic]] theologies), which manifests [[immanence|immanently]] in nature ([[panentheism|panentheistic]] and [[pantheism|pantheistic]] theologies).&lt;ref&gt;* [[Ulrich Libbrecht]]. ''Within the Four Seas...: Introduction to Comparative Philosophy''. Peeters Publishers, 2007. {{ISBN|9042918128}}. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the  polytheistic deities of ancient religions, with the notable exceptions of the Ancient Egyptian&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P. (2000). ''[[Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs]]'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hindu deities, were conceived as having physical bodies. 

Polytheism is a type of [[theism]]. Within theism, it contrasts with [[monotheism]], the belief in a [[God|singular God]], in most cases transcendent. Polytheists do not always worship all the gods equally, but they can be [[henotheism|henotheists]], specializing in the worship of one particular deity. Other polytheists can be [[kathenotheism|kathenotheists]], worshiping different deities at different times.

Polytheism was the typical form of religion during the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] up to the [[Axial Age]] and the development of [[Abrahamic religions]], the latter of which enforced strict [[monotheism]]. It is well documented in historical religions of [[Classical antiquity]], especially [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[ancient Roman religion]], and after the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] in tribal religions such as [[Germanic paganism]] or [[Slavic paganism]].

Important polytheistic religions practiced today include [[Chinese traditional religion]], [[Hinduism]], Japanese [[Shinto]], [[Santeria]], and various [[modern paganism|neopagan]] faiths.

==Terminology==
The term comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πολύ ''poly'' ("many") and θεός ''theos'' ("god") and was first invented by the Jewish writer [[Philo of Alexandria]] to argue with the Greeks. When Christianity spread throughout Europe and the Mediterranean, non-Christians were just called [[Gentiles]] (a term originally used by Jews to refer to non-Jews) or pagans (locals) or by the clearly pejorative term idolaters (worshiping "false" gods). The modern usage of the term is first revived in French through [[Jean Bodin]] in 1580, followed by [[Samuel Purchas]]'s usage in English in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Inconceivable Polytheism: Studies in Religious Historiography |last= Schmidt|first= Francis |year=1987 |publisher= Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers |location=New York |isbn= 978-3718603671 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soft polytheism versus hard polytheism==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
A central, main division in polytheism is between soft polytheism and hard polytheism.

"Hard" polytheism is the belief that gods are distinct, separate, real divine beings, rather than psychological [[archetypes]] or personifications of natural forces. Hard polytheists reject the idea that "all gods are one god."  "Hard" polytheists do not necessarily consider the gods of all cultures as being equally real, a theological position formally known as integrational polytheism or [[omnism]].

This is contrasted with "soft" polytheism, which holds that gods may be aspects of only one god, that the pantheons of other cultures are representative of one single pantheon, psychological [[archetypes]] or personifications of natural forces.

==Gods and divinity==
{{Main article|Deity|God (male deity)|Goddess}}
{{Refimprove section | date = September 2014}}
The deities of polytheism are often portrayed as complex personages of greater or lesser status, with individual skills, needs, desires and histories; in many ways similar to humans ([[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]]) in their [[wikt:personality|personality]] traits, but with additional individual powers, abilities, knowledge or perceptions.
Polytheism cannot be cleanly separated from the [[animism|animist]] beliefs prevalent in most [[folk religion]]s. The gods of polytheism are in many cases the highest order of a continuum of [[Non-physical entity|supernatural beings]] or [[spirits]], which may include [[ancestors]], [[demon]]s, [[wights]] and others. In some cases these spirits are divided into [[heaven|celestial]] or [[chthonic]] classes, and belief in the existence of all these beings does not imply that all are worshipped.

==Types of deities==
{{Further information|List of deities}}
{{Refimprove section | date = September 2014}}
Types of deities often found in polytheism may include
* [[Creator deity]]
* [[Culture hero]]
* [[Death deity]] ([[chthonic]])
* [[Life-death-rebirth deity]]
* [[List of love and lust deities|Love goddess]]
* [[Mother goddess]]
* [[Apotheosis|Political deity]] (such as a king or emperor)
* [[Sky deity]] ([[heaven|celestial]])
* [[Solar deity]]
* [[Trickster|Trickster deity]]
* [[Water deity]]
* Gods of music, arts, science, farming or other endeavors.

==Mythology and religion==
{{Main article|Mythology and religion}}
{{Refimprove section | date = September 2014}}
In the Classical era, [[Sallustius]] (4th century AD) categorised mythology into five types:

# Theological
# Physical
# Psychological
# Material
# Mixed

The theological are those myths which use no bodily form but contemplate the very essence of the gods: e.g., [[Cronus]] swallowing his children. Since divinity is intellectual, and all intellect returns into itself, this myth expresses in allegory the essence of divinity.

Myths may be regarded physically when they express the activities of gods in the world.

The psychological way is to regard (myths as allegories of) the activities of the soul itself and or the soul's acts of thought.

The material is to regard material objects to actually be gods, for example: to call the earth Gaia, ocean Okeanos, or heat Typhon.

==Historical polytheism==
Some well-known historical polytheistic pantheons include the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] gods and the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] gods, and the classical-attested pantheon which includes the [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. Post-classical polytheistic religions include [[Norse mythology|Norse]] Æsir and Vanir, the [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] Orisha, the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] gods, and many others. Today, most historical polytheistic religions are referred to as "[[mythology]]",&lt;ref&gt;Eugenie C. Scott, ''Evolution Vs. Creationism: An Introduction'' (2009), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; though the stories cultures tell about their gods should be distinguished from their worship or religious practice. For instance deities portrayed in conflict in mythology would still be worshipped sometimes in the same temple side by side, illustrating the distinction in the devotees mind between the myth and the reality. Scholars such as [[Jaan Puhvel]], [[J. P. Mallory]], and [[Douglas Q. Adams]] have reconstructed aspects of the ancient [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], from which the religions of the various [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European peoples]] derive, and that this religion was an essentially naturalist numenistic religion. An example of a religious notion from this shared past is the concept of ''[[Dyeus|*dyēus]]'', which is attested in several distinct religious systems.

In many civilizations, pantheons tended to grow over time. Deities first worshipped as the patrons of cities or places came to be collected together as empires extended over larger territories. Conquests could lead to the subordination of the elder culture's pantheon to a newer one, as in the Greek [[Titanomachia]], and possibly also the case of the [[Æsir]] and [[Vanir]] in the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythos]]. Cultural exchange could lead to "the same" deity being renowned in two places under different names, as seen with the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, and also to the cultural transmission of elements of an extraneous religion into a local cult, as with worship of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian deity [[Osiris]], which was later followed in [[ancient Greece]].

Most ancient belief systems held that gods influenced human lives. However, the Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]] held that the gods were living, incorruptible, blissful beings who did not trouble themselves with the affairs of mortals, but who could be perceived by the mind, especially during sleep. Epicurus believed that these gods were material, human-like, and that they inhabited the empty spaces between worlds.

[[Hellenistic religion]] may still be regarded as polytheistic, but with strong [[monistic]] components, and [[monotheism]] finally emerges from Hellenistic traditions in [[Late Antiquity]] in the form of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Christian theology]].

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main article|Religion in ancient Greece}}

The classical scheme in Ancient Greece of the [[Twelve Olympians]] (the Canonical Twelve of art and poetry) were:&lt;ref name="EnAm1993"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Greek mythology |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Americana]] |year=1993 |volume=13 |page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnPLB2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Dodekatheon |trans-title=Twelve Olympians |encyclopedia=[[Papyrus Larousse Britannica]] |year=2007 |language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Ares]], [[Demeter]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hermes]], and [[Hestia]]. Though it is suggested that Hestia stepped down when [[Dionysus]] was invited to [[Mount Olympus]], this is a matter of controversy. Robert Graves' ''The Greek Myths'' cites two sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title=Apollodorus, Library, book 3, chapter 5, section 3  
  | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.5.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Hades]]&lt;ref name="EnAm1919"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia Americana Vol. 13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWYMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA408 |volume=13 |year=1919 |editor=George Edward Rines |publisher=Americana Corp |pages=408–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; was often excluded because he dwelt in the underworld. All of the gods had a power. There was, however, a great deal of fluidity as to whom was counted among their number in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Stoll1852"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stoll, Heinrich Wilhelm (R.B. Paul trans.) |title=Handbook of the religion and mythology of the Greeks |publisher=Francis and John Rivington |year=1852 |page=8 |quote=The limitation [of the number of Olympians] to twelve seems to have been a comparatively modern idea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with [[epithet]]s that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

The [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Hellenic Polytheism]] extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of [[Ionia]] in [[Asia Minor]], to [[Magna Graecia]] (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille). Greek religion tempered [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan cult and belief]] to form much of the later [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].

==Folk religion==
{{Main article|Folk religion}}
{{Further information|Saint|Angel|Folk Catholicism|Shamanism}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
The [[animism|animistic]] nature of folk beliefs is an anthropological [[cultural universal]]. The belief in [[ghost]]s and [[spirit]]s animating the natural world and the practice of [[ancestor worship]] is universally present in the world's cultures and re-emerges in monotheistic or materialistic societies as "[[superstition]]", belief in [[demon]]s, [[tutelary saint]]s, [[fairies]] or [[UFOs|extraterrestrials]].

The presence of a full polytheistic religion, complete with a ritual cult conducted by a priestly caste, requires a higher level of organization and is not present in every culture. In Eurasia, the [[Kalasha (religion)|Kalash]] are one of very few instances of surviving polytheism. Also, a large number of polytheistic folk traditions are subsumed in contemporary [[Hinduism]], although Hinduism is doctrinally dominated by monist or monotheist theology ([[Bhakti]], [[Advaita]]). Historical Vedic polytheist ritualism survives as a minor current in Hinduism, known as [[Shrauta]]. More widespread is [[folk Hinduism]], with rituals dedicated to various local or regional deities.

==Contemporary world religions==

===Buddhism and Shinto===
{{further2|[[God in Buddhism]], [[Deva (Buddhism)]], and [[Nontheism#Buddhism|Nontheism in Buddhism]]}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
In [[Buddhism]], there are higher beings commonly designed (or designated) as gods, [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]]; however, Buddhism, at its core (the original Pali canon), does not teach the notion of praying nor worship to the Devas or any god(s).

However, in Buddhism, the core leader 'Buddha', who pioneered the path to enlightenment is not worshiped in meditation, but simply reflected upon. Statues or images of the Buddha (Buddharupas) are worshiped in front of to reflect and contemplate on qualities that the particular position of that rupa represents. In Buddhism, there is no creator and the Buddha rejected the idea that a permanent, personal, fixed, omniscient deity can exist, linking into the core concept of impermanence (anicca).

Devas, in general, are beings who have had more positive [[karma]] in their [[Reincarnation|past lives]] than humans. Their lifespan eventually ends. When their lives end, they will be reborn as devas or as other beings. When they accumulate negative karma, they are reborn as either human or any of the other lower beings. Humans and other beings could also be reborn as a deva in their next [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], if they accumulate enough positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]; however, it is not recommended.&lt;!--By whom? POV?--&gt;

Buddhism flourished in different countries, and some of those countries have polytheistic [[folk religion]]s. Buddhism [[syncretism|syncretizes]] easily with other religions. Thus, Buddhism has mixed with the folk religions and emerged in polytheistic variants (such as [[Vajrayana]]) as well as non-theistic variants. For example, in [[Japan]], Buddhism, mixed with [[Shinto]], which worships deities called [[kami]], created a tradition which prays to the deities of Shinto as forms of Buddhas. Thus, there may be elements of worship of gods in some forms of later Buddhism.

The concepts of [[Adi-Buddha]] and [[Dharmakaya]] are the closest to monotheism any form of Buddhism comes, all famous sages and Bodhisattvas being regarded as reflections of it.{{clarify|reason=sentence fragment|date=February 2016}}
Adi-Buddha is not said to be the creator, but the originator of all things, being a deity in an [[Emanationist]] sense.

===Christianity===
{{see also|God in Christianity|Trinity}}
{{POV check|section|date=October 2014}}
It is sometimes claimed that Christianity is not truly monotheistic because of its teaching about the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (1974) art. "Monotheism"&lt;/ref&gt; This is the position of some Jews and Muslims who contend that because of the adoption of a Triune conception of deity, Christianity is actually a form of [[Tritheism]] or Polytheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/educational-and-liturgical-materials/classic-articles/966-fisher2010/./|title=Typical Jewish Misunderstandings of Christianity |website= Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations|accessdate= June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thedebateinitiative.com/2014/12/08/muslims-reject-the-trinity-because-they-do-understand-it/./|title=Muslims reject the Trinity because they do understand it|website=thedebateinitiative|accessdate= June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example see [[Shituf]] or [[Tawhid]]. However, the central doctrine of Christianity is that "one God exists in Three Persons and One Substance".&lt;ref name="odcc-trin"&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (1974) art. "Trinity, Doctrine of the"&lt;/ref&gt;  Strictly speaking, the doctrine is a revealed mystery which while above reason is not contrary to it.{{clarify|date=October 2014}}&lt;ref name="odcc-trin"/&gt; The word 'person' is an imperfect translation of the original term "[[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]". In everyday speech "person" denotes a separate rational and moral individual, possessed of self-consciousness, and aware of individual identity despite changes. A human person is a distinct individual essence in whom human nature is individualized. But in God there are no three individuals alongside of, and separate from, one another, but only personal self distinctions{{clarify|date=October 2014}} within the divine essence, which is not only generically{{clarify|date=October 2014}}, but also numerically, one.&lt;ref&gt;Berkhof, Louis. ''Systematic Theology'' (1949) page 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the doctrine of the Trinity was not definitely formulated before the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381, the doctrine of one God, inherited from Judaism was always the indubitable premise of the Church's faith.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black (1965) pp. 87,88&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--{{off-topic|Trinity|Nontrinitarianism|date=May 2013}}
Historically, most Christian churches have taught that the nature of God is a ''[[Sacred mysteries|mystery]]'', in the original, technical meaning; something that must be revealed by [[special revelation]] rather than deduced through [[general revelation]]. Among [[early Christians]] there was considerable debate over the nature of [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], with some factions arguing for the deity of Jesus and others calling for an [[Arianism|Arian]] conception of God. These issues of [[Christology]] were to form one of the main subjects of contention at the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

The First Council of Nicaea, held in [[Nicaea]] in [[Bithynia]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]), convoked by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in 325, was the first (or second, if one counts the apostolic [[Council of Jerusalem]]) [[ecumenical council|ecumenical]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ecumenical'', from [[Koine Greek]] [[Oikoumene|oikoumenikos]], literally meaning worldwide but generally assumed to be limited to the Roman Empire as in Augustus's claim to be ruler of the ''oikoumene'' (world); the earliest extant uses of the term for a council are in Eusebius's ''Life of Constantine'' 3.6 [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/eusebius/vc/gr/index.htm] around 338 "{{lang|grc|σύνοδον οἰκουμενικὴν συνεκρότει}}" (he convoked an Ecumenical council), Athanasius's Ad Afros Epistola Synodica in 369 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2819.htm], and the Letter in 382 to [[Pope Damasus I]] and the Latin bishops from the [[First Council of Constantinople]] [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-63.htm#TopOfPage]&lt;/ref&gt; council of [[bishop]]s of the [[Roman Empire]], and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian [[doctrine]], called the [[Nicene Creed]]. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent 'general ([[ecumenical]]) councils of bishops' ([[synod]]s) to create statements of belief and [[Canon law|canons]] of doctrinal [[orthodoxy]]— the intent being to define unity of beliefs for the [[State church of the Roman Empire]] and eradicate [[heresy|heretical]] ideas.

The purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements in the [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] over the nature of [[Jesus]] in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the [[Homoousia|same substance]] as [[God the Father]] or merely of [[Homoiousia|similar substance]]. [[St. Alexander of Alexandria]] and [[Athanasius]] took the first position; the popular [[presbyter]] [[Arius]], from whom the term [[Arianism|Arian controversy]] comes, took the second. The council decided against the Arians overwhelmingly. (Of the estimated 250-318 attendees, all but 2 [[voting|voted]] against Arius).

Christian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Evangelical) follow this decision, which was codified in 381 and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the [[Trinity]], comprising the three "Persons" [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]], the three of this unity are described as being "of the same substance" ({{lang|grc|[[Homoousian|ὁμοούσιος]]}}).

Some critics, especially among [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]],. This concept dates from the teachings of the Alexandrian Church, which claimed that Jesus, having appeared later in the Bible than his "Father," had to be a secondary, lesser, and therefore "distinct" God. This controversy led to the convention of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaean council]] in 325 CE. Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: "I believe in one God".--&gt;

Jordan Paper, a Western scholar and self-described polytheist, considers polytheism to be the normal state in human culture. He argues that "Even the Catholic Church shows polytheistic aspects with the 'worshipping' of the saints." On the other hand, he complains, monotheistic missionaries and scholars were eager to see a proto-monotheism or at least [[henotheism]] in polytheistic religions, for example, when taking from the Chinese pair of Sky and Earth only one part and calling it the ''King of Heaven'', as [[Matteo Ricci]] did.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Paper: The Deities are Many. A Polytheistic Theology. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2005, pp. 112 and 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Further information|Hindu views on monotheism}}
Hinduism is not a monolithic religion: many extremely varied religious traditions and practices are grouped together under this umbrella term and some modern scholars have questioned the legitimacy of unifying them artificially and suggest that one should speak of "Hinduisms" in the plural.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Brian. "Hinduism." New Dictionary of the History of Ideas. 2005. Retrieved May 22, 2013 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424300342.html&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic [[Hinduism]] encompasses both monotheistic and polytheistic tendencies and variations on or mixes of both structures.

Hindus venerate deities in the form of the ''[[murti]]'', or idol. The ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]]'' (worship) of the [[murti]] is like a way to communicate with the formless, abstract divinity ([[Brahman]] in Hinduism) which creates, sustains and dissolves creation. However, there are sects who have advocated that there is no need of giving a shape to God and it is omnipresent and beyond the things which human can see or feel tangibly. Specially the [[Arya Samaj]] founded by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayananda Saraswati]] and [[Brahmo Samaj]] founder by [[Ram Mohan Roy]] (there are others also) do not worship deities. Arya Samaj favours [[Mantra|Vedic chants]] and Havan, Brahmo Samaj go for simple prayers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Some Hindu philosophers and theologians argue for a transcendent metaphysical structure with a single divine essence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} This divine essence is usually referred to as [[Brahman]] or [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], but the understanding of the nature of this absolute divine essence is the line which defines many Hindu philosophical traditions such as [[Vedanta]].

Among lay Hindus, some believe in different deities emanating from Brahman, while others practice more traditional polytheism and henotheism, focusing their worship on one or more personal deities, while granting the existence of others.

Academically speaking, the ancient Vedic scriptures, upon which Hinduism is derived, describe four authorized disciplic lines of teaching coming down over thousands of years. (Padma Purana). Four of them propound that the Absolute Truth is Fully Personal, as in Judeo-Christian theology. That the Primal Original God is Personal, both transcendent and immanent throughout creation. He can be, and is often approached through worship of Murtis, called "Archa-Vigraha", which are described in the Vedas as likenesses of His various dynamic, spiritual Forms. This is the Vaisnava theology.

The fifth disciplic line of Vedic spirituality, founded by [[Adi Shankaracharya]], promotes the concept that the Absolute is Brahman, without clear differentiations, without will, without thought, without intelligence.

In the [[Smarta]] denomination of Hinduism, the philosophy of [[Advaita]] expounded by [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] allows veneration of numerous deities {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} with the understanding that all of them are but manifestations of one impersonal divine power, [[Brahman]]. Therefore, according to various schools of Vedanta including Shankara, which is the most influential and important Hindu theological tradition, there are a great number of deities in Hinduism, such as [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Ganesha]], [[Hanuman]], [[Lakshmi]], and [[Kali]], but they are essentially different forms of the same "Being".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, many Vedantic philosophers also argue that all individuals were united by the same impersonal, divine power in the form of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]].

Many other Hindus, however, view polytheism as far preferable to monotheism. [[Ram Swarup]], for example, points to the [[Vedas]] as being specifically polytheistic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goel|first=Sita Ram|title=Defence of Hindu Society|year=1987|publisher=Voice of India|location=New Delhi, India|url=http://voi.org/books/hindusoc/ch5.htm|quote="In the Vedic approach, there is no single God. This is bad enough. But the Hindus do not have even a supreme God, a fuhrer-God who presides over a multiplicity of Gods." -- Ram Swarup}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that, "only some form of polytheism alone can do justice to this variety and richness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goel|first=Sita Ram|title=Defence of Hindu Society|year=1987|publisher=Voice of India|location=New Delhi, India|url=http://voi.org/books/hindusoc/ch5.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sita Ram Goel]], another 20th-century Hindu historian, wrote:

{{quotation|"I had an occasion to read the typescript of a book [Ram Swarup] had finished writing in 1973. It was a profound study of Monotheism, the central dogma of both Islam and Christianity, as well as a powerful presentation of what the monotheists denounce as Hindu Polytheism. I had never read anything like it. It was a revelation to me that Monotheism was not a religious concept but an imperialist idea. I must confess that I myself had been inclined towards Monotheism till this time. I had never thought that a multiplicity of Gods was the natural and spontaneous expression of an evolved consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goel|first=Sita Ram|title=How I became a Hindu|year=1982|publisher=Voice of India|location=New Delhi, India|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some Hindus construe this notion of polytheism in the sense of polymorphism—one God with many forms or names. The [[Rig Veda]], the primary Hindu scripture, elucidates this as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutman. ''To what is One'', sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan. '''Book I, Hymn 164, Verse 46 Rigveda'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RigVeda|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01164.htm|work=The Sacred Books|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reconstructionism===
{{main article|Polytheistic reconstructionism}}
Reconstructionist polytheists apply scholarly disciplines such as [[history]], [[archaeology]] and [[linguistics|language study]] to revive ancient, traditional religions that have been fragmented, damaged or even destroyed, such as [[Norse Paganism]], [[Greek Paganism]], [[Celtic polytheism]] and others. A reconstructionist endeavours to revive and reconstruct an authentic practice, based on the ways of the ancestors but workable in contemporary life. These polytheists sharply differ from neopagans in that they consider their religion not only inspired by the religions of antiquity but often as an actual continuation or revival of those religions.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hellenismos Today|author=Alexander, T.J.|date=2007|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781430314271|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ie-aHv8rzHoC&amp;pg=PA14|page=14|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serer religion===
{{main article|Serer religion|Timeline of Serer history|States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes}}
In [[Africa]], polytheism in [[Serer religion]] dates as far back to the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Era]] (possibly earlier) when the [[Timeline of Serer history|ancient ancestors of the Serer people]] represented their ''[[Pangool]]'' on the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]].&lt;ref name="Serer religion"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''"La civilisation Sereer'' - ''Pangool"'', Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal, (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}. pp 9, 20, 77&lt;/ref&gt;  The supreme creator deity in Serer religion is [[Roog]].

==Neopaganism==

'''Neopaganism''', also known as '''modern paganism''' and '''contemporary paganism''',{{Sfn|Adler|2006|p=xiii}} is a group of contemporary [[religious movement]]s influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[historical pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.{{Sfn|Lewis|2004|p=13}}{{Sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=84}} Although they do share commonalities, contemporary Pagan religious movements are diverse and no single set of beliefs, practices, or [[Religious text|text]]s are shared by them all.{{Sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=40}}

[[English people|English]] [[occultist]] [[Dion Fortune]] was a major populiser of ''soft polytheism''.

=={{anchor|Use as a term of abuse}}Use as a term of abuse==
The term 'polytheist' is sometimes used by [[Sunni]] Muslim groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) as a [[derogatory]] reference to [[Shiite]] Muslims, whom they view as having "strayed from Islam’s monotheistic creed because of the reverence they show for historical figures, like [[Imam Ali]]".&lt;ref name=NYT2018-01-17a&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/world/middleeast/iraq-baghdad-isis-bombing.html|title=ISIS Claims Responsibility for Baghdad Bombings|last=Callimachi|first=Rukmini|date=2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-21|last2=Coker|first2=Margaret|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|quote=The second refers to the group’s view that Shiites have strayed from Islam’s monotheistic creed because of the reverence they show for historical figures, like Imam Ali.}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Polydeism==
Polydeism (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πολλοί'' ('' 'poloi' ''), meaning 'many', and [[Latin]] ''[[deus]]'' meaning god) is a [[polytheistic]] form of [[deism]] encompassing the belief that the [[universe]] was the collective creation of multiple [[deity|god]]s, each of whom created a piece of the universe or [[multiverse]] and then ceased to intervene in its evolution. This concept addresses an apparent contradiction in deism, that a [[monotheism|monotheistic God]] created the universe, but now expresses no apparent interest in it, by supposing that if the universe is the construct of many gods, none of them would have an interest in the universe as a whole.

===History of the term===
[[Creighton University]] Philosophy professor [[William O. Stephens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/Bill.htm Article on "Bill" Stephens]&lt;/ref&gt; who teaches this concept to his students, suggests that [[C. D. Broad]] projected this concept&lt;ref&gt;[http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/Stephens/phl-323-Spr05-Revu-Q-4.htm article on C. D. Broad's concept projection]&lt;/ref&gt; in Broad's 1925 article, "The Validity of Belief in a Personal God".&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Broad, "The Validity of Belief in a Personal God", reprinted in C. D. Broad, ''Religion, Philosophy and Psychical Research'', (1953), 159–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Broad noted that the arguments for the [[existence of God]] only tend to prove that "a designing mind ''had'' existed in the past, not that it ''does'' exist now. It is quite compatible with this argument that God should have died long ago, or that he should have turned his attention to other parts of the Universe," and notes in the same breath that "there is nothing in the facts to suggest that there is only one such being".&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens contends that Broad, in turn, derived the concept from [[David Hume]]. Stephens states:
:David Hume's criticisms of the [[argument from design]] include the argument that, for all we know, a committee of very powerful, but not omnipotent, divine beings could have collaborated in creating the world, but then afterwards left it alone or even ceased to exist.  This would be polydeism.

Use of this term as a [[portmanteau]] for this purpose appears to originate at least as early as [[Robert M. Bowman, Jr.]]'s 1997 essay, ''Apologetics from Genesis to Revelation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantaapologist.org/GenesisToRevelation.PDF Atlanta Apologist: Genesis to Relevations PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Bowman wrote:
:[[Materialism]] (illustrated by the [[Epicureans]]), represented today by [[atheism]], [[skepticism]], and deism. The materialist may acknowledge superior beings, but they do not believe in a Supreme Being. Epicureanism was founded about 300 BC by [[Epicurus]]. Their world view might be called "polydeism:" there are many gods, but they are merely superhuman beings; they are remote, uninvolved in the world, posing no threat and offering no hope to human beings. Epicureans regarded traditional religion and [[idolatry]] as harmless enough as long as the gods were not feared or expected to do or say anything.

===Etymologically disjunctive uses of the term===
The term polydeism has occasionally been used as a direct substitute for polytheism – a usage which does not consider certain distinctions which have arisen between the respective [[root word]]s, [[deism]] and [[theism]]. The above description of polydeism would be a distinct subset of polytheism.

Sociologist [[Susan Starr Sered]] used the term in her 1994 book, ''Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister : Religions Dominated by Women'', which includes a chapter titled, "No Father in Heaven: Androgyny and Polydeism." Sered states therein that she has "chosen to gloss on 'polydeism' a range of beliefs in more than one supernatural entity." Id. at 169. Sered used this term in a way that would encompass polytheism, rather than exclude much of it, as she intended to capture both polytheistic systems and nontheistic systems that assert the influence of "spirits or ancestors." Id. This use of the term, however, does not accord with the historical misuse of ''deism'' as a concept to describe an absent [[creator god]].

In 2006, Protestants made up a little over 5% of the state's population. Their population experienced a long period of decline over the 19th and 20th centuries, but grows in the 21st century.

The parts of Ireland where the number of Protestants were of higher proportion was closely related to the plantations that occurred throughout the 16th and 17th centuries and the areas where British influence was strongest.&lt;ref name="ANHI"/&gt; The decline in the number of Protestants in the south during the 20th-century is usually attributed to the [[Partition of Ireland]] in 1921 and the after-effects. It has been suggested however that the pattern of migration may have started in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81"/&gt; Important factors for this emigration were socio-economic factors, reinforced by political factors.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81"/&gt; Irish independence in 1921 however may have accelerated the process.&lt;ref name="Delaney82"/&gt;

Research done on the decline of Protestantism in Dublin between 1870 and 1926 provides various reasons, including:

• Working class Protestants having a strong inclination to marry British soldiers, who upon the end of their tour of duty would then be posted to other parts of the British Isles.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt;

• Between 1901 and 1911, 15% of Protestant males were in mixed-marriages.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt; The 1901 census indicates that nearly 80% of mixed-marriages resulted in any children being brought up as Catholics, even before the Vatican issued ''[[Ne Temere]]'' in 1907,&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt; which meant that children in all mixed-marriages must be brought up as Catholics. In the following period from 1911 to 1926 it seems likely that due to an increase in contention between Protestants and Catholics, there was a decrease in mixed-marriages.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt;

• The end of [[World War I]] saw the de-industrialisation of Dublin and migration of skilled Protestant workers seeking work.&lt;ref name="Delaney82" /&gt;

==Decline after creation of the Irish Free State==
After the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, the Protestant population declined sharply, reasons for which included:

• Intimidation from the Catholic majority.

• The end of the union between southern Ireland and Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Delaney71-2" /&gt;

• The departure of British personnel, such as soldiers and public servants.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Delaney71-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANHI139" /&gt;

• According to the ''Church of Ireland Gazette'': Protestants "have a wholly disproportionate number of old people compared with young, in comparison to Roman Catholics".&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt; They were also likely to marry later in life and have fewer children than their Catholic counterparts.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt;

• The ''Church of Ireland Gazette'' also remarks on the "forced exodus of large numbers" during the period of the early 1920s known as the Troubles.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81" /&gt; 

• The Catholic ethos of the Free State.&lt;ref name="ANHI139" /&gt;

• Symbols of British influence were seen as an integral part of the Protestant tradition during the interwar period between World War I and II, however the Free State's intent on removing them was viewed by southern Protestants as sectarian.&lt;ref name="Delaney77-78" /&gt;

• The introduction of a "Gaelicisation" policy.&lt;ref name="Delaney77-78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANHI233" /&gt; The compulsory teaching of the [[Irish language]] in schools saw some Protestant parents send their children to school in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Delaney77-78" /&gt; It also meant that Irish was compulsory for roles in the civil service,&lt;ref name="Delaney77-78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANHI233" /&gt; which resulted in "the continuing emigration of young Protestants in search of jobs", with the requirement seen as "disguised discrimination" by some.&lt;ref name="Delaney77-78" /&gt;

• The influence of the Catholic Church on government policy, such as: the banning of divorce and contraception; censorship of films and books; and in the education system.&lt;ref name="ANHI233" /&gt; This reached its peak with the 1937 constitution giving the Catholic Church "special position" in the state.&lt;ref name="ANHI233" /&gt;

The exact numbers of migration based upon religious affiliation before 1926 is complicated by various different reasons.&lt;ref name="Delaney71-2"/&gt; However between the 1911 and 1926 census' it has been suggested that there was a migration of 106,456 people from minority-religions, with at least 60,000 Protestants not connected to the British administration in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Delaney71-2"/&gt; During this period the number of Protestants in what became the Irish Free State dropped from 10% to 7%.&lt;ref name="ANHI"/&gt; This represented a drop of 32% in the Protestant population compared to the 2% drop in the Catholic population.&lt;ref name="ANHI"/&gt; This decrease is often linked to the removal of British forces from the Free State, however the rate of decline was quite similar between native and foreign born Protestants and the drop was five times greater than the total number of Protestants in the British forces in 1911.&lt;ref name="ANHI"/&gt;

===Treatment of Protestants===

The Irish Free State had few overt discriminatory religious policies against Protestants and prided itself on its treatment of religious minorities. Delaney argues that this was motivated by the desire to  assure Protestants in Northern Ireland that they would receive equal treatment and religious liberty in a future united Ireland.&lt;ref name="Delaney82"/&gt;

However, Delaney writes that southern Protestants were "penalised and ill-treated" for being a cultural minority.&lt;ref name="Delaney82"/&gt; Nationalism, which was in essence Catholic and Gaelic, took on a triumphalist tone in the state.&lt;ref name="ANHI139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisis"/&gt; Social policy during the 1922-1932 government administration was largely based on Catholic beliefs, and events such as the [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)|Eucharistic Congress of 1932]], helped reinforce the exalted status the Catholic Church enjoyed.&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt; The zenith of this anti-British, Catholic and Gaelic ethos came about after the 1932 election,&lt;ref name="ANHI233"/&gt; exemplify by the newly elected Taoiseach, [[Éamon de Valera]], refusal to change or compromise on his views of a [[united Ireland]] that emphasised Gaelic and Catholic values.&lt;ref name="ANHI233"/&gt;

Cosgrove writes that Protestant children were treated fairly and at times given preferential treatment in the education system.&lt;ref name="ANHI139"/&gt; However, during the 1930s despite the fact education in the Free State was under denominational control, Catholicism became more influential and pervasive in the Irish governments education policy,&lt;ref name="ANHI233"/&gt; resulting in the Catholic Church having more control over the education system than any other country in the world.&lt;ref name="ANHI233"/&gt;

One of the most infamous incidents of overt discrimination against Protestants was the Dunbar-Harrison case in 1930.&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt; In this instance a Protestant, [[Letitia Dunbar-Harrison]], applied to become a librarian.&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt; The Mayo Library Committee, mostly composed of prominent local Catholics including a bishop, originally said that she had inadequate knowledge of Irish for the role.&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt; Later during the debate it was remarked "could a Protestant be trusted to hand out books to Catholics?".&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt; Dunbar-Harrison was appointed, with the support of the national government, but in the fall-out Mayo County Council was dissolved, and there was strong opposition to the appointment from some prominent Catholic clerics and politicians.&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt; Despite the government standing its ground on the appointment, a boycott of the library resulted in [[W. T. Cosgrave]], [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]], and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Catholic Archbishop of Tuam]], Dr. [[Thomas Gilmartin]], coming to an agreement to transfer Dunbar-Harrison from Mayo library to a post in Dublin in January 1932.&lt;ref name="Delaney74-75"/&gt;

Another incident of overt discrimination against Protestants was the [[Fethard-on-Sea boycott]] in [[County Wexford]], 1957.&lt;ref name="Connolly199"/&gt; In this instance a local Protestant woman who had married a Catholic fled to Belfast after failing to honour her promise to educate her children as Catholics.&lt;ref name="Connolly199"/&gt; This resulted in Catholics backed by a number of Catholic priests and bishops boycotting Protestant businesses in the area despite condemnation from the Irish government.&lt;ref name="Connolly199"/&gt;

===Impact===
Between 1922-1923, emigration consisted of not just families, but also young individuals.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81"/&gt; In the period between 1926–1936, a greater proportion of young Protestants between the ages of 10–24 years old appear to have emigrated from the Free State compared to older Protestants.&lt;ref name="Delaney77-78"/&gt; The decrease in the number of Protestants resulted in an even greater proportion of Catholics and thus the culture associated with it, furthering Protestant marginalisation and giving the perception of Catholic triumphalism.&lt;ref name="ANHI139"/&gt; The coverage of the 1936 census results by ''[[The Irish News]]'' in 1939 was later reprinted by the [[Ulster Unionist Council]] as vindication for their belief of what would happen to Irish Protestants as a whole in a united Ireland under home rule.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81"/&gt;

Areas where the Protestant minority was strongest tended to see the least decline, primary examples being the three Ulster counties that became part of the Free State: [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]].&lt;ref name="ANHI"/&gt; Meanwhile, urban centres and military towns saw the greatest decrease.&lt;ref name="ANHI"/&gt; This helped contribute to a greater concentration of [[Protestantism in Northern Ireland|Protestants in Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="ANHI"/&gt;

This emigration affected the Free State economy as Protestants formed a significant part of its commercial and cultural activities.&lt;ref name="Delaney79-81"/&gt;

==Modern reversal in decline==
From 1921 to 1991 there was a decrease in the Protestant population in the Irish Free State and then the Republic of Ireland, however by the 2002, there has been an increase in the three main Protestant denominations: Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, and Methodism.&lt;ref name="Census2002Vol12"/&gt;

The number of Protestants belonging to the Church of Ireland in the Republic in 1991 stood at 89,197.&lt;ref name="Census2002Vol12"/&gt; By 2006, this number was 121,229, and by 2011 129,039.&lt;ref name="Census2002Vol12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irelandstatsCD753"/&gt; It was during the 2002-2006 period that the number of members of the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Church surpassed their 1946 totals.&lt;ref name="Census2002Vol12"/&gt; [[County Clare]] has the smallest population of Protestants in Ireland however its county town, [[Ennis, County Clare|Ennis]], saw a six-fold increase in the Church of Ireland population - 68 to 400.&lt;ref name="IWCN"/&gt; The Presbyterian church between 1991 and 2002 saw an increase of almost 56%, followed by an increase of almost 20% between 2002 and 2011. The Methodist Church saw its membership increase nearly 100% between 1991 and 2002, though by 2011 it had declined by 31%.&lt;ref name="Census2002Vol12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irelandstatsCD753"/&gt;

The cause of this growth is stated as being a mixture of Protestant immigration and the conversion of Catholics.&lt;ref name="IWCN"/&gt; One notable convert was the [[Dean of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]], Dr. [[Dermot Dunne]], who was formerly a Catholic cleric.&lt;ref name="IWCN"/&gt; It has been suggested that Catholic Ireland has become more Protestant in social terms, whilst Protestantism itself has become more Catholic in some of its practices.&lt;ref name="IWCN"/&gt;

Despite this, Protestantism since 2002 has been relegated to the third largest group recorded on the census, having been overtaken by those who choose "No Religion".&lt;ref name="irelandstatsCD753"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CensusReport7page6"/&gt; Overall Protestants accounted for 4% of the total Irish population in 2006 and 2011.&lt;ref name="irelandstatsCD753"/&gt; In the 2016 census Protestantism accounted for 4.2% of the population.&lt;ref name="pop2016v2"/&gt;

In regards to immigration, of the 137,048 people from the three main Protestant denominations (Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist) to declare their country of birth, only 94,889 (69.2%) stated the Republic.&lt;ref name="Census2002Vol12"/&gt; 27,928 of these immigrants came from the United Kingdom, whilst 3,575 were born in the rest of Europe, 6,641 were from Africa, 1,341 from Asia, 1,730 from America, and 944 from elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Census2002Vol12"/&gt;

'''Sanctum''' is a sacred place, in a [[shrine]] within a [[temple]] or [[church (building)|church]]. It also refers to a sacred place of [[pilgrimage]].  

The Latin word ''[[wikt:sanctum|sanctum]]'' is the neuter form of the adjective "[[sacred|holy]]".

She is credited with pioneering neo-Nazi interest in [[occultism]], deep ecology and the [[New Age]] movement, and more contemporaneously has influenced the [[alt-right]].&lt;ref name="Influence on the Alt-right"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-41757047 |title=Savitri Devi: The mystical fascist being resurrected by the alt-right |date=2017-10-29 |website=BBC Magazine |access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also influenced the Chilean diplomat [[Miguel Serrano]]. In 1982, [[Franco Freda]] published a German translation of her work ''Gold in the Furnace'', and the fourth volume of his annual review, ''Risguardo'' (1980–), was devoted to Savitri Devi as the "missionary of Aryan [[Paganism]]".&lt;ref name=HP&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m6-5YC-pBk4C "Hitler's Priestess: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism"], Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke.

Savitri was an associate in the post-war years of [[Françoise Dior]],&lt;ref name=BS /&gt; [[Otto Skorzeny]],&lt;ref name=BS&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xaiaM77s6N4C "Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity"], Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. NYU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-3155-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3155-0}}. p. 97-106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes von Leers]],&lt;ref name=BS /&gt; and [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]].&lt;ref name=BS /&gt; She was also one of the founding members of the [[World Union of National Socialists]].&lt;ref name="Black Sun"/&gt;

==Early years==
Born as Maximiani Julia Portas in 1905,&lt;ref name=TN /&gt; Savitri Devi was the daughter of Maxim Portas, a French citizen of Greek and Italian ancestry and an Englishwoman, Julia Portas (née Nash). Maximine Portas was born two and a half months [[Premature birth|premature]], weighing only 930&amp;nbsp;grams (2.05&amp;nbsp;lbs), and was not at first expected to live. She formed her political views early. From childhood and throughout her life, she was a passionate advocate for [[animal rights]]. Her earliest political affiliations were with [[Greek nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Black Sun"/&gt;

Portas studied philosophy and chemistry, earning two [[master's degree]]s and a [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy from the [[University of Lyon]].&lt;ref name=TN /&gt; She next traveled to Greece, and surveyed the legendary ruins. Here, she became familiar with [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s discovery of [[swastika]]s in [[Anatolia]]. Her conclusion was that [[Ancient Greeks]] were [[Aryan]] in origin. Her first two books were her [[doctoral dissertation]]s: ''Essai-critique sur Théophile Kaïris'' (''Critical Essay on [[Theophilos Kairis]]'') (Lyon: Maximine Portas, 1935) and ''La simplicité mathématique'' (''Mathematical Simplicity'') (Lyon: Maximine Portas, 1935). Sometime between 1932 and 1935, she was the French tutor of the philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (1922–1997), as he revealed in a radio interview by Katherine von Bülow (''France Culture'' 20/4/1996).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mourningtheancient.com/savitri.htm "Savitri Devi: The Woman Against Time"] by R. G. Fowler. ''Mourning the Ancient''. Accessed 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Socialism===
In early 1928, she renounced her French citizenship and acquired [[Greek Nationality Law|Greek nationality]]. Joining a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] during [[Lent]] in 1929, Portas decided that she was a [[Nazism|National Socialist]].

In 1932, she travelled to India in search of a living [[Paganism|pagan]] Aryan culture. Formally adhering to [[Hinduism]], she took the name Savitri Devi ("Sun-rays Goddess" in [[Sanskrit]]). She volunteered at the Hindu Mission as an advocate against [[Judeo-Christianity]],&lt;ref name=CF /&gt; and wrote ''[[A Warning to the Hindus]]'' to offer her support for [[Hindu nationalism]] and independence, and to rally resistance to the spread of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] in India.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt; During the 1930s, she distributed pro-Axis propaganda and engaged in intelligence gathering on the British in India.&lt;ref name=TN /&gt; She claimed that, during the World War II, she enabled [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] (leader of the Axis-affiliated [[Indian National Army]]) to make contact with representatives of the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/mar/27hitler.htm Shrabani Basu, 1999, "The spy who loved Hitler", ''Rediff'']; (6 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Devi's connection to the [[Axis powers]] led to a clash with her mother, who served with the [[French Resistance]] during the German occupation of France.&lt;ref name=nephews&gt;[http://www.savitridevi.org/article-nephews.html Greg Johnson, 2006, "Savitri Devi’s Communist Nephews", ''savitridevi.org'']; (6 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, Devi married [[Asit Krishna Mukherji]], a [[Bengal]]i [[Brahmin]] with National Socialist views who edited the pro-German newspaper ''New Mercury''. During 1941, Devi chose to interpret [[Operation Lustre|Allied military support]] for Greece, against Italian and German forces, as an invasion of Greece. Devi and Mukherji continued to gather intelligence for the Axis cause. This included entertaining Allied personnel, which gave Devi and Mukherji an opportunity to question them regarding military matters. The information gathered was passed on to Japanese intelligence officials and contributed to attacks on Allied airbases and army units.&lt;ref name="rediff" /&gt;

==Post-war Nazi activism==
After [[World War II]], she travelled to Europe in late 1945&lt;ref name=BS /&gt; under the name Savitri Devi Mukherji as the wife of a British subject from India, under a [[British passport|British Indian passport]]. She stopped briefly in England, then visited her mother in France, and then travelled on to Iceland where she witnessed the [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Hekla|Mount Hekla]]. She then returned to England, before travelling to Sweden where she met with [[Sven Hedin]].&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;

On 15 June 1948 she took the [[Nord Express|Nord-Expreß]] from Denmark to Germany,&lt;ref name=HP /&gt; where she distributed many thousands of copies of handwritten leaflets encouraging the "Men and women of Germany" to "hold fast to our glorious National Socialist faith, and resist!" She recounted her experience in ''Gold in the Furnace'' (which has been reedited in honor of her 100th birthday under the title ''Gold in the Furnace: Experiences in Post-War Germany'').&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=BS /&gt;

Arrested for posting bills, she was tried in Düsseldorf on 5 April 1949 for the promotion of Nazi ideas on German territory subject to the [[Allied Control Council]], and sentenced to two years imprisonment. She served eight months in [[Werl prison]], where she befriended her fellow Nazi and [[SS]] prisoners (recounted in ''[[Defiance (book)|Defiance]]''), before being released and expelled from Germany. She then went to stay in Lyon, France.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=BS /&gt;

In April 1953, she obtained a Greek passport in her [[maiden name]] in order to re-enter Germany, and she began a [[pilgrimage]], as she called it, of Nazi "holy" sites. She flew from Athens to Rome then travelled by rail over the [[Brenner Pass]] into "[[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]]", which she regarded as "the spiritual home of all racially conscious modern [[Aryan race|Aryans]]". She travelled to a number of sites significant in the life of Adolf Hitler and the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi party), as well as German nationalist and heathen monuments, as recounted in her 1958 book ''[[Pilgrimage (book)|Pilgrimage]]''.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;

Savitri Devi became friends with [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]], and completed her manuscript of ''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'' at his home in March 1956. Through his introductions she was able to meet a number of Nazi émigrés in Spain and the Middle East. In 1957 she stayed with [[Johannes von Leers]] in Egypt as she traveled across the Middle East when returning home to New Delhi, including stops in Beirut, [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], [[Tehran]], and [[Zahedan]].&lt;ref name=HP /&gt; In 1961 she stayed with [[Otto Skorzeny]] in Madrid.&lt;ref name=BS /&gt;

Savitri Devi took employment teaching in France during the 1960s, spending her summer holidays with friends at [[Berchtesgaden]]. In the spring of 1961, while on her Easter holiday in London she learned of the original [[British National Party (1960)|British National Party]]. This group emerged after the Second World War when a handful of former members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] took on the name. (The original BNP was absorbed quite quickly into the [[Union Movement]] – it is not directly connected with the present [[British National Party|BNP]].) She met with the British National Party president [[Andrew Fountaine]]. Beginning a correspondence with [[Colin Jordan]], she became a devoted supporter of the [[National Socialist Movement (1960s)|National Socialist Movement]].&lt;ref name=BS /&gt;

In August 1962, Savitri Devi attended the international Nazi conference in [[Gloucestershire]] and was a founder-signatory of the Cotswold Agreement that established the [[World Union of National Socialists]] (WUNS). At this conference she met, and was greatly impressed by, [[George Lincoln Rockwell]]. When Rockwell became leader of WUNS, he appointed [[William Luther Pierce]] editor of its new magazine: ''National Socialist World'' (1966–68). Along with articles by Jordan and Rockwell, Pierce devoted nearly eighty pages of the first issue to a condensed edition of ''The Lightning and the Sun''. Because of the enthusiastic response, Pierce included chapters from ''Gold in the Furnace'' and ''Defiance'' in subsequent issues.&lt;ref name=BS /&gt;

After retiring from teaching in 1970, Savitri Devi spent nine months at the Normandy home of close friend [[Françoise Dior]] while working on her memoirs; although she was at first welcome, her annoying personal habits began to disrupt life at the presbytery (amongst other traits, she did not take a bath during her stay and chewed garlic continually).  Concluding that her pension would go much further in India and encouraged by Françoise Dior, she flew from Paris to Bombay on 23 June 1971. In August she moved to New Delhi, where she lived alone, with a number of cats and at least one cobra.&lt;ref name=BS /&gt;

Savitri Devi continued correspondence with Nazi enthusiasts in Europe and the Americas, particularly with [[Colin Jordan]], [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], [[Matt Koehl]], [[Miguel Serrano]] and [[Ernst Zündel]]. She was the first to claim to Zündel that the [[Holocaust denial|Nazi genocide of the Jews was untrue]]; he proposed a series of taped interviews (conducted in November 1978) and published a new illustrated edition of ''The Lightning and the Sun'' in 1979.&lt;ref name=BS /&gt;

==Animal rights activism==
Devi was a pioneer in [[animal rights]] activism, and was a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] from a young age and held [[Environmentalism|ecologist]] views in her works. She wrote ''[[Impeachment of Man]]'' in 1959 in India&lt;ref name=TN /&gt; in which she declared her views on animal rights and nature. According to her, human beings do not stand above the animals; but in her ecologist views, humans are rather a part of the ecosystem and should respect all life, including animals and the whole of nature.

She always held radical views on vegetarianism&lt;ref name=TN /&gt; and supported the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for those who did not "respect nature or animals". She once broke into laboratories and took animals being held there, releasing them from being used in experiments.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} She believed that [[vivisection]], [[circuses]], [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] and [[fur]] industries among others do not belong in a civilized society.

==Death==
By the late 1970s she had developed cataracts and her eyesight was rapidly deteriorating. A clerk from the French embassy in India named Myriam Hirn looked after her, making regular house visits. She decided to leave India, returning to Germany to live in Bavaria in 1981 before re-moving to France in 1982.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

She eventually died in 1982 in [[Sible Hedingham]], Essex, England, at a friend's home. The cause of death was recorded as [[myocardial infarction]] and [[coronary thrombosis]]. She was ''en route'' to lecture in [[United States|America]] at the invitation of [[Matthias Koehl|Matt Koehl]] at the time. Devi's ashes are enshrined next to those of [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] in the small red brick building, often misidentified today as Rockwell's former headquarters (now a coffee shop called The Java Shack) in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=BS/&gt;

Imam '''Shamsi Ali''' is a prominent [[moderate]] Muslim Scholar known for promoting interfaith dialogues among [[Abrahamic Religions]] in United States and the Chairman of the Al-Hikmah Mosque and the Director of Jamaica Muslim Center in [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York City]].

== Early life ==
Ali was born as '''Muhammad Utteng Ali''' in the village of [[Bulukumba]] in [[Kajang (Indonesia)|Kajang]] district of [[Bulukumba Regency]] in [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]] on October 5, 1967. He is the third of six children (though only five survived into adulthood). His parents were a couple with farming background, Ali Kadrun (father) and Inong Tippangrom (mother).&lt;ref name=SOA&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkfCGnh7sn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sons+of+Abraham&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yVGBU_HpOdDaoATOw4KQDA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sons%20of%20Abraham&amp;f=false|title=Sons of Abraham:A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims|isbn=978-08070-33074|last1=Schneier|first1=Marc|last2=Ali|first2=Shamsi|publisher= Beacon Press|format=hard|place=NY|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents were not religious, but they wanted him to learn how to read the [[Koran]], so they sent him to ''Daarul Arqam'' Islamic boarding school.&lt;ref name=SOA/&gt; During his childhood, Utteng (as he used to be called) was rebellious, lazy and often truant.&lt;ref name=SOA/&gt; He was one time detained for hitting a student named Mustafa, breaking his nose and sending him to the hospital. Mustafa's parents then called the police and they arrested him, though he was not entirely guilty. Finally Utteng was jailed for two weeks. Fortunately, he was not expelled from the boarding school due to the incident.

His name was changed from ''Utteng'' to ''Shamsi'' (an Arabic word which means ''Sun'') when he and his father met with the ''Daarul Arqam'' school headmaster, Abdul Jabbar Asyiri. The headmaster argued that in Islam, the name is a prayer and should have a good sense, and he eventually renamed his middle name from ''Utteng'' to ''Shamsi'' with hope, Utteng could be the praiseworthy one (from his first name) and can illuminate (from his middle name, with the same way the sun does) people's hearts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dakwatuna.com/2013/12/01/42945/terpana-dengan-buku-imam-shamsi-ali-menebar-dakwah-di-bumi-barat/#ixzz32NcNu1aZ|title=Terpana dengan Buku Imam Shamsi Ali: Menebar Dakwah di Bumi Barat|language=id|publisher=dakwatuna|first=Irhamni|last=Rofiun|date=December 1, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
After completing primary school at age 12 in the village of [[Tana Toa]] in Bulukumba [[Regency]], his parents sent him to ''Darul-Arqam'' [[pesantren]] (Islamic [[boarding school]]) in [[Makassar]], which is owned by the [[Muhammadiyah]] organization. After graduating from the boarding school in 1987, Shamsi Ali stayed there as a teacher until the end of 1988.

He received a scholarship offer from [[Muslim World League|Rabithah Alam Islami]] to study at the [[International Islamic University, Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]]. He completed his undergraduate in [[Tafseer]] in 1992 and continued his master at the same university in the field of Comparative Religion in 1994. During his study in Pakistan, Shamsi Ali also worked as a lecturer at the school funded by Saudi Arabia, ''the [[Red Crescent Society]]'' in Islamabad, where later he received an offer to teach at the Islamic Education Foundation in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] in early 1995.

In 1996 [[Hajj]] season, Shamsi Ali got a mandate to speak at the Consulate General of Indonesia in Jeddah. From there, he met with some foreign hajj pilgrims, including the Indonesian Ambassador to the United Nations, [[Nugroho Wisnumurti]], who once offered him to come to New York to build a new mosque for Indonesian community. Shamsi Ali accepted the offer and moved to New York in early 1997.

Ali earned Ph.D in [[Political Science]] from [[University of Southern California|Southern California University]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.masjidalhikmahnewyork.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=90&amp;lang=in|title = Info Chairman|date = |accessdate = Jan 2, 2015|website = Masjid Al-Hikmah|publisher = Masjid Al-Hikmah New York|last = Vourloumis|first = Eirini}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.qgazette.com/news/2009-04-15/features/016.html?print=1|title = Imam To Speak At Free Synagogue Of Flushing|date = April 15, 2009|accessdate = January 2, 2015|work = Western Queens Gazette|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as his [[Native Language]] and [[Buginese language]] as his [[mother-tongue]], Ali is also fluent in Arabic, English, and Urdu.&lt;ref name="masjid_hikmah_new_york"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masjidalhikmahnewyork.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=90&amp;lang=in|title=Profile:  Muhammad Shamsi Ali|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
During his study in [[Islamabad]], he was hired as a [[muezzin]] in [[Faisal Mosque]], the biggest mosque in the city. He saved money to fund his [[hajj]] (pilgrimage) and wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pksbanguntapan.com/2012/08/syamsi-ali-dari-indonesia-mengembangkan.html|title=Shamsi Ali, Dai RI di AS yang Aktif Bangun Toleransi Antar-umat|publisher=detikNews|language=id|date=July 19, 2012|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in New York in 1996, he served as an imam to an Indonesian community mosque in [[Long Island City]], Queens. Through funding from the Indonesian Mission to the UN, Bank of Indonesia and the Indonesian consulate of New York, the community purchased a chemical warehouse for $350,000 on the 31st Street and 48th Avenue in [[Astoria, Queens]]. In 2001, he was appointed as deputy Imam of [[Islamic Cultural Center of New York]] which is the city’s largest mosque located in 96th street and 3rd Ave in [[Manhattan]], but left the position in 2011.

Shamsi Ali is also the Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] Muslim Federation of North America. He also serves as the Vice President of the Asian-American Coalition USA (AAC-USA) and its UN Representative and as an Advisory Board member to numerous interfaith organizations, including the [[Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding|Tanenbaum Center]] and [[Federation for Middle East Peace]].

In interfaith organizations, Imam Ali serves as a Board member for the Partnership of Faith in NY, and co-founder of the UNCC (Universal Clergy Coalition-International). Furthermore, he is also Assistant Director and a Board member of the Muslim Foundation of America, Inc., and Chairman of the annual Muslim Day Parade in NYC.

A few days after the [[September 11 attacks|events of 11 September 2001]], New York City chose him to represent the Muslim community to visit the scene, where he met President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="The Rise and fall of a New York Imam"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24468337|title=Shamsi Ali: The rise and fall of a New York imam|publisher=BBC|date=November 2, 2013|accessdate=May 19, 2014|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also recited a prayer at the memorial service for the September 11th victims at Yankee stadium in the Bronx.

In 2002, Ali was appointed "Ambassador for Peace" by the International Religious Federation, and a recipient of ICLI Interfaith Award in 2008. Ali was chosen as one of the seven most influential religious leaders in New York City by New York Magazine in 2006.&lt;ref name="huffington shamsi ali"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/imam-shamsi-ali/|title=Imam Shamsi Ali|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate= May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He represented the Muslim community at an interfaith discussion on Religions and Sustainable Development in the White House 2007, and took part in the Transatlantic Interfaith Dialogue in Frankfurt, Germany 2008.&lt;ref name="huffington shamsi ali" /&gt;

Within the Indonesian Muslim [[Indonesian American|community in North America]], he serves as an Advisory Board to major national Muslim organizations such as IMSA (Indonesian Muslim Society in America) and [[Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals|ICMI]] (Indonesian Muslim Intellectual Society in America).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shamsiali.com/biography/|title=Biography of Imam Shamsi Ali|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the president of '''Nusantara Foundation''', a community based operating and non-profit organization in New York that is established, publicly supported, operated by, and for the benefit of Indonesian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nusantara-foundation.org/html/about.html|title=Nusantara Foundation|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Shamsi Ali was accused by some people of [[Islamic Cultural Center of New York]] of misconduct during his time as the Imam. Furthermore, some congregations disagreed with his "liberal" approaches, especially his [[interfaith]] activities which they said were controversial. Other people at the mosque accused him not to do good in the wider community, but instead he went out and made friends with Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] and Police Commissioner Kelly. Some people then refused to attend Ali's prayers. His teachings about how to lead a modern Islamic life in a Western society infuriated some congregants.&lt;ref name="The Rise and fall of a New York Imam" /&gt;

One of scholars in South Africa even issued a [[fatwa]], cautioning Muslims against performing prayers led by Ali.&lt;ref name="The Rise and fall of a New York Imam" /&gt; The worst accusation against him was that he had been accused by [[takfiri]]s of committing [[apostasy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shamsialiexposed.com/latest_news.html|title=Boycott Shamsi Ali Based on This Fatwa|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fundamentalist Muslims in Queens disagreed with Ali's approach to youths to be closer to Islam. They accused him of corrupting Muslim youths' mentality by letting them use the mosque's basement for practicing music which they considered [[haram]]. They also accused him of being an [[FBI]] mouthpiece.&lt;ref name="FBI mouthpiece"/&gt; On another occasion, this group of people opposed Ali's defense of a Shi'a Muslim who was rallying against terrorism and injustice, whom they considered an [[infidel]]. According to Ali, one of these groups is thought to be an American offshoot of the London-based [[Al-Muhajiroun]], which is infamous for its conference "The Magnificent 19," praising those who carried out the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref name="FBI mouthpiece"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicthinkers.com/index/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=565&amp;Itemid=74|title="Imam" Shamsi Ali: an FBI Mouthpiece|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali left his position at ICC of New York (the management at ICC insisted that he was ''fired'') in 2011.&lt;ref name="The Rise and fall of a New York Imam" /&gt; He continues his position as the director of Jamaica Muslim Center in [[Astoria, Queens]] since 2004 and as the chairman of ''Al-Hikmah'' mosque since 1996.

In September 2015 Ali sharply criticized Chairman of the [[People's Representative Council|DPR]] of Indonesia, [[Setya Novanto]] and its Deputy Speaker [[Fadli Zon]] for attending [[Donald Trump]]'s press conference.&lt;ref name="notafraid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/09/06/shamsi-ali-says-he-not-afraid-lawsuit.html|title=Shamsi Ali says he is not afraid of lawsuit|work=Jakarta Post|date=September 6, 2015|access-date=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamsi said the meeting had humiliated Indonesian state leaders and was full of political interests. He said it was obvious that the press conference was part of a campaign event. He further said the presence of Setya and Fadli, who stood behind Trump as the US business tycoon delivered a speech, was deplorable.&lt;ref name="notafraid"/&gt; In addition, according to Imam Shamsi Ali, Donald Trump is known for his racist and anti-immigrant comments, including the anti-Muslim sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://islamnewstoday.com/new-york-mosque-imam-shamsi-ali-donald-trump-racist-anti-immigrant-including-anti-muslim/|title=New York Mosque Imam Shamsi Ali: Donald Trump Racist, Anti-immigrant, Including Anti-Muslim|date=September 5, 2015|access-date=December 31, 2015|work=Islam News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings and publications ==
Ali has written many articles, given speeches and initiated dialogues with various religious leaders about the importance of dialogues among [[Muslim]]s, [[Christian]]s, [[Jew]]s and other religious groups toward peace. He has made countless appearances on TV (ABC, PBS, BBC World, CNN, Fox News, National Geographic, al-Jazeera, the Hallmark Channel) to condemn [[terrorism]], [[Radical Islam|radicalism]], [[anti-Semitism]] and to promote peaceful Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chine-labbe/new-yorks-imam-is-on-a-mi_b_546305.html|title=New York's Imam Is on a Mission |publisher=Huffington Post|first1=Chine|last1=Labbe|first2=Mahawish|last2=Rezvi|date=April 21, 2010|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali has authored four books: ''Dai muda di New York City'' (A Young Dai in New York City),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Dai_muda_di_New_York_City.html?id=ZuMb4perWasC|title=Dai muda di New York City|first=Shamsi|last=Ali|publisher=Gema Insani|year=2007|language=id|isbn=9789795602507}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The True Love in America; 29 Kisah Mualaf Amerika'' (The True Love in America: 29 stories of Muallaf in America),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwyCEh_qu4YC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=True+Love+in+America+Shamsi+Ali&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=esaz34EkFG&amp;sig=svG1Y6rsmHREAzuukA2_MMUgYiw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-KMU-_oIK3IsATXzIGAAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=True%20Love%20in%20America%20Shamsi%20Ali&amp;f=false|title=The True Love in America; 29 Kisah Mualaf Amerika|first=Shamsi|last=Ali|publisher=Gema Insani|year=2009|language=id|isbn=9789790770959|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Menebar Damai di Bumi Barat'' (Spreading Peace in Western World).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mcvpnQEACAAJ&amp;dq=Menebar+Damai+di+Bumi+Barat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PeyMU5u-DfTJsAT6xYHgDQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA|title=Menebar Damai di Bumi Barat|first1=Shamsi|last1=Ali|first2=Julie|last2=Nava|publisher=Noura Books|year=2013|pages=302|language=id|isbn=9786021606131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former US president [[Bill Clinton]] gave a foreword to his fourth book, a [[memoir]], entitled ''Sons Of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims'' which he co-authored with [[Marc Schneier]], a Jewish [[rabbi]] who is also his close friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/indonesia/majalah/2013/11/131105_majalahlain_imam_newyork.shtml|title=Kiprah imam asal Indonesia di New York|publisher=BBC|language=id|date=November 5, 2013|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Imam Ali was appointed "Ambassador for Peace" by the International Religious Federation in 2002, and a recipient of the 2008 ICLI Interfaith Award. In 2006, he was named one of seven most influential religious leaders in New York City by New York Magazine. He is also one of 100 recipients of the 2009 [[Ellis Island Medal of Honor]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ar1ta.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/2009-ellis-island-medals-of-honor/|title=Preserving the American Dream: 2009 Ellis Island Medals of Honor recipients turn challenges into opportunities|date=June 9, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2015|first=Arita |last=Soenarjono}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prestigious non military gold medal is one of the highest awards recognized by US government to native-born and naturalized U.S. citizens with tremendous contributions to the American society and the world and for Shamsi Ali it was due to his endless dedication in building bridges between religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annefranktreeusa.com/af/sapling.nsf/Speakers/Ali|work=The Sampling Project|title=Imam Shamsi Ali|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neco.org/medal-of-honor/medalists-search/tag/a|title=National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations: Medalists Database|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism small}}
'''''Shilpa Shastras''''' ({{lang-sa|शिल्प शास्त्र}} ''{{IAST|śilpa śāstra}}'') literally means the Science of Shilpa (arts and crafts).&lt;ref name=sk&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1958), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/538558 Traditions of the Indian Craftsman], The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, Traditional India: Structure and Change (Jul. - Sep., 1958), pp. 224-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, A. (1998), Design of Settlements in the Vaastu Shastras, Journal of Cultural Geography, 17(2), pp. 27-41&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ancient umbrella term for numerous [[Hindu texts]] that describe arts, crafts, and their design rules, principles and standards. In the context of temple design, Shilpa Shastras were manuals for sculpture and [[Hindu iconography]], prescribing among other things, the proportions of a sculptured figure, composition, principles, meaning, as well as rules of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;For Śilpa Śāstras as basis for iconographic standards, see: Hopkins, Thomas J. (1971). The Hindu Religious Tradition. Belmont, California: Dickenson Publishing Company, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixty-four techniques for such arts or crafts, sometimes called ''{{IAST|bāhya-kalā}}'' "external or practical arts", are traditionally enumerated, including carpentry, architecture, jewellery, farriery, acting, dancing, music, medicine, poetry etc., besides sixty-four ''{{IAST|abhyantara-kalā}}'' or "secret arts", which include mostly "erotic arts" such as kissing, embracing, etc. ([[Monier-Williams]] s.v. ''{{IAST|śilpa}}'').

While Shilpa and Vastu Shastras are related, Shilpa Shastras deal with arts and crafts such as forming statues, icons, stone murals, painting, carpentry, pottery, jewellery, dying, textiles and others.&lt;ref&gt;Misra, R. N. (2011), Silpis in Ancient India: Beyond their Ascribed Locus in Ancient Society, Social Scientist, Vol. 39, No. 7/8, pages 43-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Chandra (1973), Costumes, Textiles, Cosmetics an Coiffures in Ancient and Medieval India, Delhi, {{oclc|251930242}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vastu Shastra]]s deal with building architecture – building houses, forts, temples, apartments, village and town layout, etc.

==Description==
Shilpa (शिल्प) refers to any art or craft in ancient Indian texts, while Shastra means science. Together, Shilpa Shastra means the science of art and crafts. The ancient Sanskrit texts use the term Shilpin (शिल्पिन्, male artist)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=silpin+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Śilpin] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; and Shilpini (शिल्पिनी, female artist)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=zilpinI&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Śilpini] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; for artists and crafts person, while Shilpani refers to works of arts of man.&lt;ref name=sk/&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Shilpani, works of art of man,
imitate the divine forms,
by employing their rhythms,
they metrically reconstitute,
and interpret the limitless knowledge,
of the sacred hymns,
from the limits of being human.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Aitareya Brahmana]]|Rig Veda, 6.5.27&lt;ref&gt;Mary-Ann Milford-Lutzker, Intersections: Urban and Village Art in India, Art Journal, Vol. 58, No. 3 (Autumn, 1999), pp. 22-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Haug (1922), Aitareya Brahmanam of the Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Allahabad, University of Toronto Archives, Sixth Book, Chapter 5, pages 288-300&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meaning of Shilpa, according to Stella Kramrisch, is complex. She writes that it consists of "art, skill, craft, labor, ingenuity, rite and ritual, form and creation."&lt;ref name=sk/&gt;&lt;ref name=skramrisch1958&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1958), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/538558 Traditions of the Indian Craftsman],  The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, (Jul. - Sep., 1958), pp. 224-230&lt;/ref&gt; The range of crafts encompassed by the term Shilpa extends to every aspect of culture, includes sculptor, the potter, the perfumer, the wheelwright, the painter, the weaver, the architect, the dancer, the musician, the arts of love, and others. Ancient Indian texts assert that the number of the arts is unlimited, they deploy sixty four ''kala'' (कला, techniques)&lt;ref&gt;Vatsyayana, Kamasutra I.3, Jayamangala&lt;/ref&gt; and thirty two ''vidyas'' (विद्या, fields of knowledge).&lt;ref name=sk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vatsyayana, Kamasutra, Book I, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Shilpa is discussed in Agamas, Puranas and Vastu Shastra where it is linked to the mythology of [[Vishvakarman|Vishvakarma]].

==In painting==
Shilpa Shastras include chapters on paintings, both miniature and large.&lt;ref&gt;Isabella Nardi (2006), The Theory of Citrasutras in Indian Painting, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415391955}}, pages 180-187&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Narada Shilpa Shastra dedicates chapters 66 and 71 to painting, while Saraswati Shilpa Shastra describes various types of chitra (full painting), ardhachitra (sketch work), chitrabhasa (communication through painting), varna samskara (preparation of colors).&lt;ref&gt;S. Dabhade, {{Google books|SWO7AAAAIAAJ|The Technique of Wall Painting in Ancient India}}, pages 7-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient Shilpa Shastra on painting include Vishnudharmottara Purana and Chitralakshana, former is available in Sanskrit while the only surviving copies of latter are in Tibetan (both were originally written on birch bark, and have been translated into English and German).&lt;ref name=isabella6&gt;Isabella Nardi (2006), The Theory of Citrasutras in Indian Painting, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415391955}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Sanskrit treatises discuss the following aspects of a painting: measurement, proportions, perspective of the viewer, mudra, emotions, and rasa (meaning). Such an approach of Indian paintings, states Isabella Nardi, make Shilpa Shastra not only canonical textual sources but also a means to transmit knowledge and spiritual themes.&lt;ref name=bravi/&gt;&lt;ref name=isabellanardi&gt;Isabella Nardi (2009), Re-evaluating the Role of Text in Indian Art - Towards a Shastric Analysis of the Image of Shri Nathji in Nathdvara Miniature Painting, South Asia Research, July, vol. 29, no. 2, pages 99-126&lt;/ref&gt;

==In carpentry==
The first chapter of Shilpa Shastra Manasara discusses the measurement principles for carpentry.&lt;ref&gt;Ram Raz, Henry Harkness (1834), {{Google books|0ahCAAAAcAAJ|Essay on the Architecture of the Hindus}}, pages 3-6,  (footnote on page 4)&lt;/ref&gt; The 9th-century version of Mayamata text of Tamil Nadu and 16th Century version of Shilparatna of Odisha describe takshaka and vardhaki as wood Shilpins; takshaka possesses the knowledge of wood types and practices the art of cutting wood, while vardhaki possesses the knowledge of wood forms and practices the art of carpentry.&lt;ref&gt;Naoki Ideno (2007), The Artisans' Duty and Ability in Shilpa-Shastras, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 55(2), pages 788-784&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest mentions of carpentry arts is in Book 9, Chapter 112 of Rig Veda.&lt;ref&gt;R Vyas (1992), Nature of Indian Culture, South Asia Books, {{ISBN|978-8170223887}}, pages 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentry was also an essential Shilpa Shastra during the construction of a [[Hindu temple]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Purdon Clarke (1883), Some notes upon the Domestic Architecture of India, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41334942 The Journal of the Society of Arts], Vol. 31, No. 1594 (JUNE 8), pages 731-756&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metallurgy==
[[File:Delhi Iron pillar.JPG|thumb|The 4th-century CE 99.7% pure Iron pillar in Delhi reflecting the metal-related shilpa in ancient India.&lt;ref name=rbpillar/&gt; The pillar was moved and reinstalled near Qutb complex about 1000 years later. The upper part of the pillar remains without any rust damage; the lower, reinstalled in-ground part shows signs of rust.]]
The Vedas, in particular Atharva veda and Sthapatya veda, describe many kinds of arts and crafts in their discussion of Shilpa Shastra and Yantra Sarvasva. The Rig veda, states Ravi,&lt;ref name=bravi&gt;B. Ravi (2003), Investment casting development - Ancient and Modern Approaches, National Conference on Investment Casting Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Durgapur, IIT Bombay&lt;/ref&gt; mentions equipment used in casting, such as dhamatri ([[Reverberatory_furnace|cupola]]), gharma aranmaya ([[crucible]]) and bhastri ([[Bellows|blower]]). These discussions are in the context of making idols, and describe rules to achieve best talmana (proportions), mudra (stance) and bhava (expression).&lt;ref name=bravi/&gt;&lt;ref name="isabellanardi"/&gt;

Sanskrit texts such as Shilparatna&lt;ref&gt;Hans Losch, Sources of Sri Kumara's Shilparatna, Anal. Bhandarkar Orient. Res., Vol. 31, pages 152-164&lt;/ref&gt; and Manasara&lt;ref&gt;While Manasara, sometimes spelled Manava sara, has extensive discussions on architecture, guidelines for ancient village and town planning, it has section on metal art works as well; See: Koenigsberger (1952), New towns in India, Town Planning Review, 23(2): 95-99; Acharya (1933), Manasara on Architecture and Sculpture, Mansara Series 1-4, Oxford University Press - A version was reprinted in 1995 as {{ISBN|978-8186142721}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe in detail the process and principles for art work with metals, particularly for alloys such as [[panchadhatu]] (five metals – zinc, tin, copper, silver and gold) and [[ashtadhatu]] (eight metal alloys – which adds iron, lead and mercury to panchadhatu).&lt;ref name=bravi/&gt; Madhuchista Vidhana (cire perdue or lost wax) casting process is the most discussed process in these ancient shilpa shastras with metals.&lt;ref name=bravi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pupul Jayakar(1984), Metal Casting from Kerala, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 4, DESIGN: TRADITION AND CHANGE (December 1984), pp. 63-68&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk suggests that these Shastras diffused from India to other ancient cultures in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, W. (1975), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1796941 The role of India in the diffusion of early cultures], Geographical Journal, Vol. 141, No. 1, 19-34&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is empirical evidence of high purity metallurgy and art works with other metals, some ancient Shilpa Shastras have been lost. For example, the 5th century [[Iron Pillar of Delhi]], which stands 23 feet, weighs 6 tonnes and contains 99.72% iron without showing any signs of rust, is empirical evidence of the state of metallurgical arts in 5th century India.&lt;ref name=bravi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rbpillar&gt;R Balasubramaniam (1998), The decorative bell capital of the Delhi iron pillar, JOM, 50(3): 40-47, {{doi|10.1007/s11837-998-0378-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shilpa Shastra education in ancient India==
;Birth was no barrier
All arts were the domain of all classes, castes and both genders in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0222-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient texts of [[Parashara]] states that all crafts were practised by anyone irrespective of family's occupation.&lt;ref name=sk/&gt; The Buddhist ''Jatakas'' mention Brahmin carpenters, the 4th century text ''Baudhayana'' describes&lt;ref&gt;Baudhayana, XXV.13.22&lt;/ref&gt; chariot builders, carpenters, brick-workers, potters and metal workers from people of people classified as Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. ''Suttavibhanga'' describes builders and wheelwrights born to Shudra father and Brahmin mother, who by later texts would be described as untouchables.&lt;ref name=sk/&gt; The goldsmiths of Maharashtra included children born in cattle herding families.

;Apprenticeship
Apprentices joined and trained under masters. The best were adopted and recognised as members of various art guilds.&lt;ref name=sk/&gt; The training began from childhood, and included studies about [[dharma]], culture, reading, writing, mathematics, geometry, colors, tools, as well as trade secrets – these were called Tradition.&lt;ref name=sk/&gt;&lt;ref name=skvol1/&gt;

;Guilds
Shilpins had formed Śreni (guilds) in ancient India. Each guild formed its own laws and code of conduct, one the ancient Hindu and Buddhist kings of India respected by tradition. In some cases, the king established the laws of the guilds;&lt;ref&gt;Manusmriti VIII.41&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases, the king's treasurer had the final word and served as judge of various guilds in a kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Nigrodha Jataka VI.427&lt;/ref&gt; These guilds, in the 1st millennium BC, included all those who practised the art irrespective of the artist's caste or creed.&lt;ref name=sk228&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1958), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/538558 Traditions of the Indian Craftsman], The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, Traditional India: Structure and Change (Jul. - Sep., 1958), pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The income of each guild came from fees paid by new members joining the guild, from fines on those violating the code of conduct established by the guild, and levies on tools used for that art. The guilds also performed charity and gifted collective works of art by their members to temples and other social works.&lt;ref name=sk228/&gt; During festivals and social celebrations, each guild would contribute their own performance and pavilions with flags and emblems.

;Art is spiritual
Creative work and artists were granted the sanctions of a sacrament in ancient Indian culture, states Stella Kramrisch.&lt;ref name=skvol1&gt;Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0222-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An artist expresses the spiritual and holiness in his or her art. This belief continues to manifest itself in modern India in the form of rituals, where in an autumn festival (Dashahra), craftsmen in parts of India worship their tools with incense, flowers and unhusked rice.

Brhat Samhita at verses 57.10-11 describes the practice of carpenters offering prayers and seeking forgiveness of a tree before cutting it for wood. The axe used to cut the tree would be rubbed with honey and butter to minimise the hurt to the tree which was considered to be a living being. Craft was seen as application of essence of [[Purusha]] (Universal Principles) to parts of nature so as to transform it into a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1 &amp; 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0222-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hgood&gt;Heather Elgood (2000), Hinduism and the religious arts, {{ISBN|978-0304707393}}, Bloomsbury Academic, pp 121-125&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Church of Scientology]] doctrine, [[supernatural]] or [[superhuman]] abilities are a recurring subject, appearing throughout [[Scientology]] and [[Dianetics]] materials, from the most basic introductory texts to the highest-level [[Operating Thetan]] information. Virtually all of these concepts were authored by the church's founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]], and have not been subjected to testing outside the Church. The Church of Scientology have never offered any externally accepted, empirical, peer-reviewed evidence that Scientologists possess any of these abilities.

==Conquering MEST==
{{Main|MEST (Scientology)|l1=MEST}}
'''MEST''' is an acronym Hubbard coined which stands for [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]] and [[time]], the component parts of the physical universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrh-books.com/mailings/congress/glossary.php#mest The L. Ron Hubbard Congress Lectures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117035746/http://www.lrh-books.com/mailings/congress/glossary.php#mest |date=2006-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that by completing [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Scientology courses]], it is possible to eventually attain "cause over MEST" — the ability to control matter, energy and spacetime in the physical universe, free of the encumbrance of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''[[Scientology: A History of Man]]'', chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Church of Scientology:

{{Quote|In Scientology, a state of complete spiritual freedom is attainable. It has been achieved not on a temporary basis but on a stable plane of full awareness and ability, unqualified by accident or deterioration. And it is not limited to a few.

It is called, in Scientology, “Operating Thetan.” The definition of the state of Operating Thetan is “knowing and willing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time.|Church of Scientology|[http://www.auditing.org/13-ot.htm The State of Operating Thetan]}}

==Dianetics and Clearing==
Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the general public in April 1950, in an article published in the ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' [[pulp magazine]], and followed quickly with the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' that same summer.

Dianetics postulates that there is a part of our psyche called the [[reactive mind]], and that most of our mental and physical problems are [[psychosomatic]], thus they can be solved by eliminating this portion of our minds. This mental state of self-mastery is called [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:Dianetics1992hard.JPG|frame|left|The 1992 hardcover edition of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]''.]] --&gt;

In the 1992 Hardcover edition of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', Hubbard writes: "A Clear, for instance, has complete recall of everything which ever happened to him, or anything he ever studied. He does mental computations, such as those in chess, for example, which a normal would do in half an hour, in ten or fifteen seconds." (p.&amp;nbsp;214).

==Exteriorization of energy==
Speaking on the subject of "Exteriorization - communication in Theta and MEST", Hubbard said that an individual [[thetan]] (person) has the ability to generate electricity by putting a "beam" inside a [[vacuum tube]], or a [[bell jar]] that has had the air evacuated:

{{Quote|The truth of the matter is an individual can activate a vacuum tube.  By the way, he can activate a vacuum tube because he isn't trying to go through the terrific insulative quality of air. I've forgotten what an inch of air insulates, but it is something fabulous.  An inch of air represents maybe a hundred thousand volts or something on that order.  He would have to be almost as big as a lightning storm to get across any space of air.  But he can do it in a vacuum tube, and he could do it in a bell jar from which the air could be exhausted, while he himself was outside the bell jar.  He simply puts a beam inside the bell jar connecting two electrodes and you would get a registry on a meter inside the bell jar."|L. Ron Hubbard|3rd ACC Lecture 35}}

==Spiritual immortality==
{{blockquote|Some of the miracles of life have been exposed to full view for the first time ever on the OT levels. Not the least of these miracles is knowing immortality and freedom from the cycle of birth and death.|Church of Scientology|[http://www.auditing.org/13-ot.htm The State of Operating Thetan]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisscientology.org/Html/part03/chp15/pg0274.html Dianetics, Scientology &amp; Beyond by L. Ron Hubbard]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "immortality" referred to is not immortality of the body, but of the [[thetan]], and Scientology does not claim that it causes the thetan's immortality, but makes a Scientologist aware of that immortality and alleviates the distress that might otherwise be felt at the prospect of death:

{{Quote|The subject of death is never a very serious one to a Scientologist beyond the fact that he feels kind of sorry for himself sometimes. ... {{interpolation|The deceased person}} was thoughtless enough to dispose of his body and go out of communication. A person sometimes feels pretty unhappy about it and thinks it's a thoughtless thing for a friend to do.|L. Ron Hubbard|Have You Lived Before This Life?, 1977, Church of Scientology of California Publications Organization}}

==Enhanced health and lifespan==
On page 121 of the 1992 Hardcover edition of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', Hubbard writes: "Clears do not get colds."

It is also hinted that achieving the state of Clear prolongs lifespan: "What the lifespan of a Clear is cannot be answered now; ask in a hundred years." (p.&amp;nbsp;384)

==Increasing body weight==
Hubbard has claimed on numerous occasions that it is possible for Scientologists to use mind over matter to increase one's body weight, although why someone would specifically want to do this is not explained. In his book ''Understanding the [[E-meter]]'', Hubbard wrote that this assertion can be tested by "mocking up" mental pictures in one's imagination. "This test has actually been made and an increase of as much as thirty pounds, actually measured on scales, has been added to and subtracted from a body by creating 'mental energy.'" (p.&amp;nbsp;52)

In December 1954, Hubbard declared before a crowd at a lecture:

{{Quote|Just mock up something, pull it in, mock it up and pull it in, mock it up and pull it in. Mock up heavy planets, mock up dense things and pull them in. You shoot a person's weight up - if he's working pretty well, and you do this very insistently, and you insist on density and mass - you can put a person on a set of very accurate Toledo scales, have him do this process for a few hours, put him back on the scales and find out his weight has gone up about thirty pounds.|L. Ron Hubbard|Introduction to 9TH ACC - Havingness}}

In 1957, Hubbard claimed that he was contacted by physicists from a scientific congress in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]: "They wanted to know if I had any proof I could offer that thought created matter". Hubbard said he gave them all his data about using Scientology's mental "mock-ups" to increase body weight, and reported "I got back a highly enthusiastic wire saying that my data, as sent to them, had been of great assistance." (''Ability Congress'', 2nd lecture, December 1957)

==Touch assists==
{{Main|Touch assist}}
Scientologists (especially [[Volunteer Ministers]]) are taught to administer the "Touch Assist", a procedure designed by Hubbard to help heal illnesses or injuries. The Scientologist touches the person's body in a set manner, avoiding sexual areas, and asks the recipient of the process, who is lying or sitting still, to "Feel my finger". This is continued until the recipient states that he feels better about what was bothering him and looks more cheerful overall. The process is claimed to help restore the spiritual being's ([[thetan]] in Scientology terminology) ability to communicate with the affected area and thereby to speed healing and reduce mental trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_4.HTM |title=Touch Assist |work=The Scientology Handbook |accessdate=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The touch assist is not to be used to treat headaches, however: "Do not do a Touch Assist on a person who has a headache. Research has shown that headaches are often the result of mental phenomena that a Touch Assist would be the incorrect handling for." (''[[The Scientology Handbook]]'', 1994 edition, p.&amp;nbsp;218)

It is probably the most well-known of all Scientology [[Assist (Scientology)|Assists]], which also include the "Nerve Assist" and the "Unconscious Person Assist".

==Theta perceptics==
[[Image:Superpowerbldg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Super Power Building in Florida, where the Super Power Rundown, intended to enhance one's "Theta Perceptics", will be given upon completion.]]
Scientology promises the ability to hone one's "theta perceptics" (senses of the thetan rather than the physical "meat body") and promises "Communication with the theta universe" with enhanced 'perceptics' such as "hunches, predictions, ESP at greater and lesser distances, communication with the dead, perception of the Supreme Being, etc." (''Science of Survival'', 50th anniversary edition, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;576.)

Hubbard claims that humans have precisely 57 of these 'perceptics'. The [[Rundown (Scientology)|Super Power Rundown]] is intended to amplify these latent abilities of the thetan by way of becoming hyper-aware of the physical "[[Scientology and sex#MEST and meat|meat body]]". These 'perceptics' are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Time, Sight; Taste, Color, Depth; Solidity (barriers); Relative sizes (external); Sound; Pitch; Tone; Volume; Rhythm; Smell; Touch (pressure, friction, heat or cold and oiliness); Personal emotion; Endocrine states; Awareness of awareness; Personal size; Organic sensation (including hunger); Heartbeat; Blood circulation; Cellular and bacterial position; Gravitic (self and other weights); Motion of self; Motion (exterior); Body position; Joint position; Internal temperature; External temperature; Balance; Muscular tension; Saline content of self (body); Fields/magnetic; Time track motion; Physical energy (personal weariness, etc.); Self-determinism; Moisture (self); Sound direction; Emotional state of other organs; Personal position on the [[Emotional tone scale|tone scale]]; Affinity (self and others); Communication (self and others); Reality (self and others); Emotional state of groups; Compass direction; Level of consciousness; Pain; Perception of conclusions (past and present); Perception of computation (past and present); Perception of imagination (past and present); Perception of having perceived (past and present); Awareness of not knowing; Awareness of importance, unimportance; Awareness of others; Awareness of location and placement (masses, spaces and location itself); Perception of appetite; Kinesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Robert |last = Farley |title = Scientology nearly ready to unveil Super Power |work = St. Petersburg Times |date = 2006-06-06|url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/06/news_pf/Tampabay/Scientology_nearly_re.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Church describes the Super Power Rundown as "A super fantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anybody whether Dn Clear {{interp|Dianetics Clear}} or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing Super Power of a thetan. This means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create a new world." (''Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary'', 1982 hardcover edition) The exact nature of these "Super Powers" have not yet been enumerated, at least to the public.

Scientology researcher Martin Hunt says that the Super Power Rundown is "expected to make planetary clearing and the expanding of all service organizations to the size of old Saint Hill a reality". This refers to a directive issued by the Church that their primary goal must be to expand the size of all Scientology service organizations to the size that [[Saint Hill Manor|Saint Hill]] was in the 1960s - in other words, more than 200 staff members in each organization.

The [[Super Power Building]] is currently under construction in [[Clearwater, Florida]] for the purpose of administering this rundown. However, it has been plagued with construction setbacks since its initial groundbreaking in 1998.

==Telepathy and remote viewing==
Two Scientologists, [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Ingo Swann]], researched remote viewing at [[Stanford Research Institute]] for the [[CIA]] [[Project Stargate]] in the 1970s. Most of the SRI team, including project director Puthoff, and the CIA's star "psychic spies", Price and Swann, were Scientologists, a fact that skeptic [[Martin Gardner]] noted disparagingly. Puthoff and Swann were of the "original" [[Operating Thetan]] (OT) VII level (the Church has since 'changed' OT VII from the level these two completed), and credited Scientology with their success in the CIA remote viewing program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/essays/atack_ciacos.html |title=The Hubbard Intelligence Agency |first=Jon |last=Atack |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614022013/http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/essays/atack_ciacos.html |archivedate=2006-06-14 |work=Essays on scientology |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc-i-r-s-ology.pair.com/veritas/cst/cst-cia.htm CST and the CIA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502121035/http://www.sc-i-r-s-ology.pair.com/veritas/cst/cst-cia.htm |date=2006-05-02 }}, Church of Spiritual Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

From the book ''What is Scientology?'': "Can OTs read minds? ...to answer the question bluntly - yes, with varying degrees of ability". (First printing, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;215)

==Independent creation of perception==
In ''Scientology 8-8008'', Hubbard states that Scientology training can make one aware of one's ability to turn illusions into [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]] reality, and that even a preclear is "capable of producing illusions sufficiently strong to be observable by others".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Scientology 8-8008'', 1990 edition, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard speaks of "rehabilitating" the preclear so that he "begins to recognize that his viewpoint is expanding and that he is becoming all-pervasive", and then goes on to say:

{{Quote|"He is above the level of energy, if one can use the term, on the same wavelength with all other beingness, a condition which does not permit differentiation. As he rehabilitates his abilities in independent creation, he can change this wavelength at will, and can go in or out of agreement with all other points of beingness. The matter of perceiving, then, becomes a matter entirely of self-choice.|L. Ron Hubbard|''Scientology 8-8008'', 1990 edition, p. 157.}}

==Cleared Theta Clear==
&lt;!-- [[Operating Thetan]] links here --&gt;
Beyond even the powerful Operating Thetan levels comes "Cleared Theta Clear," a state which Hubbard describes this way:

{{Quote|A thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan should do, such as move [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]] and control others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in existence.|L. Ron Hubbard|Scientology 8-8008, p. 114 (1st ed), p. 151 (1990 ed.)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6527">'''Terris Nguyen Temple''', born in California 1944, studied the art of Tibetan [[Thangka]] painting in Nepal during the years 1966 to 1975. For the past twenty five years, the Nguyen Temples have been the official artists to the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa and Tsurphu Monastery, Tibet. [[File:HH2017.jpg|thumb|Terris, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, Leslie, and son Sonam Dorje]]

==History==
Terris' first teacher was the State Artist of Tibet, the late Master Jampa Tsedan, the Dalai Lama's artist. Later Terris studied with the late Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche - Simla, India; the late Sherpa artist Pargyaltsen (Kapa Ngawong Damcho) - Nepal; the late Dolpo artist Pema Wangyal, and the late Newar artist Siddhimuni Shakya - Kathmandu. In 1969 Terris became one of the 16th [[Karmapa]]'s original Western disciples. In 1974 at the invitation of the Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Terris taught thangka painting at the then Naropa Institute in Boulder Colorado, now Naropa University. This was the opening year of the Institute.

==Tsurphu Appliques==
1992–1997 Terris and fellow artist Leslie Nguyen created two giant silk appliques for [[Tsurphu Monastery]] in Tibet.&lt;ref name="chiangmai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intgchiangmai.com/diary2006_271st.html|title=Presentation 2006 Chiang Mai group, Chang Mai, Thailand|website=intgchiangmai.com|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[File:Karma Gadri Goku.jpg|thumb|Karma Gadri Goku applique]] Tsurphu Monastery is the Karmapa's main seat in Tibet and was established in 1187 by the 1st Karmapa, Dusum Khyenpa. The Karma Gadri Applique (gos-sku chen-mo, 108&amp;nbsp;ft x 76&amp;nbsp;ft, 35m x 23m). The Mahakala Goku (applique, gos-sku chen-mo, 30&amp;nbsp;ft x 30&amp;nbsp;ft, 10m x 10&amp;nbsp;m). [[File:Mahakala Applique.jpg|thumb|left|The Mahakala Applique]] The originals had been destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in the mid 1960s, and no photographic records existed. The Abbot of Tsurphu, the Drupon Dechen Rinpoche gave the artists oral instructions.
[[File:Carrying the Karma Gadri Thangka.jpg|thumb|Carrying the Karma Gadri Thangka]]
Two ceremonial banners, as companion pieces for the two giant appliques were requested by Tsurphu in 1997. These works are shown annually during major cultural festivals at Tsurphu, attended by devotees from all over Tibet, a tradition that began at the monastery in 1590. During Saga Dawa, the festival honoring the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and Parnirvana, the Karma Gadri Goku is shown. It takes a minimum of sixty strong people to carry the Karma Gadri Thangka out of the Temple for display on the Mountain.

The Tsechur Drabje (40m x 2m, 120&amp;nbsp;ft x 7&amp;nbsp;ft) which is the ceremonial companion piece, is being made now in India by the 17th Karmapa. Upon completion the two artists will take it to Tsurphu. The Mahakala Goku (completed in 1997), and its companion the Gutor (Norbu) Drabje appliqué (completed in 2007). They are both 120’ x 8’ (40&amp;nbsp;m x 2&amp;nbsp;m) and are used during the Gutor Festival to purify the Tibetan Lunar New Year. The Tsechur Drobje drawings were presented in 2016 to the 17th Karmapa [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kagyuoffice.org/|title=Karmapa – The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|website=kagyuoffice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sewing work is expected to be completed in 2019 and will also be given to Tsurphu Monastery.

==The Gyalwa Karmapa==
Ogyen Trinley Dorje is the supreme head of the 900 year old Karma Kagyu order of Tibetan Buddhism. Terris and Leslie are involved with the Karmapa’s Koryug Organization, doing environment projects in the Himalayas.[[File:Karlet.jpg|thumb|left|Official letter from the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa introducing Terris Temple and Leslie Nguyen.]] Terris is also the Executive Director of Liberation Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Liberation-Arts-207324262615710/|title=Liberation Arts|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a registered USA non profit organization, relating to art, culture and the environment. Liberation Arts was created with advice from the 17th Karmapa in 2010.

==Current Projects==
Presently Terris is executive producer in a feature documentary “Thongdrol” &lt;ref name="thongdrol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thongdrol.com/|website=thongdrol.com|title=Thongdrol|accessdate=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject of Tibetan art especially the lineage style Karma Gadri with the Karmapa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/106809581|title=Thongdrol: Liberation through Seeing - New Preview|first=David|last=Cherniack|date=22 September 2014|publisher=|via=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also completing a documentary “Tsurphu, the Giant Appliques", using the archival footage of the giant appliqués created for Tsurphu, 1992–2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/187663701|title=Tsurphu: The Giant Appliqu&amp;eacute;s trailer|first=Trace|last=Foundation|date=17 October 2016|publisher=|via=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maui Hawaii 1976, the 16th Karmapa advised Terris to do flower and bird painting in addition to thangkas, which Terris only produces by commission. These bird and flower paintings are created using mineral and botanical pigments with the techniques of traditional Tibetan painting. A few are graced with the 17th Karmapa's calligraphy at the ages of 8 and 14 years old.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The natural palette consists of cinnabar, orpiment, realgar, malachite, azurite, red lead, mineral whites and the earth minerals delicately lined and shaded with lac, cochineal, indigo, safflower and a Himalayan leaf known as 'shung kan'.

These colors are natural pigments used before aniline dyes took the market in the 1860's and Terris has used them since the 1960's. The silks used are from China, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam. Many of these paintings are of extinct and endangered species as Terris is passionate on the preservation of our environment for future generations.

Terris and Leslie continue making contributions to Tibetan Art.&lt;ref name="asianart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/tsurphu/|website=asianart.com|title=Terris Temple and Leslie Nguyen: Giant Thangkas of Tsurphu Monastery|accessdate=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NewThought}}
The '''Universal Foundation for Better Living''', or '''UFBL''', is a [[New Thought]] denomination that was founded in 1974 by [[Johnnie Colemon]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Colemon founded the foundation as an association for [[African American]] New Thought ministers after breaking away from the [[Unity Church]] for "blatant racism".&lt;ref&gt;DuPree, S.S. (1996) ''African-American Holiness Pentecostal movement: an annotated bibliography.'' Taylor &amp; Francis. p 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. Colemon is often referred to as "the First Lady of New Thought".&lt;ref&gt;Finley, S.C., Alexander, T. (2009) ''African American religious cultures, Volume 1.'' ABC-CLIO. p 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

After founding the first predominantly African American Unity Church in 1954, Colemon broke away in 1974. Named the Universal Foundation for Better Living, the foundation had 22,000 members in the late 1980s, with a 32-acre facility in the Chicago-area.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, W.J. (1991) ''Directory of African American religious bodies: a compendium by the Howard University School of Divinity.'' Howard University Press. p 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation adheres closely to the principles taught by [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles]] and [[Myrtle Fillmore]].&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, J. (2009) ''World Religions in America: An Introduction.'' Westminster John Knox Press. p 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the denomination has more than 30 churches across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean, with a majority of African American members. Colemon appointed Mary A. Tumpkin as President of the foundation in 1995, where she served until she died in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, S.C., Alexander, T. (2009) ''African American religious cultures, Volume 1.'' ABC-CLIO. p 281.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Sheila R. McKeithen became the foundation’s third President.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13217">[[File:Urarina shaman B Dean.jpg|thumb|right|Urarina [[shaman]], 1988]] The '''Urarina''' are an [[indigenous people]] of the [[Peruvian Amazon Basin]] ([[Loreto (Department of Peru)|Loreto]]) who inhabit the valleys of the [[Chambira]], Urituyacu, and Corrientes Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]&lt;/ref&gt; According to both [[archaeological]] and historical sources, they have resided in the [[Chambira Basin]] of contemporary northeastern [[Peru]] for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Myers, Thomas P. and Bartholomew Dean “Cerámica prehispánica del río Chambira, Loreto.” ''Amazonía peruana'', 1999 Lima, Published by the Centro Amazónico de Antropología y Aplicacíon Práctica. 13(26):255-288&lt;/ref&gt; The Urarina refer to themselves as ''Kachá'' (lit. "person"), while [[ethnologists]] know them by the [[ethnonym]] Urarina.

The local [[vernacular]] term for the Urarina is ''Shimaku'',&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [[:es:Shimaku|Spanish wiki entry for Shimaku]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered by the Urarina to be pejorative, as it is a Quechua term meaning "unreliable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Thomas E.|title=Describing morphosyntax: A guide for field linguists|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnonym "Urarina" may be from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]--''uray'' meaning below, and ''rina'' referring to ''runa'', or ''people''. Urarina is rendered in Quechua as ''uray-runa'' or ''people from below'' or ''down stream people''.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see Paz Soldan 1877:964; Espinoza Galarza 1979:305). [[Indigenous peoples|Native]] inhabitants of the [[Chambira Basin]] have also been called various names, including: Itukales; Ytucalis, Singacuchuscas; Cingacuchuscas; Aracuies; Aracuyes; Chimacus; and Chambiras (Grohs 1974:53 fn. 4; Velasco 1960: 267; Jouanen 1943, II: 471-2; Figueroa 1904: 163, 177)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Urarina [[society]] and [[culture]] have been given little attention in the burgeoning [[ethnographic]] literature of the region, and only sporadic references in the encyclopedic genre of [[Peruvian Amazonia]]. Accounts of the Urarina peoples are limited to the data reported by Castillo,&lt;ref&gt;Castillo, 1958, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; by the German [[ethnologist]] G. Tessmann in his ''Die Indianer Nordost-Peru'',&lt;ref&gt;Tassmann, 1930, partial Spanish translation 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and to the observations of [[missionaries]] and contemporary adventure seekers.

The Urarina are a [[semi-mobile]] hunting and horticultural society whose population is estimated to be around 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/rclt/StaffPages/olawsky.htm#photos Dr Knut Olawsky's photos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929161241/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/rclt/StaffPages/olawsky.htm#photos |date=2007-09-29 }}, {{es}} [http://www.peruecologico.com.pe/etnias_urarina.htm Peruecologico's Urarina factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;  Urarina settlements are composed of multiple [[longhouse]] groups, located on high ground (''restingas'') or embankments along the flood-free margins of the [[Chambira Basin]]'s many rivers and streams. The embankments are bounded by low-lying territories (''tahuampa '' and ''bajiales'') that are susceptible to flooding during the annual rainy season (roughly November–May).

Urarina local politics are characterized by a mercurial balance of power between [[deme]]s united through [[Affinity (law)|affinal]] ties and episodic [[political]] alliances, [[barter (economics)|exchange]] relations, and disputation. Surrounded by the [[Jivaroan]], and the [[Tupi–Guarani]]-speaking [[Cocama-Cocamilla]] [[indigenous people]]s of the [[upper Amazon]], the Urarina have an elaborate [[animist]]ic [[cosmology|cosmological]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew. "The Poetics of Creation: Urarina Cosmology and Historical Consciousness." ''Latin American Indian Literatures Journal'' 1994 10:22-45&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[ayahuasca]] [[shamanism]], which is based in part on the profoundly [[ritual]]ized consumption of ''[[Brugmansia]] suaveolens''.

The Urarina customarily practice [[brideservice]],&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew. "Forbidden fruit: Infidelity, affinity and brideservice among the Urarina of Peruvian Amazonia," ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'' March 1995, Vol. 1 Issue 1, p87, 24p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/URARINA.HTM Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology], citing Dean 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[uxorilocal]] patterns of post-[[nuptial]] residence, and sororal [[polygyny]].  While men are esteemed for their hunting prowess and shamanic skills, Urarina women are likewise recognized for their craftsmanship: the women are consummate producers of [[woven]] palm-fiber bast mats, [[hammocks]], and net-bags.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew. "Multiple Regimes of Value: Unequal Exchange and the Circulation of Urarina Palm-Fiber Wealth," ''Museum Anthropology'' February 1994, Vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 3-20 available online [http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/abs/10.1525/mua.1994.18.1.3?prevSearch=allfield%3A%28Dean%2C+Bartholomew%29 (paid subscription)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Múltiples regímenes de valor: intercambio desigual y la circulación de bienes intercambiables de fibra de palmera entre los Urarina,"  ''Amazonía peruana'', Special edition: "Identidad y cultura", Lima, Published by the Centro Amazónico de Antropología y Aplicacíon Práctica. 1995, p. 75-118&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
The Urarina have a [[Flood|deluge]]-myth, in which a man saved himself from the deluge while climbing a cudí (amasiza, [[Erythrina]] elei) tree; the man's wife was transformed into a termites' nest clinging to that tree, while their two sons became birds.&lt;ref&gt;Dean 1994, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards that man acquired a wife, a different woman, one who had at first summoned successively a pit viper, a spider, and a giant biting ant in an unsuccessful attempt to evade him.&lt;ref&gt;Dean 1994, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; 
In another Urarina deluge-myth, a deluge was produced, on the occasion of a [[cassava]]-beer festival, by the urination by the daughter of the [[ayahuasca]]-god, "giving rise to the [[chthonic]] world of spirits".&lt;ref&gt;Dean 1994, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urarina continue to tell elaborate [[Mythology|myths]] and stories about the [[violence]] that they experience from outsiders, which historically has included forced-labor [[conscription]], [[rape]], [[disease]], [[concubinage]], and abusive treatment at the hands of outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;In Anderson, Myrdene (ed.)
