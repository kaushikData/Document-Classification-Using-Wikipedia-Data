'''Alana Kathleen Cordy-Collins''' (5 June 1944 – 16 August 2015) was Professor of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of San Diego]]. She was an [[archaeologist]] whose primary specialization was [[Peru]]vian prehistory.

==Biography==
She was born in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Her father was [[Mayanist]] [[Napoleon Cordy]].

She received her bachelor's degree, master's degree and Ph.D. at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). She worked on the Ulluchu Project, a botanical research project on the north coast of Peru.  A secondary specialization was shamanism, where she developed a project in [[Mongolia]]. In addition to her professorship, she was director of the David W. May Indian Artifacts Gallery and [[curator]] of the collection. She was also a former curator of the [[Latin America]]n collections at the [[San Diego Museum of Man]].

== Scientific career ==
Cordy-Collins played a major role in the excavation of several important [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] tombs in [[Peru]] starting in 1972, including the [[Royal Tombs of Sipan]] and [[Dos Cabezas]]. [[Sipán]], excavated in 1987, is one of the most important archaeological discoveries of Peru. It includes some of the few tombs that had been undisturbed by grave robbers, and the artifacts, which included gold, ornate pottery and other findings, toured the United States. The excavation of the [[Dos Cabezas]] pyramid in 1997-2002 revealed treasure-filled tombs with a surprising amount of metalwork and ceramics, as well as a family of “giants” – mummies of men who would have stood about 6 feet tall, compared with the typical [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], who averaged between 4-foot-10 and 5-foot-6. The noblemen suffered from [[Marfan]] syndrome, an inherited form of [[gigantism]]. These are the first recorded instances of gigantism in prehistoric South America. Cordy-Collins lectured both nationally and internationally about the Moche "giants."

'''András Sütő''' (17 June 1927 – 30 September 2006) was an [[Hungarian minority in Romania|ethnic Hungarian]] writer and politician in [[Romania]], one of the leading writers in the [[Hungarian language]] in the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Sütő was born into a poor peasant family in [[Cămărașu]] ({{lang-hu|Pusztakamarás}}), in [[Cluj County]], [[Transylvania]]. He received his primary and secondary school education in the Reformed College of [[Aiud]] and in the Reformed [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]. After secondary school, he studied [[Theatre direction|Stage Directing]] at the ''Szentgyörgyi István College of Dramatic Arts'' in Cluj.

==Career==

===Journalism===
Sütő quit college in order to become the [[editor in chief]] of the ''[[Falvak Népe]]'' weekly. He moved to [[Bucharest]] in 1951 because the editorial office was relocated there. Sütő could not identify himself with the political environment of the 1950s in the capital and returned to [[Târgu Mureş]], Transylvania, in 1954, where he edited ''Igaz Szó'', a literary magazine. He held this post till 1957, after which he edited ''Uj Élet'', an illustrated magazine, till 1989.&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andras-suto-426979.html|title=Andras Suto: Writer banned under Ceausescu|last= Gömöri|first=George|date=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Sütő's first work (''A Letter to a Romanian Friend'') was published by the Hungarian-language ''[[Világosság]]'' journal in Cluj, when he was 18. His writing career ranged across genres, with short stories (''Félrejáró Salamon'', 1955), satire (''Pompás Gedeon'', 1967), historical drama (''Egy lócsiszár virágvasárnapja'', 1974; ''Csillag a máglyán'', 1974; ''Szuzai menyegzo'', 1981), and myth and folklore (''Káin és Abel'', 1977; ''Advent a Hargitán'', 1987). The dramas, in particular, ''probed the duty of the individual, confronted by arbitrary authority, to preserve his dignity and identity even at the cost of his life''.&lt;ref name=Banham1995/&gt;

He served as vice-president of the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Writers' Association of Romania]] between 1974 and 1982.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

From 1980, aiming to curb his dissent against the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime's repression of Romania's Hungarian minorities, András Sütő's works were banned from publication and presentation. Consequently, between 1980 and 1989 he could publish only in [[Hungary]]. During this period, he and his family were constantly harassed by the authorities and the [[Securitate]].&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

===Politics===
A committed Communist, Sütő was Member of the [[Great National Assembly]], the parliament of [[Communist Romania]], between 1965 and 1977. But his observations of the fate of the indigent Romanian and Hungarian villagers in Transylvania under forced collectivisation in the 1950s and his discontent with the increasing centralisation of political power brought him disfavour from the Ceauşescu government. Increasing, too, was his opposition to the regime's pressure to "homogenise" the various nationalities in the country, such as restrictions against the use of the Hungarian language.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

By the time of Ceauşescu's removal from power in 1989, Sütő was a well-known public figure, respected for his support of the rights of the Hungarian people in Romania.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

===Awards===
In 1979, Sütő was awarded the [[Herder Prize]].&lt;ref name="Banham1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banham|first=Martin |title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC&amp;pg=PA507|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University |isbn=978-0-521-43437-9|page=1043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also received Gábor Bethlen Prize (1990), and the [[Kossuth Prize]] (1992).&lt;ref name=hunlit&gt;{{cite web|title=András SÜTŐ (1927 - 2006)|publisher=Petőfi Irodalmi Múzeum|work=Publishing Hungary|url=http://www.hunlit.hu/sutoandras,en|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Sütő had his eye gouged out during the 1990 [[ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureş]], and had to undergo treatment in Hungary. He died on 30 August 2006 in [[Budapest]], where he was undergoing treatment for cancer.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402032.html|title=Ethnic Hungarian Writer and Activist Andras Suto, 79|first=Pablo|last=Gorondi|date=October 5, 2006|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Charles Thiselton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 1937) is an English [[Anglican]] priest, [[theologian]], and academic. He has written a number of books and articles on a range of topics in [[Christian]] [[theology]], [[biblical studies]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].  He has served on the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]], appointed by the [[Minister of Health]].

He was educated at [[City of London School]], with degrees from [[King's College London]] (BD, MTh) the [[University of Sheffield]] (PhD) and the [[University of Durham]] (DD). He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Chester]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chester University profile|url=http://www.chester.ac.uk/node/12797|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2012.  Thiselton is an Honorary Fellow of [[Cranmer Hall, Durham]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranmer Hall - Honorary Fellows|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/st-johns.college/cranmer/cranmer_staff/honorary-fellows/|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; fellow of Kings College London and fellow of the British Academy.

Thiselton is a former head of theology at the [[University of Nottingham]] and was also [[Principal (academia)|principal]] of both [[St John's College, Nottingham]] (1986 to 1988) and [[St John's College, Durham]] (1988 to 1992).&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = Thiselton | forenames = Anthony Charles | id = 19906 | accessed = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a priest and canon in the [[Church of England]], in which he represents the Diocese of Southwell on the church's [[General Synod]]. He is an associate priest in the parish of St Mary the Virgin, Attenborough, Nottingham. On 25 June 2002, he was presented with a [[Lambeth Degree]] of Doctorate of Divinity by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, [[George Carey]].

He was visiting Professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena; Calvin College, Grand Rapids; Regent College, Vancouver; North Park, Seminary, Chicago; the University of Utrecht, Netherlands; several seminaries in South Korea; Senior Lecturer in the University of Sheffield; and Professor of Theology in the University of Chester.

He served on the Church of England General Synod membership, and its Commissions and Committees:  Crown Nominations Commission, 2000-2010); Appointments Committee (2008–13); and Theological Education and Training Committee (1999-2005).  Outside Synod he remained on the Doctrine Commission for nearly 30 years: Church of England Doctrine Commission (1976-2006); Acting Chairman, (1987); Church of England Faith and Order Group (1979–89); Theological Education in the Anglican Communion (2003–06).

His main published work has been in the areas of [[hermeneutics]] (especially hermeneutical theory and its relationship to biblical interpretation), Christian doctrine (including eschatology and pneumatology), and biblical studies, in particular with two substantial commentaries on [[1 Corinthians]]. He is unusual in academic theology for publishing research-level works across such a broad range of topics.

He received a ''[[Festschrift|festschrift]]'', edited by Stanley Porter and Matthew Malcolm, entitled ''Horizons in Hermeneutics'' (Eerdmans) in April 2013. In June 2012 he was also the subject of a one-day conference in his honour, at the University of Nottingham, at which he presented a response paper to several contributors who spoke in light of his work. Proceedings from this conference were published by Paternoster (in the UK) and IVP (in the US) as ''The Future of Biblical Interpretation'' (2013). St John's College, Nottingham, inaugurated a series of "Thiselton lectures" in 2013 to honour his work in hermeneutics. He gave the first of these himself, in June 2013.

The name Charenza (also spelt ''Karentia'' or ''Karenz'') may be derived from an old personal name, ''Chareta'', or from the Rani word for "root", ''Koreta''. In its original form, the name was ''Korenitza''.

== Temples ==

Charenza was not only the administrative hub of the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani tribe]], but also a religious centre with the temples of [[Rugievit]], [[Porevit]] and [[Porenut]]. The main religious centre of the Rani, however, was [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] on [[Wittow]].

==Danish conquest==

In 1168, King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]] of [[History of Denmark#Middle Ages|Denmark]] and his archbishop [[Absalon]] captured Arkona. Charenza surrendered a few days later after negotiations with the Rugian princes [[Tetzlav]] and [[Jaromar I]]. The temples were destroyed, the princes agreed to become Danish vassals and the population adopted the Christian faith. In 1180, the administrative centre of the [[Principality of Rugia]] was moved to [[Rugard]] (today [[Bergen auf Rügen]], just a few kilometres to the southeast).

==Records==

[[Image:Gründungsurkunde der Stadt Stralsund.jpg|thumb|1234 document granting [[Lübeck law]] to [[Stralsund]], signed in Charenza]]

In the 12th century, Charenza was mentioned by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Helmold von Bosau]].

The last records are from the early 13th century. When the Danish king raised money to build 12&amp;nbsp;churches on [[Rügen]], one of them was the ''capelle nostre in Charenz'', which in 1232 was granted the village of [[Kluis|Gagern]] as a fief. In 1234, when the Rugian prince [[Vitslav I]] granted [[Lübeck law]] to [[Stralsund]], the document was signed in Charenza. The last record mentioning Charenza was in 1237. In the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, "Gharense" was mentioned as belonging to the parish of [[Gingst]].

==Coordinates==

Older research located Charenza at [[Garz Castle|Garz]] ({{coord|54|18|51|N|13|20|50|E |type:landmark_region:DE-MV_source:dewiki |name=Garz}}), while newer studies locate Charenza near Venz ([[Trent, Germany|Trent]] community, {{coord|54|30|7|N|13|19|0|E |type:landmark_region:DE-MV_source:dewiki |name=Venz}}), the supposed site of Gharense, which also fits the hints given in the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' of [[Saxo Grammaticus]] for Charenza's location.

'''Daniel Anthony Binchy''' (1899&amp;ndash;1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ó Murchú |first1=Máirtín |year=1992 |title=Matters of Record |journal=Newsletter of the School of Celtic Studies |volume=5 |pages=16–19 |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a scholar of [[Irish language|Irish]] [[linguistics]] and [[Early Irish law]]. 

From 1919-20 he was Auditor of the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)]]. His activities shortly after the formation of the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] are affectionately satirized in [[Brian O'Nolan]]'s poem ''Binchy and [[Osborn Bergin|Bergin]] and [[Richard Irvine Best|Best]]'', originally printed in the ''[[Cruiskeen Lawn]]'' column in the [[Irish Times]] and now included in ''The Best of Myles''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/cat/k/k3/hist6.html DIAS Online Book Shop]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of [[Frank O'Connor]].

He served as Ireland's ambassador to [[Germany]] from 1929 to 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Henry|title='A born natural orator': Irish student's account of Hitler in 1921 emerges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/irish-student-hitler-1921-daniel-binchy|accessdate=6 May 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm Binchy, D. A. at Ricorso]&lt;/ref&gt; While there he received instruction from [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] which allowed him to begin his study of Early Irish Law. He was, for a time, the main academic investigating the legal system and for some time his ideas were the orthodoxy. While his contributions still underlie the foundations, some of his analysis, however, has since been reexamined. Many of his attempts to connect early Irish law to [[Celtic Law]] and even to [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] law have come under considerable doubt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} However, his contributions are also lasting on account of his production of numerous translations and editions of legal texts. His final major work, the six volume [[Corpus Iuris Hibernici]], collected almost all texts in the native Irish legal tradition, thus offering later scholars a firm ground to stand upon.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Binchy, Corpus Iuris Hibernici, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

Binchy was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the uncle of  the [[author]] [[Maeve Binchy]] and the academic [[William Binchy]].

'''"Disseram que voltei americanizada''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''They said I've come back Americanized'') is a [[samba]] song written by [[Luiz Peixoto]] and [[Vicente Paiva]] especially for [[Carmen Miranda]]. It is a direct answer to accusations that Miranda put her Brazilian roots aside to become famous enough in Hollywood. Miranda recorded it on September 2, 1940 for [[Odeon Records]]. It was one of the last songs she recorded in Brazil, alongside "Voltei pro morro", "Disso é que eu gosto" and "Diz que tem", all of them written by Paiva in a similar way to "Disseram que voltei americanizada".

{{Distinguish|Pig Latin}}

'''Dog Latin''', also known as '''Cod Latin''', '''macaronic Latin''', '''mock Latin''', or '''Canis Latinicus''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus Canis Latinicus - Television Tropes and Idioms]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the creation of a [[phrase]] or [[jargon]] in imitation of [[Latin]],&lt;ref name="bartleby"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/81/5146.html Dog-Latin], [[Bartleby.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; often by "translating" English words (or those of other languages) into Latin by [[Latin conjugation|conjugating]] or [[latin declension|declining]] them as if they were Latin words.  Unlike the similarly named [[language game]] [[Pig Latin]] (a form of playful spoken [[Code (cryptography)|code]]), Dog Latin is more of a humorous device for invoking [[Academia|scholarly]] seriousness.

Sometimes "dog Latin" can mean a poor-quality attempt at writing genuine Latin.&lt;ref&gt;OED s.v. "dog," compounds C3a&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:

{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say. 
'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Straight Dope:'''  [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin What's the origin of pig Latin?]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Jefferson]] mentioned dog Latin by name in 1815:

{{quote|Fifty-two volumes in folio, of the acta sanctorum, in dog-latin, would be a formidable enterprise to the most laborious German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16784/16784-h/16784-h.htm Letter to John Adams, 08/10/1815]&lt;br/&gt;I had supposed them defunct with the society of Jesuits, of which they were: and that their works, although above ground, were, from their bulk and insignificance, as effectually entombed on their shelves, as if in the graves of their authors. Fifty-two volumes in folio, of the acta sanctorum, in dog-Latin, would be a formidable enterprise to the most laborious German.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
A once-common schoolboy [[doggerel]] which, though very poor Latin, would have done a tolerable job of reinforcing the rhythms of Latin [[hexameter]]s:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Patres conscripti took a boat, and went to Philippi;
Boatum est upsettum, magno cum grandine venti.
Omnes drownderunt qui swim away non potuerunt.
Trumpeter unus erat, qui coatum scarlet habebat;
Et magnum periwig, tied about with the tail of a dead pig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIrWLegNZxUC&amp;pg=PA288|title=Notes and Queries|date=October 13, 1855|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Insofar as this specimen can be translated, it is as follows:

{{quote|The conscript fathers [i.e. [[Roman Senate|Senators]]] took a boat and went to [[Philippi]]. The boat was upset by a great hailstorm of wind. All drowned who could not swim away. There was a trumpeter, who had a scarlet coat, and a great periwig, tied about with the tail of a dead pig.}}

The meter uses Latin vowel quantities for the Latin parts, and to some extent follows English stress in the English parts.

Another variant has similar lines in a different order, with the following variants:

{{quote|Stormum surgebat et boatum oversetebat
Excipe John Periwig tied up to the tail of a dead pig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4A9anfJ1G4C&amp;pg=PA152|title=The comic Latin grammar|author=Percival Leigh|year=1840|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meaning here is "The storm rose up and overturned the boat" and "Except for John Periwig", etc.

Another verse in similar vein, from [[Ronald Searle]]'s ''[[Down with Skool]]'', is:&lt;ref name=Molesworth&gt;{{cite book| title=Down with Skool!|first1=Geoffrey| last1=Willans| authorlink1=Geoffrey Willans| first2=Ronald| last2=Searle| authorlink2=Ronald Searle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcAUySObyaoC&amp;pg=PT50 | year=1953| publisher=Max Parrish |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Caesar adsum jam forte
Brutus aderat
Caesar sic in omnibus
Brutus sic in at&lt;/poem&gt;}}

which, when read aloud using [[traditional English pronunciation of Latin]], sounds like the following:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Caesar]] 'ad(had) some [[jam]] for [[Tea_(meal)|tea]]
[[Brutus]] 'ad a rat
Caesar [[vomit |sick ]] in [[bus|omnibus]]
Brutus sick in 'at ([[hat]])&lt;/poem&gt;}}

but which means in Latin

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Caesar I am already here by chance
Brutus was present
Caesar thus in all things
Brutus thus in but&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The following spoof of legal Latin, in the fictional case of ''Daniel v Dishclout'' (from [[George Alexander Stevens]]' "Lecture on Heads", 1765),&lt;ref name="LoH"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w_scWotcOscC&amp;pg=PA74 ], retrieved November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; describes a kitchen:

{{quote|camera necessaria pro usus cookare, cum saucepannis, stewpannis, scullero, dressero, coalholo, stovis, smoak-jacko; pro roastandum, boilandum, fryandum, et plumpudding mixandum, pro turtle soupos, calve's-head-hashibus, cum calipee et calepashibus.}}

In English, this is:
{{quote|A necessary room for the purpose of cooking, with saucepans, stewpans, scullery, dresser, coalhole, stoves, smoke-jack; for roasting, boiling, frying, and mixing plum pudding, for turtle soups, calves'-head hashes, with calipee and calipashes.}}

From time to time the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' will publish a mock degree citation in dog Latin in order to lampoon a public figure.

'''''El Privilegio de Mandar''''' (''The Privilege to Rule'') was a successful [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Parody|political parody]] broadcast by [[Televisa]] on [[Canal de las Estrellas]]. It started as a sketch on another Televisa show, called ''La Parodia'', that parodies political, social and cultural events happening in Mexico. High [[Audience measurement|rating]]s kept the show running.

It was first broadcast on October 25, 2004, during ''La Parodia''. Soon, the high success of the program encouraged the producers to separate it from the other show, so on January 3, 2005, it became an independent show.

Televisa broadcast what is considered the last episode of the series on July 9, 2006, just after the [[Mexican general election, 2006|federal elections in Mexico]]. However, some of the actors who performed leading roles (such as [[Arath de la Torre]], who played the role of presidential candidate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI), Roberto Madrazo) stated that in a few years, when political events have advanced, they will make a return to see how things are.

==History==
In September 2004, ''La Parodia'' was one of the most successful shows on Mexican television. Characters presented here first would later appear on ''El Privilegio de Mandar'', like "Chente" and "Andrés Manuel". The idea of the name "Privilegio" emerged from a skit on the famous Mexican [[telenovela]] ''El Privilegio de Amar'' (The privilege of loving), so the main title was presented with golden letters and slide images, just like a telenovela. This show was first aired as a section on ''La Parodia'', on Monday October 25, 2004, at 10pm with its first episode, "El Informe". This quickly became such a success that from January 3, 2005 it became a show in its own right, ''La Parodia'' now being broadcast on Sundays. In September of the same year, Alter Films released a [[DVD]] containing the first ten broadcast episodes of ''El Privilegio de Mandar''.

The show followed closely the world of the Mexican and even foreign politics, from the 2004 [[videoscandals]] and the [[Desafuero]] judges to the last [[2006 Mexican general election]]s. During its broadcast, the show had several guest artists, like Consuelo Duval (from ''La Hora Pico'' and ''La Familia P.Luche''). It won the 2005 [[Premios TVyNovelas|TVyNovelas Award]] for Best Comic Program.

The show made history as the first political parody ever aired in Mexico, where every single political person was parodied. On Saturday July 8, Televisa broadcast a special programme hosted by Mexican entertainer and actor [[Ernesto Laguardia]], in which scenes were presented from the first episodes of the show, interviews with the actors and the people parodied, as well as "behind the scenes" specials.

Televisa broadcast the last episode of what is considered the first season on July 9, 2006, just after the federal elections in Mexico.

From 2004, there have appeared around 50 different characters.  The January 7, 2011 edition of ''NuestroDetroit.com'', however, reported that a second season may soon be in production with [[Reynaldo Lopez]] taking over executive producing duties.  The report went on to say that at least four actors—de la Torre, the Ortega brothers, and Vale—will return to the series.&lt;ref&gt;''Angelica Vale quiere regalo de 50 mil pesos,'' [[NuestroDetroit.com]], January 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
As a [[parody]], it is kind of predictable knowing what will happen the next episode. The only thing the viewer has to do is follow the political news. For example, in 2004, Andrés Manuel López Obrador had problems with the law, confronting a [[desafuero]] judge, so in the show all the trouble was parodied for months.

Not all the shows are directly related to real politics, although there is usually some political context. In February 2006, ''[[Bailando Por Un Sueño]]'' (''Dancing for a Dream'') was highest rating show on Televisa, ''El Privilegio de Mandar'' parodied the show as ''Bailando Por Un Hueso'' (''Dancing for a Bone'') a double meaning because ''Hueso'' in this context is an expression for an influence,  the participants were the politicians dancing, with the idea that the winner would get some political position or [[Influence peddling|influence]] as a result.

On ''El Privilegio de Mandar'', Mexico is parodied as "Colonia el Relaxo con x" ("Relaxo"  means "mess" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The real word is "relajo", but the "j" is changed to "x" like the one in "Mexico"), representing the bad organization of the political world in that country. The states are represented as "Manzanas" (blocks), and the president as the president of the neighbors' association. Many of the parodied names and places are word-plays in Spanish, so they wouldn't be understood by many English or other languages speakers.

==Final episode==
'''Episode 79: "The elections"'''. The last episode of what's considered the first season was aired at 10pm on Sunday July 9, 2006.
A special TV programme was wired presenting early scenes from "El privilegio de mandar" in 2004, interviews with some parodied politics and with the actors, their feelings and "behind the scene" specials.

'''Real facts'''
*AMLO arrived early at 8am to vote on Sunday July 2
*A special cover was hosted by Televisa journalist on the day of the elections
*At night, Calderón and López Obrador celebrated their triumphs over the other, with people supporting them, without even knowing who had won
*On July 6, the official counting was finished and declared Felipe Calderón President-elect.
*Andrés Manuel battled against the results and call to a meeting at [[Mexico City]]'s Zócalo
*Roberto Madrazo lost over 10 points under the nearest candidate
'''Parody'''&lt;br&gt;
The show takes off with Andrés Manuel waiting for the IFE to open the polls at 7am on Sunday July 2, when the polls were actually opened at 8am (as a parody of the early arrive to the polls of the real Andrés Manuel). Then, are shown the [[Televisa]] studios where four journalists are waiting for the candidates to vote (they are also rarely presented characters):
*''Carlos Loharé de Mole'''
*''Dámela Micha'''
*''Joaquín Loque-Nósdiga'''
*''Víctor Trujillo''
Shortly after almost all characters arrive to the polls to present their votes (including characters that weren't presented anymore, like "Bejarano"). After the elections, "Ugalde" (parody to [[Federal Electoral Institute|IFE]]'s president) made an announcement on TV, saying that he couldn't give an official winner because two candidates (Felipe and Andrés Manuel) were head to head so it wasn't time to celebrate yet. The scene changes and shows Felipe celebrating with balloons and all the people supporting him:
*- (Crowd, cheering) Felipe!, Felipe!, Felipe!
*- (Felipe, happy) Friends, that disobedient boy (Disobedient boy is a mariachi song sung by Vicente Fox in a TV show during his campaign) said it!, I'm the next president!. And I'm sorry for Andrés Manuel that must be very sad
The scene changes again, now to Andrés Manuel:
*- (Crowd, cheering) Andrés Manuel!, Andrés Manuel!, Andrés Manuel!
*- (Andrés Manuel, happy) I am president!. I won for over five hundred thousand votes!
However, the scene changes once more, now to Roberto, in his house sat down and paralysed in front of the TV. Soon the door rings:
*- (Roberto, sitting next to Mariano Palacios) The dorbell rings Mariano. Open the door; it could be a vote.

The day now changes to Thursday July 6, when the official counting was finished and declared Felipe winner of the election.
However, Andrés Manuel is very angry, and calls to a demonstration:
*- (Andrés Manuel, angry) We have to do a meeting at Saturday 8 at the Zócalo for battling against the polls! (Talking to Jesús Ortega)
*- (Jesús Ortega) Why not Sunday 9 morning?
*- (Andrés Manuel) No Jesús, is the final match of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]!
*- (Jesús Ortega) And why not Sunday 9 night?
*- (Andrés Manuel) No, it's the final episode of "El Privilegio de Mandar"

Finally, the scene of the meeting of Andrés Manuel is presented. When he finishes talking, Canti goes up the platform and starts talking about Andres Manuel's decision and the respect of the democracy. The show ends with all the crowd cheering "México!, México!, México!", a screen showing "¿Fin?" (The End?) and all the actors thanking the viewers for their support.

'''Jokes on this episode'''
*Joaquín Loque-Nósidga, talking about the great coverage of Televisa of the elections by their reporters:
**-(Joaquín) We've got a reporter and a camera on every state, on every district, on every poll, on every crayon.
*Roberto has voted and now goes up to Mariano Palacios (his consultant):
**- (Mariano, proud) Hey Roberto! You know what?, I voted against Felipe! (Roberto's rival)
**- (Roberto, curious) And how did you vote against Felipe, Mariano?
**- (Mariano, proud) I marked him with a cross! (Note: mark the candidate space with a cross means a vote)
*Mario de Tin Marín hadn't respected the line and he was voting. The crowd protests about that selfish act:
**- (Mario de Tin Marín, smiling) Calm down, as if you were gods!

==Troubles with politicians==
Andrés M. López Obrador criticised the show as making fun of him personally and as a strategy of the media to attack him because he felt that the amount of time dedicated to him was excessive in relation to other politicians. However, the show continued to broadcast parodies of him. [http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/342030.html]
[[Víctor González Torres]] also criticized the show as making fun of his way of talking, as he has physical problems.

After 2006 elections, changes to the laws were provided to warn any television propaganda in favor or against a candidate, preventing Televisa to do another season of El Privilegio de Mandar.

==Common phrases and jokes==

===Chente===
*"No Marthita" (complaining about what his wife says)
*He often wears boots, as the real person
*Several one-liners used in his campaign and presidential cycle were used to ridiculize the President acts.
*Everytime the president says something aggressive to others, Vocero appears from nothing telling "That Chente really want to say is...")

===Felipe Calderón===
*He is referred to sometimes as "Jelipe", as a common bad pronunciation of the letter F.
*He waves his left arm up and down, as the real person. When doing this there was a funny cartoon sound effect.
*Jokes with the real political campaign "Manos limpias" (clean hands),
**"Since I have to keep my hands clean, a few days ago, I couldn't play with my daughter to [[Play-Doh]]!
**"Since I have to keep my hands clean, the last day, my wife had to replace our [[SUV]]'s wheel!
**"Since I have to keep my hands clean, the last day, I ate a [[taco]] with a spoon!

===Andrés Manuel===
*The mispronunciation of the letters C and S, commonly between people from the Mexican Southeast
*Parody of the pauses the real person makes while he is speaking
*He always has his hair bad bruised so he had some hairs on the backhead lift up. He mentioned this portion of hair as his "Gallito Feliz" and sing a children song about it (Gallo in Mexico is a portion of hair bad bruised... literally translated to "Happy Rooster"). This gag is joking at the point that the real person woke up early the press to give a daily conference press as Mayor of Mexico City, and sometimes he arrived without bruising his hair properly.
*Fear from [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], he always mentions him as "El Innombrable" (The one must not be named) in a similar way to Harry Potter's Voldemort.In an episode he fights Darth Vader and when he is defeated he reveals to be "El Innombrable" and then Salinas said that Peje is his son.
'''Memorable phrases'''
**"A estas encuestas sí les creo porque voy ganando" (I do believe in this polls because I am winning); after the polls from June 23, when he was winning
**"Que poca... ¡eso no es cierto!" (Son of a... that's not true!); used several times
**"¡Esto es un compló!" (This is a complot!); every time he feels cornered about a situation that everybody is blaming on him even that he was the real cause. The phrase was original from Mexican Big Brother reality show where some participants plotted to nominate another participant. Indeed, when the real person said that he was plotted in a political ruse to get him expelled of the elections, in the comedy the characters participated in a Big Brother style reality show and he was the first to be nominated because he break some of the rules in order to attend his morning conference, at the end he replies "This is a complot!".
**"¡Callese, cha-cha-la-ca!" (Shut up you insignificant thing!); Chachalaca is a very small animal, and it was used frequently after the real one said this to the President during his campaign. In the program he used to shut up another characters.

===Roberto===
*Use always of the phrase "Amigo" (my friend) anytime he talks to somebody
*He laughs in a very noisy way
*Reference for the strongness of his last name ("Madrazo" is often an offensive word in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] for "hit") sometimes making him to get hit by something.
*Incredible fear from Elba Esther Gordillo

===René Bejarano===
*He never laughs. Instead, he covers his mouth with his hand and shakes his head like he was laughing
*He uses his bills to blow his nose, clean his face, etc.
*He ends his phrases in an upper tone than the one he started them
*He always ensure to do not forget the rubbers.
'''Memorable phrases'''
**"Dondequiera que esté, nadie, absolutamente nadie, me podrá quitar mi derecho de soñar" (Wherever I am, nobody, nobody at all will ever take from me my right for dreaming); at his [[desafuero]] judge.
**"Me siento como un billete dentro de un portafolios" (I feel like a bill trapped inside a briefcase); being in jail.

==DVD==
In 2005, 10 early episodes from September–November 2004 were released on a double-face [[DVD]] format. This DVD edition is still available in some music stores in Mexico.
These episodes include all the [[desafuero]] judge to Bejarano and the [[videoscandals (Mexico)|videoscandals]].

===Synopsis===
'''Episode 6: "Derecho de soñar"''' (Right for dreaming); is about Bejarano's desafuero judge.&lt;br&gt;
Two police officers ("polecias", as a parody of the ignorance of some police officers in Mexico) are waiting for Bejarano to come out of his house. The frame changes to the room of Bejarano, where he is packing his clothes.
Later, in the desafuero judge, he starts avoiding the judge's questions:
Part of the dialogue:
*(Bejarano): "I know, you all have seen the video of me receiving money from Ahumada. The thing that really disappoints me is that, existing an original version, you all have seen a fake copy. Now, our partner Dolores (referring to his wife) will give you original videos that you'll can buy for a low price"
*(Judge): "And the cash René?" (In Spanish: ¿Y la lana René?) (lana is a form to say money or cash in Mexico)
*(Bejarano): "La Rana René está con los Muppets" (Kermit the Frog is with the Muppets) (Joking of the pronunciation of lana=rana) (Rana René is the name of [[Kermit the Frog]] in Mexico)
* (Judge, after finishing the judgement): "What does the people says?!! (¿Qué es lo que dice el público?)
* (Crowd, furious): "Out!" "Out!" (¡Fuera, fuera!) (this is parody of the TV Show Sabado Gigante)
*(Bejarano): "Finally for finish, wherever I am, nobody, nobody at all will ever take from me my right for dreaming"
*(Crowd): "Out"! "Out!"
* (The frame changes and Bejarano is trapped in jail, before he wakes up and realizes he was dreaming), after this, other characters also dream, specially Peje where he dreams fighting Carlos Salinas dressed as Star Wars characters, Salinas, dressed as Darth Vader, rips Peje's "gallito feliz" and then removes his mask to show his identity and revealing to be his father.

'''Euripide Foundoukidis''' ({{lang-el|Ευριπίδης Φουντουκίδης|Evripidis Fountoukidis}}; 1894 – 11 September 1968) was a [[Greece|Greek]] administrator at the [[International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation]] (IIIC) who ran the [[International Office of Museums]] (IOM) for many years.

==Early years (1894–1929)==

Euripide Foundoukidis was born in Greece in 1894.
He studied in Paris at the [[Institute of Higher International Studies]] and the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]].{{sfn|Stöckmann|2015}}
Foundoukidis has also been called a lawyer and art historian.{{sfn|Winiwarter|2015|pp=27–28}} 
He became a civil servant in the Greek government, and represented the government in the 1920 [[Postal Union Congress]] in Madrid.
He also edited the journal ''Phos''.
He became cultural advisor to the Greek Embassy in Paris.{{sfn|Stöckmann|2015}}
In January 1929 Foundoukidis became an attache at the Section of Artistic Relations in the [[International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation]] (IIIC), an advisory body to the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|Stöckmann|2015}}

==International Office of Museums (1929–1941)==

In April 1929 Foundoukidis was appointed Secretary of the IIIC's International Office of Museums (IOM).{{sfn|Stöckmann|2015}}
He served under [[Jules Destrée]].{{sfn|McClellan|2008|p=284}}
Foundoukidis was open-minded and multi-lingual, and introduced a more internationalist and professional attitude to the IMO.{{sfn|Meyer|Savoy|2014|p=210}}
In 1931 at a conference in Athens he was the first to use the French term ''patrimoine'' to refer to artistic heritage, and other international organizations soon began to use the ''patrimoine'' in this sense.{{sfn|Winiwarter|2015|pp=27–28}} 
He was made Secretary General of the IOM in 1931, holding office until after the start of [[World War II]] (1939–45).{{sfn|Stöckmann|2015}}
With Foundoukidis as its effective leader the IMO began to organize international conferences which drew very large numbers of attendees.{{sfn|Meyer|Savoy|2014|p=210}}
The Germans were generally opposed to the IIIC and would not cooperate with the IMO or other League of Nations units, but to some extent Foundoukidis was able to counteract this divide through his diplomacy and human qualities, creating strong personal but unofficial links.{{sfn|Meyer|Savoy|2014|p=212}}

Under Foundoukidis the OIM was involved in the debate over acquisition of archaeological materials, and proposed that the OIM could facilitate resolution of disputes between a collecting institution and the country of origin.{{sfn|Vadi|Witte|2015|p=128}}
The 1933 OIM Draft came into operation whenever an object was alienated or exported contrary to national legislation, whether the object was from a collection or from an archaeological excavation.
When stelae removed from [[Tell el-Amarna]] in Egypt were illegally exported and offered for sale in Europe, Foundoukidis advised that the OIM draft applied to both movables and immovables, such as "fragments of monuments".
However, later versions of the OIM Draft did exclude objects from archaeological sites.{{sfn|Vrdoljak|2006|p=112}}
The OIM also facilitated international exchange of cultural objects by promoting international exhibits and circulation of casts.
Under a Leagues of Nations resolution the OIM became the clearing house for all information about international exhibitions.{{sfn|Vadi|Witte|2015|p=128}}

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], on 16 November 1936 eight incendiary bombs fell on the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid, causing considerable damage to the structure.
The architect [[José Lino Vaamonde]] drew up a detailed plan of the impact of the bombs, with photographs, the next day.
The plan and photographs were published in ''Mouseion'', the press organ of the International Office of Museums, directed by Foundoukidis, in October 1937.{{sfn|Négri|2014|loc=PT26}}

==Later career (1941–68) ==

In September 1941 the IOM suspended operations as a result of World War II.
Foundoukidis left the IIIC in 1946.
He remained the honorary director of the Hellenic society at the [[Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris]].{{sfn|Stöckmann|2015}}
He also became secretary of the International Commission of Folklore and Folk Arts (CIAP), a unit of UNESCO's Commission for Philosophy and Historical Sciences (CIPHS).{{sfn|Thompson|1996|p=274}}
In 1951 he was replaced in this position by Jorje Dias of Portugal.{{sfn|Thompson|1996|p=294}}
Foundoukidis died on 11 September 1968. 
He was a Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]].{{sfn|Stöckmann|2015}}

== History ==
[[Sigfús Eymundsson]], a photographer and a [[Bookbinding|bookbinder]] founded "Bókaverslun Sigfúsar Eymundsson"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2290544|title=Sigfús Eymundsson bóksali|date=March 1907|work=Oðin|page=1|accessdate=7 August 2014|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1872. In 1886 Sigfus founded Eymundsson [[publishing]] and in coming years he would publish many of Iceland's poets, including [[Hannes Hafstein]] and [[Bólu-Hjálmar]]. Sigfus was the first to import [[typewriter]]s and [[Safe|money safes]]. He was also the first Icelander to publish and sell [[postcard]]s, using his own photos as material.

In 1920 Eymundsson bought the house on Austurstræti 18. Today Eymundsson's store still stands on this spot, in house built in 1960.&lt;ref name="eymundsson2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eymundsson.is/eymundsson/saga-eymundsson/|title=Saga Eymundsson&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt; Um Eymundsson &amp;#124; Eymundsson|publisher=eymundsson.is|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4799">[[Image:Atlas (Farnese Globe).jpg|thumb|''Farnese Atlas'' ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]], [[Naples]])]]

'''The Farnese Atlas''' is a 2nd-century Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic]] [[sculpture]] of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] kneeling with the celestial spheres, not a globe, weighing heavily on his shoulders. It is the oldest extant statue of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is represented in earlier vase-painting, and more important, the oldest known representation of the [[celestial sphere]]. The sculpture is at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Naples]], in Italy. It stands {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} tall, and the globe is 65&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.

The name ''Farnese Atlas'' reflects its acquisition by [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Alessandro Farnese]] in the early 16th century, and its subsequent exhibition in the [[Villa Farnese]]&lt;!--or Palazzo Farnese, Rome--&gt;.

[[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] labors under the weight because he had been sentenced by [[Zeus]] to hold up the sky. The globe shows a depiction of the night sky as seen from outside the outermost [[celestial sphere]], with low reliefs depicting 41 (some sources say 42) of the 48 classical Greek [[constellation]]s distinguished by [[Ptolemy]], including; [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] the ram, [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] the swan and [[Hercules]] the hero. The Farnese Atlas is the oldest surviving pictorial record of Western constellations. It dates to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, around AD 150, but has long been presumed to represent constellations mapped in earlier [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] work.

==Dating the original==
In 2005, at a meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]] in [[San Diego, California]], [[Bradley E. Schaefer|Dr. Bradley E. Schaefer]], a professor of [[physics]] at [[Louisiana State University]], presented a widely reported analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.lsu.edu/farnese/JHAFarneseProofs.pdf Bradley E. Schaefer, "The epoch of the constellations on the Farnese Hercules and their origins in Hipparchus's lost catalogue"]&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that the text of [[Hipparchus]]' long lost [[star catalog]] may have been the inspiration for the representation of the constellations on the globe, thereby reviving and expanding an earlier proposal by Georg Thiele (1898). The constellations are fairly detailed and Schaefer regards them as scientifically accurate given the period of the globe's creation, implying that it was modeled after a scholarly work. His statistical analysis concludes that the positions of these constellations are consistent with where they would have appeared in the time of Hipparchus (129 BC) – leading to the conclusion that the statue is based on the star catalog.

However, because the globe contains no actual stars, and because the circles on the globe are drawn inexactly and ambiguously by a sculptor copying the Hellenistic model rather than by a modern astronomer, the dating of the globe is still uncertain and its source or sources remain controversial; Schaefer's conclusions have been strongly contested (e.g. by Dennis Duke&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~dduke/farnese4.pdf Dennis Duke, ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', February 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;) most particularly on the ground that regardless of the globe's date the constellations on it show large disagreements with the only existing work by Hipparchus.

== History ==
In 2012, filmmaker [[Lina Esco]] started this campaign in New York City. She created a documentary of herself running through the streets of New York topless. As the documentary was being made, she posted teaser clips with the hashtag #FreeTheNipple. In 2013, [[Facebook]] removed these clips from its website for violating its guidelines. In 2014, several celebrities such as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Lena Dunham]], [[Chelsea Handler]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Chrissy Teigen]] posted photos on social media to show their support of Esco's initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Sarah Myers|date=22 September 2017|title=Raging Against the Machine: Network Gatekeeping and Collective Action on Social Media Platforms|url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/989|journal=Media and Communication|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=28–36|issn=2183-2439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They appeared [[topless]] except for pieces of tape over their nipples, and had the words "Free the Nipple", "Equality", and "Feel the Bern" written on their chests. [[Los Angeles Police]] officers asked them to cover their breasts, and the two women refused and were arrested. They were held for 25 hours in jail but were not charged with any crime. After being released, Ma filed a federal lawsuit against the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Ma said that her action was not lewd because mammary glands are not sexual organs, but rather have the purpose of [[breastfeeding]] children, and said she believed she did not at any point show her "genitals" or "private parts". Her attorney claims she was never "nude" and that California's indecent exposure law applies only to genitals, not breasts. Her lawsuit also alleged that her constitutional rights had been violated, that she had been subject to unlawful gender discrimination, and that federal civil rights laws had been violated.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

Historically, women have sometimes been arrested or charged with public indecency, disturbing the peace, or lewd behavior for baring their breasts in public, even in jurisdictions where there was no law explicitly prohibiting doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/health/the-weird-wild-legal-history-of-breasts-and-104942336487.html |title=The Weird, Wild Legal History of Breasts and Nipples |website=[[Yahoo Health]] |date=12 December 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New York state]], female toplessness was made legal around 1990, and when a woman was arrested there in 2005 for appearing topless in public, a court ruled in her favor and she later received US$29,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;NBC News.

In 2017, a Free The Nipple event was held in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], England, on the day also celebrated as [[Women's Equality Day]] and [[Go Topless Day]], on the anniversary of when [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|women gained the right to vote in the United States in 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/women-take-tops-hulls-first-386257|title=Why these women went topless on Hessle Foreshore today|first=Elizabeth|last=Mackley|date=26 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court cases ==
Various court cases in the United States have involved the question of whether women may publicly expose female breasts. Two examples are Erie v. Pap's A. M.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2550942384996791158&amp;q=public+nudity&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003 Erie v. Pap's A. M.]&lt;/ref&gt;, and Barnes v. Glen Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13977097322948440019&amp;q=public+nudity&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003 Barnes v. Glen Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; These involved ordinances that placed restrictions on how women were legally permitted to appear in public, focusing on banning any public exposure of the female breasts. A lawsuit was filed as Free the Nipple v. City of Fort Collins,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10601192275792345743&amp;q=people+v+santorelli&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003 Free the Nipple v. City of Fort Collins]&lt;/ref&gt; which was an attempt to remove the provision in the municipal code of [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], that prohibits women from revealing their breasts. An injunction prohibiting Fort Collins from enforcing the prohibition is currently in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

In total, there are three U.S. states where the mere showing of women's breasts is illegal: Indiana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chicagoinc/ct-met-topless-law-1112-chicago-inc-20171110-story.html |title=Chicago's ban on uncovered women's breasts upheld by divided court |date= November 10, 2017 |publisher= Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tennessee, and Utah.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Fourteen states and many other cities have laws with ambiguous implications on how much a woman is allowed to expose her body.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Social media campaign ==
Every social media platform has their own guideline and policy in regards to nudity and revealing nipples. Facebook only allows photos of nipples to be posted when it is "in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, health (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness, or gender confirmation surgery), or an act of protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/adult_nudity_sexual_activity/|title=Community Standards {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instagram's guideline for nudity states "We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don't allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119|title=Community Guidelines – Instagram Help Center|website=Instagram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinterest allows artistic and non-sexualized nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.pinterest.com/en/articles/nudity|title=Nudity|publisher=help.pinterest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reasoning on why they allow nudity and mature content is for "art, safe sex education or advocacy for political protests". Instagram's CEO Kevin Systrom said that because of the Apple's App Store regulations, every app needs an age rating, if an app contains nudity, it has to be rated 17+, the CEO would prefer Instagram remain at its current rating of 12+, to attract a younger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konbini.com/us/lifestyle/heres-real-reason-instagram-wont-freethenipple/|title=Here's the real reason Instagram won't #FreeTheNipple|first=Lydia|last=Morrish|date=5 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube's policy allows nipples to be shown in content, however, will not allow sexually explicit material in content in which a woman's nipples are exposed. Google+ does not allow nipples to be shown unless they are cartoons. [[Flickr]] and [[Tumblr]] allow users to control how much nudity they want to see, but when the control settings are off then everything is allowed. Twitter allows everything to be shown when it comes to female nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/131620/your-concise-guide-to-social-medias-female-nipple-policies/|title=Your Concise Guide to Social Media's Female Nipple Policies|date=20 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tactic that activists have taken up is the use of the [[hashtag]] #FreeTheNipple. This tag has been used on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, where it can be used for searching the databases for posts with the same tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/download/989/989 |title=Raging Against the Machine: Network Gatekeeping and Collective Action on Social Media Platforms |first=Sarah Myers| last=West |publisher=Cogitatio |location=Lisbon |work=Media and Communication |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=28–36 |issn=2183-2439 |doi=10.17645/mac.v5i3.989 |date=22 September 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television ==
In 2014, director Lina Esco released her American feature film ''[[Free the Nipple (film)|Free the Nipple]]''. The film is centered around a group of young women who take to the streets of New York City as they protest the legal and cultural taboos regarding female breasts by way of publicity stunts, graffiti installations, and [[First Amendment]] lawyers. After shooting the film in 2012, Esco found it difficult to get the film widely released, motivating her to start the campaign in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Esco, Lina.

In episode 106 of ''[[The Bold Type]]'', the main character, Kat, participates in the campaign on social media by going against Instagram's guidelines by posting pictures with male nipples pasted onto women's bodies. The character said that freeing the nipple is more than just about Instagram and more about equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refinery29.com/2017/08/167301/bold-type-free-the-nipple-episode-6-instagram |first=Ariana |last=Romero |title=''The Bold Type'' Proves Freeing the Nipple is About So Much More than Instagram |date=9 August 2017 |website=[[Refinery29]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eric Enstrom - Grace - bw.jpg|thumb|300px|Photograph with window light added to original.]]
'''''Grace''''' is a [[photograph]] by [[Eric Enstrom]]. It depicts an elderly man with hands folded, saying [[Grace (prayer)|a prayer over a table]] with a simple meal. In [[82nd Minnesota Legislature|2002]], an act of the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] established it as the state photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mn.gov/portal/about-minnesota/state-symbols/photograph.jsp |title=''Grace'', official state photograph |publisher=[[State of Minnesota]] |accessdate=Feb 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The original photograph was taken at Enstrom's photography studio in [[Bovey, Minnesota]]. Most sources indicate 1918 as the year, though Enstrom's daughter Rhoda, born in 1917, claimed to remember being present when the photograph was taken, which might have been around 1920. The man depicted in the photograph is Charles Wilden, who earned a meager living as a [[peddler]] and lived in a [[sod house]]. While the photograph conveys a sense of piety, the book seen in the photo is actually a [[dictionary]] not a [[the Bible|Bible]],{{disputed inline|date=June 2018}} and local stories about Wilden "centered more around drinking and not accomplishing very much."&lt;ref name="grandforks"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee |first1=Stephen J. |title=Man in famous ''Grace'' photo mystifies historians |url=http://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/230720/publisher_ID/40/ |work=Grand Folks Herald |date=27 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101163418/http://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/230720/publisher_ID/40 |archivedate=1 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What happened to Wilden after the photograph is unknown. In 1926, he was paid $5 by Enstrom in return for waiving his rights to the photograph; he disappeared thereafter. After the photograph became popular Enstrom attempted to track Wilden down but was unsuccessful. Numerous family members and local historians have also attempted to determine what became of Wilden but have not been able to locate definitive evidence.&lt;ref name="grandforks" /&gt;

Enstrom first licensed the photograph to [[Augsburg Fortress]] in 1930. In the 1940s, his daughter, Rhoda Nyberg, [[hand-colouring of photographs|colorized]] the photo by hand. This version was featured in prints produced during the 1940s onward and became the more widespread and popularly known version of the photo.&lt;ref name=startribune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Paul|title=Iron Range artist brought ''Grace'' photo to fame|url=http://www.startribune.com/iron-range-artist-brought-grace-photo-to-fame/140587173/|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enstrom earned a modest sum from the photograph for the remainder of his life until his death in 1968. Nyberg died in 2012.&lt;ref name="grandforks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt;

==Biography==
Hermann Claasen was an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]] who made his first photographs at fourteen before the [[World War I|First World War]] with a camera built from a cigar box and spectacle lens. After the family textile business in which he worked suffered in the late 1920s during the [[Great Depression]], he earned his first income with photographs of the frozen [[Rhine]] at [[Sankt Goar|St. Goar]]. In 1936 he obtained a Meisterprüfung im Photographenhandwerk (Master Certificate in Photographic Craft), and worked as a portrait and advertising photographer, and after the 1930s started to photograph in colour. In 1942 he married the Cologne-based photographer Ria Dietz.

==Trümmerfotografie==
[[File:Truemmer koeln alter markt u gross stmartin194647.jpg|thumb|Hermann Claasen (1946-7) Ruins of St Martin at Cologne old market]]
After the Second World War professional and amateur photographers, German and foreign, took many thousand photographs that together became a genre known as ''Trümmerfotografie'' (English: 'rubble photography' or 'the photography of ruins').&lt;ref&gt;BLOKKER, J. M. (2016). Remembering and Experiencing German Cities in Photographic Books after World War II.

Among these, Claasen’s ‘rubble photographs’ of bombed [[Cologne]] are therefore a valuable historical record because, after his studio and his photo archive were destroyed in an attack on May 31, 1942, he started photographing during the conflict despite strict prohibitions against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Vollmer, Wolfgang, 1952- | author2=SK Stiftung Kultur.

Alongside his and Peter’s work is that of Eva Kemlein in Berlin, [[Edmund Kesting]] and Kurt Schaarschuch in [[Dresden]], Erna Wagner-Hehmke in [[Düsseldorf|Dusseldorf]], Karl-Heinz Mai and Renate Roessing in [[Leipzig]], Lala Aufsberg in [[Nuremberg]], and [[Herbert List]] and Tom von Wichert in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;Laoghaire, D., Connolly, M., &amp; Hogan, S.

It was exhibited with seventeen others of children joining hands for a ‘[[Ring a Ring o' Roses|Ring-a-ring-a-rosie]]’, all mounted on a stand that, in form, imitated the circular dance motion of the children in each photograph and forced the audience into the same step.

==Late career==
After the war and his documentation of the devastated [[Rhineland]], Claasen returned to commercial work and his portrait of Adenauer was used in election campaigns. An ongoing contributor to [[Photokina]], he kept up with current trends in post-war photography, and also with the developments of modern art that had advanced abroad, participating in many exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, T. (1988). " Subjektive Fotografie" in den fünfziger Jahren (No. 3). D. Nishen.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 60s, he produced industrial and portrait photography for  the museums of Cologne and for private companies, but by 1970 had to give up his photographic studio due to failing sight.

== Legacy ==
Through the 1980s Claasen held exhibitions of his work in Cologne, Düren, Bonn and Brussels. 

After his death an annual award for Rhineland photographers, the [http://www.kulturpreise.de/web/preise_info.php?cPath=4_67&amp;page=2&amp;preisd_id=1775 Hermann-Claasen-Preis für Kreative Fotografie und Medienkunst] (Hermann Claasen Award for Creative Photography and Media Arts) was inaugurated in his name in 1987.

As a [[Freelancer|freelance]] photographer, he worked for many clients, and good examples of mid-century portraits and advertising are part of his estate. A [[catalogue raisonné]] has been published in five volumes: ''Rubble'', ''Experiment'', ''Advertising'', ''Portrait'' and ''Early Work''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Sachsse, Rolf | author2=Honnef, Klaus | author3=Claasen, Hermann, 1899- | title=Hermann Claasen : Werkverzeichnis | publication-date=1993 | publisher=Rheinland-Verlag | isbn=978-3-7927-1517-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hoooverville willamette.jpg|thumb|A hooverville near [[Portland, Oregon]]]] 
A "'''Hooverville'''" was a [[shanty town]] built during the [[Great Depression]] by the homeless in the [[United States|United States of America]]. They were named after [[Herbert Hoover]], who was [[President of the United States of America]] during the onset of the Depression and was widely blamed for it. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the [[Democratic National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Hans |last= Kaltenborn| title= It Seems Like, Yesterday| year= 1956| page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were hundreds of Hoovervilles across the country during the 1930s and hundreds of thousands of people lived in these [[slum]]s.&lt;ref name="washington.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/depress/hooverville.shtml|title=Hoovervilles and Homelessness| work=washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Homelessness was present before the Great Depression, and was a common sight before 1929. Most large cities built municipal lodging houses for the homeless, but the Depression exponentially increased demand. The homeless clustered in shanty towns close to free soup kitchens. These settlements were often trespassing on private lands, but they were frequently tolerated or ignored out of necessity.  The [[New Deal]] enacted special relief programs aimed at the homeless under the Federal Transient Service (FTS), which operated from 1933–1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Gwendolyn |last1= Mink |first2= Alice |last2= O'Connor|title=Poverty in the United States: A – K.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40Zv8DC4g38C&amp;pg=PA371|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO| page= 371| isbn= 9781576075975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the men who were forced to live in these conditions possessed construction skills and were able to build their houses out of stone. Most people, however, resorted to building their residences out of wood from crates, cardboard, scraps of metal, or whatever materials were available to them. They usually had a small stove, bedding and a couple of simple cooking implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first= Andrew T. |last= Carswell| title= Hooverville| work= The Encyclopedia of Housing| edition= Second |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7uF7eIjwmQC&amp;pg=PA302| year= 2012| publisher= SAGE| page= 302| isbn= 9781412989572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, women and children alike lived in Hoovervilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= McElvaine| first= Robert S.| title= The Depression and New Deal: A History in Documents| location= New York| publisher= Oxford University Press| year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these unemployed residents of the Hoovervilles used [[Nonprofit organization|public charities]] or [[Begging|begged]] for food from those who had housing during this era.

Democrats coined many terms based on opinions of [[Herbert Hoover]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= John Morton |last= Blum| title= The National Experience: A History of the United States Since 1865| year= 1993| page= 678}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "Hoover blanket" (old newspaper used as blanketing). A "Hoover flag" was an empty pocket turned inside out and "Hoover leather" was cardboard used to line a shoe when the sole wore through. A"Hoover wagon" was an automobile with horses hitched to it, often with the engine removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nathan |first1=George Jean |last2=Mencken |first2=Henry Louis |title=The American Mercury vol. 34 |edition=1935 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=600EAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=mercury++hoover+wagon&amp;dq=mercury++hoover+wagon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3-6Kf69ndAhUD94MKHb7rBfoQ6AEILTAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1940 the economy recovered, unemployment fell, and shanty eradication programs destroyed all the Hoovervilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Steven L. |last= Danver| title= Revolts, protests, riots, demonstrations, and rebellions in American History| year= 2010| page= 839| isbn= 1598842218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Talk Minnesotan''''' is a book by Howard Mohr, a former writer for ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''. Published in 1987, the book provides examples of stereotypical [[Minnesota]]n speech and mannerisms. There was a [[musical theater|musical]] version by Mohr and Drew Jansen (produced at Plymouth Playhouse by Troupe America, Inc.). The book was also adapted as a television special, which was produced by [[KTCA]] and first broadcast January 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnvideovault.org/mvvPlayer/customPlaylist2.php?id=15512&amp;select_index=0&amp;popup=yes#0&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the things the book covers:
*Useful phrases such as "You bet", "That's different", and "Whatever" 
*Refusing food three times before accepting
*The art of waving
*[[Hotdish]]
*[[Lutefisk]]
*Talking about cars and starting cars in the winter
*The Minnesotan "long goodbye"

Much of the material for the book was originally performed as sketches on ''A Prairie Home Companion''.  The book also includes fictional ads for improbable businesses such as "Raw Bits Cereal", "Polka Pants", and "Walleye Phone Company".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24348">'''Jewish Painters of Montreal''' refers to a group of artists who depicted the [[social realism]] of Montreal during the 1930s and 1940s. First used by the media to describe participants of the annual YMHA-YWHA art exhibition, the term was popularized in the 1980s by art historian and curator Esther Trepannier.&lt;ref name=Trep2&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then these artists have been exhibited collectively in public galleries across Canada. In 2009 the [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] mounted a touring exhibition ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: a Witness to their time 1930-1948''&lt;ref name=McCord&gt;McCord Museum of Canadian History.

This collective included two generations of painters — established artists: Jack Beder (1910-1987), Alexandre Bercovitch (1891-1951), [[Eric Goldberg (artist)|Eric Goldberg]] (1890-1959), [[Louis Muhlstock]] (1904-2001); those in mid-career: [[Sam Borenstein]] (1908-1969), [[Herman Heimlich]] (1904-1986), [[Harry Mayerovitch]] (1910-2004), Bernard Mayman (1885-1966), Ernst Neumann (1907-1956), Fanny Wiselberg (1906-1986); and those just beginning: [[Sylvia Ary]] (1923-2011), [[Rita Briansky]] (1925), [[Ghitta Caiserman-Roth]] (1923-2005), [[Alfred Pinsky]] (1921-1999), and Moses "Moe" Reinblatt (1917-1979).&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p28.&lt;/ref&gt; As a group during the 30s and 40s, they were united in their choice of subjects — the human figure, Montreal and its people, and the war.&lt;ref name=McCord/&gt; As individual artists, their style varied from [[socialist realism]] to stylized [[expressionism]] with some the subject of recent museum exhibitions in Montreal, Ottawa or New York.

== History ==
These artists were either new arrivals from Eastern Europe or children of immigrants from that region. All were trained artists with a deep appreciation of impressionism and post-impressionism.&lt;ref name=ELAN&gt;Callaghan, Lori. ''Visual Arts from Painting to Performance Collectives'', [http://www.quebec-elan.org/histories/oneView/10 "The seeds of a community"] English Language Arts Network (ELAN). Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Most lived east of [[Mount Royal]] in Montreal's Jewish neighbourhood where, by 1926, Bercovitch, Mulstock and Reinblatt met informally at Bernard Mayman’s sign store on St Lawrence Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p219"&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p219.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the opening of the new YMHA (Young Men's Hebrew Association) on Mount Royal Avenue in 1929, the group became associated with its annual art exhibition. As the Depression of the 1930s deepened, many of these artists found themselves in reduced circumstances. Louis Mulstock used discarded sugar sacks as canvas, while in 1936 Bercovitch took a teaching position at the YWHA (Young Women's Hebrew Association). There he instructed a new generation of artists including daughter Sylvia Ary, Ghitta Caisserman and Rita Briansky,&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p221&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom included in the annual YMHA-YWHA art exhibition. Although there were discussions on creating a formal organization of Jewish Artists, as Bercovitch, Goldberg, Muhlstock, Mayervitch and Reinblatt were members of the 1938 [[Eastern Group of Painters]] and/or the 1939 Contemporary Arts Society, they were prohibited from other affiliations.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these artists had socialistic leanings which was reflected in their art. Bercovitch had married Russian revolutionary Bryna Avrutick  1915&lt;ref name=Inter/&gt; and was hired to teach art in Turkestan by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], then the Soviet Commisaire for Art and Theatre, in 1922.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p219"/&gt; Muhlstock identified with the working class and referred to his imagery as "proletarian art",&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;Anreus, Alejandro, Linden, Diana L. and Weinberg, Jonathan. ''The Social and the Real: Political Art of the 1930s in the Western Hemisphere'' Penn State Press (Philadelphia). 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-271-02691-6}} [http://www.psupress.org/books/SampleChapters/0-271-02691-Xsc.html Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; He later described his choice of subject matter as "something I had known and experienced and seen, and so it was the thing I wanted to express".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Charles. "Interview with Louis Muhlstock (Artist) 15/09/1973". National Gallery of Canada [http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO914-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Mayerovitch wrote on social issues such as Montreal housing in the leftist ''[[Canadian Forum]]'' (Toronto): "Nothing has been done to alleviate the overcrowding of low wage earners; nothing to render slum property a less profitable investment; nothing to provide new housing for that shockingly large proportion of our population which lives in sub-standard dwellings ...".&lt;ref&gt;Mayerovitch, Harry. ''The Canadian Forum''. May 1940. National Gallery of Canada. [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey= "Is Housing to Be Forgotten?"] Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the younger generation, Caiserman (after 1964 Caiserman-Roth) was the daughter of Hananiah Meir Caiserman, a union organizer and Po’alei Zion (Labor Zionism) activist&lt;ref name=Caisserman&gt;Jewish Women;s Archive [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/caiserman-roth-ghitta "Ghitta Caiserman-Roth".] Web&lt;/ref&gt; while Alfred Pinsky was the son of an American communist leader.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p263.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 30s and early 40s, Caisserman, Pinsky and Briansky attended the [[Art Students League of New York]] where they studied under muralist [[Harry Sternberg]] of the [[Federal Art Project]]. In New York they were exposed to the work of Mexican artists [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]] and the social purpose of art was debated in both America and Canada. In 1941, Reinblatt viewed Orozco's 1932 mural in New York on his honeymoon while in 1948 both Caiserman and Pinsky, then married, traveled to Mexico to study mural art.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p264.&lt;/ref&gt;

These artists also responded to the degradation of human rights in Nazi-Germany and Quebec's restrictive 1937 [[Padlock Law]] against socialist and communists.&lt;ref name=cjournal&gt;Herland, Karen. [http://cjournal.concordia.ca/archives/20080403/reminiscing_about_jewish_montreal.php "Reminiscing about Jewish Montreal".] ''Concordia Journal.'' Concordia University. Web&lt;/ref&gt; During the 30s, Muhlstock who was a member of the Canadian League Against War and Fascism later commented: "Perhaps if the war wasn’t on I might not have gone in that direction, you see." As Canada's military commitment deepened, World War 2 became a topic for paintings, cartoons and political posters. Mayerovitch, appointed art director for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1940, produced many soviet-style posters,&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p245.&lt;/ref&gt; while Reinblatt enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Airforce]] in 1942 and was an official Canadian War Artist by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;ARTSask, [http://www.artsask.ca/en/artists/moereinblatt Moe Reinblatt]. Web&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 Pinsky as union representative with the Royal Canadian Navy&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p207. {{ISBN|978-2761925310}}&lt;/ref&gt; also choose war as a subject matter, but like Mulstock and Reinblatt depicted the workers behind the war effort rather than combat. Muhlstock’s ''Female Worker, Rear View'' (1943), of a female worker dressed in coveralls depicted the gender equality of workers during the war years.&lt;ref name=Shalom/&gt;

During the 30s and 40s, these artists exhibited in prominent venues of the day. All, with the exception of Sylvia Ary, exhibited at The Art Association of Montreal (now the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275/&gt; In the mid 30s Mulstock exhibited with the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in Toronto  and along with Beder, Bercovitch, Borenstein, Goldberg, Mayman, and Wiselberg with the Contemporary Arts Society of Montreal.&lt;ref name=Trep2-276&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''.

After the YM-YWHA moved from the downtown core in 1950, West End Gallery increasingly served as a meeting place.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 1948"&gt;Trépanier, Esther.

== Recognition ==
'''1930-1949''' In the early 1930s Bercovitch, Muhlstock and Borenstein were recognized artists. In 1933 Bercovitch held his first solo exhibition at Sydney Carter Gallery&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Canada [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=438 "Alexandre Bercovitch".] Web&lt;/ref&gt; which was reviewed favourably by Henri Girard.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Charles C. [http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO92-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf "Interview with Sylvia Ary (Artist and daughter of artist Alexandre Bercovitch)"] National Gallery of Canada. Web&lt;/ref&gt; Mulhstock, considered one of the  finest draughtsmen in the country. was singled out for hi sensitive depictions of individuals by Montreal art critic Robert Ayre of ''The Gazette''. IBy the mid-30s 1935 they were reviewed collectively in the [[Canadian Forum]] (Toronto): "The subject matter of [Louis Muhlstock, Alexander Bercovitch, and Sam Borenstein] is similar: they paint the Montreal ghetto, tramp steamers in the harbour, street scenes, typical workers and members of the lumpen proletariat.... Muhlstock and Borenstein link their preoccupations closely with political awareness, though neither has as yet participated in the revolutionary movement."&lt;ref&gt;The National Art Gallery of Canada. [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=14805 "A Cartoonist of the Left"]&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, many were mentioned in the reviews of the Art Society of Montreal, while the Annual YM-YWHA art exhibition drew favorable reviews in the English press.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Respected as innovators in subject matter or form, by 1948 artists Beder, Bercovitch, Borenstein, Heimlich, Mayervitch, Muhlstock, Neumann, and Reinblatt had all exhibited at the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Art]] exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275/&gt;

'''1950-1999''' In 1959 these artists were featured at the Montreal Museum of Fine Art's exhibition ''Works by Canadian Jewish Artists''.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition catalogue. ''Exhibition of Works by Canadian Jewish Artists October 29 to November 15''. Montreal Museum of Fine Art, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the art of the 30s and 40s was renewed in the mid-70s with the publication of Barry Lord's ''Canadian Art: Towards A Peoples History'' and with the [[National Gallery of Canada]]'s traveling exhibition ''Canadian Painting in the Thirties''. While both featured work by Bercovitch, Muhlstock and Goldberg, only Lord included the younger Jewish Painters of Montreal. However, in 1987 Montreal art historian and curator Esther Trepanier mounted an exhibition of their collective work at the Saidye Bronfman Centre (Montreal) which toured Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta and published ''Jewish Artists and Modernity''.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This renewed attention led to the acquisition of over 150 of their works by public institutions including the National Gallery of Canada, The Canadian War Museum, The National Archives and the Musée de Québec.&lt;ref&gt;John Donovan Biography [http://www.biferalifineart.com/artists/donovan/donovan.html Biferali Fine Art] Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution ==
As social realists, the Jewish Painters of Montreal combined streetscapes and figurative art with leftist ideals of social justice and worker solidarity.&lt;ref name=McCord/&gt; In 1936 Toronto critic Graham McInnis of ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]'' wrote: "Mr. Muhlstock... is one of the leaders of that small group of Montreal painters who have found that it is possible to paint one's immediate environment – to see forms and relationships from one's back window – and at the same time to paint well, and in a manner as fine and as native in this country as the most gnarled and twisted pine of the most jagged rock in the North Country."&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p184.&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian Esther Trepannier these artists of the 30s and 40s "unequivocally produced works that, both in their formal exploration and in their more contemporary, urban subjects, contributed towards the definition of the particular form of modernity that emerged between the major nationalist movements and abstraction"&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p205"&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p205.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Les Automatistes]] painters [[Paul-Émile Borduas]] and [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]. For her these Jewish artists offered a decidedly more 'international' way of looking at the Canadian scene'."&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p204.&lt;/ref&gt; which, unlike their American and Mexican contemporaries, they adopted to distance themselves from the perceived nationalism of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. In terms of contribution, Trepannier has concluded that: "The artists of the Jewish community not only helped to define cultural modernity in Quebec and the rest of Canada during the interwar period, but have continued to enrich and enhance the originality of its development ever since."&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p205"/&gt;

[[File:Complexity-legal-translation.jpg|thumb|Complexity of legal translation]]
'''Legal translation''' is the [[translation]] of texts within the field of [[law]]. As law is a culture-dependent subject field, legal translation is not necessarily [[Transparency (linguistic)|linguistically transparent]]. Intransparency in translation can be avoided somewhat by use of Latin legal terminology, where possible. 

Intransparency can lead to expensive misunderstandings in terms of a [[contract]], for example, resulting in avoidable [[lawsuit]]s. Legal translation is thus usually done by specialized law translators. Conflicts over the legal impact of a translation can be avoided by indicating that the text is "authentic" i.e. legally operative on its own terms or instead is merely a "convenience translation", which itself is not legally operative. Courts only apply authentic texts and do not rely on "convenience" translations in adjudicating rights and duties of litigants.

Most legal writing is exact and technical, seeking to precisely define legally binding rights and duties. Thus, precise correspondence of these rights and duties in the [[source text]] and in the translation is essential. As well as understanding and precisely translating the legal rights and duties established in the translated text, legal translators must also bear in mind the legal system of the [[source text]] (ST) and the legal system of the [[target text]] (TT) which may differ greatly from each other: Anglo-American common law, Islamic law, or customary tribal law for examples.

Apart from terminological [[lexical gap|lacuna]]e (lexical gaps), textual conventions in the source language are often culture-dependent and may not correspond to conventions in the target culture (see e.g. Nielsen 2010). Linguistic structures that are often found in the source language may have no direct equivalent structures in the target language. The translator therefore has to be guided by certain standards of linguistic, social and cultural equivalence between the language used in the [[source text]] (ST) to produce a text (TT) in the target language. Those standards correspond to a variety of different principles defined as different approaches to translation in [[translation theory]]. Each of the standards sets a certain priority among the elements of ST to be preserved in TT.  For example, following the functional approach, translators try to find target language structures with the same functions as those in the source language thus value the functionality of a text fragment in ST more than, say, the meanings of specific words in ST and the order in which they appear there.

Different approaches to translation should not be confused with different approaches to [[translation theory]]. The former are the standards used by translators in their trade while the latter are just different [[paradigms]] used in developing translation theory.

Few jurists are familiar with terms of translation theory. They may ask [[interpreters]] and [[translators]] to provide [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] translation. They often view this term as a clear standard of quality that they desire in TT. However, verbatim translation usually is undesireable due to different grammar structures as well as different legal terms or rules in different legal systems.  Jurists asking for "verbatim" translation are likely making the lay misconception that an accurate translation is achieved by substituting "the correct" words of the target language one-for-one from the ST. In reality, they just want to have a [[faithful and fluent translation]] of ST, having no doubt that a good translator will provide it. They do not realize that word-by-word translations could sound as complete nonsense in the target language, and usually have no idea of different professional translation standards. Many translators would probably choose to adhere to the standard that they themselves find more appropriate in a given situation based on their experience rather than to attempt to educate the court personnel.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Legal translators often consult specialized bilingual or polyglot [[law dictionary|law dictionaries]]. Care should be taken, as some bilingual law dictionaries are of poor quality and their use may lead to mistranslation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10749">'''Johann Leo Weisgerber''' (25 February 1899, [[Metz]] – 8 August 1985, [[Bonn]]) was a [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]-born [[Germany|German]] [[linguistics|linguist]] who also specialized in [[Celtic languages|Celtic linguistics]]. He developed the "organicist" or "[[Linguistic relativity|relativist]]" theory that different languages produce different experiences. He was son of a village-teacher who served as a young man in the German army in Flanders and could not return to his home city for that.  During [[World War II]] his [[pan-Celticism|pan-Celticist]] ideology was co-opted to support the German war effort, as did pro-Polish and pro-Czech ideology on the side of the allies.

==Scholarly career==
After studying in Bonn (1918–), Weisgerber taught as a [[professor]] of general and comparative linguistics at [[Rostock University]] (1927–), [[Marburg University]] (1938–) and [[Bonn University]] (1942–). He was an editor of the journal ''Wörter und Sachen'', which he used as a vehicle for his ideas.&lt;ref name = "hutt" /&gt; After the Second World War he taught mainly in Bonn. He wrote prolifically throughout his career. Among other activities he founded the modern German language journal ''Wirkendes Wort'' and was a co-founder of the Institut für Deutsche Sprache ([[Mannheim]]).

==Theory of language==
Reacting to older linguists' emphasis on form (especially phonology and morphology), Weisgerber initiated what he called ''inhaltbezogene Grammatik'' ('content-related grammar'). Starting from the study of translation problems and of colour amnesia, he contributed notably to the theory that language determines and structures our apprehension of reality. This was initially influenced by the [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], but Weisgerber's theory soon took him far beyond the simple Saussurean linkage of (linguistic) form and (semantic) content.&lt;ref name = "hutt"&gt;{{Citation | first = Christopher M | last = Hutton | title = Linguistics and the Third Reich: Mother-tongue fascism, race and the science of language | series = Studies in the History of Linguistics | volume = 1 | publisher = Routledge | pages = 18, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His other debts were to [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (notably the insight that language diversity implies a diversity of world-views) and [[Jost Trier]] (concurrently with whom he developed the structuralist idea of a word-field or lexical field).

Weisgerber argued that each language community has its own perception of the world, different from that of other groups:
*There are words or phrases that are specific to each language community.
*Some concepts may be shared by two (or more) linguistic communities, but with different connotations in each case.
*Each language community structures reality in a different way, according to its own language codes.

In this respect, languages imply a "world view" that can produce sustained cultural differences.

Centrally, Weisgerber contended that each language community was engaged in a process of 'wording the world' (''Worten der Welt'') by means of its mother tongue. Mediating between the forms (i.e. words and grammatical structures) of a language and the external world, there was a 'linguistic inter-world' (''sprachliche Zwischenwelt''), which operates directly, indirectly and in part autonomously, in ways peculiar to that language. In acquiring a specific mother tongue, a speaker will also unconsciously acquire and be influenced by its distinctive categorizations and structures. These effects permeate the entire community and shape its perceived world.

From 1925 through into the 1970s, Weisgerber repeatedly cited colour terms in support of his views. Categorisation of colour impressions under a small number of generally applicable ("abstract") terms like ''blau'' and ''rot'' was, for him, the outcome of long evolutionary development, and only a minority of languages had achieved this. Specifically, he found it remarkable that the German language had mastered (''bewältigt'') the entire world of colour with only eight abstract colour words.&lt;ref&gt;William Jervis Jones (2013). ''German Colour Terms: A study in their historical evolution from earliest times to the present''. [[John Benjamins]], Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia, {{ISBN|978-90-272-4610-3}}, pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisgerber claimed in 1929 to have discovered a significant restructuring in the field of visual impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Weisgerber (1929), 'Adjektivische und verbale Auffassung der Gesichtsempfindungen', ''Wörter und Sachen'' 12.197–226.&lt;/ref&gt; Simplistically, he reported a decline since ancient Germanic times in the verbal expression of colour, with objects nowadays perceived as colour-bearers, not colour-transmitters (''Farbträger, nicht Farbsender''). Empirical evidence for this has since proved to be contradictory. Better supported, but still in need of verification, was his converse hypothesis of a corresponding historical shift in the expression and perception of ''Glanz'' (a term comprising 'shininess', 'radiance' etc.). These non-chromatic light phenomena had earlier been freely rendered adjectivally, but were now mainly expressed in modern German 'Glanzverben' like ''glänzen'' and ''schimmern''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2013: 456–461.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisgerber's conception of [[linguistic relativity]] was more extreme than that of [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] or [[Edward Sapir]], with whom the theory is most often associated.&lt;ref&gt;For critiques of Weisgerber in that context, see, for example: Beat Lehmann (1998), ''ROT ist nicht ″rot″ ist nicht [rot].

Alan Cruse et al., Walter de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York, 1.380–391.&lt;/ref&gt; Resonance in the Anglo-Saxon world was limited partly by Weisgerber's arcane terminology, but more by his French-German ethnic background in an "Americanized scientific community", dominated by structuralist universalists like [[Noam Chomsky]].  In Germany he remained a significant figure in German linguistics well into the 1960s, when politically as well as linguistically his views fell into scientific discredit. His theory was then overtaken by new structuralist and universalist approaches from Britain and America, as well as elsewhere in Europe – "history" was out, "structure" was in. One of his pupils, Helmut Gipper, prominently developed his ideas in modified form, in a series of articles and as co-editor of the Duden ''Grammatik'' from the late 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2013: 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Gipper was also influential as co-editor of an extensive bibliography on ''Sprachinhaltsforschung'', as linguistics broadly within the Weisgerber tradition has come to be known.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Gipper &amp; Hans Schwarz (1963-89), ''Bibliographisches Handbuch zur Sprachinhaltsforschung'', Westdeutscher Verlag, Cologne, Opladen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisgerber can be seen as an epigonic scholar of the German idealistic and romantic traditions alike, that insisted on the compatibility of reason and history and did not play off the first contra the latter.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} That he did not resist narrowing it down to irrational and silly Germanicism/Celtism does not distinguish him from the academic climate of his times.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Pan-Celticism==
Before World War II, Weisgerber established links with Celtic nationalists in Ireland, Britain and Brittany, which were seen as a threat to national unity by the respective majority governments (the British Crown and the Centralist French Republic).  The Breton nationalists joined Germany at the beginning of the war, at least some of them. After the [[Fall of France]] Weisgerber initiated the creation of the Breton Celtic Institute and directed the radio station ''[[Radio Rennes Bretagne]]'' (Radio Rennes of Brittany) which broadcast the first radio transmissions in the [[Breton language]], something that most Bretons had been waiting for unsuccessfully for decades.

These ventures were perceived by the [[French Resistance]] as German-sponsored propaganda organizations, which they in fact were. This "aumenting – assumed or real – ethnic fractions in enemy states" was a political tactic used by all war-faring states, Weisgerber thus being in a line with Lawrence of Arabia, the Germans supporting Irish independence or the British supporting Polish or Czech independence – it is not genuinely Nazi, nor does it hint at a character/scientific flaw in Weisgerber.  The counter-tactic was employed by Americas ally Joseph Stalin, who deported hundreds of thousands of non-Russians, mostly by means of American military  logistics.  Roosevelt agreed after the war that all ethnic non-Russians that had fled or otherwise collaborated with the Germans be handed over to the Russians (especially Ukrainians and Polish), where most were either actively killed or starved to death in work-camps.

After the defeat of the Nazis, Weisgerber assisted the members of the Breton [[Bezen Perrot]] SS militia, led by [[Célestin Lainé]], providing them with false papers to allow them to escape to Ireland with the help of other Celticists, a practice that can be seen both critically politically and/or humane .&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel | last = Leach | url = http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol4/4_1/ | title = Bezen Perrot: The Breton nationalist unit of the SS, 1943–5 | journal = e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies | page = 24 | volume = 4 | publisher = UWM}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Libro de' Disegni''' (Italian for ''Book of Drawings'') was a collection of drawings gathered, sorted and grouped by [[Giorgio Vasari]] whilst writing his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''. By the time of his death in 1574 it is thought to have contained around 526 drawings, of which 162 are now in the [[Louvre]] and 83 in the [[Nationalmuseum, Stockholm]]&lt;ref&gt;Per Bjurstrom, ''Italian Drawings from the Collection of Giorgio Vasari'' (Stockholm: Nationalmuseum, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;. There are also drawings from the ''Libro'' in the prints and drawings departments of the [[Uffizi]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Albertina]], the [[National Gallery of Art]] and other institutions.

==Origins and dispersal==
Some art historians believe they were gathered to illustrate Vasari's ''Lives'' directly, as a visual index of the artists' works, whilst others believe it was a separate document in its own right. In his preface to the ''Lives'', Vasari described his reasons for writing:
{{blockquote|When I took on the task of writing about the life of the great artists ... I made a choice, which I have also explained, between what was good, what was better and what was perfect. I carefully pointed out the techniques, aspects, styles, particularities and fantasies of painters and sculptors. I also tried my best to reveal to those who did not succeed alone the causes and origins of different styles, and the ascending or descending curve followed by arts in different epoques and among different characters}}

No text reveals why Vasari compiled his collection of drawings, but it was probably to illustrate the styles of the different artists he wrote about and to show how he had divided them "into three parts, or rather let us call them periods, between the rebirth of the arts and our own time - each of these is distinguished from the others by manifest differences". The earliest drawing in the collection was by [[Cimabue]] and the latest dated to Vasari's own time. In the 1550 and 1568 editions of the ''Lives'' Vasari insisted on drawings as documents which allowed the viewer to perceive the ''maniera'' of the great masters of painting and mentioned when he owned one or two drawings by a particular artist, such as at the end of his life of [[Filippo Lippi]]:
("Fra Filippo drew very well, as one can see in my own ''Libro'' of the most famous painters, in the preparatory drawings for the altarpiece at Santo Spirito and the frescoes in the Prato chapel.") and in his life of [[Sandro Botticelli]] ("Sandro's drawings were of a totally unique excellence; and, after his death, more and more artists have been keen to have some of his drawings; and I myself, in my collection, have a few which were done with great care and judgement").

Giorgio Vasari was one of the founders of the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] set up in [[Florence]] by [[Cosimo I of Tuscany]] in 1563. He and the other founders wished to use this academy to promote artists above the status of artisans.&lt;ref&gt;K. Barzman, ''The Florentine Accademia del Disegno  : Liberal Education and the Renaissance Artist'', p. 14-32, in A. Boschloo ed., ''Academies of Art Between Renaissance and Romanticism'', Leid Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liana de Girolami Cheney, ''The Homes of Giorgio Vasari'', {{p.|5-20}}, Peter Lang Publishing, New York, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8204-7494-0}} [https://books.google.fr/books?id=4crgY-AN2mUC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (''sample'')]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a passionate collector of drawings and in his ''Libro'' he set them in his own paper frames and gathered drawings by one or more painters on a single sheet. In [[1528]] he received a collection of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s drawings, as one of Ghiberti's descendents.&lt;ref&gt;Liana de Girolami Cheney, ''Giorgio Vasari's Teachers : Sacred &amp; Profane Art'', p.250, note 10, Peter Lang Publishing, New York, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-8204-8813-4}} [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Edi7bg9V3aEC&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (''read online'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Vasari's death, the sheets of the ''Libro'' were initially bought in 1574 by the Florentine collector [[Niccolò Gaddi (1537-1591)|Niccolò Gaddi]] (1537-1591).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/niccolo-gaddi_res-8e4caa38-87ed-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Dizionario_Biografico%29/ {{it icon}} Vanna Arrighi, ''Niccolò Gaddi'', Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]&lt;/ref&gt; They were then sold by Gaddi's heirs before 18 May 1638, the date of death of Lorenzo Sabbatini, who had been put in charge of the ''Libro''. They were then dispersed among the [[Medici]], [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Arundel]], Quesnel, [[Pierre Crozat|Crozat]] and Mariette collections during the 17th and 18th centuries.

The first drawings from the ''Libro de' Disegni'' to enter the French national collection were bought by [[Everhard Jabach]], probably when the Arundel collections were sold in 1646 and 1654 after his and his widow's deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Monbeig-Goguel, ''Collections de Louis XIV, dessins, albums, manuscrits'', {{p.|46}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then passed from Jabach into [[Louis XIV]]'s drawings collection in 1671. Further sheets from the ''Libro'' were added when the French royal collection bought part of the collection of [[Pierre-Jean Mariette|Mariette]] in 1755 and when [[Charles Paul Jean Baptiste de Bourgevin Vialart de Saint-Morys|Saint-Morys]]'s collection was seized by the revolutionary government in 1793. These later additions may have originated in the sale of the Crozat collection, for which a catalogue survives. Part of the Mariette collection was sold to the royal collection in 1775. Other pages entered the French national collection from [[émigré]] goods seized by the revolutionary government and via gift and purchase.

Nothing else is known about him or his life, though Umberto Gnoli suggests he can be identified with Giovanni Paolo di Cola dal Borgo and that theory was supported by Ricci due to the journal of [[Alberto Alberti|Berto Alberti]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/alberto-alberti_res-eb412d61-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani Treccani : Alberti, Alberto]&lt;/ref&gt;, which refers to the death of a painter named Giovanni Paolo del Colle on 19 September 1556. He was mentioned in the marriage register entry for his sister Lodovica di Francesco di Michelangelo dal Colle, dating to 29 November 1538 and showing he was born around 1518. A 1550 document published by Josephine von Henneberg links him to the decoration of the Parisiani chapel in [[San Marcello al Corso]] in Rome. He can also be seen assisting Vasari in painting the [[Vasari Sacristy|refectory of the Monteoliveto monastery in Naples]], as cited in a 1545 letter from Vasari to Don Miniato Pitti&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L. C. Ewart Witcombe, ''A Vasari assistant : Giovanni Paolo del Colle'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, volume 6, no. 4, Summer 1987&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Birmingham Central Library fire jan1879.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Birmingham Central Library]] destroyed by fire, 1879]]
Libraries have been deliberately or accidentally destroyed or badly damaged. Sometimes a [[library]] is purposely destroyed as a form of [[cultural cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fadhil|first=Muna|date=26 February 2015|title=Isis destroys thousands of books and manuscripts in Mosul libraries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/26/isis-destroys-thousands-books-libraries|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location= |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of accidentally destroyed libraries by human actions. Other times they are damaged by natural disasters like earthquakes, floods or accidental fires.

Library fires have happened sporadically through the centuries: notable examples are the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]], destruction of Library of Nalanda in India and the accidental burning of the [[Duchess Anna Amalia Library]] in Weimar. Causes vary from [[arson]] to the [[sun]]'s rays setting fire to leaflets through the action of a magnifying lens, as happened to a library in [[Northam, Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=The Times |location=London |title=Arson ruled out |date=17 June 2005 |page=38 |department=Home News |edition=Final 3|quote=A fire that destroyed a public library in Northam, Devon, was thought to have been the work of an arsonist, but investigators have determined that a beam from a hands-free magnifier ignited leaflets, which fell onto a box of books. Flames destroyed 90 per cent of the collection.&lt;!-- This is the entirety of the story. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://fred.historicengland.org.uk/pdf/743.pdf|title=Action C17: Built Heritage: Fire Loss to Historic Buildings: Final Report|author=TECHNICAL CONSERVATION, RESEARCH AND EDUCATION group|publisher=Historic Scotland|date=2007|isbn=978-1-904966-53-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and prevention ==
In earlier times [[mildew]] was considered a major problem in many libraries and so the emphasis on library design was to increase air flow by, for example, leaving openings under the shelves in adjoining floors. In a fire the flames will be drawn floor to floor by the air flow thus ensuring the relatively easy destruction of a whole library rather than a small section.

Advances in technology have reduced the possibility of a library collection being destroyed by fire. These include water sprinklers, [[fire door]]s, freezers, alarms, smoke detectors, suppression systems, and emergency generators. Older libraries are usually converted by closing up air flow openings and installing fire doors, alarms and sprinklers. Air conditioning reduces the mold problems. These are all essential parts of new library design.

There is no recovery possible if a book is burnt so it is accepted that a better solution is to put out the fire with water and then dry out the books. As mold destroys paper the books are frozen until they can be dried. This process will damage the book but not destroy it and the information will be intact.

In order to minimize the possibility of damage from fire, or other causes, and decrease the time needed for recovery after a destructive event, all libraries need a disaster management and recovery plan. This can be an ongoing process which will include professional development following updates in technology for key staff, training for the remaining staff, checking and maintaining disaster kits, and review of the disaster plan.

In addition, fire-safety investigations are periodically carried out, especially regarding historical libraries.  The [[Library of Congress]], for example, experienced a year-long inspection in 2000. Before the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]], the Library of Congress and all Capitol Hill buildings were exempt from safety regulations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fineberg, Gail. "Moving Toward a Safer Library. Compliance Office Issues Fire Safety Report," Library of Congress Information Bulletin 60 no. 3, 65, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Balancing historical preservation and contemporary safety standards proves to be a difficult task for "even a 12-year rehabilitation of LC completed in 1997 did not address many fire hazards".&lt;ref&gt;L.A., "Inspection Scorches Fire Safety at LC," ''American Libraries,'' 32 no. 3 17–18, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Compliance Office inspection, however, the LC announced their wholehearted commitment "to achieving the highest level of safety possible" and "the [[Architect of the Capitol]] and Library of Congress will report their progress to the [[United States Congress Office of Compliance|Office of Compliance]] every three months".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Information technology is another catalyst for careful fire protection.  With so many computers in libraries there "is a decrease in floor space and an increase in more compact and powerful computer systems" which generates more heat and requires the use of many more outlets, increasing the number of potential ignition sources.&lt;ref name="Fixen, Edward L 2006, p47-51"&gt;Fixen, Edward L. and Vidar S. Landa,"Avoiding the Smell of Burning Data," ''Consulting-Specifying Engineer'', May 2006, Vol. 39 Issue 5, p47-51&lt;/ref&gt;  From as early as the 1950s the potential dangers of computer equipment, and the facilities that house them, was recognized.  Thus in 1962 the National Fire Protection Association began developing the first safety standards specifically applicable to electronic computer systems.&lt;ref name="Fixen, Edward L 2006, p47-51"/&gt;  This standard is called NFPA 75 Protection of Information Technology Equipment.  FM Global Data Sheet 5–32 is another standard providing guidelines to protect against not only fire, but water, power loss, etc.&lt;ref name="Fixen, Edward L 2006, p47-51"/&gt;

The '''Manchester Phonology Meeting''' (abbreviated and stylised as '''mfm''') is an annual [[linguistic]] [[academic conference|conference]] held at Hulme Hall in Manchester, in the [[United Kingdom]], since 1993. Submitted [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] undergo an anonymous [[peer-review]] process before being selected for inclusion by an organising committee and international advisory board of prominent [[linguist]]s. Presentations take on a broad range of phonological topics, from [[phonological development|phonological acquisition]] and the phonological description of languages to the interfaces between phonology and other subfields of linguistics such as [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]].

The Manchester Phonology Meeting is the longest-running and most-attended series of conferences in phonology. It regularly attracts participants from all over Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. Funding for the conference has come from a variety of sources, including the [[Linguistics Association of Great Britain]] and the [[British Academy]]. The 27th conference in the series will take place between 23 and 25 May 2019.

In recent years her research has focused on fathers and sons, and she has carried out a follow-up study 30 years later of [[Erik Grønseth]]'s pioneering, experimental gender equality research from the 1970s, which studied gendered patterns of breadwinning and care.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/jobb/Det-lonner-seg-for-far-a-stelle-hjemme-5344292.html |title= Det lønner seg for far å stelle hjemme |last1= Gimmestad |first1=Johnny |last2= |first2= |date= 5 September 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Aftenposten]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Tenk nytt om tidsklemma  |author= Ingeborg Moe |url= |newspaper=[[Dagbladet]] |date= 12 December 2005 | pages= 1, 16, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another focus is the cultural adaptations and transnational practices of Polish emigrants to Norway, and how migration leads to social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.policy.no/research/cross-national-polish-norwegian-project-on-work-life-balance |title= EFFECT: Cross-national Polish–Norwegian project on work–life balance |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Policy and Social Research |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently heads a research project on intimate partner violence with emphasis on gender, gender equality and power at [[NKVTS]], which is funded by the [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Gir-50-millioner-til-forskning-pa-vold-i-nare-relasjoner-7633617.html Gir 50 millioner til forskning på vold i nære relasjoner], ''Aftenposten''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cristin.no/app/projects/show.jsf?id=502936 |title= CRIStin Projects |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[CRIStin]] |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was co-editor, with the Scottish economist [[Ailsa McKay]], of the 2014 book ''Counting on [[Marilyn Waring]]: New Advances in Feminist Economics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2014/mai/391278 |title= – Klart vi kan jobbe mindre |author= Kristin Marie Skaar |date= 24 May 2014 |work= |publisher=[[forskning.no]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/women-unaccounted-for-in-global-economy-proves-waring-influence.html |title= Women Unaccounted for in Global Economy Proves Waring Influence |last1= Langeland |first1=Terje |last2= |first2= |date= 18 June 2013 |work= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was described by [[Alison Preston]] as "a timely reminder of the politics and economics underpinning what, how and by whom activities are valued." According to ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'', the book explores "a wide range of issues—including the fundamental meaning of economic growth and activity to consumption, health care, mortality, unpaid household work, mothering, education, nutrition, equality, and sustainability" and reveals "the breadth, depth, and substance that can grow from innovative ideas and critical analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sullivan |first=T.E. |last2= |first2= |year=2014 |title= Review: Counting on Marilyn Waring: new advances in feminist economics |url= |journal=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]] |publisher= |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages= 52-1517|doi= 10.5860/CHOICE.185300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diane Elson]] argues that "despite many valiant efforts, women do not as yet really count in the conduct of economic policy. This book is an imaginative contribution to an ongoing struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Elson |first=Diane |authorlink= Diane Elson |year= 2015 |title= Book Review: Counting on Marilyn Waring: new advances in feminist economics |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/fr/journal/v109/n1/full/fr201458a.html |journal= Feminist Review |publisher= |volume=109 |pages= e9–e11|doi= 10.1057/fr.2014.58 |accessdate=25 February 2015 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Might Is Right''''', or '''''The Survival of the Fittest''''', is a book by pseudonymous author Ragnar Redbeard. First published in 1890, it heavily advocates [[egoist anarchism]], [[amorality]], [[consequentialism]] and [[psychological hedonism]]. In ''Might Is Right'', Redbeard rejects conventional ideas of [[human rights|human]] and [[natural rights]] and argues that only strength or physical might can establish moral right (à la [[Callicles]] or [[Thrasymachus]]). The book also attacks [[Christianity]] and [[Democracy]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s theories of [[master–slave morality]] and [[herd mentality]] serve as a clear inspiration for Redbeard's book written contemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Mathews|title=Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQrbsOWaOyUC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=May 16, 2017|year=2009|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-36639-0|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Individualist anarchism|Individualist Anarchist]] historian [[James J. Martin]] called it "surely one of the most incendiary works ever to be published anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818145227/http://www.nonserviam.com/egoistarchive/SidParker/Parker_Ego_06.htm |date=August 18, 2010 |title=EGO No 6 1985 Twenty Five Pence, }} archived from [https://web.archive.org/web/20020812061611/http://www.nonserviam.com:80/egoistarchive/SidParker/Parker_Ego_06.htm the original]&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the controversial content such as the viewpoint that weakness should be regarded with hatred and the strong and forceful presence of [[Social Darwinism]] in the text. There are also controversial parts of the book that deal with race and male–female relations, claiming that the woman and the family as a whole is the property of the man and proclaiming the innate superiority of the [[English people|Anglo-Saxon]] race. The book also contains many strongly [[anti-Semitic]] statements. 

Some have suspected that the work is at least partly intended to be a satire of Social Darwinism. It has also been characterised as "proto-fascist white power manifesto".&lt;ref&gt;Mathews 2009, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authorship ==
[[S. E. Parker]] writes in his introduction to the text: "The most likely candidate is a man named [[Arthur Desmond]] who was red-bearded, red-haired and whose poetry was very similar to that written by Redbeard."&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;[[S. E. Parker]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120143427/http://www.churchofsatan.org/might.pdf Introduction to ''Might is Right'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Satan]] founder [[Anton LaVey]] and white supremacist publisher Katja Lane (wife of [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] member [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]]) both believed noted novelist [[Jack London]] was substantially involved, if not the author of the entire book; the latter based her judgment on London's distinctive grammar and punctuation.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt;[http://london.sonoma.edu/Bibliographies/redbeard.html RUNNING WITH THE WOLVES: JACK LONDON, THE CULT OF MASCULINITY, AND "MIGHT IS RIGHT"], Rodger Jacobs, Jack London Online Collection, Sonoma U&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HioKA46blE8C&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=UvgQ6nsieW&amp;dq=%22might%20is%20right%22%20author%20jack%20london&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22might%20is%20right%22%20author%20jack%20london&amp;f=false "Foreward" (sic)] by Anton LaVey, to ''Might is Right'', pub. Shane Bugbee (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jack London scholar Rodger Jacobs said, "the notion is as ludicrous as suggesting that the author of 'White Fang' was a cross-dressing hermaphrodite who buried his sexual shame in manly exploits".&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; London was born in 1876, so he would have written the book in his early teens by the time it was first published in 1890.

Ambrose Bierce, the American born author of the Devil's Dictionary has also been suggested to have written Might Is Right.

==Response==
[[Leo Tolstoy]], whom ''Might Is Right'' described as "the ablest modern expounder of primitive Christliness", responded in his 1897 essay ''[[What Is Art?]]'':

{{quote|The substance of this book, as it is expressed in the editor's preface, is that to measure "right" by the false philosophy of the [[Nevi'im|Hebrew prophets]] and "weepful" [[Messiah]]s is madness. Right is not the offspring of doctrine, but of power.  All laws, commandments, or doctrines as to not doing to another what you do not wish done to you, have no inherent authority whatever, but receive it only from the [[Club (weapon)|club]], the [[gallows]], and the [[sword]]. A man truly free is under no obligation to obey any injunction, human or divine. Obedience is the sign of the [[wikt:degenerate|degenerate]]. Disobedience is the stamp of the hero.

Expressed in the form of a doctrine these positions startle us. In reality they are implied in the ideal of art serving beauty. The art of our upper classes has educated people in this ideal of the over-man, --- which is in reality the old ideal of [[Nero]], [[Stenka Razin]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Robert Macaire]] or [[Napoleon]] and all their accomplices, assistants, and adulators --- and it supports this ideal with all its might.

It is this supplanting of the ideal of what is right by the ideal of what is beautiful, i.e. of what is pleasant, that is the fourth consequence, and a terrible one, of the perversion of art in our society. It is fearful to think of what would befall humanity were such art to spread among the masses of the people. And it already begins to spread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=tolstoy%20redbeard&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q=fittest&amp;f=false What is art?] Leo Tolstoy&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[S. E. Parker]] wrote: "''Might Is Right'' is a work flawed by major contradictions." He particularly criticised the inconsistency of the book's central dogma of [[individualism]] with its open sexism and racism. However, he concluded that "it is sustained by a crude vigor that at its most coherent can help to clear away not a few of the religious, moral and political superstitions bequeathed to us by our ancestors."&lt;ref name="parker"/&gt;

==Influence==
Portions of ''Might Is Right'' comprise the vast majority of ''The Book of Satan'' in [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', the founding document of the [[Church of Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Eugene V.|authorlink=Eugene V.

Petersen|chapter=Sources, Sects, and Scripture: The Book of Satan in The Satanic Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is no longer included in current printings of ''The Satanic Bible'', early printings included an extensive dedication to various people whom LaVey recognized as influences, including Ragnar Redbeard.&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton Szandor (1969).

The '''NIlamata Purana''' (नीलमत पुराण) is an ancient text (6th to 8th century AD) from [[Kashmir]] which contains information on its history, geography, religion, and folklore.&lt;ref name="Kumari1968"&gt;{{citation |last=Kumari |first=Ved |title=The Nīlamata purāṇa, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sJHAAAAMAAJ |year=1968 |publisher=J. &amp; K. Academy of Art, Culture and Languages; &amp;#91;sole distributors: Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used by [[Kalhana]] as one of sources of his history.

== Date ==
The dating of the text to 6th to 8th century AD is based on the following reasoning: "The textual study of the work shows that some alterations and additions have been made in it after the ninth or tenth century A.D. in order to incorporate into it the monistic Saiva Philosophy of Kasmira. Had the Nilamata been composed after the ninth century A.D. there would have been no scope for such change. The lower limit of the date thus may be eighth century A. D. and the upper one about the sixth century A.D. as Buddha began to be regarded as an incarnation of Visnu from about 550 A.D."&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite web |last=Ghai |first=Ved Kumari |url=http://www.koausa.org/Glimpses/NilmataPurana.html |title=Nilmata Purana: A Brief Survey |publisher=Shri Parmanand Research Institute, Srinagar |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Ved Kumari Ghai: "If the [[Rajatarangini]] is important from the point of view of the political history of 'Kasmira', the Nilamata is no less important for the cultural history of that part of the country." Its critical edition was published in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Ved Kumari Ghai, [https://archive.org/details/nilamatapurana Nilamata Purana], 1972 (on archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the [[national epic]] of Kashmir&lt;ref name=ikashmir&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ikashmir.net/nilmatapurana/ |title=Nilmata Purana |publisher=Ikashmir.net |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Rajatarangini]] encompassing modern day regions of modern day [[India]], [[Pakistan]] [[Afghanistan]], [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Dardic people|Modern Dardic regions]] of world.

==Summary of the contents==

The Nilamata opens with Janamejaya's enquiry from Vaisampayana as to why the king of [[Kashmir]] did not participate in the war of Mababharata although his kingdom was not less important than any other in the country. Vaisampayana states that some time before the Mababharata war was fought, king Gonanda of Kashmir had been invited by his relative Jarasandha to help him in a war against the yadavas. Gonanda complied with his request and was slain on the battle field by [[Lord Krishna]]'s brother, [[Balarama]]. In order to avenge his father's death, Gonanda's son Damodara went to Gandhara to fight with lord Krishna who had gone there to attend a Svayamvara. Krishna killed Damodara in the fight but taking into consideration the high sanctity of Kashmir he coronated his rival's pregnant widow Yasovati. Damodara's Posthumous son Bala Gonanda was a minor at the time of the great war, so he did not join either the Kauravas or the Pandavas.
Vaismpayana points out the importance of Kashmir by referring to its numerous charms and its identification with Uma. He points out further that the valley was originally a lake known as Satisaras. This leads to the question about the origin of 'Kashmir' to which Vaisanipayana replies by relating a dialogue held previously between Gonanda and the sage Brahadasva.

Brahadasva gives at first the account of the divisions of time, the destruction of the world at the end of manvantara, the presevation of Manu and the seeds in a ship, the birth of the land and the lake, of Sati, the origin of various tribes from Kasyapa and Visnu's allottment of Satisaras to the Nagas. Then follows the story of the demon Jalodbbava born in the waters and reared by the Nagas. Having obtained boons from Brahma, the demon began to destroy the descendants of Manu dwelling in the lands of Darvabhisara, Gandbars Jubundura, the Sakas, the Khasas etc. Seeing this devastation, Nila the king of the Nagas approached his father Kasyapa and prayed to him to intercede with the gods to punish the evil-doer and to save the innocent victims. He requested the gods, Brahma, Visnu and Siva to do the needful. Visnu followed by Brahma, Siva and various other deities, proceeded to Naubandhana to punish the demon. The demon was imperishable in the waters; so Visnu asked Ananta to make an outlet for the waters by breaking forth the mountain-barriers. He did accordingly. Visnu then cut off the demon's head with his disc. Now the dry land being available in the valley, Kasyapa expressed the desire that it should be inhabited by the Nagas as well as by the descendants of Manu. The Nagas, however, flatly refused to have Manavas as their co-hahitants. Filled with rage Kasyapa cursed them to live with the Pisacas. At the request of Nila the curse was modified to the extent that the Pisacas would go every year for a period of six months to the sea of sand and the Manavas would live in the land jointly with the Nagas during that period. Visnu further assured the Nagas that the occupation of Kasmira valley by the Pisacas would last for four ages only.

After the passing away of the four ages, the Manavas, as usual, had gone out for six months. An old Brahmana, Candradeva did not accompany them. Troubled by the Pisacas he approached the Naga King Nila and begged of him to ordain that 'Kasmira' might henceforth be inhabited by Manavas without the fear of emigration. Nila complied with this request on the condition that the Manavas should follow his instructions revealed to him by Kesava. Candradeva lived for six months in the palace of Nila and was initiated into the mysteries of rites or ceremonies prescribed by Nila. In Caitra, when the emigrant population of 'Kasmira' came back, he related the whole incident to Virodaya - king of Manavas. The lengthy dialogue held between Nila and Candradeva describes sixty five rites. ceremonies and festivals many of which are similar to those mentioned in other Puranic works and observed in many parts of India, while a few are peculiar to Kasmira only. At Janamejaya's enquiry as to what Gonanda had asked after listening to the teachings, another dialogue between Gonanda and Brhadasva follows. Gonanda expresses his desire to know the names of the principal Nagas dwelling in Kasmira and Brahadasva enumerates not fewer than Sir hundred Nigas. He expresses his inability to enumerate all the Nagas, as their number was too great. He further refers to four Nagas, the guardians of directions and relates the story of the Naga Sadangula and the Naga Mahapadma.

==Sacred places==

Then follows Gonanda's enquiry about the sacred places of Kasmira and Brhadasva's reply referring to various places dedicated to Siva and other deities. Two names Bhutesvara and Kapatesvara raise Gonanda's curiosity which leads Brhadasva to relate Bhutesvara Mahatmya and Kapatesvara Mahatmya. Then follows the enumeration of the sacred places of Visnu and other tirthas situated in the valley of Kasmira. Thereafter is given the eulogy of the river Vitasta and the work ends with the remark that, as this treatise in the form of a dialogue between [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]] and [[Vaisampayana]] was not useful everywhere (i. e. was of local interest mainly), Vyasa did not include it in the Mahabharata lest that should become too exhaustive.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;

In [[Georg Bühler|Georg Buhler]]’s words it is a real mine of information regarding the sacred places of Kashmir and legends which are required to explain the Rajatrangini. It is a valuable source of the cultural political life of ancient Kashmir. such as the legend of Satisar lake, the battle between Kasyapa and Nagas and other mythical accounts with the historical names of Gonanda and Queen Yasomati. This legend of lake is also found it [[Kalhana]]’s Rajatarangini in the Mahavamsa, the Chinese vinaya of the Mula Sarvastivadin sect and in travels of Hiuen Tsang.&lt;ref name=ikashmir/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kashmirasitis.com/female-status-in-kashmir |title=Females in Kashmir - POSITION &amp; STATUS |publisher=Kashmirasitis.com |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;

A '''noun particle''' is any [[morpheme]] that denotes or marks the presence of a [[noun]].  Noun particles do not exist in [[English language|English]], but can be found in other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. &lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Arabic has object and topic particles as well; someone knowledgeable in Arabic should add something below. -Roehl Sybing --&gt;

==Korean particles==
&lt;!-- The following section is based on the Korean reference found on Wikibooks, as I have very little experience with Korean.  Romanization - as well as clarifications/corrections - is most certainly encouraged and requested. -RS --&gt;
{{Main|Korean language}}
Korean particles are [[postposition]]s, which differ from English [[preposition]]s in that they come ''after'' the word they mark.
*'''Example #1:''' {{lang|ko|새가 지붕 '''위에''' 있어요.}} (There's a bird '''on''' the roof.)
The particle "{{lang|ko|위에}}" is used to mean "on" or "above." It follows the word "{{lang|ko|지붕}}" ("roof").
*'''Example #2:''' {{lang|ko|도서관이 시장 옆에 있어요.}} (The library is '''next to''' the market.)
The particle "{{lang|ko|옆에}}" means "next to," and it follows "{{lang|ko|시장}}" ("market").

==Japanese particles==
{{Main|Japanese grammar}}

Just as in Korean, noun particles follow the noun being marked, and can serve any of several functions in a given sentence.
*'''Example #1:''' {{lang|ja|昨日スーパーへ行きました。}} (Yesterday, I went '''to''' the supermarket.)
**Kinoo suupaa '''e''' ikimashita.
In this example, "e" is the noun particle for "suupaa" ("supermarket").  This particular noun particle denotes direction towards a place, being "supermarket."

*'''Example #2:''' {{lang|ja|昼ごはんは私がピザを食べた。}} (I ate pizza for lunch. '''lit.''' '''As for''' lunch, I ate pizza.)
**Hirugohan '''wa''' watashi '''ga''' piza '''o''' tabeta.
The three noun particles ("wa," "ga," and "o") all serve different functions:
* "wa" - ''topic marker'' ("hirugohan" - lunch)
* "ga" - ''subject marker'' ("watashi" - I)
* "o" - ''object marker'' ("piza" - pizza)

'''Nunivak Cup'ig''' or just '''Cup'ig''' (own name '''Cugtun''') is a language or separate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/etudinuit/2006/v30/n1/016154ar.html Steven A. Jacobson (2006), ''The participial oblique, a verb mood found only in Nunivak Central Alaskan Yup'ik and in Siberian Yupik''], ÉTUDES/INUIT/STUDIES, 2006, 30(1): 135-156 &lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;(= Nunivak Island has the most divergent dialect of Central Alaskan Yup'ik Eskimo, the language of southwestern Alaska)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; dialect of [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]] spoken in Central [[Alaska]] at the [[Nunivak Island]] by [[Nunivak Cup'ig people]] (own name '''Cup'it''' or '''Nuniwarmiut'''). The letter "'''c'''" in the Yup’ik alphabet is equivalent to the English alphabet "'''ch'''".

The Central Alaskan Yupik who live on [[Nunivak Island]] (''Nuniwar'' in Nunivak Cup'ig, ''Nunivaaq'' in [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Yup'ik]]) call themselves ''Cup'ig'' (plural ''Cup'it''). Those who live in the village of [[Chevak, Alaska|Chevak]] call themselves ''[[Chevak Cup’ik language|Cup'ik]]'' (plural ''Cup'it''). The name '''Cup'ig''' (with g) is used for the Nunivak Island Yup'ik dialect and the name '''Cup'ik''' (with k) is used for Hooper Bay-Chevak Yup'ik dialect.

The Cup'ig dialect is threatened. This fact was documented by Dr. [[Michael E. Krauss]] of the [[Alaska Native Language Center]] at the [[University of Alaska]] and is illustrated on the map. In 1975, Krauss indicated, "Some of the children speak the language".&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, Michael E. (1975). ''Native peoples and languages of Alaska''. [Map]. Fairbanks, AK: Alaska Native Language Center, University of Alaska.&lt;/ref&gt; Krauss documented continued decline and downgraded the status to "Very few or none of the children speak the language"&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, Michael E. (1982). ''Native peoples and languages of Alaska''. [Map]. Fairbanks, AK: Alaska Native Language Center, University of Alaska.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982.

Today Cup'ig is spoken by elders in the village of [[Mekoryuk, Alaska|Mekoryuk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lksd.org/AcademicSite/HTML/index.html Lower Kuskokwim School District]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''overview''' in [[policy debate]] is part of a [[structure of policy debate|speech]] which is flagged as not responding to the line-by-line arguments on the [[flow (policy debate)|flow]]. An overview may be "global" if presented at the beginning of a speech or "local" if presented at the beginning of a position.

Overviews typically list the order a debater's speech will be given in. For instance, On-Case, Co-op Disadvantage, Spending Disadvantage, Weapon Disadvantage would be an expected overview.

Debaters will usually inform the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] where they will be giving an overview before they start a speech because it can make it harder to flow the speech. A small minority of judges dislike this practice and will start speech time when a debater starts giving this order.

Many judges dislike overviews because, since many are scripted before the round begins, they tend to be non-responsive or repetitive and are often long. However, most judges and coaches support the practice for arguments which cannot be placed anywhere on the line-by-line or that need to be flagged for their importance.

The above is also informally known as a "road map"

Another form of an overview is of specifically in the section of the speech(i.e. [[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]], [[Kritik]], Disadvantage, Counter-Plan, etc). This is commonly announced before the debater's speech and will signpost an overview.

The overview usually consists of star/main arguments being made and more than likely tend to contain extended evidence or authors. This practice is used to elaborate an argument and/or bring it back up in order for the judge to be aware of the main arguments being made by a team.

The '''Piraeus Lion''' ({{lang-it|Leone del Pireo}}; {{lang-sv|Pireuslejonet}}); is one of four [[lion]] statues on display at the [[Venetian Arsenal]], where it was displayed as a symbol of Venice's patron saint, [[Saint Mark]].

== History ==
It was originally located in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of [[Athens]]. It was looted by Venetian naval commander [[Francesco Morosini]] in 1687 as [[plunder]] taken in the [[Great Turkish War]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], during which the Venetians [[Siege of the Acropolis (1687)|captured Athens]] and Morosini's cannons caused damage to the [[Parthenon]] only matched by his subsequent looting.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Athens, The Acropolis, p.6/20, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the statue can also be seen at the [[Piraeus Archaeological Museum]] and the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in [[Stockholm]].

The lion was originally sculpted in about 360 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Vermeule, "Greek Funerary Animals, 450-300 B. C.", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''76''':1:49-59 (January 1972), {{jstor|503610}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and became a famous landmark in Piraeus, having stood there since the 1st or 2nd century AD. Its prominence was such that the port eventually became referred to in Italian as Porto Leone ("Lion Port") as the port's original name ceased to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Goette, Hans Rupprecht (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRHY3zWyrcEC Athens, Attica and the Megarid: An Archaeological Guide]''. [[Routledge]]. p. 141. {{ISBN|0-415-24370-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is depicted in a sitting pose, with a hollow throat and the mark of a pipe (now lost) running down its back; this suggests that it was originally used as a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Henry (1833). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1K_TIaJxo8EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The British Museum. Elgin and Phigaleian Marbles]''. [[British Museum]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the description of the statue from the 1670s, which said that water flowed from the lion's mouth into a cistern at its feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jarring |first=Gunnar |authorlink= |title=Evliya Celebi och Marmorlejonet från Pireus |journal=[[Fornvännen]] |volume=85 |pages=1–4 |publisher=[[Swedish National Heritage Board]] |year=1978 |url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1970talet/1978_001.pdf |issn=1404-9430 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue, which is made of white [[marble]] and stands some 3&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft.) high, is particularly noteworthy for having been defaced some time in the second half of the 11th century by Scandinavians who carved two lengthy [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions into the shoulders and flanks of the lion.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. D. Kendrick|Kendrick, Thomas D.]] (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8NgXgRytUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A History of the Vikings]''. Courier Dover Publications. p. 176. {{ISBN|0-486-43396-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The runes are carved in the shape of an elaborate [[lindworm]] dragon-headed [[scroll]], in much the same style as on [[runestone]]s in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=BussLion&gt;"The Book of THoTH (Leaves of Wisdom) — Dragon" (notes), URL: [http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon BT-Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325220622/http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon |date=25 March 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvers of the runes were almost certainly [[Varangians]], Scandinavian mercenaries in the service of the [[Byzantine Emperor | Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor]].

== Inscriptions and translations ==
[[File:Pireuslejonet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Piraeus Lion drawing of curved [[lindworm]] inscription (shoulder/flank).]]
[[File:6003 - Venezia - Arsenale - Scritta runica su leone greco (1040) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 3-Aug-2007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Photo of inscription on right flank of lion (with contrast exaggerated to make inscription more visible).]]
[[File:Lion runes drawing.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing of the same inscription.]]
The inscriptions were not recognised as runes until the Swedish diplomat [[Johan David Åkerblad]] identified them at the end of the 18th century. They are in the shape of a [[lindworm]] (a flightless dragon with serpentine body and two or no legs) and were first translated in the mid-19th century by [[Carl Christian Rafn]], the Secretary of the Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab (Royal Society of Nordic Antiquaries).&lt;ref name="Rafn"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rafn |first=Carl Christian  |authorlink=Carl Christian Rafn |contribution=En Nordisk Runeindskrift i Piræus, med Forklaring af C. C. Rafn |title=Antiquarisk Tidsskrift: Udgivet af det Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab 1855-57 |publisher= |year=1857 |location= |pages=3–69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7khBAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions are heavily eroded due to weathering and air pollution in [[Venice]], making many of the individual runes barely legible. This has required translators to reconstruct some of the runes, filling in the blanks to determine what words they represented.

There have been several attempts to decipher and translate the text. Below follow Rafn's early attempt (1854) and Eric Brate's attempt (1914), which is considered to be the most successful one.&lt;ref name="Pritsak348"&gt;[[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak, Omeljan]]. (1981). ''The Origin of Rus'.'' Cambridge, Mass.: Distributed by Harvard University Press for the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute. p. 348. {{ISBN|0-674-64465-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rafn's translation ==
Rafn's attempt is as follows, with the legible letters shown in bold and the reconstructed ones unbolded:&lt;ref&gt;A. Craig Gibson, "Runic Inscriptions: Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian", in ''Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire'', p. 130. Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafn, Carl Christian (1856). "Inscription runique du Pirée -  Runeindskrift i Piraeeus", Impr. de Thiele&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have tried to trace [[Harald Hardrade]]'s name on the inscription, but the time it was carved does not coincide with his time in the service of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Ian (1985). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aEyQe18JWvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Vikings]'' Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|0-85045-565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Erik Brate's translation ==
[[Erik Brate]]'s interpretation from 1914 is considered to be the most successful one.&lt;ref name="Pritsak348"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Prague|Timeline of Prague}}
[[File:Josef Mathauser - Kněžna Libuše věští slávu Prahy.jpg|thumb|The mythological princess [[Libuše]] prophesies the glory of Prague.]]

During the thousand years of its existence, the city grew from a settlement stretching from [[Prague Castle]] in the north to the fort of [[Vyšehrad]] in the south, becoming the capital of a modern European country, the Czech Republic, a member state of the European Union.

===Early history===
[[File:Praga 0003.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Prague astronomical clock]] was first installed in 1410, making it the third-oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest one still working.]]The region was settled as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age.&lt;ref name="Demetz1997" /&gt; A Jewish chronicler [[David Gans|David Solomon Ganz]], citing [[Cyriacus Spangenberg]], claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in c. 1306 BC by an ancient king, Boyya.&lt;ref name=ganz /&gt;

Around the fifth and fourth century BC, a [[Celts]] tribe appeared in the area, later establishing settlements including an [[oppidum]] in Závist, a present-day suburb of Prague, and naming the region of Bohemia, which means "home of the Boii people".&lt;ref name="Demetz1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Demetz|first=Peter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/demetz-prague.html|title=Prague in Black and Gold: Scenes from the Life of a European City|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8090-7843-1|chapter=Chapter One: Libussa, or Versions of Origin|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bohemiaradio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/unearthing-bohemias-celtic-heritage-ahead-of-samhain-the-new-year | title = Unearthing Bohemia's Celtic heritage ahead of Samhain, the 'New Year' | last = Kenety | first = Brian | date = | website =  | publisher = Czech Radio | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last century BC, the Celts were slowly driven away by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] ([[Marcomanni]], [[Quadi]], [[Lombards]] and possibly the [[Suebi]]), leading some to place the seat of the [[Marcomanni]] king, [[Maroboduus]], in southern Prague in the suburb now called Závist.&lt;ref name="marobudradio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rozhlas.cz/leonardo/historie/_zprava/202797| title = Atlantis české archeologie | last = Kenety | first = Brian | date = | website =  | publisher = Czech Radio | access-date = | quote = | language = Czech }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ganz"&gt;Dovid Solomon Ganz, Tzemach Dovid (3rd edition), part 2, Warsaw 1878, pp. 71, 85 ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=72&amp;hilite= available online] )&lt;/ref&gt; Around the area where present-day Prague stands, the 2nd century map drawn by [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaios]] mentioned a Germanic city called ''Casurgis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs-magazin.com/index.php?a=a2011021048|title=Praha byla Casurgis|trans-title=Prague was Casurgis|language=cs|publisher=cs-magazin.com|date=February 2011|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 5th century AD, during the great [[Migration Period]] following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the [[West Slavs|Slavic tribes]] (Venedi) settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the [[Czechs|Czech tribes]] built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the [[Divoká Šárka|Šárka valley]], [[Jinonice|Butovice]] and [[Levý Hradec]].&lt;ref name="Demetz1997" /&gt;

The construction of what came to be known as [[Prague Castle]] began near the end of the 9th century, growing  a fortified settlement that already existed on the site since the year 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/kultura/24807-slovane-na-hrade-zili-uz-sto-let-pred-borivojem.html |title=Slované na Hradě žili už sto let před Bořivojem&amp;nbsp;– |publisher=[[Novinky.cz]] |accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first masonry under Prague Castle dates from the year 885 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/history/archaeological-research.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401033615/http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/history/archaeological-research.shtml |archivedate=1 April 2009 |title=Archaeological Research&amp;nbsp;– Prague Castle |publisher=Hrad.cz |date=8 July 2005 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other prominent Prague fort, the Přemyslid fort [[Vyšehrad]], was founded in the 10th century, some 70 years later than Prague Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguewelcome.cz/en/visit/monuments/top-monuments/65-vysehrad.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312091714/http://www.praguewelcome.cz/en/visit/monuments/top-monuments/65-vysehrad.shtml |archivedate=12 March 2013 |title=TOP MONUMENTS – VYŠEHRAD |publisher=praguewelcome.cz |accessdate=14 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prague Castle is dominated by the [[St. Vitus Cathedral|cathedral]], which began construction in 1344, but wasn't completed until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/gothic-buildings-prague|title=5 of the Best Gothic Buildings in Prague {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th century Czech duchess and prophetess [[Libuše]] and her husband, [[Přemysl, the Ploughman|Přemysl]], founder of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. Legend says that Libuše came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied: "I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars." She ordered a castle and a town called Praha to be built on the site.&lt;ref name="Demetz1997" /&gt;

The region became the seat of the [[duke]]s, and later [[King of Bohemia|kings of Bohemia]]. Under Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] the area became a [[Diocese|bishopric]] in 973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FeFACISbhCgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=bishopric+prague#v=onepage&amp;q=archbishopric&amp;f=false|title=Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands|last=Wolverton|first=Lisa|date=2012-10-09|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0812204223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until Prague was elevated to [[archbishopric]] in 1344, it was under the jurisdiction of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radio.cz/en/section/travel-tip/prague-an-architectural-gem-in-the-heart-of-europe|title=Prague – an architectural gem in the heart of Europe {{!}} Radio Prague|work=Radio Praha|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prague was an important seat for trading where merchants from all of Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the [[Al-Andalus|Hispano-Jewish]] merchant and traveller [[Abraham ben Jacob|Ibrahim ibn Ya'qub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hx2xBWN3hX0C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Ibrahim+ibn+Ya'qub+prague+jew+965#v=onepage&amp;q=Ibrahim%20ibn%20Ya'qub%20prague%20jew%20965&amp;f=false|title=The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia: Facing the Holocaust|last=Rothkirchen|first=Livia|date=2006-01-01|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803205024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old New Synagogue]] of 1270 still stands in the city.

At the site of the ford in the Vltava river, King [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus I]] had the first bridge built in 1170, the Judith Bridge (Juditin most), named in honour of his wife [[Judith of Thuringia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radio.cz/en/static/charles-bridge/history|title=History of Charles Bridge {{!}} Radio Prague|work=Radio Praha|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1342, but some of the original foundation stones of that bridge remain in the river. It was rebuilt and named the Charles Bridge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1257, under King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]], [[Malá Strana]] ("Lesser Quarter") was founded in Prague on the site of an older village in what would become the [[Hradčany]] (Prague Castle) area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UhkCBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT337&amp;lpg=PT337&amp;dq=king+ottokar+Mal%C3%A1+Strana+1257#v=onepage&amp;q=king%20ottokar%20Mal%C3%A1%20Strana%201257&amp;f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Prague|last=Guides|first=Rough|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=9780241196311}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the district of the German people, who had the right to administer the law autonomously, pursuant to [[Magdeburg rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bBFwIGv2qMEC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=Magdeburg+rights+Mal%C3%A1+Strana#v=onepage&amp;q=Magdeburg%20rights%20Mal%C3%A1%20Strana&amp;f=false|title=The West European City: A Geographical Interpretation|last=Dickinson|first=Robert E.|date=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415177115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new district was on the bank opposite of the [[Old Town (Prague)|Staré Město]] ("Old Town"), which had [[borough]] status and was bordered by a line of walls and fortifications.

===The era of Charles IV===
[[File:CZ-Prag-hrad-koenigsp-kronjuw.jpg|thumb|The [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]] are the fourth oldest in Europe]]
Prague flourished during the 14th-century reign (1346–1378) of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and the king of [[Bohemia]] of the new [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg dynasty]]. As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed Prague into an imperial capital and it was at that time by the area the third-largest city in Europe (after Rome and [[Constantinople]]).

He ordered the building of the [[New Town, Prague|New Town]] (Nové Město) adjacent to the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31&amp;nbsp;am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the [[palindromic number]] 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as the best time for starting the bridge construction.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Andrew. ''A Hedonist's Guide to New York''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1347, he founded [[Charles University]], which remains the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest university]] in Central Europe.

[[File:St Vitus Prague September 2016-30b.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[St. Vitus Cathedral]] at [[Prague Castle]]]]
He began construction of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. Vitus Cathedral|Saint Vitus Cathedral]], within the largest of the Prague Castle courtyards, on the site of the Romanesque rotunda there. Prague was elevated to an archbishopric in 1344, the year the cathedral was begun.

The city had a [[mint (coin)|mint]] and was a centre of trade for German and Italian bankers and merchants. The social order, however, became more turbulent due to the rising power of the [[Artisan|craftsmen]]'s [[guild]]s (themselves often torn by internal fights), and the increasing number of poor people.

The Hunger Wall, a substantial fortification wall south of Malá Strana and the Castle area, was built during a famine in the 1360s. The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.

Charles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] (1378–1419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the Prague clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer) and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack and burn the Jewish quarter. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Prague (3,000 people) perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.org/title/The%2520Prague%2520Pogrom%2520of%25201389 |publisher=Everything2 |title=The Prague Pogrom of 1389 |date=April 1389 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prague.cz/jewish-quarter/ |publisher=prague.cz |title=The former Jewish Quarter in Prague |date=April 1389 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prague banner c1477.png|upright=0.7|thumb|Depiction of the "Prague Banner" (municipal flag dated to the 16th century)&lt;ref&gt;
This swallow-tailed banner is approximately {{convert|4|by|6|ft|m|abbr=off}}, with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the centre. The words ''PÁN BŮH POMOC NAŠE'' (The Lord God is our Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite "host with chalice" centred on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent shaped golden sun with rays protruding.
One of these banners was captured by Swedish troops in [[Battle of Prague (1648)]], when they captured the western bank of the Vltava river and were repulsed from the eastern bank, they placed it in the Royal Military Museum in [[Stockholm]]; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition.

[[Jan Hus]], a theologian and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at the Charles University, preached in Prague. In 1402, he began giving sermons in the [[Bethlehem Chapel]]. Inspired by [[John Wycliffe]], these sermons focused on what were seen as radical reforms of a corrupt Church. Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the [[Council of Constance]], put on trial for [[heresy]], and burned at the stake in [[Constanz]] in 1415.

Four years later Prague experienced its [[Defenestrations of Prague|first defenestration]], when the people rebelled under the command of the Prague priest [[Jan Želivský]]. Hus' death, coupled with Czech proto-nationalism and [[proto-Protestantism]], had spurred the [[Hussite Wars]]. Peasant rebels, led by the general [[Jan Žižka]], along with Hussite troops from Prague, defeated Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], in the [[Battle of Vítkov Hill]] in 1420.

During the [[Hussite Wars]] when the City of Prague was attacked by "Crusader" and mercenary forces, the city militia fought bravely under the Prague Banner. This swallow-tailed banner is approximately {{convert|4|by|6|ft|m|abbr=off}}, with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the centre. The words "PÁN BŮH POMOC NAŠE" (The Lord is our Relief) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite chalice centred on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent shaped golden sun with rays protruding.

One of these banners was captured by Swedish troops in [[Battle of Prague (1648)]], when they captured the western bank of the Vltava river and were repulsed from the eastern bank, they placed it in the Royal Military Museum in [[Stockholm]]; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the [[Codex Gigas]] and the [[Codex Argenteus]]. The earliest evidence indicates that a gonfalon with a municipal charge painted on it was used for Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.

In the following two centuries, Prague strengthened its role as a merchant city. Many noteworthy Gothic buildings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.hrad.cz/castle/architektura/gotika_uk.html |title=Architecture of the Gothic |publisher=Old.hrad.cz |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/photogallery/prague-castle/9.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401061009/http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/photogallery/prague-castle/9.shtml |archivedate=1 April 2009 |title=Old Royal Palace with Vladislav Hall – Prague Castle |publisher=Hrad.cz |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=18 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were erected and Vladislav Hall of the Prague Castle was added.

===Habsburg era===
[[File:Bohemiae Moraviae et Silesiae (Merian) 102.jpg|thumb|Prague panorama in 1650]]

In 1526, the Bohemian estates elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Habsburg]]. The fervent Catholicism of its members was to bring them into conflict in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prague.st/city-info/static/eng/czech-history/religious-conflicts.php |title=Religious conflicts |publisher=Prague.st |date= |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems were not pre-eminent under Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in the Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover too, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], the painter [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Arcimboldo]], the alchemists [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], the poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], and others.

In 1618, the famous [[Defenestrations of Prague|second defenestration of Prague]] provoked the [[Thirty Years' War]], a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]; however his army was crushed in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) not far from the city. Following this in 1621 was an execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exiling of many others. Prague was forcibly converted back to [[Roman Catholicism]] followed by the rest of Czech lands. The city suffered subsequently during the war under an attack by [[Electoral Saxony]] (1631) and during the [[Battle of Prague (1648)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.family-lines.cz/html/Articles/30-war.htm |title=The Kingdom of Bohemia during the Thirty Years' War |publisher=Family-lines.cz |accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prague began a steady decline which reduced the population from the 60,000 it had had in the years before the war to 20,000. In the second half of the 17th century Prague's population began to grow again. [[History of the Jews in the Czech Republic|Jews]] had been in Prague since the end of the 10th century and, by 1708, they accounted for about a quarter of Prague's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Prague.html |title=Prague |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frantisek Palacky monument.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to [[František Palacký]], a significant member of the [[Czech National Revival]]]]

In 1689, a great fire devastated Prague, but this spurred a renovation and a rebuilding of the city. In 1713–14, a major outbreak of [[plague (disease)|plague]] hit Prague one last time, killing 12,000 to 13,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;M. Signoli, D. Chevé, A. Pascal (2007).''"[https://books.google.com/books?id=3u3rNCWtv0MC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Plague epidemics in Czech countries]"''. p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1744, [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia invaded Bohemia. He took Prague after a severe and prolonged siege in the course of which a large part of the town was destroyed.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Prague|volume=22|pages=248–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757 the [[Prussia]]n bombardment&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; destroyed more than one quarter of the city and heavily damaged St. Vitus Cathedral. However a month later, Frederick the Great was defeated and forced to retreat from Bohemia.

The economy of the city continued to improve during the 18th century. The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and [[Music from Eighteenth-Century Prague|music]], creating a [[Baroque]] city renowned throughout the world to this day.

In 1784, under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the four municipalities of Malá Strana, Nové Město, Staré Město, and Hradčany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called [[Josefov]], was included only in 1850. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had a strong effect in Prague, as factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby region. A first suburb, [[Karlín]], was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.

[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutions in Europe in 1848]] also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years the [[Czech National Revival]] began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. Prague had a German-speaking majority in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase of the city's overall population caused by the influx of [[Czechs]] from the rest of Bohemia and [[Moravia]] and also due to return of social status importance of the Czech language.

===20th century===

====First Czechoslovak Republic====
{{Main|First Czechoslovak Republic}}
World War I ended with the defeat of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the creation of Czechoslovakia. Prague was chosen as its capital and Prague Castle as the seat of president [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]]. At this time Prague was a true European capital with highly developed industry. By 1930, the population had risen to 850,000.

====Second World War====
[[File:Prague liberation 1945 konev.jpg|thumb|Prague liberated by [[Red Army]] in May 1945]]
{{further|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}
[[Hitler]] ordered the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] to enter Prague on 15 March 1939, and from Prague Castle proclaimed [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate]]. For most of its history, Prague had been a multi-ethnic city&lt;ref name=TOT1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlas-europa.de/t04/bevoelkerung/europ_staedte/pdf/BevStaedte-Tabelle_dt.pdf |title=Einwohnerzahl europäischer Städte |quote=Prag insgesamt 1940 928.000|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; with important Czech, German and (mostly native German-speaking) Jewish populations.&lt;ref name=JEW1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jüdische-gemeinden.de/index.php/gemeinden/p-r/1593-prag|title=Aus der Geschichte jüdischer Gemeinden|quote=1937/38 ca. 45.000|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1939, when the country was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]], and during the [[Second World War]], most Jews were [[Holocaust|deported and killed]] by the Germans. In 1942, Prague was witness to the assassination of one of the most powerful men in [[Nazi Germany]]—[[Reinhard Heydrich]]—during [[Operation Anthropoid]], accomplished by Czechoslovak national heroes [[Jozef Gabčík]] and [[Jan Kubiš]]. Hitler ordered bloody reprisals.

In February 1945, [[1945 Bombing of Prague|Prague suffered several bombing raids]] by the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]]. 701 people were killed, more than 1,000 people were injured and some buildings, factories and historical landmarks  ([[Emmaus Monastery]], [[Faust House (Prague)|Faust House]], [[Vinohrady Synagogue]]) were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Bombing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/40592-looking-back-at-the-bombing-of-prague.html|title=Looking Back at the Bombing of Prague |website= [[The Prague Post]] |date=14 February 1945 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historic structures in Prague, however, escaped the destruction of the war and the damage was small compared to the total destruction of many other cities in that time. According to American pilots, it was the result of a navigational mistake. In March, a deliberate raid targeted military factories in Prague, killing about 370 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The bombing of Prague from a new perspective |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czech-history/the-bombing-of-prague-from-a-new-perspective |publisher=Radio Prague |accessdate=10 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 1945, two days before Germany capitulated, an [[Prague uprising|uprising]] against Germany occurred. Several thousand Czechs were killed in four days of bloody street fighting, with many atrocities committed by both sides. At daybreak on 9 May, the [[3rd Shock Army]] of the [[Red Army]] took the city almost unopposed. The majority (about 50,000 people) of the German population of Prague either fled or were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] by the [[Beneš decrees]] in the aftermath of the war.

====Cold War====
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)}}
[[File:Havla 1989.jpg|thumb|[[Velvet Revolution]] in November 1989]]

Prague was a city in the territory of military and political control of the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Iron Curtain]]). The largest [[Stalin Monument (Prague)|Stalin Monument]] was unveiled on [[Letná]] hill in 1955 and destroyed in 1962. The 4th Czechoslovak Writers' Congress held in the city in June 1967 took a strong position against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pehe|first1=Jiří|title=Post-Communist Refections of the Prague Spring|url=http://www.pehe.cz/Members/redaktor/post-communist-refections-of-the-prague-spring|website=Jiří Pehe}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 October 1967 students demonstrated at [[Strahov (district of Prague)|Strahov]]. This spurred the new secretary of the [[Communist Party]], [[Alexander Dubček]], to proclaim a new deal in his city's and country's life, starting the short-lived season of the "socialism with a human face". It was the [[Prague Spring]], which aimed at the renovation of institutions in a democratic way. The other [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries, except [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], reacted with the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] of Czechoslovakia and the capital on 21 August 1968 by tanks, suppressing any attempt at reform.
[[Jan Palach]] and [[Jan Zajíc]] committed suicide by [[self-immolation]] in January and February 1969 to protest against the "normalization" of the country.

===After Velvet Revolution===
[[File:Mrakodrapy v Praze 2018.jpg|thumb|Prague high-rise buildings at [[Pankrác]]]]
In 1989, after the riot police beat back a peaceful student demonstration, the [[Velvet Revolution]] crowded the streets of Prague, and the [[Czechoslovak]] capital benefited greatly from the new mood. In 1993, after the split of Czechoslovakia, Prague became the capital city of the new Czech Republic. From 1995 high-rise buildings began to be built in Prague in large quantities. In the late 1990s, Prague again became an important cultural centre of Europe and was notably influenced by [[globalisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McAdams |first1=Michael |title=Global Cities as Centers of Cultural Influence: A Focus on Istanbul, Turkey |url=https://journals.openedition.org/transtexts/149 |work=Transtext(e)s Transcultures |date=1 September 2007 |pages=151–165 |doi=10.4000/transtexts.149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] summit took place in Prague and [[Anti-globalization protests in Prague|anti-globalization riots]] took place here. In 2002, Prague suffered from [[2002 European floods|widespread floods]] that damaged buildings and its underground transport system.

==Name==
{{see also|Names of European cities in different languages: M-P#P|l1=Names in different languages}}
[[File:Vltava in Prague.jpg|thumb|Bridges over the River Vltava, as seen from Letná]]

The Czech name Praha is derived from an old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word, ''práh'', which means "[[ford (crossing)|ford]]" or "[[rapid]]", referring to the city's origin at a crossing point of the Vltava river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praguesummer.com/whats-in-a-name-prague-history-lesson/|title=What's in a name? Prague History lesson|last=|first=|date=|website=praguesummer.com|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same etymology is associated with the [[Praga|Praga district of Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy S. Dawidowicz&amp;nbsp;– ''The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe'' 1996 p. 351 "Then you surely knew also Reb Shmuel on the other side of the Vistula, in Praga! Praga, the threshold of Warsaw—the aroma of the country, with its broad fields, so many times desolated by wars and fires and rebuilt, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view to the origin of name is also related to the Czech word ''práh'' (in the mean of a [[Threshold (door)|threshold]]) and a legendary etymology connects the name of the city with princess [[Libuše]], prophetess and a wife of mythical founder of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. She is said to have ordered the city ''"to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house"''. The Czech ''práh'' might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river&amp;nbsp;– thus providing a "threshold" to the castle.

Another derivation of the name ''Praha'' is suggested from ''na prazě'', the original term for the [[shale]] hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city&amp;nbsp;– the [[Old Town, Prague|Old Town]] on the opposite side of the river, as well as the [[Lesser Town]] beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The English spelling of the city's name is borrowed from [[French language|French]]. Prague is also called the ''"City of a Hundred [[Spire]]s"'', based on a count by 19th century mathematician [[Bernard Bolzano]], today's count is estimated by Prague Information Service at 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kolik-vezi-ma-stovezata-praha-nadsenci-jich-napocitali-pres-pet-set-1fv-/domaci.aspx?c=A100805_115917_praha-zpravy_sfo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514204127/http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kolik-vezi-ma-stovezata-praha-nadsenci-jich-napocitali-pres-pet-set-1fv-/domaci.aspx?c=A100805_115917_praha-zpravy_sfo |archivedate=14 May 2013 |title=Kolik věží má "stověžatá" Praha?

===Climate===
[[File:Prague SPOT 1030.jpg|thumb|Prague seen from [[SPOT (satellite)|satellite]]]]
Prague has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). The winters are relatively cold with average temperatures at about freezing point, and with very little sunshine. Snow cover can be common between mid-November and late March although snow accumulations of more than 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8&amp;nbsp;in) are infrequent. There are also a few periods of mild temperatures in winter. Summers usually bring plenty of sunshine and the average high temperature of {{convert|24|°C|0}}. Nights can be quite cool even in summer, though. Precipitation in Prague (and most of the Bohemian lowland) is rather low (just over {{convert|20|in|mm|-2|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=sqbr}} per year) since it is located in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sudetes]] and other mountain ranges. The driest season is usually winter while late spring and summer can bring quite heavy rain, especially in form of thundershowers. [[Inversion (meteorology)|Temperature inversions]] are relatively common between mid-October and mid-March bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of {{convert|16|kph|mph|abbr=on}} that often help break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold months.

==Administration==
===Administrative division===
[[File:Prague districts en.svg|thumb|Map of Prague cadastral and administratice districts]]
Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since November 24, 1990, it is de facto again a statutory town, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemia Region. 

Until 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. Cadastral area (for example, [[Vinohrady]], [[Smíchov]]) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering. 

Prague is composed of 112 cadastral territories of different size, character and importance. The city also consists of 22 administrative districts (1-22).

===City government===
Prague is governed by the [[Prague City Assembly]] that is elected in municipal elections. Current [[Mayor of Prague]] is [[Czech Pirate Party]] member [[Zdeněk Hřib]], since the [[Prague municipal election, 2018|2018 municipal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zdeněk Hřib se stal primátorem Prahy.

[[File:Nábřeží Kapitána Jaroše, budova Galileo.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] system in Prague's [[Holešovice]]]]

The region city of Prague is an important centre of research. It is the seat of 39 out of 54 institutes of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Czech Academy of Sciences]], including the largest ones, the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Microbiology and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry. It is also a seat of 10 public research institutes, four [[business incubator]]s and large hospitals performing [[research and development]] activities such as the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague or the Motol University Hospital. Universities seated in Prague (see section ''Colleges and Universities'') also represent important centres of science and research activities.

{{As of|2008}}, there were 13,000 researchers (out of 30,000 in the Czech Republic, counted in full-time equivalent), representing 3% share of Prague's economically active population. Gross expenditure on research and development accounted for €901.3&amp;nbsp;million (41.5% of country's total).&lt;ref&gt;J.

==Transport==

===Public transportation===
[[File:Prague 07-2016 tram at Florenc.jpg|thumb|[[Škoda 15 T]], tram of the [[Trams in Prague|Prague tram system]]]]

The public transport infrastructure (PID, ''Pražská integrovaná doprava'') consists of a heavily used [[Prague Integrated Transport]] of [[Prague Metro]] (lines [[line A (Prague Metro)|A]], [[line B (Prague Metro)|B]], and [[line C (Prague Metro)|C]] – its length is {{convert|65|km|0|abbr=on}} with 61 stations in total), [[Trams in Prague|Prague tram system]], [[Buses in Prague|Prague buses]], [[Esko Prague|commuter S-trains]], [[funicular]]s, and six [[Ferry|ferries]]. Prague has one of the highest rates of public transport usage in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Endurance|url=http://www.epomm.eu/endurance/index.php?id=2809&amp;city=454|publisher=Mgr. Jaroslav Mach|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1.2 billion passenger journeys per year. Prague has about 130 bus lines (numbers 100–299) and 22 tram lines (numbers 1–26). There are also three funiculars, one on [[Petřín Hill]], one on Mrázovka Hill and a third at the [[Prague Zoo|Zoo in Troja]].
[[File:Prague - bus 112.jpg|left|thumb|[[SOR NB 18]] of the [[Buses in Prague|Prague bus service]]]]
[[Trams in Prague|The Prague tram system]] now operates various types of trams: still popular classic [[Tatra T3]], newer [[Tatra KT8D5]], [[Tatra T6A5|T6A5]], [[Škoda 14 T]] (designed by [[Porsche Design Group|Porsche]]), newest modern [[Škoda 15 T]] and nostalgic tram lines 23 and 41. Around 400 vehicles are the modernized [[Tatra T3|T3]] class, which are typically operated coupled together in pairs.

The Prague tram system is the [[Tram and light rail transit systems|twelfth longest]] in the world (142&amp;nbsp;km) and its rolling stock consists of 857 individual cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pražská MHD loni přepravila o 9,6 procent více cestujících. Využila ji více než miliarda lidí |url=https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/ekonomika/prazske-mhd-loni-prepravilo-o-9-6-procent-vice-cestujicich-v/r~aea5fd16035b11e794440025900fea04/?redirected=1532945371 |work=Aktuálně.cz |date=7 March 2017 |language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the third largest in the world behind [[Trams in Moscow|Moscow]] and [[Trams in Budapest|Budapest]]. The system carries more than 360 million passengers annually, the highest tram patronage in the world after [[Budapest]], on a per capita basis, Prague has the second highest tram patronage after [[Zürich]].

All services (metro, tramways, city buses, funiculars and ferries) have a common ticketing system that operates on a [[proof-of-payment]] system. Basic transfer ticket can be bought for a 30/90-minute ride, short-term tourist passes are available for periods of 24 hours or 3 days, longer-term tickets can be bought on the smart ticketing system [[Lítačka]] card, for periods of one month, three months or one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpp.cz/jizdne-na-uzemi-prahy/ |title=Jízdné na území Prahy |publisher=Dopravní podnik hlavnívo města Prahy |language=Czech |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services are run by the Prague Public Transport Company (Dopravní podnik hl. m. Prahy, a. s.) and several other companies. Recently, the ''Regional Organiser of Prague Integrated Transport (ROPID)'' has franchised operation of ferries on the [[Vltava]] river, which are also a part of the public transport system with common fares. [[Taxicab|Taxi]] services make pick-ups on the streets or operate from regulated taxi stands.

The [[Rapid transit|Metro]] has three major lines extending throughout the city: A (green), B (yellow) and C (red). A fourth Metro line is planned, which would connect the city centre to southern parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prague Metro, Czech Republic|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/prague_metro/|publisher=railwaytechnology.com|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prague Metro system served 589.2 million passengers in 2012,&lt;ref name="annual-report-2012"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.dpp.cz/download-file/6145/annual_report_2012_en.pdf|title=Annual Report 2012|publisher=Public Transport Company of the Capital City of Prague|date=2012|page=66|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of metro systems|fifth busiest metro system in Europe]] and the most-patronised in the world on a per capita basis. The first section of the Prague metro was put into operation in 1974. It was the stretch between stations [[Kačerov]] and [[Florenc (Prague Metro)|Florenc]] on the current [[line C (Prague Metro)|line C]]. The first part of [[line A (Prague Metro)|Line A]] was opened in 1978 ([[Dejvická]] – [[Náměstí Míru]]), the first part of [[line B (Prague Metro)|line B]] in 1985 ([[Anděl (Prague Metro)|Anděl]] – [[Florenc (Prague Metro)|Florenc]]).

In April 2015, construction finished to extend the green line A further into the northwest corner of Prague closer to the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hold|first=Gabriella|title=Metro Extension on the Right Track|url=http://www.praguepost.com/news/4900-metro-extension-on-right-track.html|website=The Prague Post|location=Czech Republic|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=30 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114111627/http://www.praguepost.com/news/4900-metro-extension-on-right-track.html|archivedate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new interchange station for the bus in the direction of the airport is now the station [[Nádraží Veleslavín (Prague Metro)|Nádraží Veleslavín]]. The final station of the green line is [[Nemocnice Motol]] (Motol Hospital), giving people direct public transportation access to the largest medical facility in the Czech Republic and one of the largest in Europe. A railway connection to the airport is planned.

In operation there are currently two kinds of units: "[[81-71M]]" which is modernized variant of the Soviet [[Metrovagonmash 81-717/81-714|Metrovagonmash 81-71]] (completely modernized between 1995 and 2003) and new "[[Metro M1 (Prague)|Metro M1]]" trains (since 2000), manufactured by consortium consisting of [[Siemens]], [[ČKD (company)|ČKD Praha]] and [[ADtranz]]. The minimum interval between two trains is 90 seconds.

The original Soviet vehicles "[[Metrovagonmash Ečs|Ečs]]" were excluded in 1997, but one vehicle is placed in public transport museum in depot [[Střešovice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://metroweb.cz/metro/Ecs/Ecs.htm |title=Historická souprava Ečs |publisher=Metroweb.cz |date= |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Náměstí Míru]] metro station is the deepest station and is equipped with the longest [[escalator]] in [[European Union]]. The [[Prague metro]] is generally considered very safe.

===Roads===
[[File:Barrande bridge.JPG|thumb|[[Barrandov Bridge]], part of the City (inner) Ring Road]]
The main flow of traffic leads through the centre of the city and through inner and outer ring roads (partially in operation).

* '''Inner Ring Road''' (The City Ring "MO"): Once completed it will surround the wider central part of the city. The longest city [[tunnel]] in [[Europe]] with a length of {{convert|5.5|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} and five interchanges has been completed to relieve congestion in the north-western part of Prague. Called ''[[Blanka tunnel complex]]'' and part of the City Ring Road, it was estimated to eventually cost&amp;nbsp;– after several increases&amp;nbsp;– 43&amp;nbsp;billion [[Czech koruna|CZK]]. Construction started in 2007 and, after repeated delays, the tunnel was officially opened in September 2015. This tunnel complex completes a major part of the inner ring road. It is expected that the whole city ring will not be completed before 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dostavba zbývající části Pražského okruhu má začít do roku 2020|url=http://praha.e15.cz/praha/novinky/dostavba-zbyvajici-casti-prazskeho-okruhu-ma-zacit-do-roku-2020-1319683|website=e15.cz|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[D0 expressway (Czech Republic)|Outer Ring Road]] (The Prague Ring "D0"):''' This ring road will connect all major motorways and speedways that meet each other in Prague region and provide faster transit without a necessity to drive through the city. So far {{convert|39|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, out of a total planned {{convert|83|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, is in operation. The year of full completion is unknown due to incompetent, constantly changing, leadership of Czech Road and Motorway Directorate, lack of administrative preparations, and insufficient funding of road constructions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Most recently, the southern part of this road (with a length of more than {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}) was opened on 22 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening of Prague's Outer Ring (Czech only) |url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/klaus-bem-a-barta-strihli-a-otevreli-prazsky-okruh-mytne-se-plati-phs-/domaci.aspx?c=A100920_081710_domaci_jw |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926194912/http://zpravy.idnes.cz/klaus-bem-a-barta-strihli-a-otevreli-prazsky-okruh-mytne-se-plati-phs-/domaci.aspx?c=A100920_081710_domaci_jw |archivedate=26 September 2011 |accessdate=18 Dec 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual conference [[Forum 2000]], which was founded by former Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Japanese philanthropist [[Yōhei Sasakawa]], and Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Elie Wiesel]] in 1996, is held in Prague. Its main objective is "to identify the key issues facing civilization and to explore ways to prevent the escalation of conflicts that have religion, culture or ethnicity as their primary components", and also intends to promote democracy in non-democratic countries and to support civil society. Conferences have attracted a number of prominent thinkers, Nobel laureates, former and acting politicians, business leaders and other individuals like: [[F. W. de Klerk|Frederik Willem de Klerk]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Nicholas Winton]], [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]], [[Dalai Lama]], [[Hans Küng]], [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Madeleine Albright]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">'''Sananmuunnos''' ("Word transformation"), sometimes '''kääntösana''', is a sort of verbal play in the [[Finnish language]], similar to [[spoonerism]]s in [[English language|English]].  

Special to Finnish is a narrow phoneme inventory and [[vowel harmony]]. As Finnish is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-divided language, it is morae that are exchanged, not syllables (often a mora is also a syllable in a Finnish word, but not always). Also, Finnish [[inflectional morphology|inflectional]] and [[derivational morphology]] is extensive, thus applying a suffix from another word often produces a valid word. This leads to large number of possible spoonerisms. Much of practical ''sananmuunnos'' wordplay revolves around obscene [[double entendre]] expressed by spoonerism.

Several books have been written. Some have whole stories with multiple puns in one sentence, for example. Most have a "vocabulary" in the back, usually a hundred or more word pairs long.

== Processes ==
Initial [[mora (linguistics)|morae]] of two adjacent words are exchanged, which is spoonerism by definition.
:[[Johannes Virolainen]] (name of a former leading politician) → Vihannes Jorolainen (''vihannes'' 'vegetable', ''Jorolainen'' an ordinary surname)
:Mikkelin kittaajat ('chuggers of [[Mikkeli]]', a town in Finland) → kikkelin mittaajat ('measurers of [[Penis|weenie]]')

The "extra length" of a [[long vowel]] is a full mora, and thus stays in its original position, making the new vowel long.
:sanan m&lt;u&gt;uu&lt;/u&gt;nnos [sa-nan mu-&amp;#720;nnos] → [mu-nan sa-&amp;#720;nnos] → munan s&lt;u&gt;aa&lt;/u&gt;nnos

If necessary, stilted [[diphthong]]s are converted into allowed diphthongs as per [[phonotactics]]. The first vowel is the determinant for choosing the diphthong. The process preserves opening and closing diphthongs, e.g. the opening 'ie' is reflected as an opening 'uo'. 
:vieno huntti [vi-eno hu-ntti] → [h&lt;u&gt;u-e&lt;/u&gt;no vi-ntti] → h&lt;u&gt;uo&lt;/u&gt;no vintti

If necessary, [[vowel harmony]] is applied. As per vowel harmony, the initial syllable controls the kind of vowel selected.
:häipyvät tavut [hä-ipyvät ta-vut] → [ta-ipyvät hä-vut] → taipuvat hävyt
That is, transformation is A, U, O into Ä, Y, Ö, if the former do not begin the word. Notice that information may be lost in this step, making it irreversible.

== Exceptions ==

It is possible (although not accepted by some "orthodox") to exchange only the initial consonants, if  that is the only way to get a sensible result. E.g. palasokeri [p-ala/s-okeri] 'sugar lump' → salapokeri [s-ala/p-okeri] 'playing poker in secret' (*solapakeri would not mean anything).

Typically presented, spoonerisms are a kind of [[double entendre]]. Appropriately, the very term ''sananmuunnos'' is one; it becomes ''munansaannos'', which can be understood as "small yield of [[penis]]".

'''Scottish art''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in what is now Scotland, or about Scottish subjects, since prehistoric times. It forms a distinctive tradition within European art, but the political union with England has led its partial subsumation in [[British art]].

The earliest examples of art from what is now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the [[Neolithic]] period. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]]. More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the [[Iron Age]]. Elaborately carved [[Pictish stone]]s and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages. The development of a common style of [[Insular art]] across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]]. Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin. The influence of the [[Renaissance]] can be seen in stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty. [[Scottish Reformation|The Reformation]] removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display, but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms, particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls. Although the loss of the court as a result of the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed another major source of patronage, the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant, with figures such as [[George Jamesone]] and [[John Michael Wright]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the eighteenth century Scotland began to produce artists that were significant internationally, all influenced by [[neoclassicism]], such as [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] and [[Alexander Runciman]], [[Jacob More]] and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]]. Towards the end of the century [[Romanticism]] began to influence artistic production, and can be seen in the portraits of artists such as [[Henry Raeburn]]. It also contributed to a tradition of Scottish landscape painting that focused on the [[Highlands]], formulated by figures including [[Alexander Nasmyth]]. The [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] was created in 1826, and major portrait painters of this period included [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]. [[William Dyce]] emerged as one of the most significant figures in art education in the United Kingdom. The beginnings of a [[Celtic Revival]] can be seen in the late nineteenth century and the art scene was dominated by the work of the [[Glasgow Boys]] and the Four, led [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who gained an international reputation for their combination of Celtic revival, [[Arts and Crafts movement|Art and Crafts]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. The early twentieth century was dominated by the [[Scottish Colourists]] and [[the Edinburgh School]]. [[Modernism]] enjoyed popularity during this period, with [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] helping to develop the concept of a [[Scottish Renaissance]]. In the post-war period, major artists, including [[John Bellany]] and Alexander Moffat, pursued a strand of "Scottish realism". Moffat's influence can be seen in the work of the "new Glasgow Boys" from the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century Scotland has continued to produce successful and influential artists such as [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Susan Philipsz]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Scotland possess significant collections of art, such as the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh and the [[Burrell Collection]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] in Glasgow. Significant schools of art include the [[Edinburgh College of Art]] and the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. The major funding body with responsibility for the arts in Scotland is [[Creative Scotland]]. Support is also given by local councils and independent foundations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The oldest known examples of art to survive from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late [[Neolithic]] era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name="Towie"&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D. N. Marshall, "Carved Stone Balls", ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 108, (1976/77), pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions.&lt;ref name=Towie/&gt; Their production may have continued into the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are extensive examples of [[rock art]]. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are believed to be the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Childe, ''The Prehistory Of Scotland'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]], four distinct linguistic and political groupings existed in what is now Scotland, each of which produced distinct material cultures. In the east were the [[Picts]], whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the [[River Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[Dál Riata]], who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of "[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (later the northern part of [[Northumbria]]), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[File:Stirling Head King James V.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Stirling Heads]] showing [[James V of Scotland|James V]]]]
Beginning in the fifteenth century, a number of works were produced in Scotland by artists imported from the continent, particularly the [[Netherlands]], generally considered the centre of painting in the [[Northern Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]];&lt;ref name="Webster1997pp127-9"/&gt; the images of St Catherine and St John brought to [[Dunkeld]]; and [[Hugo van Der Goes]]'s altarpiece for the [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church in Edinburgh]], commissioned by [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and the work after which the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] is named.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the prayer book commissioned by [[Robert Blackadder]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]], between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; and the Flemish illustrated [[book of hours]], known as the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]], given by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Margaret Tudor]] and described by D. H. Caldwell as "perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use".&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Caldwell, ed., ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Records also indicate that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|tapestries]], such as those that depicted scenes from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' set up for James IV at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]].&lt;ref name="Glendinningetal1996p14"&gt;M.

At [[Stirling Castle]], stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] are taken from German patterns,&lt;ref&gt;C. McKean, ''The Scottish Chateau'' (Stroud: Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0-7509-3527-8}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and like the surviving carved oak portrait [[Boss (architecture)|roundels]] from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Reformation===
{{Main article|Art in early modern Scotland|Portrait painting in Scotland}}
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
During the sixteenth century, Scotland underwent a [[Protestant Reformation]] that created a predominantly Calvinist national [[Church of Scotland]] (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Protestant [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.&lt;ref&gt;N. Prior, ''Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture'' (Oxford: Berg, 2002), {{ISBN|1859735088}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A self-portrait by George Jamesone.jpeg|thumb|left|Self portrait of [[George Jamesone]] (1642)]]
The loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at [[Prestongrange]], undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at [[Pinkie House]], painted for [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seaton]], Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but began to flourish after the Reformation. There were anonymous portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell (1556) and George, fifth Earl of Seaton (c. 1570s).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt;

The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and trained the Baroque artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94).&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in Devine and Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included "drawing pictures of our [the Monarch's] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of our houses and palaces". However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a [[sinecure]] held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'', vol. 7 "The Crown", para 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, such as the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153/&gt; The painters [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84), [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98), the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] (1744–68/9) and [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–85), [[Jacob More]] (1740–93) and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland, and were to varying degree influenced by forms of [[Neoclassicism]]. The influence of Italy was particularly significant, with over fifty Scottish artists and architects known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mFt2S33o8G8C&amp;pg=PT376&amp;dq=scottish+artists+italy&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=KQipT-rINemP4gTboeyOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=scottish%20artists%20italy&amp;f=false ''Scotland: A History''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-19-162243-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gavin Hamilton studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] and in Rome, and after a brief stay in London, primarily painting portraits of the British aristocracy, he returned to Rome for the rest of his life. He emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', as well as acting as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as painters of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where John died in 1768/9. Alexander returned home to gain a reputation as a landscape and portrait painter. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological.&lt;ref name="Chilvers2009p554"&gt;I.

He produced historical and mythical scenes before moving to England, where he pursued portraiture. He then returned to Edinburgh in 1780, became director and master of the [[Academy of Arts]] in 1786. Here he produced his most famous work, with illustrations of themes from Scottish life, earning him the title of "the Scottish Hogarth".&lt;ref name="Houghton2003pp34-5"&gt;''The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography'' (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003), {{ISBN|0-618-25210-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romanticism====
{{See also|Romanticism in Scotland|Scottish genre art}}
Scotland played a major part in the origins of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] through the publication of [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in [[German language|German]] literature, influencing [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p554/&gt;&lt;ref name=Houghton2003pp34-5/&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name="Withers2001pp151-3"&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced before his departure to Italy, Jacob More's series of four paintings "Falls of Clyde" (1771–73) have been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as treating the waterfalls as "a kind of natural national monument" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3/&gt; Alexander Runciman was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in watercolours in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasmyth Alexander Highland Loch.jpg|thumb|right|''Highland Loch Landscape'' by [[Alexander Nasmyth]]]]
The effect of Romanticism can also be seen in the works of late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century artists including [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823), [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). Raeburn was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786. He is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the tradition of Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Ochterbeck, ed., ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'' (London: Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), {{ISBN|1-906261-08-3}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name="Campbell2003pp142-3"&gt;D. Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'' (Oxford: Signal Books, 2003), {{ISBN|1-902669-73-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasmyth visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Knox continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of Scott&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-6806-1}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;D.

====Painting====
[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Skating Minister|The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch]], traditionally attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823)]]
[[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters, with Wilkie succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823. Geddes produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Wilkie and Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Geddes, Andrew |volume=11 |pages=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie worked mainly in London, and was most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life, including ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' in 1822 and for his flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in [[Highland dress]] commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. After a tour of Europe he was more influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', pp.&amp;nbsp;678–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed [[lithograph]] prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Jones, eds, ''Arab and Islamic Studies'' (American Univ in Cairo Press, 1997), {{ISBN|9774244028}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name="Szasz200p136"&gt;F.

This was helped by [[Queen Victoria]]'s declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat. In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw.&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009p27"&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes, specialising in snowscapes and sheep, and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life.&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136/&gt; In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter. He has been compared with [[John Constable]] and described as the "Scottish Impressionist", with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p376&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]] in Fife,&lt;ref&gt;P.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Alexander &amp; Bucephalus by John Steell.JPG|thumb|right|Alexander and Bucephalus by [[John Steell]] (1832)]]
In the early decades of the century, sculpture commissions in Scotland were often given to English artists. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790 – 1858) and [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) undertook work in Scotland, but worked for much of their careers in London and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 90–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' (1832). His 1832 design for a statue of [[Walter Scott]] was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patrick Park (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] to the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside. Public sculpture was boosted by the anniversary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in [[Leith]]. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for [[Dundee]], London and [[Dunedin]]. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early photography====
{{Main article|Scottish photography}}
[[File:His Faither’s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|'His Faither's Breeks', by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]]]]
In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]] played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–48), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name="Burn2011"&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable [[photogravure]] process.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important figures included [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0486267504}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington Wilson]] (1823–93), who pioneered [[instant photography]]&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and [[Clementina Hawarden]] (1822–65), whose posed portraits were among the first in a tradition of female photography.&lt;ref&gt;G. Clarke, ''The Photograph'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0192842005}}, pp. 51–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence of the Pre-Raphaelites====
{{See also|Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood}}
[[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806–49) most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 205–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[William Dyce]] [[Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (1858–60?)]]
The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail, but puts the biblical subjects in a distinctly Scottish landscape, against the Pre-Raphaelite precept of truth in all things. His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as "the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyce became head of the School of Design in Edinburgh, and was then invited to London, to head the newly established Government School of Design, later to become the [[Royal College of Art]], where his ideas formed the basis of the system of training and he was highly involved in the national organisation of art.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p209&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855).&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millias was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823–1904) and whose work included ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R.

====Arts and Crafts and the Celtic Revival====
{{See also|Arts and Crafts movement|Celtic Revival}}
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: the People's Designer – 1834–1904'' (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reptilian Fabric.jpg|thumb|left|Textile pattern by [[Christopher Dresser]] (1887)]]
The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a [[Celtic Revival]], similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p170"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding. The most significant exponent was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6/&gt; Duncan was a major contributor to Geddes' magazine ''The Evergreen''. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced [[Robert Burns (artist)|Robert Burns]] (1860–1941), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 156–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

====Glasgow School====
{{Main article|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Frances Macdonald, Sleeping Princess.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Sleeping Princess'', by [[Frances Macdonald]] (1909)]]
For the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the [[Glasgow Boys]], including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943) and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E.

Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly represented by the Royal Academy, were often influenced by French painting and incorporated elements of [[impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|realism]], and have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art, making Glasgow a major cultural centre.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly later grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Colourists====
{{Main article|Scottish Colourists}}
The next significant group of artists to emerge were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and all looked to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575/&gt;

[[File:Cursiter, The Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stanley Cursiter]] ''The Regatta'' (1913)]]
Patrick Geddes coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance, arguing that technological development needed to paralleled in the arts. This ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art and the creation of a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including J. D. Fergusson, [[Stanley Cursiter]] (1887–1976), [[William McCance]] (1894–1970) and [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] (1897–1981).&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"/&gt; Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings such as ''Damaged Destroyer'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], as can be seen in his ''Rain on Princess Street'' (1913) and ''Regatta'' (1913).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; McCance's early work was in a bold post-impressionist style, but after World War I it became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in ''Women on an Elevator'' (1925) and ''The Engineer and his Wife'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 348–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone studied cubism, surrealism and new American art. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century".&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p173"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, [http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/review-painters-in-parallel-william-johnstone-william-gillies-1-2063707 "Review: Painters in Parallel: William Johnstone &amp; William Gillies"], ''Scotsman.com'', 19 January 2012, retrieved 8 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] (1907–98) and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]] (1904–49).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]] and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's ''Traquair House'' (1938) and more overtly in Baird's ''The Birth of Venus'' (1934). Before his success in painting McIntosh Patrick first gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included [[William Wilson (artist)|William Wilson]] (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Scottish Group====
{{Main article|New Scottish Group}}
[[File:JD Fergusson, People and Sails.jpg|thumb|left|[[J. D. Fergusson]], ''People and Sails'' (1910)]]
The longest surviving member of the Scottish Colourists, J. D. Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th Century, 1890–2001'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2001), {{ISBN|1840184574}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), who was influenced by [[expressionism]]. William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918–90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] [[Gauguin]]. Isabel Babianska (born 1920), was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]]. Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and Bet Low (born 1924), who with painter William Senior (born 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's ''Transport Depot'' (1944–45) and Bet Low's ''Blochairn Steelworks'' (c. 1946).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1/&gt;{{clear}}

Notable post-war artists included [[Robin Philipson]] (1916–92), who was influenced by the Colourists, but also [[Pop Art]] and [[neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert MacBryde]] (1913–66), [[Robert Colquhoun]] (1914–64) and [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the landscapes of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential St Ives School were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]] (b. 1912–2004), [[Margaret Mellis]] (b. 1914–2009).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris continued to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with [[William Gear]] (1916–97) and [[Stephen Gilbert]] (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Also a visitor to Paris was [[Alan Davie]] (born 1920),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; who was influenced by jazz and [[Zen Buddhism]] and moved further into [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]'s (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially [[concrete poetry]]) and [[landscape architecture]]. His most ambitious work, the garden of [[Little Sparta]] opened in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=K.

===Scottish Realism and the Glasgow Pups===
[[File:"The Big Heids" - geograph.org.uk - 617712.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Mach]]'s ''Big Heids'', Lanarkshire, a tribute to the steel industry]]
[[John Bellany]] (1942–2013), mainly focusing on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (born 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, both grouped under the description of "Scottish realism", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Richardson, ''Scottish Art Since 1960: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Overviews'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7546-6124-5}}, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists associated with Moffat and the [[Glasgow School of Art]] who came to prominence in the 1980s are sometimes known as the "new Glasgow Boys", or "Glasgow pups"&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255/&gt; and included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]] (1953–2007), [[Peter Howson]] (born 1958), [[Ken Currie]] (born 1960) and Adrian Wiszniewski (born 1958). Their [[Figurative art|figurative]] work has a comic book-like quality and puts an emphasis on social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;D. Reid, ''The Rough Guide to Edinburgh'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|1-85828-887-8}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Wiszniewski's [[post-modernism|post-modern]] painting adopts a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employs figures reminiscent characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his ''Young Men in Search of Simplicity'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011"&gt;D. Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Currie has revived historical painting devoted to the socialist history of Glasgow in a series of paintings for the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] in 1987. Currie also approached the problems of historical painting through his series of prints ''The Saracen Heads'' (1988).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011p406&gt;Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary sculpture===
While sculptors [[Eric Schilsky]] (1898–1974) and [[Hew Lorimer]] (1907–93) worked in the existing tradition of modelling and carving,&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; sculptor and artist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world.&lt;ref name="Roseetal2012p25"&gt;L.

Crow, ''Frommer's Scotland'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 12th edn., 2012), {{ISBN|1-119-99276-1}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Wyllie]] (1921–2012), produced works of social and political commentary including the ''Straw Locomotive'' (1987), an event which raised questions about the decline of heavy industry and the nature of colonialism.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2000p202"&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
New sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation among a new generation of sculptors that incorporated aspects of modernism, including Jake Harvey (born 1948), Doug Cocker (born 1945), Ainslie Yule (born 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940–2012).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; In contrast [[Sandy Stoddart]] (born 1959) works primarily on "nationalist" figurative sculpture in clay within the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical tradition]]. He is best known for his civic monuments, including {{convert|10|ft|m}} bronze statues of the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Clive Aslet, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3556356/Alexander-Stoddart-talking-statues.html "Alexander Stoddart: talking statues"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', retrieved 12 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photographic renaissance===
{{Main article|Scottish photography}}
[[File:sandy smith object moved edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The first room of the installation ''The Object Moved by its Own Success'', by [[Sandy Smith]] and [[Alex Gross]] (2008)]]
In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85) who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977 and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Contemporary artists===
Since the 1990s, the most commercially successful artist has been [[Jack Vettriano]] (born 1951), whose work usually consists of figure compositions, with his most famous painting ''[[The Singing Butler]]'' (1992), often cited as the best selling print in Britain. However, he has received little acclaim from critics.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p657&gt;Chilvers ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists emerging from Glasgow and Dundee include [[David Mach]] (born 1960), working in the medium of [[installation art]],&lt;ref&gt;P.

Scotland has had schools of art since the eighteenth century, many of which continue to exist in different forms today. [[Edinburgh College of Art]] developed from the Trustees Academy founded in the city in 1760 and was established in 1907. After a long independent history, in 2011 it became part of the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8523596/Edinburgh-College-of-Art-guide.html ''Edinburgh College of Art guide''], ''The Telegraph'', 20 June 2011, retrieved 8 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow School of Art]] grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">A '''sentinel event''' is defined by American healthcare accreditation organization The [[Joint Commission]] (TJC) as any unanticipated event in a healthcare setting resulting in death or serious physical or psychological injury to a patient or patients, not related to the natural course of the patient's illness. Sentinel events specifically include loss of a limb or gross motor function, and any event for which a recurrence would carry a risk of a serious adverse outcome. Sentinel events are identified under TJC accreditation policies to help aid in [[root cause analysis]] and to assist in development of preventative measures.  The Joint Commission tracks events in a database to ensure events are adequately analyzed and undesirable trends or decreases in performance are caught early and mitigated.

==Specific events requiring review==
Sentinel events include "unexpected occurrences involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof" and all of the following, even if the outcome was not death or major permanent loss of function:
* Infant [[Child abduction|abduction]], or discharge to the wrong family.
* Unexpected [[Infant mortality|death of a full-term infant]].
* Severe [[neonatal jaundice]] (bilirubin over 30 milligrams/deciliter).
* Surgery on the wrong individual or wrong body part.
* [[Retained surgical instruments|Instrument or object left in a patient after surgery]] or another procedure.
* [[Rape]] in an acute-care setting.
* [[Suicide]] in an acute-care setting, or within 72 hours of discharge.
* Hemolytic [[blood transfusion|transfusion]] reaction due to blood group incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;A fatal tranfusion reaction must be reported within 7 days.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Radiation therapy]] to the wrong body region or 25% above the planned dose.

In addition to the list above, The Joint Commission requires each accredited organization to define sentinel events for its own care system and put into place monitoring procedures to detect these events and a procedure for root cause analysis.

}}

==Actions and reporting==
Participation is necessary by the leadership of TJC accredited healthcare organizations and by the persons closely involved in the systems under review. Causal factors are analyzed, focusing on systems and processes, not individual performance. Potential improvements, called an "action plan", are identified and implemented to decrease the likelihood of such events in the future. Each accredited organization is encouraged, but not required, to report any sentinel event to The Joint Commission. However, the organization is expected to prepare a root cause analysis and action plan within 45 calendar days of the event.  In addition, healthcare organizations are required to notify the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and device manufacturers within 10 days of a sentinel event caused by a medical device, according to the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990.  Statistics of sentinel events are recorded and published by the FDA's [[MedWatch]] program.

Advantages of reporting sentinel events to The Joint Commission are:
*Adding to the database with dissemination to other health care facilities, preventing other adverse events.
*Consultation with The Joint Commission on implementing the root cause analysis and action plan.
*Association with national accrediting body reassures the public that all steps are being taken to prevent a recurrence.

==Joint Commission actions==
After review of the accredited facility's report on the sentinel event, The Joint Commission issues an Official Accreditation Decision Report that may modify the organization's current accreditation status, assign an appropriate "measure of success", or a require follow-up survey within six months. A healthcare facility that fails to complete a root cause analysis of the sentinel event and action plan within the time frame can be placed on "Accreditation Watch" by the Joint Commission, a status that can be publicly disclosed . The Joint Commission disseminates "sentinel event alerts" identifying specific sentinel events, their underlying causes, and steps to prevent recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations: [http://www.jointcommission.org/SentinelEvents/SentinelEventAlert/ Sentinel Event Alerts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further nursing research is ongoing at a number of 'magnet' hospitals in the United States, especially to reduce the number of patient falls that may lead to sentinel events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sigmund Freud]]]]
'''Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality''' have been described as deterministic, whereas he would ascribe biological and psychological factors in explaining the principal causes of [[homosexuality]]. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] believed that humans are born with [[Polymorphous perversity|unfocused sexual libidinal drives]], and therefore argued that homosexuality might be a deviation from this. Nevertheless, he also felt that certain deeply rooted forms of homosexuality were difficult or impossible to change.

==Overview==
Freud's most important articles on homosexuality were written between 1905, when he published ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'', and 1922, when he published "Certain Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia, and Homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that all humans were bisexual, by which he primarily meant that everyone incorporates aspects of both sexes, and that everyone is sexually attracted to both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also mentally and psychologically. Heterosexuality and homosexuality both developed from this original bisexual disposition.&lt;ref name="Ruse"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruse|1988|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the causes of homosexuality, Freud mentions the distressing heterosexual experience: "Those cases are of particular interest in which the libido changes over to an inverted sexual object after a distressing experience with a normal one."&lt;ref name="3essays"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1905|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud appears to have been undecided whether or not homosexuality was [[pathological]], expressing different views on this issue at different times and places in his work. Freud frequently called homosexuality an "inversion", something which in his view was distinct from the necessarily pathological perversions, and suggested that several distinct kinds might exist, cautioning that his conclusions about it were based on a small and not necessarily representative sample of patients.&lt;ref name="Lewes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexuality" /&gt;

Freud derived much of his information on homosexuality from psychiatrists and sexologists such as [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], and was also influenced by [[Eugen Steinach]], a [[Vienna|Viennese]] endocrinologist who transplanted [[testicle]]s from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation. Freud stated that Steinach's research had "thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of [[homoeroticism]]",&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexualityP58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cautioned that it was premature to expect that the operations he performed would make possible a therapy that could be generally applied. In his view, such transplant operations would be effective in changing sexual orientation only in cases in which homosexuality was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of the opposite sex, and probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism.&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexuality"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeVay1996" /&gt; In fact Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the [[immune system]]s of his patients rejected the transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful.&lt;ref name="LeVay1996"&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female homosexuality==
Freud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the 1920 paper "The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman," which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a [[lesbian]]. Her father hoped that psychoanalysis would cure her lesbianism, but in Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which the woman entered therapy, and because the homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud wrote that changing homosexuality was difficult and therefore possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that "in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse."&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesIIP376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success meant making heterosexual feeling possible rather than eliminating homosexual feelings.&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on attempts to change homosexuality==
Freud believed that homosexuals could seldom be convinced that sex with someone of the opposite sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from sex with someone of the same sex. Patients often had only superficial reasons to want to become heterosexual, pursuing treatment due to [[Minority stress|social disapproval]], which was not a strong enough motive for change. Some patients might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only so that they could convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality afterwards. Freud, therefore, told the parents only that he was prepared to study their daughter to determine what effects therapy might have. Freud concluded that he was probably dealing with a case of biologically innate homosexuality, and eventually broke off the treatment because of what he saw as his patient's hostility to men.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OconnorandRyan"&gt;{{Harvnb|O’Connor|Ryan|1993|pp=30–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935 letter===
In 1935, Freud wrote to a mother who had asked him to treat her son's homosexuality, a letter that would later become famous:&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;

{{quote|I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual. I am most impressed by the fact that you do not mention this term yourself in your information about him. May I question you why you avoid it? Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them. (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime&amp;nbsp;–and a cruelty, too. If you do not believe me, read the books of [[Havelock Ellis]].
By asking me if I can help [your son], you mean, I suppose, if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place. The answer is, in a general way we cannot promise to achieve it. In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies, which are present in every homosexual; in the majority of cases it is no more possible. It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual. The result of treatment cannot be predicted.

What analysis can do for your son runs in a different line. If he is unhappy, neurotic, torn by conflicts, inhibited in his social life, analysis may bring him harmony, peace of mind, full efficiency, whether he remains homosexual or gets changed.&lt;ref name="ErnstLFreud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''So''' is a word that may be used to end sentences. When ending a sentence, it may be:
* a [[coordinating conjunctive]] to refer backwards to something previously mentioned
* a coordinating conjunctive dangling "so" (sometimes called trailing "so")&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt; [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/so-what/402316/ So What? What it means when people leave the word “so” dangling at the end of a sentence] ''[[The Atlantic]]'' Julie Beck 26 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to refer forwards to something that may be said
* an [[Intensifier|intensifying]] [[adverb]].

==Referring back==
"So" may be used to refer back to something previously mentioned, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/so Oxford Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "If she notices, she never says so."
* Speaker 1: "Has somebody called an ambulance?” Speaker 2: ”I believe so.”

Other possibilities include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|
* "Absolutely so."
* "How so?"
* "I am afraid so."
* "Indeed so."
* "It is not so."
* "It is so."
* "Is it so?"
* "Is that so?"
* "...just so."
* "...less so."
* "Let it be so."
* "...like so."
* "...made it so."
* "...make it so."
* "...more so."
* "Not so."
* "...or so."
* "Quite so."
* "So?"
* "...{{Wikten|so and so}}."
* "Why so?"
}}

==Dangling so==
A dangling "so" in conversation invites the listener to articulate or consider the implications of the information provided without the speaker having to articulate it himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.usatoday.com/2014/02/14/so-why-is-everyone-saying-so/ So… why is everyone saying “so?"] ''[[USA Today]]'' Haley Goldberg 14 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/15/its-okay-to-end-your-sent_n_5325324.html It's Okay To End Your Sentences With 'But' Or 'So,' Right?] ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' 15 May 2014 Claire Fallon&lt;/ref&gt; It has been interpreted as sometimes a form of [[bragging]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20100515/ISSUE03/100033407/people-who-end-sentences-with-so-yes-theyre-bragging People who end sentences with 'so': Yes, they're bragging] ''[[Crain's Chicago Business]]'' Lisa Bertagnoli 15 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
A dangling "so" in conversation may be represented in text as "so" followed by an [[ellipsis]] symbol "…".&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[http://blog.dictionary.com/dangling-so/ Why do people end sentences with “so”? What effect does it have on conversation?] ''[[Dictionary.com]]'' Jane Solomon 21 Aug 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of dangling "so":
* "Yeah, it's pretty exciting, though we're not really sure whether it will work out, so..."
* Speaker 1: "How was your date?" Speaker 2: "Well, he didn’t show up, so..."

==Intensifying adverb==
"So" may close a sentence as an intensifying adverb, such as in "I love her so". "So" in the middle of a sentence can also be an intensifying adverb, such as in "I so love her".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25637">'''Sustainability advertising''' is [[communication]]s geared towards promoting social, economic and environmental benefits of products, services or actions through paid [[advertising]] in media in order to encourage [[social responsibility|responsible behavior]] of consumers.

==Definition==
Conventional advertising is part of the promotion of products and services, which is one of the 4P's represented in the [[marketing mix]] (Product, Promotion, Price, Place).&lt;ref&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 11.Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability marketing mix includes the 4C's (Customer solution, Communication, Customer cost, [[Convenience]]) and makes sustainability advertising a part of the sustainability communication concept.&lt;ref&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability advertising is used to advert customers to [[sustainable product]]s, services and actions. It is not only focused on [[environmental issues]] and the product or service itself, but includes communication about the entire [[product life cycle|life cycle of the product]]. It furthermore informs about the sustainability of the producing company and communicates desirable [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s changes to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 9 f. ; Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 181 f&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising in general is a one-way communication through [[mass media]]&lt;ref name="BP 9 181"&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to create [[brand recognition]], brand knowledge and some [[brand preference]].&lt;ref&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability advertising contributes to all three pillars of [[triple bottom line]]: [[economic development]], [[environmental protection]] and [[social responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 9 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Whenever an advertisement campaign is developed and launched as a marketing strategy for a sustainable product or service, it must be aligned to the objectives defined by the company in the context of sustainability. Some of the common objectives of marketing communications are: generation of awareness, informing consumers, reminding consumers, persuading consumers, reassuring consumers, motivating and rewarding consumers and connecting with them.&lt;ref name="BP 9 181"/&gt; These are the basis for more specific objectives of sustainability advertising with the emphasis on environmental and social aspects.
The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (''UNEP'') has developed documents that give insights about the objectives of the sustainability advertising. They include:&lt;ref&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

#“Ensuring truth in advertising – the advertising codes provided and supported by the [[advertising industry]] and other mechanisms to ensure that claims can be substantiated, to prevent consumers from being misled”. This is related to the objectives of informing consumers and reassuring them whenever there is misleading critics or arguments against a particular product, service or implemented action.
#“Ensuring [[Corporate social responsibility|ethical behavior]] from advertisers, so that messages are legal, decent, honest and truthful”. Advertisement should not include attempts of [[greenwashing]] and reference to false social responsibility claims.
#“Ensuring that all sectors of society, including women, minorities, the elderly and children are sensitively portrayed.” This “is associated with the challenge of sustainability advertising to address and “connect” with different audiences through a mass media message”.
#“How advertising agencies, and the advertisers themselves, operate. As with all other sectors, organizations in the advertising industry need to address their direct effects on the environment and society, and the need for environmental management systems, reporting and corporate social responsibility programs.”  This area refers to the coherence needed whenever a sustainability message in advertising is set. The advertising message and the behavior of the company should be consistent to create trust and credibility.

==Background==
The conventional marketing mix concept was gradually developed during the economic miracle right after World War II and included the 4P’s model, introduced around 1960.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; This model, in which the promotion of products with advertising as one of its main tools plays an important role, was helpful for many industries in many markets.”&lt;ref&gt;Gronroos 1999. p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the market situation changed: con-sumers became more aware of the social and ecological implications of their purchases and at the same time inherent attributes like efficiency and cost effectiveness, health and safety, symbolism and status needed to be highlighted by companies in order to remain competitive in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The companies have been adapting to the changes and now move towards “relationship marketing focused more on communicating with the consumer”&lt;ref&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than just promoting the product. They use advertising, along with other activities and resources,&lt;ref&gt;Gronroos 1994, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; as a tool to inform the consumers and stakeholders about the sustainability solutions the company provides and about the company as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

“The relationship between marketing and the environment has been examined since the early 1970s”.&lt;ref&gt;Kilbourne 2004, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; First, the idea of ecological marketing was developed and mainly centered in the “depletion of energy and non-energy natural resources and the pollution created as by-product of production and consumption.”&lt;ref name="BP 9 28"&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; “The first tentative steps of non-polluting industry and first uses of nature in advertising arose”&lt;ref name="UNEP 21"&gt;UNEP 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and were later accompanied by an intensive mediatization of environmental issues in the 1980s. For example: the discovery of the ´hole in the ozone layer` in 1985 and Chernobyl in 1986.&lt;ref name="UNEP 21"/&gt; By this time,  [[green marketing]] and [[environmental marketing]] concepts were built up and elements from the product [[life cycle assessment]] (associated with environmental marketing) as well as destruction of ecosystems and poverty in developing countries (associated with green marketing)&lt;ref name="BP 9 28"/&gt; were considered in the advertising campaigns.

Lately, the concept of sustainability advertising has evolved as it is defined in the first part of this article. It has encountered critics, and limitations, but also challenges that are guiding the companies, governments and organizations to the implementation of more holistic and sustainable practices in the process of providing products and services worldwide.

==Information carriers==
Information carriers of marketing messages are mainly mainstream media like national television, national radio and print. Those media are also engaged in sustainability promotion, because they are central players in building consumers culture.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis 2001, in: Kolandai-Matchett 2009, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Within radio, print or television campaigns sustainability advertisements are pointing out the social, environmental and economical benefits of sustainable products and services.&lt;ref&gt;Kolandai-Matchett 2009, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic advertising messages are then connected with corporate communication leading towards the development of a responsible and civic image of the company. However, mainstream media have constrains in promoting sustainability issues due to limitations to the application of persuasive, motivational or educative communication.&lt;ref&gt;Sandman 1974, pp. 207–247; Dennis 1991, pp. 55–64; Shanahan 1996, pp. 176–193 in: Kolandai-Matchett 2009, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Most sustainability advertising campaigns therefore combine different types of mainstream media to approach the consumer on different levels of information reception.

===Radio===
Sustainability advertising on the Radio refers only to audio. High imagery ads that elicit visual images in the minds of listeners show positive effects on attitude toward the brand and purchase intention.&lt;ref&gt;Bolls; Muehling 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The right choice of words for the campaign and the possibility to activate imagination of the consumer and raise the desire for the product or service is the challenge for radio advertising.

===Print===
[[Print media]] are paper based media methods like magazines, newspaper, books, flyers or posters. Therefore, print advertising generally includes a higher resource use in terms of paper, compared to digital radio and television campaigns.
The choice of the right print media is important to inform the defined target group about the sustainable products and services. Advertisements in daily newspapers whose readers are ed-ucated and interested in sustainability issues, as well as in magazines promoting a sustainable lifestyle contribute to raise consumers’ interest in sustainable products and services. Posters on the other hand are often used for social marketing campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Earthprint publishing 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Television is the dominant type of media in the developed countries&lt;ref&gt;Office for Official Publications of the European Communities (Data 1980/2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and combines audio and visual possibilities of sustainability advertising. Its effectiveness results from ‘learning without involvement’ which means that the consumer takes up the information even without being interested at first.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, H.E. (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequentially, television is an essential media for sustainability advertising.

==Target group==
The target group for sustainability advertising is '''“[[Sustainable consumption|responsible consumers]]”'''. They are aware of sustainable development issues or in the niche of activists and follow sustainability principles. These consumers have a continuously developing commitment towards a more responsible lifestyle and are serious in their sustainable intentions and behavior. They are interested in information about products or services, real product labeling and have an independent attitude towards mass media and advertising. Responsible consumers can be seen as 'optimistic realists' encouraging society to continue development in a sustainable way.  They are critical towards their own behavior concerning environmental impact of the products or services they consume. Responsible consumers are sensitive for corporate behavior and are careful in trusting companies which laud their social or environmental commitment even if it is independently monitored.&lt;ref&gt;Earthprint publishing 2007, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; They consume efficiently, see economic growth decoupled from environmental degradation and focus on ‘common but differentiated responsibility’ to improve the quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley (2004), p, 9 ; UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Responsible consumers demand a higher value from their purchases in terms of social responsibility, environmental impacderations.&lt;ref name="U W E 25"&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; They show an increasing awareness on social and environmental issues and offers in domestic and export markets.&lt;ref name="U W E 25"/&gt; Focusing on the responsible consumer as an overall target group, further division into the following target subgroups can be made:&lt;ref&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[LOHAS]] – who are strongly concerned about their health, taste of food and with a high level of responsibility for environmental and social issues.
*Status addicts – who are strongly concerned about social visibility of the purchase and want to be perceived as sustainability consumers.
*Transition towns community members – narrow group with the focus on local consumption and sustainability.
*Concerned parents – who want the best and the healthiest products for their children.
*Currently constrained – who would like to be more sustainable, but don’t think there is much they can do in their current circumstances.

==Advantages==
'''Range of coverage'''. Speed and scale with which the message is spread refers to one of the most significant advantages of the sustainability advertising. Advertising is capable of reaching a large or dispersed market repeatedly with persuasive and informative messages&lt;ref name="BP 9 181"/&gt; and is considered to be one of the most powerful sources of symbolic meaning in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2005, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability advertising campaigns 
'''motivate pro-environmental attitudes'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2005, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Being one of the tools of sustainability communication strategy, advertising campaigns focus on the intrinsic motivations of the consumers, their attitudes and beliefs as one of the determinants of the sustainability friendly consumption behavior.

Sustainability advertising represents the primary communication tool to which major part of con-sumer group is exposed on the market. It serves as a '''source of initial information '''for the consumers, concerning the social and environmental status of product and company. On the basis of the primary impression the consumer than takes the decision whether the product and the company behind deserve further evaluation as a potential purchase choice. Therefore, sustainability advertising “helps to inform consumers and facilitates consumer choice”.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

As marketing communication tool sustainability advertising can be used as an instrument to '''modify''' ''the impact of human activities on the planet''.  There are three factors, which contribute to the total human impact: ''population, affluence and technology.''&lt;ref name="BP 9 181"/&gt;
Sustainability advertising addresses affluence by promoting reduction of the environmental and social footprint of the society on the planet. Originally advertising was one of the factors that created consumption culture, thus playing an important role in shaping consumer preferences and the social and environmental impact they produce. Sustainability advertising however, is responsible for the lifestyle changes in the society, from materialistic towards more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of marketing communication tools offer producers a wide range of opportunities to build relationships with a consumer.  Due to the format restrictions sustainability advertising often is not able provide comprehensive information about the product.&lt;ref name="BP 9 182"&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it '''serves as a link to more substantial sources of information''' (e.g. a company’s web page) where consumer can find more data on environmental and social aspects of the product. This link enables further development of the communication process between the company and the consumer. So, under favorable conditions and linked to a competent communication strategy it can be transformed into long lasting mutually beneficial relationships between the two.

==Disadvantages, limitations, and challenges==
Promoting sustainable solutions through Sustainability Advertising provides corporations with big [[competitive advantage]]s&lt;ref&gt;Lovell (2004), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; and allows them to educate and inform consumers as well as stimulate their emotions towards the product. Nevertheless, there are some limitations:

General advertising as well as Sustainability Advertising operate by sending out ''[[unidirectional]] messages'' to its entire audience at one.&lt;ref name="BP 9 181"/&gt; At the same time the ability to connect with the single consumers as well as the chances for them to respond are strongly limited. That means the creation of feedback-relationships between corporations and its customers through sustainable advertisement is limited too. To avoid the typical one-way communication and to provide consumers and corporations with the chance to give and receive feedback, advertising can be used in combination with other key media such as online communication or labeling. Interactive advertising then enables the company to build op strong customer-relationships despite the primer lack of personalized messages.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlou 2000, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special challenge for Sustainability Advertising is the ''complexity of the messages'' that have to be communicated. To avoid what is called  ´Sustainability Advertising Myopia` – an exclusive focus on the “green” aspects of the product – the advertising message should not only include the social and environmental attributes of a product, but also connect them to the inherent [[consumer benefits]],&lt;ref&gt;Inherent consumer benefits: cost-effectiveness, health &amp; safety, convenience, status symbol, cf. Belz; Peattie 2009, pp. 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as men-tion the main buying criteria influencing the consumers´ [[buying decision]].&lt;ref&gt;Main buying criteria: functionality, performance, design, durability, taste, freshness, cf. Belz; Peattie 2009, pp. 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S 62"&gt;Schrader 2005, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, communicating meaningful about the complex interplay of social, environmental, economic, technical and consumer benefits of a product from a sustainability perspective using a 30-second radio or television slot or a single printed page can be a serious challenge.&lt;ref name="BP 9 182"/&gt; To make information uptake easier for consumers a selection of the core information and its transformation into simple advertising messages in combination with other key media, like annual environmental reports or links to web pages that provide more detailed information about the product,&lt;ref name="S 62"/&gt; can be helpful.

A challenge related to the complexity of messages is the ''risk of [[information overload]]''. It results from the corporations’ effort to gain more credibility and trust by providing search qualities in form of text and fact oriented advertising. However, facing the information overload of today’s consumers mainly socio-ecologically conscious consumers perceive the fact focused advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Schrader 2005, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Enhancing the emotional appeal of Sustainability Advertising can create emotional connections with a larger range of consumers and stimulate their involvement with the product.&lt;ref&gt;Schrader 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common approaches is the so-called: „Ecotainment“&lt;ref&gt;Lichtl, M. (1999), in: Schrader 2005, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt; – the creation of consumers´ involvement by including a celebrity into the advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;Schrader 2005, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong threat to the credibility of Sustainability Advertising can be seen in corporate “[[greenwashing]]”, a form of disinformation from organizations seeking to repair public reputations and further shape public images.&lt;ref&gt;Beder, S. (1997), in: Laufer, W. S. (2003), p.253.&lt;/ref&gt; It allows firms to manipulate an image of environmental, social, and cultural responsiveness&lt;ref&gt;Beder, S. (2000), in: Munshi; Kurian (2005), p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; by communicating false or misleading sustainability claims. This common practice damages the overall credibility of corporate sustainability claims and leads to mistrust of the consumers. This general inconsistency between a company’s messages and it actions could finally explain the [[value-action gap]] between consumers strongly expressed concerns about socio-ecological issues and their nevertheless relatively low purchase of sustainable goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Belz; Peattie 2009, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the most important future challenge concerning firms as well as advertising agencies is certainly a ''better understanding of the benefits of corporate socio-ecological responsibility in communications''.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP; WFA; EACA 2002, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially advertising agencies often lack the technical expertise to ensure that the communications of new sustainable messages are credible and fail to ensure that there is alignment between a client's corporate practices and external communications.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This often leads to passed up marketing opportunities and hinders the creation of positive brand value. To overcome those barriers advertising agencies must gain expertise and experience in the fields of sustainable advertising, so the promotion of sustainability issues becomes part of a real corporate philosophy advertised through all communication channels.&lt;ref&gt;Longhust (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The case examines how the rescued survivors, who kill and eat one person in order to survive, should be treated by the law.]]

"'''The Case of the Speluncean Explorers'''" is an article by legal philosopher [[Lon L. Fuller]] first published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1949. Largely taking the form of a fictional judgment, it presents a [[jurisprudence|legal philosophy]] puzzle to the reader and five possible solutions in the form of [[judicial opinion]]s that are attributed to judges sitting on the fictional "Supreme Court of Newgarth" in the year 4300.{{efn|Fuller addressed his decision to date his scenario in the [[fifth millennium]] in the article's postscript, writing that "the reader puzzled by the choice of date may wish to be reminded that the centuries which separate us from the year 4300 are roughly equal to those that have passed since the [[Fifth-century Athens|Age of Pericles]] [i.e. the fifth century]".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=645}} }}

The case involves five explorers who are caved in following a landslide. They learn via intermittent radio contact that, without food, they are likely to starve to death before they can be rescued. They decide to engage in [[cannibalism]], and select one of their number to be killed and eaten so that the others may survive. They decide who should be killed by throwing a pair of dice.  After the four survivors are rescued, they are charged and found guilty of the [[murder]] of the fifth explorer. If their appeal to the Supreme Court of Newgarth fails, they face a mandatory [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. Although the wording of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is intense public pressure for the men to avoid facing the death penalty.

The article offers five possible judicial responses. Each differs in its reasoning and on whether the survivors should be found guilty of breaching the law.  Two judges affirm the convictions, emphasising the importance of the [[separation of powers]] and [[Plain meaning rule|literal approach]] to [[statutory interpretation]]. Two other judges overturn the convictions; one focuses on "common sense" and the popular will while the other uses arguments drawn from the [[natural law]] tradition, emphasizing the [[purposive approach]]. A fifth judge, who is unable to reach a conclusion, recuses himself.  As the Court's decision is a tie, the original convictions are upheld and the men are sentenced to death.

Fuller's account has been described as "a classic in [[jurisprudence]]"{{sfn|D'Amato|1980|p=467}} and "a microcosm of [the 20th] century's debates" in legal philosophy.{{sfn|Eskridge Jr.|1993|p=467}}  It allows for contrasts to be drawn between different legal philosophies, with the main two being [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]].  In the 50 years following the article's publication, a further 25 hypothetical judgments were written by various authors whose perspectives include [[natural law]] theory, [[consequentialism]], plain meaning [[positivism]] or [[textualism]], purposivism, historical contextualism, realism, pragmatism, [[critical legal studies]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], [[process theory]] and minimalism.{{sfn|Roederer|2003|p=388}}

==Synopsis==
===Facts===
The facts of the case are recounted in the first judicial opinion, which is given by Chief Justice Truepenny.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1851}}

Five cave explorers became trapped inside a cave following a landslide.  They have limited food supplies and no sources of nutrition inside the cave. Above ground, substantial resources are spent to rescue them, with 10 workmen killed in subsequent landslides near the blocked entrance. Radio contact is eventually established with the cavers on the 20th day of the cave-in, and the cavers learn that another 10 days would be required in order to free them. They then consult with medical experts, who inform them that they are unlikely to survive to the rescue given the likelihood of starvation.

[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|180px|left|In "the Case of the Speluncean Explorers", the person to be eaten was chosen by throwing a pair of dice. This method had also been suggested for choosing the victim in the similar real-life case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''.]]

One of the cavers, Roger Whetmore, then asks on the cavers' behalf if the cavers could survive 10 days longer "if they consumed the flesh of one of their number". The medical experts reluctantly confirm this to be the case. Whetmore then asks if they should [[sortition|draw lots]] to select a person to be killed and eaten. No one outside the cave is willing to answer this question. Radio contact is subsequently lost.

Once the cave-in is cleared, it is discovered that only four cavers have survived; Roger Whetmore had been killed and eaten by the others. The survivors state that Whetmore had originally come up with the ideas of cannibalism and choosing the victim through random chance, offering a pair of [[dice]] in his possession.

Before the dice are cast, Whetmore allegedly expresses a wish to withdraw from the arrangement, preferring to wait another week "before embracing an expedient so frightful and odious". The others refuse to accept his change of mind, and cast the dice on his behalf. The survivors claim that Whetmore conceded that the dice were thrown fairly. He is subsequently killed and eaten.

Following their rescue and recovery, the survivors are charged with the murder of Whetmore. The relevant statute provides that "Whoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punished by death", offering no exceptions which would be relevant to the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1853}} The jury seek a [[special verdict]], so that they can make limited findings of fact without having to return a verdict on whether it constitutes murder. The cavers are ultimately convicted of murder.

The [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentence]] for murder in Newgarth is [[death by hanging]]. Both the trial judge and members of the jury petition the Chief Executive to [[Commutation of sentence|commute the sentence]] of the surviving spelunkers from the death penalty to six months' imprisonment. The Chief Executive refuses to act while the Supreme Court of Newgarth considers the appeal.

|+Summary of Fuller's five judicial opinions 
! Judge !! Key points !! Decision
|-
| Chief Justice Truepenny || 
* Statute is unambiguous and must be applied by judiciary notwithstanding personal views
* [[Clemency]] is a matter for the [[Executive (government)|executive]], not the judiciary
* Court should joint petition to Chief Executive for clemency 
|| 
Affirms convictions but recommends clemency
|-
| Justice Foster || 
* Defendants were in a "state of nature" so Newgarth's normal laws did not apply to them; the laws of nature would allow them to agree to sacrifice one's life to save the other four
* If the laws of Newgarth do apply, then a purposive approach must be taken to the statute. Judges can find an exception to the law by implication, as the Courts had earlier done with [[self-defense]].
** Principal purpose of the criminal law – deterrence – would not be served by convicting the defendants.
|| Sets aside convictions
|-
||Justice Tatting || 
* Criticises Foster J's approach
** The natural law under the posited "state of nature" prioritises freedom of contract above the right to life
** Purposive approach to statutory interpretation is difficult when there are multiple purposes (here, retribution and rehabilitation)
* Cannot decide case due to competing legal rationales and emotions
|| Withdraws from case and makes no decision
|-
| Justice Keen || 
* Criticises Chief Justice's proposed appeal to Executive for clemency given need to respect [[separation of powers]]; should only make appeal in capacity as private citizens
* Moral considerations are irrelevant in applying the statute 
|| Affirms convictions
|-
| Justice Handy || 
* Court should take account of public opinion and "common sense"
* Aware that 90% of the public want the men to face a lesser punishment or be released
* Has heard rumours that the Chief Executive will not commute the sentence despite strong public opinion 
|| Sets aside convictions

===Opinion of Chief Justice Truepenny===
The first opinion is largely [[Exposition (narrative)|expository]]; it is used to recount the facts of the case.  The Chief Justice states that the statute is unambiguous, with no applicable legal defences, so it must be applied by the court.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=619}}  He adds that granting mercy is a decision for the executive branch of government to make, rather than the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} However, the Chief Justice suggests that the judges of the court should add their names to the petition of the trial judge and jury requesting the Chief Executive to show mercy to the defendants. This would allow justice to be achieved "without impairing either the letter or spirit of our statutes and without offering any encouragement for the disregard of law".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}

===Opinion of Justice Foster===
{{Quote|text=I believe something more is on trial in this case than the fate of these unfortunate explorers; that is the law of our Commonwealth. If this Court declares that under our law these men have committed a crime, then our law is itself convicted in the tribunal of common sense, no matter what happens to the individuals involved in this petition of error. For us to assert that the law we uphold and expound compels us to a conclusion we are ashamed of, and from which we can only escape by appealing to a dispensation resting within the personal whim of the Executive, seems to me to amount to an admission that the law of this Commonwealth no longer pretends to incorporate justice.|sign=Justice Foster{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}}}

The second opinion takes a different approach to the Chief Justice's.  In determining that the convictions should be overturned, Justice Foster makes two main points.  Firstly, the defendants were in a "[[state of nature]]" at the time of the killing, so the laws of nature applied to them. The laws of nature allowed to agree to sacrifice one person for the survival of the rest.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} Secondly, assuming the laws of Newgarth did apply, a {{cfy|text=[[functional approach]]|date=March 2016}} should be used in applying the statute.  As its main purpose is deterrence, the judge concluded that, just as with a case of self-defence, the purpose of the statute would not be served by upholding the convictions.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=624}}

The judge counters potential objections of [[judicial activism]] by suggesting that although judges must obey the will of legislators, they must do so intelligently. He draws analogies to servants who need to "read between the lines" of their masters' instructions; strict literal compliance may not always be the actual intention.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=625}}  Thus the "correction of obvious legislative errors or oversights is not to supplant the legislative will, but to make that will effective."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}}

===Opinion of Justice Tatting===
In the third opinion, Justice Tatting is emotionally "torn between sympathy for [the defendants] and a feeling of abhorrence and disgust at the monstrous act they committed".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}} He ultimately finds himself unable to decide the case.

Justice Tatting disagrees strongly with Justice Foster's rationales in overturning the convictions. He criticizes the "state of nature" concept and is not satisfied with Justice Foster's formulation placing the law of contract above the law against murder.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=627–628}} He also notes the difficulty of applying the [[purposive approach]] to the criminal statute which has multiple purposes, including retribution and rehabilitation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=628–629}} He distinguishes the self-defence exception that was created by past judges on the basis that it is not a "willful" killing, so it does not contradict the wording of the statute.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=629}} He finds that the self-defence exception could not be applied to the present case as it would raise "a quagmire of hidden difficulties".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=630}} 

The judge cites the case of  ''Commonwealth v Valjean'',{{efn|This reference invokes [[Jean Valjean]], the protagonist in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]]''. In the novel, Valjean is imprisoned after stealing bread to feed his sister's starving children.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=70–71}} }} in which starvation was held not to justify the theft of a loaf of bread, let alone homicide. These combined objections lead Justice Tatting to reject Justice Foster's reasoning as "intellectually unsound and approaching mere rationalization."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

Despite rejecting Justice Foster's reasoning, Justice Tatting cannot bring himself to reach the alternative view, that the defendants' convictions should be upheld. He states that "almost every consideration that bears on the decision of the case
is counterbalanced by an opposing consideration leading in the opposite direction."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}} Concluding with a criticism of the prosecutor for deciding to bring the prosecution in the first place, the judge makes the "unprecedented" decision of withdrawing from the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

===Opinion of Justice Keen===
The fourth opinion begins by excluding [[executive clemency]] and the morality of the defendants' actions as relevant factors to the court's deliberations.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} Rather, the question before the court is purely one of applying the legislation of Newgarth and determining whether the defendants wilfully took the life of Whetmore. He criticizes the other judges for failing to distinguish the legal from the moral aspects of the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} While he shares their preference that the defendants be spared from death, he respects the obligations of his office to put his "personal predilections" of what constitutes justice out of mind when interpreting and applying the law.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}}

Justice Keen objects vehemently to Justice Foster's purposive approach allowing the plain words of the law to be ignored.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=67}} He emphasizes that laws may have many possible purposes, with difficulties arising in divining the actual "purpose" of a piece of legislation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}}

Justice Keen recalls that earlier instances of judicial activism in Newgarth had ultimately led to [[civil war]], which established the supremacy of the legislature over the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}} He concludes by criticizing the courts' creation of the self-defence excuse, stating that waiting for the legislature to enact such revisions would have led to a stronger legal system.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}

===Opinion of Justice Handy===
In contrast to the other judges, Justice Handy prefers to use a "pragmatic, common-sense approach", rather than abstract legal theories, to resolve the case.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He criticizes his colleagues' "obscuring curtain of legalisms" when the case simply requires the application of "practical wisdom" of "human realities".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}} He emphasizes the need for the courts to maintain public confidence, which requires them to follow the 90% majority in favour of applying a token punishment or releasing the defendants altogether.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He is prepared to use Justice Foster's purposive approach doctrine as the legal rationale.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}}

Justice Handy notes that apart from the ambivalent Justice Tatting, the other judges share the majority public opinion.  The judges voting to uphold the convictions simply differ from Justices Foster and Handy on whose role it is to spare the defendants from the death penalty.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=642}}

==Similar real cases==
*''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', an actual English criminal case from 1884 involving cannibalism at sea.
*The ''[[William Brown (ship)|William Brown]]'' was a ship whose sinking led to several passengers being forced out of an overcrowded lifeboat to save the remaining passengers. It led to the case of ''United States v. Holmes'', in which crewman Alexander Holmes was charged with [[murder]] and convicted of [[manslaughter]] for his actions.

'''''The Will to Doubt: An Essay in Philosophy for the General Thinker''''' is a [[book]] published in 1907 by [[University of Michigan]] professor [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]]. Professor Lloyd would later become interim President of the University of Michigan in 1925.

==Thesis==
''The Will to Doubt'' was Lloyd's fourth book and was published as a volume in the Ethical Library Series. The book was a response to [[William James]]' 1896 collection of essays titled ''[[The Will to Believe]]''. Professor Lloyd's simple thesis is that "doubt is essential to real belief".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/willtodoubtessay00lloyrich#page/n11/mode/2up ''The Will to Doubt'']. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1907, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote at the beginning of the 20th century, in what he called an age of doubt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We would often hide it from others, not to say from ourselves, but it is there, and we all know it to be there.&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Though many fear doubt, and try to keep it hidden and locked away, the confession of doubt is in fact the beginning of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Themes==
Fear is a chief motivator of [[dogmatism]], and dogmatic people are slaves to their fears. This is not genuine confidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; But doubt is not the road to [[atheism]]; in fact, doubt is part of a very difficult road to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Will to Doubt'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] built upon these arguments in subsequent years, even directly referencing Lloyd in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">'''ʿIlm al-ḥurūf''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْم الْحُرُوف}}) or '''the science of letters''' is an Arabic [[Esotericism|esoteric]] science or magic practice concerned with occult properties assigned to the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]], and the words and names formed from those letters.

Using these properties of letters, ʿilm al-ḥurūf then sought to combine letters based on these magical properties to form words to achieve a desired magical or divinatory effect. It also sought to use these properties to analyze significant names and words, such as the [[Names of God in Islam|99 names of God]], to reveal and understand divine secrets.

== Etymology ==
ʿIlm al-Ḥurūf is composed of the two words ''ʿilm'' ({{lang-ar|عِلْم}}) meaning "science", and ''ḥurūf'' ({{lang-ar|حُرُوف}}), the plural of the word ''ḥarf'' ({{lang-ar|حَرْف}}), meaning "letters".
