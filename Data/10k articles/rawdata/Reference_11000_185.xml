The '''Associated Press''' ('''AP''') is a U.S.-based [[not-for-profit]] [[news agency]] headquartered in [[New York City]]. Founded in 1846, it operates as a [[cooperative]], [[unincorporated association]]. The AP is owned by its contributing newspapers and radio and television stations in the United States, all of which contribute stories to the AP and use material written by its staff journalists. Its Statement of News Values and Principles spells out its standards and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/about/news-values-and-principles/|title=News Values and Principles {{!}} AP|website=Associated Press|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP has earned 52 [[Pulitzer Prizes]], including 31 for photography, since the award was established in 1917.

The AP has counted the vote in U.S. elections since 1848, including national, state and local races down to the legislative level in all 50 states, along with key ballot measures. AP collects and verifies returns in every county, parish, city and town across the U.S., and declares winners in over 5,000 contests.

The AP news report, distributed to its members and customers, is produced in English, Spanish and Arabic. AP content is also available on the agency's app, AP News. A 2017 study by [[NewsWhip]] revealed that AP content was more engaged with on Facebook than content from any individual English-language publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2017/ap-content-drives-more-facebook-engagements-than-individual-publishers-in-june-july|title=AP content drives more Facebook engagements than individual publishers in June, July|website=Associated Press|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2016}}, news collected by the AP was published and republished by more than 1,300 newspapers and broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/AssociatedPress_2016FinancialStatements.pdf|title=2016 Consolidated Financial Statements|last=|first=|date=April 5, 2017|website=Associated Press|access-date=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP operates 263 [[news bureau]]s in 106 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/ap-by-the-numbers.html|title=A look at the AP through AP stats and figures|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Associated Press|access-date=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates the AP Radio Network, which provides newscasts twice hourly for broadcast and satellite radio and television stations. Many newspapers and broadcasters outside the United States are AP subscribers, paying a fee to use AP material without being contributing members of the cooperative. As part of their cooperative agreement with the AP, most member news organizations grant automatic permission for the AP to distribute their [[local news]] reports. The AP employs the "[[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]]" formula for writing which enables the news outlets to edit a story to fit its available publication area without losing the story's essentials.

Cutbacks at rival [[United Press International]] in 1993 left the AP as the United States' primary news service, although UPI still produces and distributes stories and photos daily. Other English-language news services, such as the [[BBC]], [[Reuters]] and the English-language service of [[Agence France-Presse]], are based outside the United States.

==History==
The Associated Press was formed in May 1846&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorknatives.com/on-this-day-in-nycs-history-associated-press-formed/|title=Associated Press Founded - This Day in History May 22|work=New York Natives|date=2015-05-22|accessdate=2016-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324173630/http://newyorknatives.com/on-this-day-in-nycs-history-associated-press-formed/|archive-date=2016-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by five daily newspapers in [[New York City]] to share the cost of transmitting news of the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15108618|title=Network effects|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venture was organized by [[Moses Yale Beach]] (1800–68), second publisher of ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', joined by the ''[[New York Herald]]'', the ''[[New York Courier and Enquirer]]'', ''[[The Journal of Commerce]]'', and the ''[[New York Evening Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/06/26/the-birth-of-atari-modern-computer-design-and-the-software-industry-this-week-in-tech-history/#14b8630f6f38|title=The Birth of Atari, Modern Computer Design, And The Software Industry: This Week In Tech History|last=Press|first=Gil|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians{{who|date=October 2012}} believe that the ''Tribune'' joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849. ''[[The New York Times]]'' became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and [[price setting]] practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by [[Victor Lawson]], editor and publisher of the ''Chicago Daily News'', revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] decision (''Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press'')—that the AP was a [[public utility]] and operating in restraint of trade—resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

When the AP was founded, news became a salable commodity. The invention of the rotary press allowed the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Spanish–American War]], there was a new incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. [[Melville Stone]], who had founded the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925–48), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]), the Middle East. He introduced the "telegraph typewriter" or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA392&amp;resnum=7 |title=Wire That Photo |work=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1937 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'' that the AP had been violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP. The decision facilitated the growth of its main rival [[United Press International]], headed by [[Hugh Baillie]] from 1935 to 1955.

[[File:the associated press building in new york city.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Logo on the former AP Building in New York City]]

AP entered the broadcast field in 1941 when it began distributing news to radio stations; it created its own radio network in 1974. In 1994, it established APTV, a global video newsgathering agency. APTV merged with WorldWide Television News in 1998 to form APTN, which provides video to international broadcasters and websites. In 2004, AP moved its world headquarters from its longtime home at 50 Rockefeller Plaza to a huge building at [[Manhattan West|450 West 33rd Street]] in Manhattan—which also houses the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the studios of New York's public television station, [[WNET]]. In 2009, AP had more than 240 bureaus globally. Its mission—"to gather with economy and efficiency an accurate and impartial report of the news"—has not changed since its founding, but digital technology has made the distribution of the AP news report an interactive endeavor between AP and its 1,400 U.S. newspaper members as well as broadcasters, international subscribers, and online customers.

The AP began diversifying its news gathering capabilities and by 2007 AP was generating only about 30% of its revenue from United States newspapers. 37% came from the global broadcast customers, 15% from online ventures and 18% came from international newspapers and from photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Down On The Wire |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/13/media-newspapers-ap-biz-media-cx_lh_0214ap.html |quote=Last year, AP generated only about 30% of its revenue from U.S. newspapers.

===Web resource===
The AP's multi-topic structure has resulted in web portals such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[MSN]] posting its articles, often relying on the AP as their first source for news coverage of breaking news items. This and the constant updating evolving stories require has had a major impact on the AP's public image and role, giving new credence to the AP's ongoing mission of having staff for covering every area of news fully and promptly. The AP was also the news service used on the [[Wii]]'s [[News Channel (Wii)|News Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Nintendo Customer Service: Wii News Channel |quote=Using the international resources of the Associated Press, the News Channel gives Wii users free access to stories in multiple categories from across the country and around the world.|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/channelsNews.jsp |publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Google announced that it was paying to receive Associated Press content, to be displayed in [[Google News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google News Becomes A Publisher |url =http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=PBT2QGMTUGF0AQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=201803549&amp;_requestid=555255 |quote='Because the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, U.K. Press Association and the Canadian Press don't have a consumer Web site where they publish their content, they have not been able to benefit from the traffic that Google News drives to other publishers,' Josh Cohen, business product manager for Google News, explained in a blog post. |work=[[Information Week]] |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this was interrupted from late 2009 to mid-2010, due to a licensing dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Stops Hosting New AP Content |url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-google-stops-hosting-new-ap-content |accessdate=2010-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112081900/http://paidcontent.org/article/419-google-stops-hosting-new-ap-content |archivedate=12 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google, AP reach deal for Google News content |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-20015053-265.html |publisher=[[CNET]]|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP sports polls==
{{main|AP Poll}}
The AP conducts polls for numerous [[college athletics|college sports]] in the [[United States]]. The AP college football rankings were created in 1936, and began including the top 25 teams in 1989. Since 1969, the final poll of each season has been released after all bowl games have been played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2017/08/post_205.html|title=The best and worst of LSU's AP preseason poll history|work=NOLA.com|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP released its all-time Top 25 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakewilliams3012/2016/08/21/what-the-last-five-seasons-of-the-ap-poll-say-about-trending-teams-in-college-football/#23ace7d02ff1|title=What The Last Five Seasons Of The AP Poll Say About Trending Teams In College Football|last=Williams|first=Blake|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017}}, 22 different programs had finished in the number one spot of the poll since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2017-08-21/college-football-rankings-who-has-been-no-1-ap-preseason-poll-most|title=College football rankings: Who has been No. 1 in the AP preseason poll most often and how did they finish?|date=2017-08-21|work=NCAA.com|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP college basketball poll has been used as a guide for which teams deserve national attention. The poll first began its poll of college basketball teams in 1949, and has since conducted over 1,100 polls. The college basketball poll started with 20 teams and was reduced to 10 during the 1960-61 college basketball season. It returned to 20 teams in 1968-69 and expanded to 25 beginning in 1989-90. The final poll for each season is released prior to the conclusion of the NCAA tournament, so all data includes regular season games only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/29/ap-top-100-college-basketball-programs-all-time/|title=AP Top 25 polls highlight Top 100 all-time in college basketball|date=2017-03-29|work=The Denver Post|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, The AP released a list of the Top 100 teams of all time. The poll counted poll appearances (one point) and No. 1 rankings (two points) to rank each team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.syracuse.com/axeman/index.ssf/2017/03/syracuse_basketball_ap_top_100.html|title=Where does Syracuse basketball rank on the all-time AP Top 25?|work=syracuse.com|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP sports awards==

===Baseball===
The AP began its [[Major League Baseball]] Manager of the Year Award in 1959, for a manager in each league.&lt;ref name=APManagerOfYr&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_mgy2.shtml AP Manager of the Year Award]. Baseball-Almanac.com. Retrieved 2009-09-29. Although the award began in 1959, AP gave a "manager of the year" award in 1950 to Eddie Sawyer of the Philadelphia Phillies.{{Cite news |title= Eddie Sawyer Honored in Baseball Vote| work =Prescott Evening Courier|date=November 8, 1950|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7tIKAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6370,6584502|page=Section 2, Page 1|accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984 to 2000, the award was given to one manager in all of MLB.&lt;ref&gt;In 1959, when the AP began its Manager of the Year Award for a manager in each league, [[The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award|''The Sporting News'' Manager of the Year Award]] (begun in 1936) was for one manager in all of MLB. In 1983, MLB began its own [[Manager of the Year Award]], for a manager in each league. The following year (1984) the AP changed its award to one in all of MLB. In 1986, ''The Sporting News'' changed its award to one for each league.&lt;/ref&gt; The winners were chosen by a national panel of AP baseball writers and radio men. The award was discontinued in 2001.&lt;ref name=APManagerOfYr/&gt;

Every year, the AP releases the names of the winners of its [[Associated Press College Basketball Player of the Year|AP College Basketball Player of the Year]] and [[Associated Press College Basketball Coach of the Year|AP College Basketball Coach of the Year]] awards.

==Associated Press Television News==
[[File:APTNheadquarter.jpg|thumb|The APTN Building in London]]
In 1994, London-based Associated Press Television (APTV) was founded to provide agency news material to television broadcasters.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/business/ap-buys-worldwide-television-news.html|title=A.P.

==Litigation and controversies==
===Christopher Newton===
[[Washington, D.C.]] bureau reporter Christopher Newton, an AP reporter since 1994, was fired by AP in September 2002 after he was accused of fabricating sources since 2000, including at least 40 people and organizations. Prior to his firing, Newton had been focused on writing about federal law-enforcement while based at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. Some of the nonexistent agencies quoted in his stories included "Education Alliance", the "Institute for Crime and Punishment in Chicago", "Voice for the Disabled", and "People for Civil Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.slate.com/?id=2073304 |title= Fib Newton | date=October 29, 2002 | work =[[Slate.com]] |accessdate=2008-04-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080508022026/http://www.slate.com/?id=2073304| archivedate= 8 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair-use controversies===
In June 2008, the AP sent numerous [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] take down demands and threatened legal action against several [[blog]]s. The AP contended that the internet blogs were violating AP's [[copyright]] by linking to AP material and using headlines and short summaries in those links. Many bloggers and experts noted that the use of the AP news fell squarely under commonly accepted internet practices and within [[fair use|fair-use]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4381 |title = AP's Fair Use Challenge (Harvard Law) |work = Berkman Center for Internet and Society |date = 2008-06-17 |accessdate = 2014-06-04 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512044752/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4381 |archive-date = 2011-05-12 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted and demonstrated that AP routinely takes similar excerpts from other sources, often without attribution or licenses. AP responded that it was defining standards regarding citations of AP news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = The Associated Press to Set Guidelines for Using Its Articles in Blogs |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/business/media/16ap.html | quote= The Associated Press...said that it will, for the first time, attempt to define clear standards as to how much of its articles and broadcasts bloggers and Web sites can excerpt without infringing on The A.P.'s copyright. | work =[[The New York Times]]| date = June 16, 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |first=Saul |last=Hansell| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409031736/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/business/media/16ap.html | archivedate= 9 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright and intellectual property===
In August 2005, Ken Knight, a [[Louisiana]] photographer, sued the AP claiming that it had willfully and negligently violated Knight's copyright by distributing a photograph of celebrity [[Britney Spears]] to various media outlets including, but not limited to: [[truTV]] (formerly CourtTV), America Online and [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants= Ken Knight v. The Associated Press|url= http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-nysdce/case_no-1:2005cv07479/case_id-272658/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled in November 2006.

In a case filed February 2005, ''McClatchey v. The Associated Press'', a [[Pennsylvania]] photographer sued the AP for [[Cropping (image)|cropping]] a picture to remove the plaintiff's embedded title and copyright notice and later distributed it to news organizations without the plaintiff's permission or credit. The parties settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=McClatchey v. The Associated Press |url=http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/pennsylvania/pawdce/3:2005cv00145/66017/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shepard Fairey====
In March 2009, the Associated Press counter-sued artist [[Shepard Fairey]] over [[Obama HOPE poster|his famous image of Barack Obama]], saying the uncredited, uncompensated use of an AP photo violated [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright laws]] and signaled a threat to [[journalism]]. Fairey had sued the AP the previous month over his artwork, titled "Obama Hope" and "Obama Progress", arguing that he did not violate copyright law because he dramatically changed the image. The artwork, based on an April 2006 picture taken for the AP by [[Mannie Garcia]], was a popular image during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] and now hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. According to the AP lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Fairey knowingly "misappropriated The AP's rights in that image". The suit asked the court to award AP profits made off the image and damages. Fairey said he looked forward to "upholding the [[Freedom of speech|free expression]] rights at stake here" and disproving the AP's accusations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In January 2011 this suit was settled with neither side declaring their position to be wrong but agreeing to share reproduction rights and profits from Fairey's work.&lt;ref name=NPRFaireyvAPSettlement&gt;{{cite news |last=Memmott |first=Mark|title = Shepard Fairey And AP Settle Copyright Dispute Over 'Hope' Poster |url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/12/132860606/shepard-fairey-and-ap-settle-copyright-dispute-over-hope-poster |accessdate=31 August 2012| work =NPR |date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hot News====
In January 2008, Associated Press sued competitor [[All Headline News]] (AHN) claiming that AHN allegedly infringed on its copyrights and a contentious "quasi-property" right to facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last= Schonfeld| first=Erick |title= Hot News: The AP Is Living In The Last Century |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/22/AR2009022201243.html|date=February 22, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-25| work = The Washington Post |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Anderson| first= Nate| title= Who owns the facts?

After AHN moved to dismiss all but the copyright claims set forth by AP, a majority of the lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=The Associated Press v.

In June 2010, Associated Press was accused&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=AP Sues Others For Copying Its Reporting, But Has No Problem Copying Bloggers Without Citation|url=http://techdirt.com/articles/20100601/1505529650.shtml |work= TechDirt|date= 2010-06-01|accessdate=2010-06-01|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100605025220/http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100601/1505529650.shtml| archivedate= 5 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of having unfair and hypocritical policies after it was demonstrated that AP reporters had copied original reporting from the "[[Search Engine Land]]" website without permission, attribution, or credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Sullivan |first= Danny| title= How The Mainstream Media Stole Our News Story Without Credit |url = http://daggle.com/mainstream-media-stole-news-story-credit-1906 |work = Daggle| date=2010-06-01|accessdate=2010-06-01|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Illegal immigrant"===
In April 2013, AP stated that it had dropped the term "[[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]]" from its [[AP Stylebook|stylebook]]. AP follows ABC, NBC, and CNN in not using the term. [[Jose Antonio Vargas]] commended The Associated Press for its decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Associated Press Drops 'Illegal Immigrant' From Stylebook |author =Christina Costantini |url= http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/press-drops-illegal-immigrant-standards-book/story?id=18862824&amp;page=2#.UWJrcBeG18F | work =ABC News |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicated writer [[Ruben Navarrette]] criticized the decision, stating the reasoning behind the decision was [[political correct]]ness and called the blog "incomprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ruben Navarrette: Why 'illegal' immigrant is the right term |author= Ruben Navarrette |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_22962762/ruben-navarrette-why-illegal-immigrant-is-right-term | work =San Jose Mercury News | date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Janet Napolitano]] said of the decision, that she doesn't get involved in "vocabulary wars" and then stated "They are immigrants who are here illegally, that's an illegal immigrant".&lt;ref name="FN3APR2013"&gt;{{cite news |title =Associated Press under scrutiny for nixing term 'illegal immigrant' from Stylebook |author= |url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/03/ap-stylebook-drops-illegal-immigrants-from-its-manual | work = Fox News |date =3 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax tweet and flash crash===&lt;!-- [[AP Tweet Flash Crash of 2013]] and [[2013 Flash Crash]] redirect here --&gt;
On April 23, 2013, the AP's [[Twitter]] account was hacked to release a hoax tweet about fictional attacks in the [[White House]] that left [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP Twitter Hack Falsely Claims Explosions at White House| url=http://mashable.com/2013/04/23/ap-hacked-white-house |date=April 23, 2013| accessdate=April 23, 2013|author= Samantha Murphy |work= Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt; This erroneous tweet resulted in a brief plunge of 130 points from the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], removal of $136 billion from [[S&amp;P 500]] index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Fake Tweet Erasing $136 Billion Shows Markets Need Humans |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-23/fake-report-erasing-136-billion-shows-market-s-fragility.html| date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013| work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the temporary suspension of their Twitter account. Although all executed trades were considered final, the Dow Jones later restored its session gains.

===Justice Department subpoena of phone records===
{{main|2013 Department of Justice investigations of reporters}}

On May 13, 2013, The Associated Press announced telephone records for 20 of their reporters during a two-month period in 2012, had been subpoenaed by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] and described these acts as a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into news-gathering operations.&lt;ref name=TTSanchez&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez |first=Raf |title =US Justice Department secretly seizes Associated Press phone records|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/10055318/US-Justice-Department-secretly-seizes-Associated-Press-phone-records.html| work =The Telegraph|accessdate=15 May 2013|location=London |date=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TG130513&gt;{{cite news |title=US government secretly obtained Associated Press phone records|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/13/america-government-associated-press-phone-records| work =The Guardian| date=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP reported that the Justice Department would not say why it sought the records, but sources stated that the [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia]]'s office was conducting a criminal investigation into a May 7, 2012 AP story about a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operation that prevented a terrorist plot to detonate an explosive device on a commercial flight.&lt;ref name=RC-Ingram&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingram|first=David|title=Associated Press says U.S. government seized journalists' phone records |url = http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE94C0ZW20130513 | work = Reuters Canada|accessdate=15 May 2013|date=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOJ did not direct [[subpoena]]s to the AP, instead going to their phone providers, including [[Verizon Wireless]].&lt;ref name=verizonslate&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first= Ryan|title= Verizon Wireless Secretly Passed AP Reporters' Phone Records to Feds |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/05/16/verizon_wireless_passed_ap_reporters_phone_records_to_the_feds.html | work = Slate |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] testified under oath in front of the House Judiciary Committee that he recused himself from the leak investigations to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest.

===Claims of biased reporting===

====Israeli–Palestinian conflict====
In his book ''Broken Spring: An American-Israeli Reporter's Close-up View of How Egyptians Lost Their Struggle for Freedom'', former AP correspondent [[Mark Lavie]] claims that the AP upheld a narrative line in which Arabs and Palestinians were entirely without blame in a conflict where all guilt lay with Israel.&lt;ref name=Friedman &gt;{{cite news |author=[[Matti Friedman]] |title = What the Media Gets Wrong About Israel | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/how-the-media-makes-the-israel-story/383262/3/ |accessdate =10 December 2014 | work = The Atlantic |date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lavie15&gt;{{cite news|title= ''Broken Spring'' by Mark Lavie |url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/broken-spring-by-mark-lavie | accessdate =10 December 2014 | work = Times of Israel| date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lavie14&gt;{{cite news | last1= Lavie| first1 = Mark |title = Why Everything Reported from Gaza is Crazy Twisted |url = http://www.thetower.org/article/why-everything-reported-from-gaza-is-crazy-twisted |accessdate = 10 December 2014| work = The Tower| date = August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli journalist Matti Friedman accused AP of killing a story he wrote about the "war of words", "between Israel and its critics in human rights organizations", in the aftermath of the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Israel/Gaza conflict of 2008–09]].&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4796">In [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssa.org.za/index.php?q=con,92,How_to_become_an_attorney Law Society of South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; there are two main branches of legal practitioner: attorneys, who do legal work of all kinds, and [[Advocate#Advocates_in_South_Africa|advocates]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html sabar.co.za]&lt;/ref&gt;  who are specialists litigators. Attorneys may form [[Law firm|professional firms]] and practice in [[Law_firm#Partnership|partnerships]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attorneys.co.za/ attorneys.co.za/]&lt;/ref&gt; ranging in size to the [[Big Five law firms|"Big Five" law firms]]. The profession is regulated by the ''Attorneys Act, 1979 (Act No. 53 of 1979)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1979-053.pdf justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1979-053.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125004217/http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1979-053.pdf |date=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[Advocate#Advocates_in_South_Africa|Advocates in South Africa]]. There are currently around 21400 attorneys and 5000 candidate attorneys in South Africa, each of which are represented by the LSSA (Law Society of South Africa)&lt;ref&gt;[http://attorneyportal.co.za/law-society-of-south-africa/ attorneyportal.co.za/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012015218/http://attorneyportal.co.za/law-society-of-south-africa/ |date=October 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
{{See also|Law of South Africa|List of law schools in South Africa}}
[[File:University of Pretoria Faculty of Law.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[University of Pretoria Faculty of Law]] building]]

For admission as an attorney, the academic qualification required is an [[LLB]] from a [[List of law schools in South Africa|South African university]]; see [[Bachelor_of_Laws#South_Africa|Bachelor of Laws: South Africa]]; [[Legal education in South Africa]]. (Historically, the B.Proc. degree was also offered.) One then serves "[[Articled clerk|articles]]" as a candidate attorney with a practicing attorney for a period specified according to the qualification of the candidate (generally two years if an appropriate legal degree has been obtained); the length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing [[community service]]. The candidate must also write a "board exam" set by the relevant [http://www.lssa.org.za/Index.cfm?fuseaction=home.page&amp;PageID=6402073 provincial Law Society]. The examination comprises the following:
*Paper 1: Practice and procedure (criminal procedure, supreme court procedure, magistrates’ court procedure and motor vehicle accident claims);
*Paper 2: Wills and Estates;
*Paper 3: Attorneys’ practice, contracts and rules of conduct;
*Paper 4: Legal bookkeeping.

Attorneys may additionally qualify as [[Notary public|Notaries]] and [[Conveyancer]]s, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssalead.org.za/upload/CONVEYANCING%20COURSE%20AND%20NOTARIAL%20PRACTICE%20COURSE%202012%20v7.pdf Conveyancing and Notarial Courses], lssalead.org.za&lt;/ref&gt; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys - see [[Patent_attorney#South_Africa|Patent attorney: South Africa]].

Although not formally required for practice, further training, e.g. [[Master of Science in Taxation|in tax]], is usually via specialised [[postgraduate diploma]]s or [[LL.M.]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llm-guide.com/south-africa LLM Programs in South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Master of Laws#South Africa|Master of Laws: South Africa]].

==LSSA==

The LSSA (Law Society of South Africa) consists of the regulatory and disciplinary bodies for practicing attorneys in South Africa. Attorneys are required to register at the relative provincial law society where they practice in terms of the Attorneys Act, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssa.org.za/?q=con,67,History Law Society of South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attorneys and Advocates==

Attorneys are engaged directly by clients, acting as the “manager” of litigious cases.  Although both attorneys and advocates may appear in the High Court of South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf "LAW PROFESSIONALS"], Research Commissioned by Department of Labour South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; they will 'brief' an advocate when specialist [[litigation]], is required.

The split between ''attorney'' and ''advocate'' in South Africa mirrors the split between [[solicitor]] and [[barrister]] in other Commonwealth countries, with attorneys having broadly equivalent roles to solicitors and advocates having broadly equivalent roles to barristers.

'''''Balclutha''''', also known as '''''Star of Alaska''''', '''''Pacific Queen''''', or '''Sailing Ship ''Balclutha''''', is a steel-hulled [[full rigged ship]] that was built in 1886.  She is the only square rigged ship left in the [[San Francisco Bay]] area and is representative of several different commercial ventures, including lumber, salmon, and grain.  She is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] and is currently preserved at the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] in San Francisco, California.  She was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on 7 November 1976.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

==History==
''Balclutha'' was built in 1886 by [[Charles Connell and Company]] of [[Scotstoun]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], for Robert McMillan, of [[Dumbarton]], Scotland. Her namesake is said to be the eponymous town of [[Balclutha, New Zealand]], but her name also refers to her first homeport, Glasgow, Scotland, which is a "City on the [[River Clyde|Clyde]]" - the meaning of her name derived from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] ''Baile Chluaidh''. Designed as a general trader, ''Balclutha'' rounded [[Cape Horn]] 17 times in thirteen years.

During this period she carried cargoes such as wine, case oil, and coal from Europe and the [[East Coast of the United States]] to various ports in the Pacific. These included [[Chile]] for nitrate, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] for wool, [[Burma]] for rice, San Francisco for grain, and the [[Pacific Northwest]] for timber.

In 1899 ''Balclutha'' transferred to the registry of [[Hawaii]], and traded timber from the Pacific Northwest to Australia, returning to San Francisco with Australian coal.

[[File:Star of Alaska (BALCLUTHA) under sail.jpg|thumb|left|The ship sailed as the ''Star of Alaska'' between 1904 and 1930]]
In 1902 ''Balclutha'' was chartered to the [[Alaska Packers' Association]] (APA). After having struck a reef off of [[Sitkinak Island]] near [[Kodiak Island]] on 16 May 1904, she was renamed the ''Star of Alaska'' when bought by APA for merely $500. After extended repairs she joined the [[salmon]] fishing trade, sailing north from the San Francisco area to the [[Chignik Bay, Alaska|Chignik Bay]], Alaska, in April with supplies, fishermen, and cannery workers, and returned in September with a cargo of canned salmon.

For this trade she carried over 200 crew and passengers, as compared to the 26-man crew she carried as the ''Balclutha''. In 1911 the poop deck was extended to the main mast to accommodate Italian and Scandinavian workers. This expansion is called the shelter deck. In the 'tween deck, bunks for Chinese workers were built. Her last voyage in this trade was in 1930, when she then was laid up after her return home.

In 1933, ''Star of Alaska'' was renamed ''Pacific Queen'' by her new owner Frank Kissinger. In this guise she appeared in the film ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Charles Laughton]]. She then eked out an existence as an exhibition ship, gradually deteriorating, and was for a while exhibited as a "pirate ship".

In 1954, ''Pacific Queen'' was acquired by the San Francisco Maritime Museum, which restored her and renamed her ''Balclutha'' and moored her at [[Pier 41|Pier 41 East]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photosecrets.com/balclutha-ship Balclutha - photosecrets.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 she was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;{{cite web

It was first published in 2010. The index ranks the combined infrastructure assets in the hands of the biggest public and private organisations.

In contrary to the [[Forbes Global 2000]] ranking, the Bentley Infrastructure 500 ranks companies according to their reported [[Asset|tangible fixed assets]] (or other comparable noncurrent physical assets such as buildings or fixed structures, land, and machinery) - and is a direct measure of the infrastructure owned and operated by an organization. The aim of the ranking is to help global constituents appreciate and explore the magnitude of investment in infrastructure and the potential to continually increase the return on that investment. The Infrastructure 500 index also takes into consideration governments and states.

Infrastructure Value above as measured by reported net tangible fixed assets.

==Key findings==
The Bentley Infrastructure 500 index shows little correlation with the Forbes 2000 - showing that the biggest companies in the world are not necessarily the biggest owners of fixed assets.

The 2010 study showed that the combines assets of all the 500 companies add up to US$ 13 trillion, which is equivalent to annual GDP of the United States.

'''''Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time''''' was a two-hour television special that aired on March 22, 2011, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States. Hosted by [[Tom Bergeron]] and [[Cynthia McFadden]], it was a collaboration between [[ABC News]] and ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine that gave American film fans the chance to choose their favorite movies of all time. The results were presented on the program, which included interviews with some of the stars and directors of the chosen films including [[Harrison Ford]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], and [[Olivia Newton-John]]. It also showed out-takes, screen tests and behind-the-scenes footage.

''People'' magazine featured a story that corresponded with the special in its March 28, 2011, issue, which came out on March 18.

The categories for the special were Best Film, Best Sci-Fi Film, Best Musical, Best Action Film, Greatest Film Character, Best Horror Film, Best Chick Flick, Greatest Screen Kiss, Best Comedy, Best Animated Film, Best Suspense/Thriller, Most Romantic Screen Couple, Greatest Line, Best Western Film and Best Political/Historical Film.

To vote for their favorite films, movie fans went online at abcnews.com and people.com to select the winners from a list of nominees created by a group of film industry experts.

The televised special counted down the top five films in 10 of the 15 categories: Best Comedy, Best Sci-Fi Film, Best Musical, Greatest Screen Kiss, Greatest Line, Best Action Film, Best Suspense/Thriller, Best Animated Film, Greatest Film Character and Best Film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4264">A '''big boy letter''' is a pre-sale agreement  in connection with a private sale of [[securities]] (such as in a [[private investment in public equity|PIPE]] transaction) not to sue over non-disclosure of material inside information that is not disclosed, entered into between two [[Accredited investor|sophisticated parties]]. Big boy provisions may also be contained within securities purchase agreements, rather than being the subject of a separate letter agreement. Generally, a seller's request that a buyer agree to a big boy letter is a signal to the sophisticated buyer that there is likely to be [[Insider trading|material non-public information]] that exists concerning a security, which could give rise to a lawsuit brought by the buyer if it was not disclosed, in the absence of the letter.

==Controversy==
The legality of big boy letters themselves in the United States Securities markets is a matter of dispute.  This is because the primary lawsuit parties seek to avoid with such letters is one under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], which contains a provision, Section 29(a), that waivers of liability for securities fraud are void.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], which includes the financial District of [[New York (state)|New York]], has enforced agreements similar to big boy letters strictly against the buyer.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]], which includes [[Delaware]], which is the state of incorporation for many publicly held companies, has given greater weight to the anti-waiver provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, although it has not completely ignored these agreements in considering all facts and circumstances of a transaction.  As of 2008, Commissioners and staff from the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] have expressed concern about the legal enforceability of big boy letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.morganlewis.com/~/media/559f00c122414562aef4197237935eee.ashx |title=Exchange Act Does Not Prohibit Big Boy Letters |date=December 16, 2014 |author=Susan DiCicco |publisher=Portfolio Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two commissioners have stated that even if the letters provide a defense in private securities litigation, that they are not a defense in an SEC enforcement action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgsh.com/news/newsdetail.aspx?news=231 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719011335/http://www.cgsh.com/news/newsdetail.aspx?news=231 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Even more controversial than the letters themselves is the practice of buying securities subject to a big boy letter and then reselling the securities to a third party without disclosing the existence of the "big boy letter." This practice is the subject of ongoing litigation and debate among persons familiar with securities markets.  Some argue that there is no duty to disclose the existence of the letter, because the buyer doesn't have any specific information.  Others argue that there is a duty to disclose the existence of a "big boy letter" because it strongly suggests that some material non-public information exists, even if the exact nature of that information is unknown, and that this practice, in effect, constitutes [[insider trading]].

The '''Breast Tax''' (''Mulakkaram'' or ''mula-karam'' in [[Malayalam]]) was a tax imposed on the [[Dalit|untouchable]] (outcaste) women in [[Travancore]] (in present-day [[Kerala]] state of India), until 1924. The untouchable (''avarna'') women were expected to pay the government a tax on their [[breast]]s, as soon as they started developing breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=K.S.

The outcaste women were not allowed to wear clothes covering their upper body in the public.&lt;ref name="Jacob_1990"/&gt; The law resulted from Travancore's tradition, in which the breast was bared as a symbol of respect to higher-status people. For example, the [[Nair]]s bared their breasts to the upper-caste [[Nambudiri]] [[Brahmin]]s, while the Brahmins bared their breasts only to the images of the deities. The people of the even lower castes, such as [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]] (or Shanars), were not allowed cover their breasts at all. With the spread of [[Christianity]] in the 19th century, the Christian converts among the Nadar women started covering their upper body, and gradually, even the Hindu Nadar women adopted this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert L.

This is a list of '''file synchronization software'''. [[File synchronization]] is a process of ensuring that files in two or more locations are updated via certain rules.

==Definitions==
The following definitions clarify the purpose of columns used in the tables that follow.

{{glossary}}
{{term|term=Name}}
{{defn|defn=It may contain a product name, or product name plus edition name, depending on what is discussed.}}
{{term|term=Operating system}}
{{term|term=Platform|multi=y}}
{{defn|defn=An [[Operating system]] (OS) manages the other programs on a computer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/#book-chapters|title=Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces|website=pages.cs.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;; most personal computers have an OS installed. The operating system column lists the name of the operating systems on which the corresponding synchronization software runs. [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] is a broader term; it is used as the column name because some of the software in the table were OS-independent but required a certain [[software platform]] like [[Java SE]] or [[.NET Framework]].}}
{{term|term=Programming language}}
{{defn|defn=Programming language was used to write the software, if known.  For closed-source software this information may not be known.}}
{{term|term=License}}
{{defn|defn=Indicates the licensing model under which the software is published.  For open source systems this may be the [[Comparison of free software licenses|specific license]] (i.e. GPL, LGPL, MIT, etc.), for closed source/proprietary/commercial software this may be the model (subscription per user, perpetual per device, etc.)}}
{{term|term=Portable}}
{{defn|defn=If yes, the program is designed to run without needing to modify the configuration of the computer it is run on.  The name 'portable' comes from the fact that these applications are intended to be able to be carried with the user on a portable drive and run on any computer it was designed to run on, even if the user does not have administrative privileges on the computer.  See [[Portable application|Portable Applications]].}}
{{term|term=Detect conflict}}
{{defn|defn=Indicates whether the software will detect if the requested operation may result in data loss.  See [[File synchronization|File Synchronization]]}}
{{term|term=Renames/moves}}
{{defn|defn=When a file/directory in given side of the synchronization is renamed/moved, the program repeats renaming/moving the file/directory to the other side of the synchronization. This feature saves bandwidth when operating on remote systems but increases the analysis duration. Programs that support this feature commonly do so by calculating and storing hash values of each file so they can detect if two files with different names, modification dates, etc., are identical in terms of their content. Programs which do not support this feature, will behave as if the originally-named file/directory has been deleted and the newly named file/directory is brand new and transmit the "new" file over to the other side again.}}
{{term|term=Prior file versions, revision control}}
{{defn|defn=Indicates whether the software allows one to revert to an earlier version of a particular file/directory.}}
{{term|term=Scheduling or service}}
{{defn|defn=Indicates whether the software will run automatically either via a scheduler, or by running as a system service.  If no, a user must invoke the software manually each time a synchronization is needed.}}
{{term|term=Online storage}}
{{defn|defn=Is there an [[online file storage]] option?  If so, what type?}}
{{term|term=Other Information}}
{{defn|defn=Notes that help clarify features already covered in other columns, or additional information that differentiates this software from the competition.}}
{{term|term=NAS share mobilisation}}
{{defn|defn=Indicates whether the software allows mobile devices pass-through access to NAS shares.}}
{{glossary end}}

==Open-source==
This is a comparison of the [[free and open-source]] file synchronization software.

* {{note|native}} Providing any virtual environment usually requires some overhead of some type or another. Native usually means that the virtualization technique does not do any CPU level virtualization (like Bochs), which executes code more slowly than when it is directly executed by a CPU. Some other products such as VMWare and Virtual PC use similar approaches to Bochs and QEMU, however they use a number of advanced techniques to shortcut most of the calls directly to the CPU (similar to the process that JIT compiler uses) to bring the speed to near native in most cases. However, some products such as coLinux, Xen, z/VM (in real mode) do not suffer the cost of CPU-level slowdowns as the CPU-level instructions are not proxied or executing against an emulated architecture since the guest OS or hardware is providing the environment for the applications to run under. However access to many of the other resources on the system, such as devices and memory may be proxied or emulated in order to broker those shared services out to all the guests, which may cause some slow downs as compared to running outside of virtualization.
* {{note|osvirt}} OS-level virtualization is described as "native" speed, however some groups have found overhead as high as 3% for some operations, but generally figures come under 1%, so long as secondary effects do not appear.
* {{note|parav}} See&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt; for a paper comparing performance of paravirtualization approaches (e.g. Xen) with OS-level virtualization
* {{note|patch}} Requires patches/recompiling.
* {{note|zvm_performance}}Exceptional for lightweight, [[Paravirtualization|paravirtualized]], single-user VM/CMS interactive shell: largest customers run several thousand users on even single prior models. For multiprogramming OSes like [[Linux on zSeries]] and [[z/OS]] that make heavy use of native supervisor state instructions, performance will vary depending on nature of workload but is near native. Hundreds into the low thousands of Linux guests are possible on a single machine for certain workloads.

Note: No limit means no enforced limit. For example, a VM with 1 TB of memory cannot fit in a host with only 8 GB memory and no memory swap disk, so it will have a limit of 8 GB physically.

[[File:MarkFelt.jpg|thumb|Mark Felt a.k.a. "Deep Throat"]]

'''Deep Throat''' is the [[pseudonym]] given to the secret informant who provided information in 1972 to [[Bob Woodward]], who shared it with [[Carl Bernstein]]. Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration in what came to be known as the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Associate Director '''[[Mark Felt]]''' was Deep Throat. Felt was suffering from dementia at the time and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein confirmed the attorney's claim.

==Identity==
Deep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by ''Washington Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]], which was adapted as a [[All the President's Men (film)|film]] two years later. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles which introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Egil Krogh]], White House Counsel [[Charles Colson]], former United States Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], [[John Dean]], and presidential adviser [[John Ehrlichman]].

[[Howard Simons]] was the managing editor of the ''Post'' during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant "Deep Throat", alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. [[J. Anthony Lukas]] speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book ''Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years'' (1976), based on three ''New York Times Sunday Magazine'' articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in ''Slate'' on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the "intelligence community" in a 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview with Lukas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Noah|Noah, Timothy]]. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/04/was_fred_fielding_deep_throat.html "Was Fred Fielding Deep Throat?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', April 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, 2005, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt reportedly said, "I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat." After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the ''Post''{{'}}s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt's identity as Deep Throat.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bob. ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Patrick Gray]], former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's boss, disputed Felt's claim in his book ''In Nixon's Web'', co-written with his son Ed Gray. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person in order to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt's claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward's book ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat''.

==Role in the Watergate scandal==
{{Main|Watergate scandal}}
{{Watergate|Intelligence}}

On June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. In their possession were $2,300, burglary tools, a walkie-talkie, a radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras, 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, electronic devices which they apparently intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official [[E. Howard Hunt]]. One of the men was [[James W. McCord Jr.]], a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] employee and a security man for Nixon's [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] (popularly known as "CREEP").

''Washington Post'' reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of the Nixon White House, and Nixon became the only US president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in ''All the President's Men'' that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed "Deep Throat".

===Methods of communication===
Woodward, in ''All the President's Men'', first mentions Deep Throat on page 71; earlier in the book he reports calling "an old friend and sometimes source who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office". Later, he describes him as "a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House". The book also calls him "an incurable gossip", "in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch", and a man "whose fight had been worn out in too many battles".

Woodward claimed that he would signal to "Deep Throat" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When Deep Throat wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]''; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met "on the bottom level of an underground [[parking garage|garage]] just over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]]", at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has an historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=|title='Deep Throat' garage from U.S. Watergate scandal to be razed|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/15/usa-watergate-garage-idUSL2N0OW0J320140615|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=Reuters|date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017}}, the garage had not been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Karen|title=Monday Properties asks for more time to redevelop 'Deep Throat' garage|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/03/13/monday-properties-asks-for-more-time-to-redevelop.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Washington Business Journal|date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many were skeptical of these [[cloak and dagger]] methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 [[biography]] of Woodward and Bernstein, and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward's apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said anyone regularly checking the balcony, as "Deep Throat" was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of ''The New York Times'' were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack at the building's reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off, and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward's copy of ''The New York Times'' had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the ''Times'', claiming, "I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy."&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10328832"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10328832 |title=New Zealand man's Deep Throat mystery solved |date=June 3, 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called "Deep Throat" on the telephone at his home.

===Controversy over motives===
In public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt's family called him an "American hero", stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to ''The Washington Post'' for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.

In his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist and admirer of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when [[L. Patrick Gray]], a career naval officer and lawyer from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], with no prior law enforcement experience, was appointed Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the Bureau. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, he methodically leaked information to Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.

Some conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]], castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office.&lt;ref name="traitor"&gt;Morgan, Dan (June 1, 2005). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053101420.html "Contemporaries Have Mixed Views"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelation of identity==
Although confirmation of Deep Throat's identity remained elusive for over 30 years, there were suspicions that Felt was indeed the reporters' mysterious source long before the public acknowledgment in 2005.
*In ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', Max Holland reports that Felt leaked to two major sources, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''. While the ''Post'' reporters didn't reveal their source, ''TIME'' [[correspondent]] Sandy Smith told ''TIME''{{'}}s lawyer, [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]] partner [[Roswell Gilpatric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; who told Assistant [[Attorney General]] of the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division]] [[Harry E. Peterson]], who, in turn, revealed it to [[White House Counsel]] [[John W. Dean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/26/AR2005062600974.html | work=Washington Post | title=Revenge Was Felt's Motive, Former Acting FBI Chief Says | author=Michael Dobbs | date=June 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported it to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; who did not publicly mention learning it. Nixon's stated rationale was: if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information damaging to the FBI and to other powerful people and institutions. Nixon stated, at the time, Felt "knows everything there is to know in the FBI". Nixon's motives in not outing Felt may not have been entirely altruistic, since Nixon would also have been damaged by Felt's potential revelations.  
*[[George V. Higgins]] wrote in 1975: "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Carl Bernstein did not even share Deep Throat's identity with his immediate family, which included his wife, writer [[Nora Ephron]]. (As he said on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' on June 2, 2005, "I was never dumb enough to tell her...which was very smart because I would have told the whole world by now.") His wife became obsessed with figuring out the secret and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050603041501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 3, 2005 | work=Huffington Post | first=Nora | last=Ephron | title=Deep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told and Not for the First Time Either | date=May 9, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had previously been revealed that Deep Throat was definitely a man. In 1999, a 19-year-old college freshman, Chase Culeman-Beckman, claimed to have been told by Bernstein's son that Mark Felt was really Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was "100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He's someone in the FBI." Jacob had reportedly said this approximately 11 years prior, when he and Chase Culeman-Beckman were classmates. His wife explained that their son overheard her "speculations"; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, but many did not believe these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1999-07-28/news/9907280810_1_deep-throat-woodward-s-secret-source-summer-camp|title=Deep Throat|work=tribunedigital-thecourant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*James Mann, who had worked at the ''Post'' at the time of Watergate and was close to the investigation, brought a great deal of evidence together in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199205/mann "Deep Throat: An Institutional Analysis"], ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Mann recalled that prior to the Watergate scandal, Woodward had made references to a high-placed source he had in the FBI. Mann argued that the information that Deep Throat gave Woodward could only have come from FBI files. Felt was also embittered at having been passed over for Director of the FBI and believed that the FBI in general was hostile to the Nixon administration. In previous unrelated articles, Woodward had made clear he had a highly placed source at the FBI, and there is some evidence he was friends with Felt.
*Woodward had kept in close touch with Felt over the years, even showing up unexpectedly at his house in 1999, after Felt's [[dementia]] began and at the home of Felt's daughter, Joan, in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. Some suspected at that time that Woodward might be asking Felt if he could reveal him as Deep Throat, though Felt, when asked directly by others, had consistently denied being Deep Throat.
*In 2002, [[Timothy Noah]] called Felt "the best guess going about the identity of Deep Throat".&lt;ref&gt;Noah, Timothy. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/05/why_did_bob_woodward_lunch_with_mark_felt_in_1999.html "Why Did Bob Woodward Lunch With Mark Felt in 1999?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', May 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1976, Assistant Attorney General [[John Stanley Pottinger]] had convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate a series of potentially illegal break-ins that Felt had authorized against various dissident groups. Felt was testifying before the jury when a juror asked him, out of the blue, "Are you Deep Throat?" Pottinger reports that Felt "went white with fear". Pottinger explained to Felt that he was under oath and would have to answer truthfully, but since Pottinger felt the question was outside the purview of the investigation, he offered to withdraw it if Felt wished.

In February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that "Deep Throat" was ailing and that Bradlee had written Deep Throat's obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of ''The Washington Post'', [[Leonard Downie]], denied these claims. Felt was something of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Henry Kissinger]], then-Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], General [[Alexander Haig]], and before it was revealed that "Deep Throat" was definitely not female, [[Diane Sawyer]].

On May 31, 2005, ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as "Deep Throat".&lt;ref name=VanityFair_31May2005_OConnor_DeepThoat&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through ''The Washington Post'' confirming that the story was true.

On June 2, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' ran a lengthy front-page column&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost_02May2005_Woodward_DeepThoat&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate. Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970, when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s who was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House's West Wing. Felt arrived soon after, for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation, eventually learning of Felt's position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to get out of the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a [[mentor]] and career advisor, and so he got Felt's phone number and kept in touch with him.

After deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined ''The Washington Post'' in August 1971. Felt, who Woodward writes had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a ''Washington Post'' story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on [[Arthur Bremer]], who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate [[George C. Wallace]]; Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward would call Felt at his office, marking the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.

Commenting on Felt's motivations for serving as his Deep Throat source, Woodward wrote, "Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons."

In 1980, Felt himself was convicted of ordering illegal break-ins at the homes of [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] suspects and their families. Richard Nixon testified on his behalf. President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and the conviction was subsequently expunged from the record.

==Composite character theory==
Prior to Felt's revelation and Woodward's confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is because no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in ''All the President's Men''. This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=David |date=June 1, 2005 |title=Throat Clearing; Watergate conspiracy theories that still won't die. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2005/06/throat_clearing.single.html |newspaper=Slate |location= |publisher= |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by [[David Obst]], the agent who originally marketed the draft for ''All the President's Men'', who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained absolutely no reference to Deep Throat.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; It also led to speculation that the authors played at condensing history in the same way [[Hollywood]] scriptwriters do.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;

Ed Gray, the son of [[L. Patrick Gray III]], stated in ''In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate'' that his examination of Woodward's interview notes pertaining to Deep Throat at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] provided "convincing evidence that 'Deep Throat' was indeed a fabrication".&lt;ref name="Gray &amp; Gray"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gray III |first1=L. Patrick |authorlink=L.

Regarding Gray's allegations, Woodward wrote that the March 24 notes were obviously not from an interview with Felt because Felt is referred to by name twice in quotes from the source, and that he never stated or wrote that he met with Deep Throat on that date.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bobwoodward.com/full-biography#Deep_Throat_Revealed |title=Full Biography |last1=Woodward |first1=Bob |date= |website=bobwoodward.com |publisher=Bob Woodward |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Woodward, Mielke said the page was likely misfiled under Felt due to a lack of source.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

==Other suspected candidates==

===Fred Fielding===
Another leading candidate was White House Associate Counsel [[Fred F. Fielding]]. In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by [[William Gaines (professor)|William Gaines]] and his journalism students, as part of a class at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] journalism school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194614/http://archive.deepthroatuncovered.com/ Deep Throat: Uncovered] (archived), Department of Journalism, University of Illinois&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Who_Was_Deep_Throat.html Who Was Deep Throat?], ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines felt that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat's being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.

Dean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and [[Leonard Garment]] dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.

One reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that "Deep Throat" worked in the intelligence community:

: LUKAS: Do you resent the implication by some critics that your sources on Watergate—among them the fabled Deep Throat—may have been people in the intelligence community?

: WOODWARD: I resent it because it's untrue.&lt;ref&gt;Noah, Timothy. [http://www.slate.com/id/2119870/ "Deep Throat, Antihero: His unmasking makes everybody look a little less noble"], ''Slate'', May 31, 2005. Quote from ''Playboy'' interview, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other credible candidates===
Any candidate who died before the Felt admission ceased to fit Woodward's criteria at that time, since Woodward had stated that he was free to reveal his identity when "Deep Throat" died.

===Less credible candidates===
* [[William Rehnquist]]: Late [[Chief Justice of the United States]], had a position in the Department of Justice early in the Nixon administration, working for [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]]. More than five months before the Watergate break-in, he was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and it would have been almost impossible for him to have had access to much of the information attributed to "Deep Throat". In February 2005, Dean reported that "Deep Throat" was ailing, and Rehnquist was known to be suffering from cancer, which caused his death later that year. The report caused a resurgence of speculation that Rehnquist was "Deep Throat". However, Woodward later stated that the notion that "Deep Throat" was ailing had been a misunderstanding.
* [[Henry Kissinger]]: Nixon's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], was out of the country on some of the dates Woodward reported to have met with "Deep Throat".
* [[George H. W. Bush]]: Was nominated in February 2005 by [[Adrian Havill]]–author of a 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, ''Deep Truth'' ({{ISBN|1-55972-172-3}})-following the unveiling of Woodward's notes at the [[University of Texas System|University of Texas]]. Havill had argued in his biography that "Deep Throat" was a composite figure, but stated in a letter to ''[[Poynter Online]]'' that based on more recent events and research, he now believed "Deep Throat" was George H. W. Bush.
* General [[Alexander Haig]]: Authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin speculated in their 1991 book ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'' that Haig may have been "Deep Throat". Died in 2010.
* [[Diane Sawyer]]: Was hired by White House press secretary Ron Ziegler to serve in the Richard Nixon Administration. On his deathbed, Nixon supporter [[Baruch Korff]] wrongly claimed that Sawyer was Deep Throat.
* [[Ben Stein]]: A Nixon speech writer and the son of Nixon economic advisor [[Herbert Stein]]; later an [[actor]], political commentator, and [[game show host]].
* [[Gerald R. Ford]]: Suggestion that Ford may have been Deep Throat as he was next in line for the presidency.
* [[Pat Buchanan]]: Served as special assistant to the President, was nominated as a potential candidate by Dean in his June 2002 book ''Unmasking Deep Throat''. Buchanan repeatedly denied the claim, stating in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article on the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in that "The last time I cooperated with ''The Washington Post''...was in 1952, when I was a paper boy delivering the damn thing in Northwest Washington." Buchanan was very interested in the mystery, however, and had a number of theories. He was most sympathetic to the idea of a composite Deep Throat.
* [[Richard Nixon]] himself: There was some suggestion that Nixon had used back-channels to communicate with Woodward in a bizarre attempt to showcase his persecution by the media which backfired horrifically. This theory was largely discredited.
* [[J. Fred Buzhardt]]: White House counsel to President Nixon.
* [[G. Gordon Liddy]]: Member of the [[White House Plumbers]]. Largely dismissed.

==Fictional portrayals==
===Films===
* [[Hal Holbrook]] portrayed Deep Throat in the film adaptation of ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), in which he uttered the catchphrase, "[[Follow the money]]".
* In the comedy film ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]'' (1999), Deep Throat is revealed as being two teenage Washingtonian girls, portrayed by [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], who worked as Nixon's dog walkers.
* In the Nickelodeon animated film ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]'' (2002), Helga Pataki takes on a similar role under the guise of Deep Voice. She is a shadowy character who aids Arnold and Gerald in trying to save the neighborhood from the evil developer Alphonse Perrier du von Scheck through a series of anonymous phone calls and cryptic advice. At the end of the film her identity is revealed, and she finally confesses her love to Arnold and successfully saves the neighborhood.
* In the [[Spy film|spy]] [[thriller film]] ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'' (2017), [[Liam Neeson]] portrays [[Mark Felt]].

===Games===
*In the video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' (1998), the cyborg ninja informant [[Gray Fox (Metal Gear)|Gray Fox]] goes by the name Deepthroat until revealing his identity to protagonist [[Solid Snake]].
**Similarly, in the sequel, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' (2001), the name is briefly assumed by [[List of Metal Gear characters#Olga Gurlukovich|Olga Gurlukovich]], until the protagonist [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] realises her connection to Gray Fox of the previous game, at which point she uses the less explicit name "Mr. X", instead.

===Literature===
* In Terry Pratchett's   [[Discworld]] novel ''The Truth'' (2000), in a reference to or parody of Deep Throat, the talking dog Gaspode takes on the role of Deep Bone, acting as an informant to the novel's protagonist William de Worde regarding the attempted framing of Patrician Vetinari.

===Television===
* In the ''[[Fairly OddParents]]'' episode "[[Channel Chasers]]", Tootie uses the "Deep Toot" undercover persona to help out Mr. and Mrs. Turner against Vicky.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Deep Throats]]", [[Kermit the Frog]] plays a similar role to provide evidence of [[Mayor West|Mayor Adam West]]'s corruption to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]].
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]", [[Waylon Smithers]] played a similar role to Deep Throat's when covertly helping the Simpson children find a way to depose the newly elected mayor of Springfield, Sideshow Bob (he even paraphrased one of Deep Throat's statements).
*''[[The X-Files]]'' featured an informant who used the name "[[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]" to leak information to [[Agent Mulder]] in early episodes in a manner similar to the meetings described by Woodward. It is never specifically mentioned whether he was intended to be the same Deep Throat from Watergate.
* In season 1 of [[Lois and Clark the New Adventures of Superman]] Perry White has a Government contact called Sore Throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0635154/|title=Honeymoon in Metropolis|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Frasier]], season 4 episode 11 "[[Three Days of the Condo]]", [[Frasier Crane|Fraiser]] meets a secretive informant in an underground parking garage who supplies him with information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8679">'''Dhrystone''' is a [[#Dhrystone_vs._Whetstone|synthetic]] computing [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] program developed in 1984 by [[Reinhold P. Weicker]] intended to be representative of system (integer) programming. The Dhrystone grew to become representative of general processor ([[CPU]]) performance. The name "Dhrystone" is a pun on a different benchmark algorithm called [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pun]]: [[Whetstone, Leicestershire|w'''h'''etstone]] → wet stone → dry stone → d'''h'''rystone.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Dhrystone, Weicker gathered meta-data from a broad range of software, including programs written in [[FORTRAN]], [[PL/1]], SAL, [[ALGOL 68]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. He then characterized these programs in terms of various common constructs: procedure calls, pointer [[indirection]]s, assignments, etc. From this he wrote the Dhrystone benchmark to correspond to a representative mix.  Dhrystone was published in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], with the [[C (programming language)|C]] version for [[Unix]] developed by Rick Richardson ("version 1.1") greatly contributing to its popularity.

==Dhrystone vs. Whetstone ==
The Dhrystone benchmark contains no [[floating point]] operations, thus the name is a pun on the then-popular [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone]] benchmark for floating point operations. The output from the benchmark is the number of Dhrystones per second (the number of iterations of the main code loop per second).

Both Whetstone and Dhrystone are ''synthetic'' benchmarks, meaning that they are simple programs that are carefully designed to statistically mimic the processor usage of some common set of programs. Whetstone, developed in 1972, originally strove to mimic typical Algol 60 programs based on measurements from 1970, but eventually became most popular in its Fortran version, reflecting the highly numerical orientation of computing in the 1960s.

==Issues addressed by Dhrystone==
Dhrystone's eventual importance as an indicator of general-purpose ("integer") performance of new computers made it a target for commercial compiler writers. Various modern compiler [[static code analysis]] techniques (such as [[dead code elimination|elimination of dead code]]: for example, code which uses the processor but produces internal results which are not used or output) make the use and design of synthetic benchmarks more difficult. Version 2.0 of the benchmark, released by Weicker and Richardson in March 1988, had a number of changes intended to foil a range of compiler techniques. Yet it was carefully crafted so as not to change the underlying benchmark.  This effort to foil compilers was only partly successful.  Dhrystone 2.1, released in May of the same year, had some minor changes and {{As of|2010|7|lc=on}} remains the current definition of Dhrystone.

Other than issues related to compiler optimization, various other issues have been cited with the Dhrystone. Most of these, including the small code size and small data set size, were understood at the time of its publication in 1984. More subtle is the slight over-representation of string operations, which is largely language-related: both Ada and Pascal have strings as normal variables in the language, whereas C does not, so what was simple variable assignment in reference benchmarks became buffer copy operations in the C library. Another issue is that the score reported does not include information which is critical when comparing systems such as which compiler was used, and what optimizations.

Dhrystone remains remarkably resilient as a simple benchmark, but its continuing value in establishing true performance is questionable.  It is easy to use, well documented, fully self-contained, well understood, and can be made to work on almost any system.  In particular, it has remained in broad use in the embedded computing world, though the recently developed '''[[EEMBC]]''' benchmark suite, HINT, Stream, and even Bytemark are widely quoted and used, as well as more specific benchmarks for the memory subsystem (Cachebench), TCP/IP (TTCP), and many others.

Dhrystone remains in use 30 years after it was designed by Weicker, a longer life than most software.

==Dhrystone vs. CoreMark==
[[CoreMark]] is a small benchmark released by the non-profit Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium ([[EEMBC]]) in 2009, that targets the CPU core, similar to Dhrystone. Both benchmarks are available free of charge and are small enough to execute on any processor, including small micro-controllers. CoreMark avoids issues such as the compiler computing the work during compile time, and uses real algorithms rather than being completely synthetic. CoreMark also has established rules for running the benchmark and for reporting the results.

==Results ==
Dhrystone may represent a result more meaningfully than MIPS (million instructions per second) because instruction count comparisons between different instruction sets (e.g. [[RISC]] vs. [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]]) can confound simple comparisons.  For example, the same high-level task may require many more instructions on a RISC machine, but might execute faster than a single CISC instruction.  Thus, the Dhrystone score counts only the number of program iteration completions per second, allowing individual machines to perform this calculation in a machine-specific way.  Another common representation of the Dhrystone benchmark is the '''DMIPS''' (Dhrystone [[million instructions per second|MIPS]]) obtained when the Dhrystone score is divided by 1757 (the number of Dhrystones per second obtained on the [[VAX|VAX 11/780]], nominally a 1 MIPS machine).

Another way to represent results is in DMIPS/MHz, where DMIPS result is further divided by CPU frequency, to allow for easier comparison of CPUs running at different [[clock rate]]s.

==Shortcomings==
Using Dhrystone as a benchmark has pitfalls: 
* it features unusual code that is not usually representative of real-life programs&lt;ref name="crit1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.johnloomis.org/NiosII/dhrystone/ECLDhrystoneWhitePaper.pdf | last=Weiss | first=Alan | title=Dhrystone Benchmark: History, Analysis, "Scores" and Recommendations | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726210001/http://www.johnloomis.org/NiosII/dhrystone/ECLDhrystoneWhitePaper.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* it is susceptible to compiler optimizations. For example, it does a lot of string copying in an attempt to measure string copying performance. However, the strings in Dhrystone are of known constant length and their starts are aligned on natural boundaries, two characteristics usually absent from real programs. Therefore, an optimizer can replace a string copy with a sequence of word moves without any loops, which will be much faster. This optimization consequently overstates system performance, sometimes by more than 30%{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.
* Dhrystone's small code size may fit in the [[instruction cache]] of a modern CPU, so that [[instruction fetch]] performance is not rigorously tested.&lt;ref name="crit1" /&gt;

'''Elizabeth Gertrude Britton''' (née '''Knight''') (January 9, 1858 – February 25, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] [[botanist]], [[bryologist]], and educator.  She and her husband, [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] played a significant role in the fundraising and creation of the [[New York Botanical Garden]].  She was a co-founder of the predecessor to the [[American Bryological and Lichenological Society]]. She was an activist for protection of wildflowers, inspiring local chapter activities and the passage of legislation.  Elizabeth Britton made major contributions to the literature of mosses, publishing 170 papers in that field.

==Early life and family==
Elizabeth Gertrude Knight was born on January 9, 1858 in [[New York City]], one of five daughters, to James and Sophie Anne (née Compton) Knight.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=97}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=125}}&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica|title=Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/80448/Elizabeth-Gertrude-Knight-Britton|publisher=Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica|accessdate=30 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006113216/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/80448/Elizabeth-Gertrude-Knight-Britton|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her family operated a furniture factory and sugar plantation in the vicinity of [[Matanzas, Cuba]], and she spent much of her childhood there.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=97}}  In later childhood, she attended a private school in New York; she then attended [[Hunter College|Normal College]] (later, Hunter College) and was graduated from there in 1875, at the early age of seventeen.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=97}} On August 27, 1885 she married [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]], an Assistant in Geology at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]] who shared her growing interest in botany.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=98}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=126}}  The couple had no children.{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=131}}

==Career==
After graduation in 1875, Elizabeth Knight joined the staff of Normal College as a critic teacher.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=97}}  She joined the [[Torrey Botanical Club]] in 1879,{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=97}} and in 1881 she published her first scientific paper in that organization's ''Bulletin'', reporting observations of unexpected white flowers in two species of plants.&lt;ref name=barnhart /&gt;&lt;ref name=knight-albinism&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knight|first1=Elizabeth G.|title=Albinism|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|date=November 1881|volume=8|issue=11|page=125|jstor=2475890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also observed the presence of a curlygrass fern, [[Schizaea pusilla]], in [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="nybg" /&gt;  In 1883, she was named a Tutor in Natural Science.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=97}} At that time, she began to specialize in [[bryology]] and her first paper concerning mosses appeared. Elizabeth collected fertile specimens of [[Eustichium norvegicum]] in [[Wisconsin]] and wrote the first description of its fruits; known since 1827, the plant had hitherto been known only in a sterile condition.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|pp=97–98}}

After her marriage in 1885, Elizabeth Britton resigned her teaching position at Normal College, and took charge of the moss collections at Columbia in an unofficial, unpaid capacity.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=98}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|pp=126,131}}  She served as editor of the ''Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club'' from 1886 to 1888;{{sfnp|Steere|1971|p=244}} in 1889, she published the first of an eleven-part series of papers titled "Contributions to American Bryology" in that journal.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=98}}  Her catalogue of the mosses of [[West Virginia]] appeared in 1892, and the first of eight articles titled "How to Study the Mosses" for a popular magazine was published in 1894.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=98}}  These papers "sufficed to place Mrs. Britton in command of the bryological field in America."{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=98}}  Showing skills away from the lab as well, she worked with her husband to acquire  for Columbia the moss herbarium of [[August Jaeger (botanist)|August Jaeger]]  (1842–1877) of Switzerland; Elizabeth persuaded wealthy friends to contribute the necessary $6000.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=98}}{{sfnp|Slack|1987|p=99}}&lt;ref name=nybg-bryology&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryology at the New York Botanical Garden|url=http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/Bryology.asp.html|publisher=The New York Botanical Garden|accessdate=10 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013201745/http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/Bryology.asp.html|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Britton, along with her husband, was one of the Torrey Botanical Club members who spurred the establishment of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG).  As the story goes, the couple had traveled to England in 1888.  Nathaniel was performing research at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], in order to classify the Bolivian botanical collections of [[Henry Hurd Rusby]], a gift to Columbia; meanwhile, Elizabeth worked on mosses at the [[Linnaean Society of London]].{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=126}}&lt;ref name=nybg&gt;{{cite web|title=ELIZABETH GERTRUDE KNIGHT BRITTON RECORDS (1882-1934)|url=http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/libr/finding_guide/egbweb.asp|publisher=New York Botanical Garden|date=2003|accessdate=22 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418195446/http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/libr/finding_guide/egbweb.asp|archivedate=18 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired by the quality and quantity of Kew's herbarium, library, and gardens, the couple set about organizing an institution of comparable stature for New York.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=102}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=127}}  A Club meeting was held in October, 1888; rich and prominent citizens were recruited as incorporators; and the Botanical Garden was established by act of the state legislature in 1891.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=102}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=127}}   Elizabeth was a prime mover in the efforts to raise funds for the organization in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=nybg /&gt; Nathaniel became the first Director-in-Chief of the Botanical Garden in 1896; Elizabeth joined him in a volunteer capacity.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=102}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=127}}  It was largely through her interest that the collection of [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s and mosses of [[William Mitten]] was acquired for the NYBG in 1906.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=102}}  In recognition of her service, Britton was named Honorary Curator of the Mosses in 1912, a post which she held until her death.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=102}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|pp=129–130}}

Elizabeth enumerated the ferns in the Rusby collection in 1888.  After extensive research, comparison with the specimens at Kew and elsewhere, and consultations with other bryologists, she published her enumeration of the Rusby mosses in 1896.&lt;ref name="britton-rusby"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britton|first1=Elizabeth G.|title=An Enumeration of the Plants Collected by H.

Britton traveled to various locations in the continental United States to collect botanical specimens, including the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], the [[Adirondack Mountains]], and the mountains of [[North Carolina]].{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=128}}  She accompanied Nathaniel on 23 of the 25 trips he made to the islands of the [[Caribbean]] and [[West Indies]].{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=130}}  Under her own name, she published her findings in the ''Bulletin'' in 1913–1915.  Elizabeth wrote the chapters concerning mosses for Nathaniel's ''Flora of Bermuda'' and ''The Bahama Flora''.{{sfnp|Britton|1918|p=xi}}{{sfnp|Britton|Millspaugh|1920|p=viii}}

Elizabeth worked with organizations to promote the study of mosses, especially by women scientists.  She chaired the division of bryophyta for the (Women's) National Science Club (NWSC) in 1897.{{sfnp|Kass|1997|p=52}}

As part of her unofficial position at Columbia, Britton acted as advisor to doctoral students, including [[James Frankin Collins (botanist)|James Franklin Collins]]{{sfnp|Kass|1997|p=57}} and [[Abel Joel Grout]].{{sfnp|Steere|1971|p=244}}{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=128}}  Together, in 1898 Grout and Britton founded the Sullivant Moss Chapter of the [[Agassiz Association]]; by 1908, it was known as the [[American Bryological and Lichenological Society|Sullivant Moss Society]] (and after 1949, as the American Bryological and Lichenological Society).{{sfnp|Steere|1971|p=244}}{{sfnp|Anderson|2000|pp=3–4,7,8}}  Although relations between the two researchers later became chilly, Britton continued to participate in the Society, contributing articles to ''The Bryologist'', its journal,{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=129}} and serving as its president from 1916 to 1919.{{sfnp|Steere|1971|p=244}}

Elizabeth Britton continued to study plants other than mosses.  She published "A Revision of the North American Species of ''Ophioglossum''," the [[adder's-tongue fern]]s, in 1897.  With Delia West Marble, she collected the type specimen of ''Dryopteris brittonae'', a species of [[Thelypteris|maiden fern]], in 1906.&lt;ref name=si-dryopteris&gt;{{cite web|title=Dryopteris brittonae Sloss. ex Maxon in Britton &amp; P.

In the first decade of the century, Britton began to devote energy to the [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] of [[wildflower]]s.  A gift of $3000 by Olivia Stokes and Caroline Phelps Stokes to the NYBG spurred the creation of the [[Wild Flower Preservation Society of America]].{{sfnp|Gager|1940|p=139}}  The first meeting was held on April 23, 1902; [[Frederick Vernon Coville]] was elected president, [[Charles Louis Pollard]] was elected secretary, and Britton was elected to the Board of Managers.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=100}}{{sfnp|Gager|1940|p=140}}  Other members of the board included [[Charles Edwin Bessey]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], [[William Trelease]], [[Charles Frederick Millspaugh]], and [[Alice Eastwood]].{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=100}}  Britton went on to serve as secretary and treasurer of the organization.{{sfnp|Howe|1934|p=101}} The Society established numerous local chapters.{{sfnp|Gager|1940|p=140}} It was incorporated in the state of New York in 1915, then reorganized as the Wild Flower Preservation Society in 1925, with Percy L.

In 1925, as chair of the conservation committee of the Federated Garden Clubs of New York State, Britton successfully led a [[boycott]] campaign against the common practice of harvesting wild [[American holly]] for use as a [[Christmas]] decoration; as a substitute, she promoted the [[Plant propagation|propagation]] of the plant by cuttings for commercial use.{{sfnp|Steere|1971|p=243}}

All told, during the period 1881 to 1930, Elizabeth Britton published 346 papers, of which 170 dealt with mosses.&lt;ref name=barnhart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnhart|first1=John Hendley|title=The Published Work of Elizabeth Gertrude Britton|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|date=January 1935|volume=62|issue=1|pages=1–17|jstor=2480827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She wrote descriptions of six families of mosses for the New York Botanical Garden's ''Flora of America''.  [[Marshall Avery Howe]] described Britton as "a woman of extraordinary physical and mental energy—the possessor of a remarkably quick and brilliant intellect.  She has left an enduring record in the literature of science, and her well-directed activities have had an outstanding influence in the conservation of the native flora of the United States."{{sfnp|Howe|1934|pp=102–103}}

==Recognition and legacy==
[[File:Plaque honoring Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton at New York Botanical Garden.jpg|thumb|Plaque placed in honor or Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton on the grounds of the New York Botanical Garden.]]In In 1893, Britton was the only woman among the 25 scientists nominated for charter membership in the [[Botanical Society of America]].{{sfnp|Slack|1987|p=95}}&lt;ref name=nybg /&gt;  In 1905, she was one of three bryologists appointed to the [[Nomenclature codes|nomenclature]] committee that would report to the 1910 meeting of the [[International Botanical Congress]] in [[Brussels]].{{sfnp|Bonta|1991|p=129}} In 1906, Britton was one of only nineteen women listed in the first edition of ''American Men of Science''.  Her entry was marked with an asterisk: this "starred" listing was limited to the top 1,000 scientists in the book, as determined by the editors. Britton was starred in the five editions of the book that appeared through 1933.{{sfnp|Kass|1997|p=54}}

In 1940, a memorial plaque in honor of Elizabeth Britton was installed in the new Wild Flower Garden of the New York Botanical Garden.  A gift of the New York Bird and Tree Club, it is mounted on a ten-ton boulder of Bronx schist, and its text reads, "Let those who find pleasure in this garden remember Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton, lover of wildflowers and ardent advocate of their protection".&lt;ref name=nybg-memorial&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mrs. Britton Honored in Dedication of Plaque by New York Bird and Tree Club in Wild Flower Garden|journal=Journal of the New York Botanical Garden|date=June 1940|volume=41|issue=486|pages=129–137|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/31501597|accessdate=22 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022140211/http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/31501597|archivedate=22 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden is now known as the Native Plant Garden, and the boulder as Britton Rock.&lt;ref name="rafalko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rafalko|first1=Ann|title=Morning Eye Candy: Britton Rock|url=https://www.nybg.org/blogs/plant-talk/tag/elizabeth-knight-britton/|website=Plant Talk: Inside the New York Botanical Garden|date=11 May 2013|accessdate=22 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822055601/https://www.nybg.org/blogs/plant-talk/tag/elizabeth-knight-britton/|archivedate=22 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernest Ladd''' (November 28, 1938 – March 10, 2007), [[nickname]]d "'''The Big Cat'''", was an American collegiate and professional [[American football|football]] player and a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. A standout athlete in high school, Ladd attended [[Grambling State University]] on a [[basketball]] scholarship before being drafted to the [[American Football League]]'s [[San Diego Chargers]] in 1961. Ladd found success in the AFL as one of the largest players in professional football history at 6' 9" and 315 pounds.

He helped the Chargers to four [[AFL championship]] games in five years, winning the championship with the team in 1963. He also had stints with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Houston Oilers]]. Ladd took up professional wrestling during the AFL offseason, and after a knee injury ended his football career turned to it full-time in 1969.

As a wrestler, Ladd became one of the top [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] in the business. For much of his career he played a villainous character who would arrogantly taunt both opponents and crowds. Ladd [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with many popular wrestlers of the time, including [[Wahoo McDaniel]], [[André the Giant]], [[Bobo Brazil]], [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], and [[Mr. Wrestling]]. He retired from the ring in 1986.

Ladd was inducted into the [[San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame]] in 1981, the Grambling State University Hall of Fame in 1989, and the [[WWF Hall of Fame]] in 1995.

Ladd was diagnosed with [[colon cancer]] in the winter of 2003–2004. He died on March 10, 2007 at the age of 68.

== Early life ==
Ladd was born in [[Rayville, Louisiana]] and raised in [[Orange, Texas]], where he was a high school [[football]] and [[basketball]] star.&lt;ref name=Canoe2 /&gt; His football coach was William Ray Smith, Sr., father of NFL star [[Bubba Smith]]. Ladd subsequently attended [[Grambling State University]] on a basketball scholarship.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He was the nephew of Grambling and [[Houston Oilers]] teammate [[Garland Boyette]].

==Professional football career==
Ladd was drafted in the fourth round of the [[1961 NFL Draft]] by the [[Chicago Bears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/These-Bears-draft-picks-gained-fame-in-other-areas/ec6dca7b-ad41-43ac-839c-e61e0197ecc9|title=These Bears draft picks gained fame in other areas|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also taken by the [[American Football League]]'s [[San Diego Chargers]] with their 15th pick (119th overall) in the 1961 AFL draft.&lt;ref name="MakinNews"&gt;{{cite news | author = Burkett, Harry| title = names makin’ news (the Wrestler) | work = The Wrestler/Inside Wrestling  | publisher = Kappa Publications | id = Volume 15, 2007 | pages = 6–8 | date = June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He chose to sign with the Chargers.

At 6'9" and 315 pounds, Ladd was said to be the biggest and strongest man in professional football during his era.  His physical measurements included a 52-inch chest, 39-inch waist, 20-inch biceps, 19-inch neck, and size 18D shoes.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Ladd played in four [[AFL championship]] games, helping the Chargers win the [[American Football League#AFL Championship Games|American Football League title]] in [[1963 AFL season|1963]] with teammate [[Earl Faison]], both members of the original [[Fearsome Foursome (football)|Fearsome Foursome]].&lt;ref name=SDN&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aQIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OY4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2962%2C5207707|title=Big Ernie A Happy Ladd Now|publisher=Sarasota Daily News|last=Lassilla|first=Alan|date=May 27, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PatriotNews&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-03-14-805479472_x.htm|title=Ernie 'Big Cat' Ladd dead at 68|agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|accessdate=September 5, 2012|date=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd, an [[American Football League All-Star game|American Football League All-Star]] from 1962 through 1965,&lt;ref name=UT&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneer Chargers DT Ladd dies at 68|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20070313-9999-1s13ladd.html|first=Jerry|last=Magee|date=March 13, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2012|work=San Diego Union-Tribune Publishing|publisher=Copley}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the AFL players that organized a walkout on the 1965 [[AFL All-Star Game]] due to the racism they experienced in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Protest-of-race-related-slights-brought-65-game-1940910.php|title=Protest of race-related slights, brought '65 game here|work=Houston Chronicle|last=Barron|first=David|date=January 16, 2005|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ladd found success with the Chargers, he had a contentious relationship with the Chargers front office.&lt;ref name=Canoe2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/03/11/3732079.html|title="The Big Cat" was seldom tamed |author1=Johnson, Stephen  |author2=Oliver, Greg|date=March 11, 2007|accessdate=June 16, 2012|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the [[1965 AFL season|1965 season]] being indefinitely suspended from the team by Coach/General Manager [[Sid Gillman]].

Ladd stated that he and teammate Earl Faison would play out their contract options, opting to take a 10 percent cut in salary in exchange for becoming free agents at the end of the season.&lt;ref name=WDN&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=USREAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ALEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3029%2C2351210|title=Ladd Suspended By Chargers|work=UPI|publisher=Williamson Daily News|date=August 3, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; A planned trade with the [[Tennessee Titans|Oilers]] in early 1966 would have sent Faison and Ladd to Houston.&lt;ref name=PBP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L8UiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c7cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3738%2C4382848|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Palm Beach Post|title=Ladd, Faison Go To Oilers}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both were declared [[free agent]]s by AFL commissioner [[Joe Foss]], who ruled that Oilers owner [[Bud Adams]] had tampered in trade dealings with the Chargers.&lt;ref name=TimesNews&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8_IZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5870%2C1584387|title=Foss Throws Out Oilers Chargers Deal|publisher=The Times-News|work=UPI|date=January 24, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd refused to re-sign with the Chargers and suggested he might instead turn to professional wrestling full-time.&lt;ref name=SPT&gt;{{cite news|title=More Wrestling, Less Football Likely For Ernie Ladd|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X7gxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R3QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6634%2C6381508|date=May 9, 1966|publisher=St. Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Ladd signed with the Oilers and spent the 1966 season playing for them before moving in [[1967 AFL season|1967]] to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; There, with similarly king sized Grambling teammate and future [[NFL Hall of Fame]]r [[Buck Buchanan]] (6'7", 286 lbs), he filled out what was probably the biggest defensive tackle tandem in history.

Ladd started wrestling in 1961. As a publicity stunt, some wrestlers in the San Diego area challenged Ladd to a private wrestling workout. Before long, Ladd was a part-time competitor in Los Angeles, during football's off-season.&lt;ref name="MakinNews"/&gt; Ladd became a huge draw in short order.  When knee problems cut his football career short, Ladd turned to the more financially lucrative business of wrestling full-time in 1969. After a run as a [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], Ladd became one of wrestling's most hated [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] during the 1970s, as well as one of the first black wrestlers to portray a heel character.&lt;ref name=Canoe2 /&gt; He riled crowds with his arrogant and colorful demeanor during interviews, especially with his less than politically correct nicknames for opponents such as [[Wahoo McDaniel]] (whom he referred to as "the Drunken Indian"), and [[Mr. Wrestling]] (whom he called "the Masked Varmint" and insisted that he was an escaped criminal).  Ladd also controversially employed a taped thumb, claiming the support was needed due to an old football injury.&lt;ref name="MakinNews"/&gt; Often when Ladd appeared to be in serious trouble during a match he'd walk out of the arena and accept a countout loss, known since as "pulling an Ernie Ladd".

Ladd wrestled for a number of different professional associations, including the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] where he was managed by [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard of Wrestling]].&lt;ref name="WWEBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/ernieladd|title=Ernie Ladd|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com|year=2013|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he had several successful runs in the NWA territories, The Mid - South Promotion, NWF, and WWC Promotion.

Known for his immense size and power, it was natural for Ladd to engage in feuds with other giants, including famously with [[André the Giant]] (whom Ladd antagonizingly referred to as "Andre the Dummy" or "The Big Fat French Fry" during interviews).

In certain areas, Ladd's wrestling nickname was "The King", and he would wear an ornate crown.&lt;ref name="MakinNews"/&gt;

In other wrestling associations, he was "The Big Cat", and entered wearing a big cowboy hat.

After handily pinning [[Earl Maynard|Earl "Mr. Universe" Maynard]] the month prior, Ladd challenged [[Bruno Sammartino]] at Madison Square Garden for the WWWF title on March 1, 1976. He also later challenged [[Pedro Morales]] for the same title.  In 1978, he wrestled WWWF champion Bob Backlund.  When the [[International Wrestling Association (1970s)|International Wrestling Association]] had its brief run in the New York area, Ladd lost a 2 out of 3 fall match at Roosevelt Stadium, in Jersey City, New Jersey, to champion Mil Mascaras, 2 falls to 1 (he pinned Mascaras the first fall, was disqualified in the second, and was pinned by Mascaras in the third).

After leaving the WWWF, Ladd ventured to the Mid-South territory promoted by [[Bill Watts]]. While there Ladd feuded with [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Ray Candy]], and [[Junkyard Dog]]. He also served as a manager to [[Afa Anoaʻi|Afa]] &amp; [[Sika Anoaʻi|Sika]], [[The Wild Samoans]]. Ladd also had a decent run as part of a tag team with [[Leroy Brown (wrestler)|"Bad" Leroy Brown]] in the early 1980s. Ladd would also assist Watts as a booker behind the scenes, and had a large part in the development of [[Sylvester Ritter]] as the area's top draw.

Ladd retired from wrestling in 1986 due to recurring knee problems.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;  He then returned to the WWF as a Color Commentator, calling the 20 Man Battle Royal at [[Wrestlemania 2]] (which featured NFL players) and then earning a trial run doing commentary for various shows, including the April, 1986 show at [[Madison Square Garden]]. He would also be used as a fill-in for random matches on syndicated programming such as ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]''. Ladd also teamed with [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Johnny Valiant]] in the broadcast booth during [[The Big Event]] at [[Exhibition Stadium|C.N.E. Stadium]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.  Ladd, Monsoon, and Valiant were the original three man team for the first few weeks of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'', before Ladd was replaced by [[Bobby Heenan]] and Valiant's role was reduced significantly to only calling matches when Heenan had to be at ringside for one of the wrestlers he managed.  Following this Ladd quietly left the WWF.

He was inducted into the [[WCW Hall of Fame]] in 1994 and the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1995)|class of 1995]], becoming the first (and for several years only) inductee in both halls.

==Later years==
Ladd was a longtime friend of the [[Bush family]] and supported the [[2000 U.S. Presidential Election|2000]] campaign of [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=Canoe1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosL/ladd_00jul26.html|title=The Cat in Bush's corner – Ernie Ladd is a proud supporter of the Republican Presidential candidate|last=Oliver|first=Greg|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|accessdate=June 16, 2012|date=July 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ladd also owned and operated Big Cat Ernie Ladd's "Throwdown" BBQ Restaurant in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], until it was destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina]] on August 29, 2005. In the disaster's aftermath, he ministered to Katrina evacuees at the [[Astrodome]]. He was a friend of WWE Hall of Fame commentator [[Jim Ross]].

Ladd also appeared in an episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' entitled "That Wrestling Show."  He was in the locker room with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], who was playing his own father "Soul Man" [[Rocky Johnson]].

Ladd was also a basketball coach for young kids in [[Franklin, Louisiana]].

Ladd was diagnosed with [[colon cancer]] in the winter of 2003–2004, being advised he had three to six months to live. Three years passed before he died on March 10, 2007 at the age of 68. He was survived by his wife of 45 years and their four children.&lt;ref name=Canoe2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770311008 |title=Ernie Ladd, hall of fame football player and wrestler, has died|accessdate=2007-03-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003311/http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770311008 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ex parte Gutta''''' (BPAI 2009) is a precedential decision from the [[Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences]] (BPAI) of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) concerning the patentability of mathematical formulae and/or algorithms. The BPAI rejected ''Gutta'' as failing a two-prong test to determine if a machine or "manufacture" involving a mathematical algorithm complies with 35 U.S.C. § 101. The patentability of processes was previously addressed in a closely related case, ''[[In re Bilski]]''.

==The ''Gutta'' Test==
For a claimed machine (or article of manufacture) involving a mathematical algorithm

# Is the claim limited to a tangible practical application, in which the mathematical algorithm is applied, that results in a real-world use (e.g. "not a mere field-of-use label having no significance")?
# Is the claim limited so as to not substantially encompass substantially all practical applications of the mathematical algorithm either "in all fields" of use of the algorithm or even in "only one field?"
If the machine (or article of manufacture) fails either prong of the two-part inquiry, then the claim is not directed to patent eligible subject matter.

The '''''Gesta Berengarii imperatoris''''' (or "Deeds of the Emperor Berengar") is an [[epic poem]] chronicling the career of [[Berengar of Friuli]] from its inception (c.874) until his imperial coronation in Rome in December 915. It is a court [[panegyric]] and highly laudatory of its namesake. To the modern historian it is "difficult and often maddeningly vague."&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Bull of Rimini''' was a [[Golden Bull]] issued by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], at his court in [[Rimini]] in March 1226&lt;ref&gt;According to historian [[Tomasz Jasiński (historian)|Tomasz Jasiński]], ''Kruschwitz, Rimini und die Grundlagen des preußischen Ordenslandes. Urkundenstudien zur Frühzeit des Deutschen Ordens im Ostseeraum'', the bull was backdated and actually issued in 1235.&lt;/ref&gt; to confirm the [[Teutonic Knights]]' possessions in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. It was the first of three similar documents, followed by the [[Treaty of Kruschwitz]] (Kruschwitz) in 1230, and the papal [[Golden Bull of Rieti]] in 1234.

== Background ==
The [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] had waged several [[Prussian Crusades]] and particularly in 1222/23 had tried to conquer [[Chełmno Land]] (Culmer Land) east of the [[Vistula]] River from the pagan [[Old Prussians]]. Backed by his [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish]] cousins [[Leszek I the White]] and [[Henry I the Bearded]], he initially was successful, but had to face a Prussian counterstrike and now feared for his [[Duchy of Masovia]], which suffered under continuous Prussian attacks. In 1224 the duke began negotiations with the [[Teutonic Knights]] to strengthen his forces and to stabilize the situation.

Between 1211 and 1225, the Teutonic Order, led by Grand Master [[Hermann von Salza|Herman of Salza]], was present in the [[Burzenland]] region of [[Transylvania]]. Similar to Konrad of Masovia's request, the Knights had been called in by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] to settle, stabilize and protect the eastern [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] frontier against the [[Cuman people]]. Yet, they were expelled after trying to establish an autonomous state on Hungarian territory, subordinate only to the authority of [[Pope Honorius III]]. This time von Salza would wait to set out for Prussia, until the Order's claimed possessions were confirmed directly by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

== The Bull ==
The Knights were to be equipped by Duke Konrad I of Masovia in exchange for their support to stabilize his Masovian land:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;...our trusty Brother Herman, the worthy Master of the Sacred House of the Hospital of St. Mary of the Germans in Jerusalem [i.e., the Teutonic Order] has explained ... that our devoted Konrad (''Chünradus''), Duke of Masovia and of Kujawy (''Cuiaviae''), has promised and undertaken to provide for him and to his brethren from that land, which is called the Chelmło Land (''terra quae vocatur Culmen''), and in that other land, that is to say, between his borderland (''marchiam'') and the territories of the Prussians (''confinia Prutenorum''), that they may thus indeed take up the task and readily embark upon the invasion and obtaining of the land of Prussia (''terram Prusciae'') for the honor and glory of the true God.

We [that is, Frederick himself] therefore... especially because the land itself is held under the sole rule of the Empire (''sub monarchia imperii''), trusting also in the judgment (''prudentia'') of the same Master, because he is a man mighty both in deed and word and through his own and his brethren's perseverance is mightily undertaking and manfully carrying out the conquest of that land... even though many, vainly besought with numerous exertions in this business, gave up (''defecerunt'') just when they seemed about to set forth, grant the land of Prussia to the same Master along with the forces of his order and with all those who think to invade [it]...&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This Imperial authorisation was signed by a large number of princes, such as the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]], [[Archdiocese of Ravenna|Ravenna]], [[Archbishop of Tyre|Tyre]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|Palermo]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Reggio Emilia-Guastalla|Reggio]], the Bishops of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bologna|Bologna]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rimini|Rimini]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cesena-Sarsina|Cesena]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mantua|Mantua]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tortosa|Tortosa]], the Dukes of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]], and the [[March of Montferrat|Margrave of Montferrat]].

== Later confirmation ==
Duke Konrad actually had no intention of ceding Chełmno Land and therefore established his own military [[Order of Dobrzyń]] (''Fratres Militiae Christi'') in 1228, whom he vested with [[Dobrzyń Land]]. The few brethren. however, were not able to secure the borders of Masovia against the Prussian raids and Konrad faced the threat of losing his whole duchy.

=== Treaty of Kruszwica ===
{{Main|Treaty of Kruszwica}}
On 16 June 1230, the [[Treaty of Kruszwica]] was supposedly signed, according to which [[Konrad I of Masovia|Duke Konrad]] ceded the [[Chełmno Land|lands of Chełmno]],  as well as [[Prussian Crusade|all other conquests made in Prussia]], to the [[Teutonic Knights]] under [[Hermann von Salza|Grand Master Hermann von Salza]] and the [[Order of Dobrzyń]]. The text is only known by later references, as the original document is not preserved. According to the historian Max Perlbach (1848-1921), the Knights forged it to create a legal basis for their secular possessions.

=== Bull of Rieti ===
{{Main|Bull of Rieti}}
In 1234, [[Pope Gregory IX]] issued the [[Golden Bull of Rieti]], ''Pietati proximum'', confirming the prior deals, stating that the Prussian lands of the Order were subject only to the Pope, not a fief of any other secular or ecclesiastical power. The [[Roman Curia]] had already made a promise confirming this; nevertheless, [[Hermann von Salza|von Salza]] had insisted on its being put in writing.

The bull was again confirmed by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in 1257.

The '''General Report on the Plan for the National Capital (1946–1950)''', or '''Greber Plan''', was an urban plan developed in 1950 by [[Jacques Gréber]] for the Federal District Commission of [[Ottawa, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

Its main components were:

* returning [[Chaudiere Falls]] to their natural state and de-industrializing the islands&lt;ref name="Greber"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gréber|first1=Jacques|authorlink1=Jacques Greber|title=Plan for the National Capital - General Report|url=https://qshare.queensu.ca/Users01/gordond/planningcanadascapital/greber1950/Full_text_Greber1950.pdf|website=Queen's University|accessdate=18 February 2017|date=18 November 1949|quote=The restoration of the Chaudiere Islands to their primitive beauty and wildness, is perhaps the theme of greatest importance, from the aesthetic point of view-the theme that will appeal, not only to local citizens, but to all Canadians who take pride in their country and its institutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* planning the region as an integrated system
* making the Capital symbolize the whole country
* relocating the rails from central Ottawa
* improving transportation
* decentralizing government offices
* creating a scenic parkway system and restoring shorelines
* creating the [[Greenbelt (Ottawa)|National Capital Greenbelt]]
* expanding [[Gatineau Park]] (formed in 1938)

The '''''Handbook of Natural Region Divisions of Germany''''' ({{lang-de|Handbuch der naturräumlichen Gliederung Deutschlands}}) was a book series resulting from a project by the former German Federal Institute for Regional Studies (''[[Bundesanstalt für Landeskunde]]'') to determine the division of Germany into natural regions. It was published in several books over the period 1953-1962. Around 400 authors, mostly geographers, took part. This natural region division of Germany is still used, with amendments, today.

'''Henry Frederic Turle''' (1835–1883) was an English journalist, known as the editor of ''[[Notes and Queries]]''.

==Life==
He was the fourth son of [[James Turle]], [[organist]] of [[Westminster Abbey]], and was born in York Road, [[Lambeth]], on 23 July 1835. The family moved in September 1841 to live in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey, and on 31 March 1845 he was admitted as a chorister at [[Westminster School]]. For the sake of his health, he spent from Christmas 1848 to the autumn of 1850 at the school of [[George Roberts (antiquary)|George Roberts]] at [[Lyme Regis]]; he was readmitted at Westminster on 3 October 1850.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Turle, Henry Frederic|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1856 to 1863 Turle was a temporary clerk in a branch of the [[War Office]] in the [[Tower of London]]. In 1870 he became assistant to [[William John Thoms]], the founder and editor of ''Notes and Queries''. In 1872, when [[John Doran (writer)|John Doran]] succeeded Thoms, Turle retained the position of sub-editor; and on Doran's death in 1878 he became editor. He was busy at work until his sudden death, from heart disease, on 28 June 1883, in his rooms at Lancaster House, The Savoy, London.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Turle was buried on 3 July in the family grave in [[Norwood cemetery]]. He was commemorated on the tablet which was placed to the memory of his parents, on the wall of the west cloister of Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Henry Gannett''' (August 24, 1846 – November 5, 1914) was an American geographer who is described as the "Father of the [[Quadrangle (geography)|Quadrangle]]" which is the basis for [[Topographic map|topographical maps]] in the United States.

==Life==
He was born in [[Bath, Maine]] August 24, 1846,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darton|first1=N.H.|title=Memoir of Henry Gannett|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=January 1917|volume=7|pages=68–70|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000053670869?urlappend=%3Bseq=74|accessdate=December 15, 2014|doi=10.1080/00045601709357056}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduated with a B.S. at [[Harvard University]] in 1869 and at the [[Hooper School of Mining and Practical Geology|Hooper Mining School]] in 1870 also at Harvard.

In 1871 he was almost simultaneously offered positions with [[Charles Francis Hall]] on what would become the ill-fated [[Polaris Expedition]] or going with [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]] to survey [[Yellowstone National Park]]. He chose the Hayden adventure and would map the western portion of the Hayden's division until 1879.

On July 26, 1872, while climbing the then unnamed highest mountain in the [[Gallatin Mountains]], he and his party experienced electric shocks following a [[lightning]] event near the summit. He was to name the mountain [[Electric Peak]].

He married Mary E. Chase on November 24, 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darton|first1=N.H.|title=Memoir of Henry Gannett|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=January 1917|volume=7|pages=68–70|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000053670869?urlappend=%3Bseq=74|accessdate=December 15, 2014|doi=10.1080/00045601709357056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Father of Government Mapmaking==
In 1879 he was among those lobbying for centralizing the mapping functions into one government agency. Previously individual mapmakers and agencies had to compete for money from Congress for funds for projects.

He lobbied to call the new organization "United States Geological and Geographical Survey" although the name [[United States Geological Survey]] would officially be approved.

His first job in the new organization under its first director [[Clarence King]] was geographer of the [[United States Census, 1880]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penry|first1=Jerry|title=The Father of Government Mapmaking: Henry Gannett|journal=The American Surveyor|date=October 27, 2007|url=http://www.amerisurv.com/content/view/4519/%20The%20Father%20of%20Government%20Mapmaking:%20Henry%20Gannett|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He laid out 2,000 enumeration districts with such precision that for the first time each census enumerator knew in advance the metes and bounds of his particular district. The completion of this work on July 1, 1882 is considered the start of true topographical work in the United States and the birth of the quad. He was promoted to Chief Geographer for the Geological Society by [[John Wesley Powell]] and would hold the position until 1896.

In 1884 he published his first ''Dictionary of Altitudes'' which listed all known survey altitudes in the United States as well as the source of the survey. He was to persuade various organizations doing the surveys including the railroads to begin using similar [[datum (geodesy)|datums]] so the data could interconnect.

In 1885 he published ''Boundaries of the United States and of the Several States and Territories, with a Historical Sketch of the Territorial Changes,'' which was the first attempt to standardize the history of the boundaries in the country.

In 1888 Gannett was one of founding members of the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census.gov › History › Agency History › Notable Alumni › Henry Gannett|url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/census_then_now/notable_alumni/henry_gannett.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as its first secretary, and later as treasurer, then vice-president, and finally president, in 1909. He was also a member of the Washington Academy of Sciences until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=List of members, officers, and committees, corrected to March 16, 1914.|date=1916|publisher=Washington Academy of Sciences|location=Washington, D.C.)|page=5|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/wu.89100016302?urlappend=%3Bseq=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was chief geographer for the [[United States Census, 1890]] and [[United States Census, 1900]]

In 1890 he and [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] campaigned to establish the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] to create official names for locations in the United States.

In 1893 ''A Manual of Topographic Methods'' which was the basis for standardizing survey and mapping processes.

In 1896 in his last year with the USGS, he started the use of the [[Benchmark (surveying)|Benchmark]].

In 1899, he was invited with other elite scientists on the [[Harriman Alaska Expedition]].

In 1904 he was among the founders of the [[American Association of Geographers]].

In 1906 [[Gannett Peak]], the highest peak in [[Wyoming]], was named for him. In 1911, Lawrence Martin named [[Mount Gannett]], a 10,000-foot peak in the [[Chugach Mountains]] of eastern Alaska, for Henry Gannett.

In 1909 he was named chairman of a special committee to examine and verify the records of [[Robert E. Peary]] in the controversy with [[Frederick Cook]] over who was the first to reach the [[North Pole]].

He was assistant director of the census of the Philippines (1902) and of [[Cuba]] (1907–08). From 1897 to 1909, he was a vice president of the [[American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=S.D.N.|title=Henry Gannett, President of the National Geographic Society, 1910-1914|date=1915|publisher=National Geographic Society|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015039793479|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ilya Semyonovich Ostroukhov''' (Russian: Илья́ Семёнович Остроу́хов; 20 July 1858, [[Moscow]] - 8 July 1929, Moscow) was a Russian landscape painter and art collector; associated with the [[Peredvizhniki]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Ostrouhov Siverko.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Siverko (a cold north wind); his most familiar painting (1890)]]
He came from a family of well-to-do merchants.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/o/ostrouhov/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Paintings.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, he enrolled at the "{{ill|Moscow Academy of Practical Commercial Sciences|ru|Академия коммерческих наук}}". While there, he became interested in zoology and began a correspondence with [[Alfred Brehm]]. He also started an [[entomological]] collection that would later be donated to the [[University of Moscow]] and wrote a short book called ''Angling for Fish'' (1877).

He did not take his first art lessons until 1880,&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; when he developed the desire to become a painter after seeing an exhibition of landscape paintings staged by the Peredvizhniki. Concerned that he was too old to begin attending art school, he sought someone to give him private lessons. An old acquaintance introduced him to [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]],&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/landscape/ilya-ostroukhov Biographical notes] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt; who at that time was working at a private girls' school and tutoring.

The following year, he felt confident enough to study with [[Ilya Repin]]. That Christmas, he worked together with [[Victor Vasnetsov]], designing and creating decorations for a performance at the home of [[Savva Mamontov]]. After that, he became a regular visitor to [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]], sketching the landscapes and architecture.

Meanwhile, he applied at the  [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], but was only allowed to audit classes. In the evenings he studied drawing at the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and took more lessons from Repin. Through 1884, he also spent some time in the workshop of [[Pavel Chistyakov]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; In 1886, he was able to study with [[Vladimir Makovsky]] at the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]]. That same year, he presented two paintings at the fourteenth exhibition of the Peredvizhniki and would exhibit with them regularly after that; becoming a member in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tphv-history.ru/books/moskovskie-kollektsyonery41.html Membership roster] @ the Peredvizhniki website.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ostroukhov-Snow.jpg|thumb|275px|left|The Last Snow]]
He would also develop a close friendship with [[Pavel Tretyakov]], who bought several of his early paintings. After Tretyakov's death in 1898, the Moscow City [[Duma]] chose Ostroukhov as one of the trustees for the [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. From 1899 to 1903, he served as de facto head of the board, then was removed for spending too much on acquisitions. 

Apparently upset by the affair, he retired to a spa in the [[Vosges]] to recuperate. In 1905, after some contention, the Duma elected him Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; Everything went well until 1913, when a knife-wielding attacker slashed ''[[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan]]'', Repin's painting of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. This gave Ostroukhov's opponents a chance to attack him. He resigned and, by mutual agreement with the Duma, was replaced by [[Igor Grabar]].  
[[File:Ilya Ostroukhov by Ernest Lissner 1927.jpg|thumb|140px|Ilya Ostroukhov by [[Ernst Lissner]] (1927).]]
During this period (which also included a stint as organizer of the Russian exhibition at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]] and election to the Imperial Academy in 1906) he had virtually given up painting. It was not until 1916, when he spent some time with friends in [[Crimea]], that he began to sketch again. Two years later, he held his last full-scale exhibition with the Peredvizhniki.

===Collector===
In addition to his work with the Tretyakov Gallery, he was a notable collector in his own right; beginning in the 1890s after he married into the wealthy {{ill|Botkin (merchants)|ru|Боткин|lt=Botkin}} family of tea merchants and acquired a large house as a dowry. He accumulated over 300 paintings (including Medieval [[icon]]s) and 500 drawings; mostly by Russian artists, but [[Degas]], [[Manet]], [[Renoir]] and [[Matisse]] were also represented. One of its highlights was ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' by [[Vermeer]]. He had a library of over 12,000 volumes as well; including a copy of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' from 1515 and a ''[[Decameron]]'' from 1757. In 1918, his collection was nationalized as a public museum and he was appointed curator for life.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;

By March 1929 when, as a former landlord, he found himself deprived of his voting rights, he was in very poor health and nearly blind. He died four months later. Shortly after, the museum was closed and his widow was limited to the use of two rooms in their home. She died in 1935. His collection was transferred to the Tretyakov Gallery. Later, the house was reopened as a branch of the "{{ill|State Literary Museum|ru|Государственный литературный музей}}".

An '''intromittent organ''' is a general term for an external organ of a [[male]] organism that is specialized to [[insemination|deliver sperm]] during [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Patricia LR. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patricia_Brennan3/publication/303747168_Studying_Genital_Coevolution_to_Understand_Intromittent_Organ_Morphology/links/57681c5108ae7f0756a2219c.pdf Studying genital coevolution to understand intromittent organ morphology]." Integrative and comparative biology 56.4 (2016): 669-681.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Diane A., and Brandon C. Moore. "[https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/56/4/630/2198577 The morphological diversity of intromittent organs]." Integrative and comparative biology 56.4 (2016): 630-634.&lt;/ref&gt; Intromittent organs are found most often in terrestrial species, as most non-mammalian aquatic species fertilize their eggs [[External fertilization|externally]], although there are exceptions. For many species in the animal kingdom, the male intromittent organ is a hallmark characteristic of [[internal fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eberhard|first=W. G.|title=Sexual selection and animal genitalia|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Species with intromittent organs==
===Invertebrates===
{{see also|Penis#Invertebrates}}

====[[Molluscs]]====
Male [[cephalopod]]s have a specialized arm, the [[hectocotylus]], which is inserted into the female's mantle cavity to deliver a [[spermatophore]] during copulation. In some species, the hectocotylus breaks off inside the female's mantle cavity; in others, it can be used repeatedly to copulate with different females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iglesias, Fuentes, Villanueva|title=Cephalopod Culture|date=2014|publisher=Springer|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ttg7BAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=hectocotylus&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Arachnids]]====
In [[spider]]s the intromittent organs are the male [[pedipalp]]s, even though these are not primarily sexual organs, but serve as indirect mating organs; in the male the pedipalps have hollow, clubbed tips, often of complex internal anatomy. The sexually mature male typically deposits his semen onto a specially woven silken mat, then sucks the emission into his pedipalps. In mating, he inserts the openings of the pedipalps in turn into the [[epigyne]], the female external genital structure.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In [[Solifugae]] sperm transfer is also indirect; the male deposits a [[spermatophore]] on the ground, picks it up in his [[chelicerae]], then inserts it into the female's genital opening.

In [[Opiliones]] (harvestmen), males have a [[Opiliones penis|structure called a penis]], which is not present in other arachnids.

====Millipedes====
In most [[millipede]]s, sperm-transfer is performed by one or two pair of modified legs called [[gonopod (millipedes)|gonopods]], which are often on the seventh body segment. During mating, a male bends his body to collect a spermatophore from the genital pore of his third segment, and inserts it into the females body. Gonopods vary greatly among millipedes, and are often used to identify species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproductive behaviour in invertebrates|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/reproductive-behaviour-zoology/Reproductive-behaviour-in-invertebrates#ref497574|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insects====
Male insects possess an [[aedeagus]], whose function is directly analogous to that of the vertebrate penis. Some insects also have [[valva|claspers]]. Male moths have an additional organ called the [[juxta]], which supports the aedeagus. These however are generalisations, and insect genitalia vary enormously in anatomy and in application. For example, some insects, most notoriously the [[Cimicidae]] and some [[Strepsiptera]] practise [[traumatic insemination]], in which the intermittent organ pierces the abdominal wall and the semen is deposited into the [[hemocoel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapman, Simpson, Douglas|title=The Insects: Structure and Function|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXJEi8fo7CkC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=semen+is+deposited+into+the+hemocoel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p5kdD_F7WO&amp;sig=q-UJow2Xw06XbWfjz5WyL12kzxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMIp7PSmNbAxwIVwVk-Ch1kIgyj#v=onepage&amp;q=semen%20is%20deposited%20into%20the%20hemocoel&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black Molly 3 Male.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Gonopodium]] of a [[black molly]] (''Poecilia sphenops'').]]

==={{anchor|Vertebrata}}Vertebrates===
====Fish====
In male members of [[Chondrichthyes]] ([[shark]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]]), as well as now-extinct [[Placodermi|placoderms]], the [[Fish anatomy#Types of fin|pelvic fins]] bear specialized [[valva|claspers]]. During copulation, one clasper is inserted into the female's [[cloaca]], and sperm is flushed by the male's body through a groove into the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urogenital Anatomy of the Dogfish Shark|url=http://www.pc.maricopa.edu/Biology/ppepe/BIO145/lab04_5.html|website=Maricopa Community Colleges|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[Poeciliidae]] are small fishes that give birth to live young. In males, the anal fin is shaped into a grooved, rod-shaped organ called a [[gonopodium]] used to deliver sperm to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Thomas|title=ABC Biologie|page=554|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LorrYj5pkKYC&amp;pg=PA554&amp;dq=In+males,+the+anal+fin+is+shaped+into+a+grooved,+rod-shaped+organ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIjebW49bAxwIVh_2ACh0OZAPd#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20males%2C%20the%20anal%20fin%20is%20shaped%20into%20a%20grooved%2C%20rod-shaped%20organ&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tetrapods====
In [[lizard]]s and [[snake]]s, males possess paired [[hemipenis|hemipenes]], each of which is usually grooved to allow sperm transport and spiny or rough at the tip to allow firm attachment to the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hemipenes of snakes and lizards|url=http://cumuseum.colorado.edu/exhibits/objects/hemipenes-snakes-and-lizards|website=University of Colorado Boulder Museum of Natural History|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826033020/http://cumuseum.colorado.edu/exhibits/objects/hemipenes-snakes-and-lizards|archivedate=26 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To become [[erection|erect]], a hemipenis is evaginated (turned inside out) through muscle action and engorgement with blood. Only one is inserted into the female's cloaca at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution|date=1900|page=700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cbk6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA700&amp;lpg=PA700&amp;dq=hemipenis+is+evaginated&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tU2T6TkIHQ&amp;sig=1pwUgi1rVFaUkjFThGmJW7T_T-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBWoVChMI6sX9uNjAxwIVgY-ACh0lRAJl#v=onepage&amp;q=hemipenis%20is%20evaginated&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[turtle]]s, [[crocodile]]s, some [[bird]]s, and in all [[mammal]]s, males possess a [[penis]] centered along the midline of the body. During copulation it becomes erect due to engorgement with [[blood]] or [[lymph]], though in many animals it also contains a stiff or even bony support structure. When not in use, its soft penile tissue is usually flaccid, and depending on the species, may be retracted into the body. The anatomy of the penis varies widely according to species. However, the penis evolved only once in the evolutionary history of [[Amniote|amniotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Patricia L.R.|date=January 2016|title=Evolution: One Penis After All|url=https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01418-9|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=26|issue=1|pages=R29–R31|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.024|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mammals=====
{{main article|Mammalian penis}}
[[File:Armand de Montlezun Baculum Pyrénées.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Baculum]] of a [[dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'').]]
All male mammals have a penis. [[Insectivora|Insectivores]], [[bat]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[carnivora]]ns, and most [[primate]]s (but not [[human]]s) have a bone called the [[baculum]] or ''os penis'' that permanently stiffens the penis. During copulation, blood engorges the already-stiff penis resulting in a full erection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baculum (penile bone) in mammals|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_203_Baculum-(penile-bone)-in-mammals/|website=Map of Life|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monotreme]] penes are variously unusual; the [[platypus]] has a penis with a two-lobed (bifid) tip though the whole shaft is inserted in mating, possibly to engage both of the [[uterus|uterine]] branches, but the [[Echidna#Mating|echidna's penis]] actually has four heads, only two of which function at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Tom|title=The Platypus: A Unique Mammal|date=1995|publisher=UNSW Press|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FASJWgDhxIsC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55&amp;dq=Monotreme+penis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wA2L2sEwVd&amp;sig=SMsB2fDDkoTr7fVXhvV8WcXfBDc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgKahUKEwjWzI6Z28DHAhVENT4KHTtZB0A#v=onepage&amp;q=Monotreme%20penis&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Echidna ejaculation is a little one-sided|url=http://scicurious.scientopia.org/2013/01/25/friday-weird-science-echidna-ejaculation-is-a-little-one-sided/|website=Scientopia|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both monotremes and [[marsupial mole]]s are the only mammals with internal penises, located on the [[cloaca]]l wall instead of outside of it as in other mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Gadow, H.

Although birds reproduce through internal fertilization, 97% of males completely lack a functional intromittent organ.&lt;ref name="Montgomerie2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Montgomerie|first=R.|title=The Evolution of Primary Sexual Characters in Animals|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=453–470|editor=J.

Male [[ostrich]]es have a conical shaped penis that is wider at the base.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Patricia LR, and Richard O. Prum. "[http://prumlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/brennan_prum_2011.pdf The erection mechanism of the ratite penis]." Journal of Zoology 286.2 (2012): 140-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

A functional intromittent organ is known to be present in most species of [[Paleognathae]] and [[Anseriformes]].&lt;ref name="Montgomerie2010" /&gt; The Anseriformes (waterfowl) are a particularly interesting group to study given the high variability in intromittent organ morphology.&lt;ref name="Montgomerie2010" /&gt; Waterfowl intromittent organs range greatly in length, are often characterized by surface elaborations (both spines and grooves), and at times spiral counter-clockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birkhead|first=P.

==Background and education==

Backer was born in [[Cuba]] and moved to [[Miami, FL]] at an early age after the [[Cuban Revolution of 1959]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Me|url=http://www.backerinlaw.com/Site/about-me/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Backer was educated at [[Columbia University]] School of Law (JD 1982), [[Harvard University]], [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] (MPP 1979) and [[Brandeis University]] (BA in history 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.ecgi.org/members_directory/member.php?member_id=662|publisher=European Corporate Governance Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After law school and a clerkship with Judge Leonard I. Garth (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit) Backer was in private practice in Los Angeles, California. Backer joined the Penn State Law faculty in 2000, after having served as professor of law and executive director of the Center for International and Comparative Law of the [[University of Tulsa College of Law]]. He has visited at the [[Tulane Law School]] (2007–2008) and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (1998). Professor Backer has lectured and taught on public and private law aspects of globalization in a number of countries in Latin America, Asia and Europe. He founded and sponsors the Penn State Latina/o Law Students Association.&lt;ref name="SIA Faculty" /&gt;

In 2006, Backer founded the [http://www.thecpe.org/ Coalition for Peace and Ethics], an independent, non-profit, non-partisan, tax-exempt research and information focused organization based in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Chamberofcommerce&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory|url=http://www.chamberofcommerce.com/washington-dc/45498814-coalition-for-peace-ethics/|publisher=Chamberofcommerce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPE&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.thecpe.org/|publisher=CPE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its research mission, CPE sponsors research oriented working papers, preliminary scientific or technical paper. The authors of these working papers have released them to share ideas about a topic or to elicit feedback before submitting to a peer reviewed conference or academic journal. These working papers are preliminary versions that are being shared to a broad research community, with the aim of contributing to scholarly debate and soliciting constructive feedback.&lt;ref name="Penn State Law Legal Studies Research Paper Series"&gt;{{cite web|title=Penn State Law Legal Studies Research Paper Series|url=http://www.ssrn.com/link/Penn-State-LEG.html|publisher=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backer is also a member of the [[American Law Institute]] and the [[European Corporate Governance Institute]]. He served as the chair of the Penn State University Faculty Senate for 2012–2013.&lt;ref name="Penn State Law Faculty" /&gt;

==Scholarship==

=== Constitutionalism ===
For his work on transnational [[constitutionalism]], Backer has argued that after [[World War II]], transnational constitutionalism embraced universal [[human rights]] as the core feature that emerged with the introduction of post-conflict [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German]] and [[Constitution of Japan|Japanese constitutions]]. He also has examined the emergence of theocratic constitutionalism starting from the [[Iranian Constitution|Iranian 1979 constitution]]. Backer argues that constitutionalism is the legal process in which each state harmonizes with international norms and laws.&lt;ref name="God(s) Over Constitutions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Backer|first=Larry Catá|title=God(s) Over Constitutions: International and Religious Transnational Constitutionalism in the 21st Century|journal=Mississippi College Law ReviewC|year=2008|volume=27|quote=Both systems of transborder constitutional legitimacy produce complex frameworks of behavior rules (systems of morals and ethics). Each competes with the other for dominion over the construction of governments. States are meant to choose from amongst these and, having chosen a system of substantive constitutional values, thereafter internalize those international constitutional norms within their national legal orders. The heart of this exploration is thus on "constitutionalism" as an aspect of legal universalism. Consequently, the emphasis will be on the nexus of constitutionalism, globalism and religion in the construction and limitations of constitutions imposed from outside any single state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Backer is well known for his works on Chinese [[Constitutionalism]].&lt;ref name=Schwinn /&gt; According to Backer, [[China]] is evolving towards a "single party constitutionalist state "that is grounded in its unique form of "party-state constitutionalism." Backer argued that the Chinese constitutionalist state differs from the Western model in that the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] plays a central role in the Chinese constitutional order.&lt;ref name=Schwinn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=强世功/Jiang|first=Shigong|script-title=zh:中国宪政模式？—巴克尔对中国"一党宪政"体制的研究|journal=《中外法学》/Peking University Law Journal|date=December 2012|issue=2012-6|trans-title=Chinese-Style of Constitutionalism: On Backer's Chinese Party-State Constitutionalism|publisher=Peking University Center for Legal Information|location=http://journal.pkulaw.cn/JournalDetails.aspx?id=159392|language=Chinese|quote=无论讨论中国模式，还是讨论当代中国政治秩序，独特之处首先就在于中国共产党的领导。在美国学者巴克尔（Larry Catá Backer）看来，中国共产党构成了中国宪政制度的核心，中国由此形成不同于西方自由宪政模式的"党国宪政模式"，即"一党宪政国"（a single party constitutionalist state）。}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to articulate his conception of the Chinese "single-party constitutionalist state" as a new model of constitutionalist governance, Backer delineated the history for the Chinese state-party system that began from [[Mao Zedong]], and was subsequently improved and strengthened through the works of [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Jiang Zemin]], and [[Hu Jintao]]. Backer acknowledged that Mao Zedong Thought has had a profound impact on the shaping of China's constitutionalist system, especially in regard to the idea of the Party's role as an outsider. "The [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] was not merely a vanguard party, but for a long time a revolutionary party. Even after the end of the civil war, the CCP continued to think of itself as outside the apparatus."  Therefore, in terms of the relationship between the CCP and the state, there was a lengthy process of internalization where the Party as an outsider became internalized into the state through its Mass Line.&lt;ref name=Jiang2&gt;{{cite journal|last=强世功/Jiang|first=Shigong|script-title=zh:中国宪政模式？—巴克尔对中国"一党宪政"体制的研究|journal=《中外法学》/Peking University Law Journal|date=December 2012|issue=2012-6|trans-title=Chinese-Style of Constitutionalism: On Backer's Chinese Party-State Constitutionalism|publisher=Peking University Center for Legal Information|location=http://journal.pkulaw.cn/JournalDetails.aspx?id=159392|language=Chinese|quote=为了阐述"一党宪政国"这种党国宪政体制的新模式，巴克尔勾画出从毛泽东奠基、经过邓小平、江泽民和胡锦涛的不断巩固和深化的党国宪政体制，使得其中一些关键性要素获得了充分的发展。巴克尔认为，毛泽东的政治思想深刻地塑造了中国的宪政体制。其中最重要的就是关于党的思想，即中国共产党处于外在者的位置上。"中国共产党不仅是一个先锋队政党，而且在很长时间里是革命党。即使在国共内战结束之后，中国共产党继续认为自己外在于国家机器。" 因此，在处理党和国家的关系上，就出现了党从国家之外转向国家之内的漫长过程，其中的政治动荡就与这种转型有关。党在国家之外就意味着强调无产阶级专政，强调群众路线}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate and Transnational Law ===

Backer has also written extensively on the imposition of binding human rights norms on multinational corporations, where "the norms internationalize and adopt an enterprise liability model as the basis for determining the scope of liability for groups of related companies. This approach ... eliminates one of the greatest complaints about globalization through large webs of interconnected but legally independent corporations forming one large enterprise."&lt;ref name=Ruggie&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggie|first=John|title=Just Business: Multinational Corporations and Human Rights|year=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393062885|pages=188–189|quote=The attempt by the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights to impose binding Norms on multinational corporations, which preceded my mandate, aimed a silver bullet at the problem. But it turned out to be a dud. Larry Cata Backer, a legal scholar who has written extensively on this subject, observed at the time that the norms internationalize and adopt an enterprise liability model as the basis for determining the scope of liability for groups of related companies. This approach ... eliminates one of the greatest complaints about globalization through large webs of interconnected but legally independent corporations forming one large enterprise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backer is also known for his work on the [[Sovereign Wealth Fund]]s (SWFs), where he suggested that states have deployed their private global investments (SWFs) as instruments for public global governance.&lt;ref name=Fabio&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassan|first=Fabio|title=The Law of Sovereign Wealth Funds|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=UK|isbn=9780857932358|pages=21–23|quote=According to most of the observers, the main characteristics that differentiate the former (SWFs) from the latter (SOEs) are the source of their funding... . ..Conversely, one author (Larry Cata Backer) concludes that in spite of the differences, a regulatory standard should be reached that may neutralize the choice by the states to use a vehicle rather than another. He suggests to replace the traditional distinction between public and private with that of regulation and participation, applying the same rules to SOEs and SWFs abroad, where states are only operators and can not regulate."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of prehistoric and extant species whose fossils have been found in the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], located in present day [[Hancock Park]], a city park on the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]] section of the [[Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles|Mid-Wilshire district]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tarpits.org/research-collections/collections&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Lagerstatten/rancho_la_brea/fanflo.html "Fauna and Flora of Rancho La Brea"] (last visited April 13, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Museum|first1=La Brea Tar Pits and|title=Collections|url=http://www.tarpits.org/research-collections/collections|website=La Brea Tarpits and Museum|date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the tar pit's fossils are displayed in the adjacent [[George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries]] in the park. They are primarily from [[Pleistocene]] predator species. Daggers (†) in the list denote extinct species.

'''Livity''' is the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] concept of righteous, everliving living. Its essence is the realization that an energy or life-force, conferred by Almighty [[Jah]] (God), exists within, and flows through, all people and all living things. This energy is the presence of Jah living within us, and is often expressed in [[Rastafarian vocabulary]] as "I and I", where the first "I" refers to the Almighty, the second "I" for oneself. A primary goal in Rastafarian meditation is maintaining awareness of I and I.

A primary goal in a Rastafarian's life is to expand his or her Livity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Timothy |last=Miller |year=1995 |title=America's Alternative Religions |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |series=SUNY Series in Religious Studies |ISBN=0-7914-2398-0 |postscript= &amp;nbsp; 474 pages.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rastafarian philosophy, Livity can be enhanced by intense prayer and meditation (often enhanced by sacramental [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use), adherence to an [[Ital]] diet, and perhaps most importantly, loving behavior toward others. Livity has a strong focus on living a natural lifestyle which includes the consumption of natural foods and growth of natural hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Garvey to Marley, Rastafari Theology|last = Erskine|first = Noel Leo|publisher = University Press of Florida|year = 2005|isbn = 0813028078|location = Florida, USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This expression of love for others is done in recognition of a central love energy within all people, a concept often referred to as "One Love". One Love was coined by [[Marcus Garvey]] to refer to the Unity and Love of black people by black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Roskind |first2=Julia |last2=Roskind |year=2001 |title=Rasta Heart: A Journey Into One Love |publisher=One Love Press |ISBN=1-56522-074-9 |postscript=&amp;nbsp; 320 pages. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Star of life2.svg|right|thumb|[[Star of Life]]]]
'''The Medical Priority Dispatch System''' (MPDS), sometimes referred to as the '''Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System''' (AMPDS) is a unified system used to dispatch appropriate aid to medical emergencies including systematized caller interrogation and pre-arrival instructions. Priority Dispatch Corporation is licensed to design and publish MPDS and its various products, with research supported by the International Academy of Emergency Medical Dispatch (IAEMD). Priority Dispatch Corporation, in conjunction with the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch, have also produced similar systems for Police (Police Priority Dispatch System, PPDS) and Fire (Fire Priority Dispatch System, FPDS)

MPDS was developed by Jeff Clawson from 1976 to 1979 when he worked as an [[emergency medical technician]] and dispatcher prior to medical school. He designed a set of standardized protocols to triage patients via the telephone and thus improve the emergency response system. Protocols were first alphabetized by chief complaint that included key questions to ask the caller, pre-arrival instructions, and dispatch priorities. After many revisions, these simple cards have evolved into MPDS.

MPDS today still starts with the dispatcher asking the caller key questions. These questions allow the dispatchers to categorize the call by chief complaint and set a determinant level ranging from '''A''' (minor) to '''E''' (immediately life-threatening) relating to the severity of the patient's condition. The system also uses the determinant '''O''' which may be a referral to another service or other situation that may not actually require an ambulance response. Another sub-category code is used to further categorize the patient. 
The system is often used in the form of a software system called ProQA, which is also produced by Priority Dispatch Corp.

==Dispatch determinants==
Each dispatch determinant is made up of three pieces of information, which builds the determinant in a number-letter-number format. The first component, a number from 1 to 36, indicates a complaint or specific protocol from the MPDS: the selection of this card is based on the initial questions asked by the emergency dispatcher. The second component, a letter A through E (including the Greek character Ω), is the response determinant indicating the potential severity of injury or illness based on information provided by the caller and the recommended type of response. The third component, a number, is the sub-determinant and provides more specific information about the patient's specific condition. For instance, a suspected cardiac or respiratory arrest where the patient is not breathing is given the MPDS code 9-E-1, whereas a superficial animal bite has the code 3-A-3. The MPDS codes allow emergency medical service providers to determine the appropriate response mode (e.g. "routine" or "lights and sirens") and resources to be assigned to the event. Some protocols also utilise a single-letter suffix which may be added to the end of the code to provide additional information, e.g. the code 6-D-1 is a patient with breathing difficulties who is not alert, 6-D-1A is a patient with breathing difficulties who is not alert and also has asthma, and 6-D-1E is a patient with breathing difficulties who is not alert and has [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema/COAD/COPD]].

====Protocol 36====
This Protocol was created to handle the influx of emergency calls during the H1N1 pandemic: it directed that Standard EMS Resources be delayed until patients could be assessed by a Flu Response Unit (FRU), a single provider that could attend a patient and determine what additional resources were required for patient care to reduce the risk of pandemic exposure to EMS Personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=International Academies of Emergency Dispatch |title=Special Procedures Briefing Protocol 36: Pandemic/Epidemic/Outbreak (Surveillance or Triage) |url=http://www.emergencydispatch.org/sites/default/files/images/iaed-logo.png |accessdate=5 September 2018 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instructions to the caller==

As well as triaging emergency calls, MPDS also provides instructions for the dispatcher to give to the caller whilst assistance is en route. These post-dispatch and pre-arrival instructions are intended both to keep the caller and the patient safe, but also, where necessary, to turn the caller into the "first first responder" by giving them potentially life-saving instructions. They include:
* [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] for adults, children, babies, and newborns
* the use of a [[Automated external defibrillator|defibrillator]]
* the use of the [[Heimlich manoeuvre]] to clear the airway of a choking patient
* delivery of a baby
* extinguishing the flames for a person on fire
* escaping from a sinking vehicle
* bleeding control
* flushing of chemical contamination
* cooling of burns
* administration of [[Epinephrine autoinjector|epinephrine/adrenaline autoinjectors]]
* administration of [[Narcan|Narcan/naloxone]]

==Responses in the United Kingdom==

Whilst MPDS uses the determinants to provide a recommendation as to the type of response that may be appropriate, some countries use a different response approach. For example, in the United Kingdom, typically all front-line emergency ambulances have advanced life support trained crews, meaning that the ALS/BLS distinction becomes impossible to implement. Instead, each individual response code is assigned to one of several categories, as determined by the Government, with associated response targets for each.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; This may include an emergency ambulance, a rapid response car, ambulance officers, or specialist crews e.g. [[Hazardous Area Response Team|HART]]. Other basic life support responses may also be sent, e.g. [[Community first responder|Community First Responder]].

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; If an emergency ambulance is unlikely to reach the patient within the average response time, a rapid response car and/or Community First Responder may also be dispatched.

The exact nature of the response sent may vary slightly between [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|Ambulance Trusts]]. Following a Category 2, 3, or 5 telephone triage, the patient may receive an ambulance response (which could be Category 1-4 depending on the outcome of the triage), may be referred to another service or provider, or treatment may be completed over the phone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">'''Memoranda Gadelica''' aka '''Dublin, Trinity College MS H. 4. 31''', is an Irish annal, covering the years 1582 to 1665.

==Overview==

This annals features notices and obits of the [[McGuinness|Mac Aonghusa]] family of Uíbh Eathach (see [[Uí Echach Cobo]] in what is now [[County Down]]. It also features references to other [[Ulster]] families such as Ó Néill, Ó Domhnaill, Ó Dochartaigh, O Dúbheanaigh. To that end it might be more properly regarded as a book of obituaries of prominent people, much like the ''Annals of [[Nenagh]]''.

The years 1583-88 are missing, as are 1590-94, 1596-1600, 1602, 1604–06, 1609–11, 1613–15, 1619–27, 1632–33, 1639, 1642–47, 1650–51, 1653, 1655-60.

All entries are brief (1589 - ''Domhnall mac Briain Megaonghusa do mharbhadh.''). Even those years with additional information (1608- ''Cathir O Dochartaigh do mharbhadh 1 Augustij. Aodh mac Feidhlim Mac Aonghusa do mharbhadh.'' 1618 - ''Inghion Meagaonghusa .i. cuntaois Thíre Eoghain ar b-fagháil bháis san Róimh 15 Martij. Art mac an Bharúin Uí Néill ar b-fagháil bhais 28 Novembris.'') consist of merely two or more obits.

The editor added some twenty supplemental footnotes to further identify some of the persons named, such as ''sub anno'' 1589, 1612, 1629, 1638, 1663.

==Final entries==

* 1663 - ''Brian Ruadh Mhagaonghusa mac Glaisne mic Eachmhilidh mic Domhnaill Chéir mic Aodh mic Airt an Lámhaigh mic Aodh mic Airt na Madhmann ar b-faghail bháis sa Tulach Breifneach a g-cuntaoi Liattroma a g-cóigeadh Chonnacht 23 Aprill 1663 &amp; ar n-ionnlacadh a d-Teampall Cluana san aimsir chéadna'' (''"One Glasney mac Cawley, according to the custom of tanistry, is made Magennis by Tirone upon the death of Sir Hugh Magennis, to the disinheriting of Arthur his son, notwithstanding he Arthur married the Earl's daughter,"'' Calendar of State Papers, 1596, January 26, page 457. ''"Glasney mac Agholy Magenis of Clare, in the co. of Down, esq., received in 1611 a grant of the lordship of Clanconnell, including 13 townlands ...

'''NeXus''' is a common [[file format|data format]] for [[neutron]], [[x-ray]], and [[muon]] [[science]]. It is being developed as an [[international standard]] by scientists and programmers representing major scientific facilities in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]], and [[North America]] in order to facilitate greater cooperation in the analysis and visualization of neutron, x-ray, and muon data.

While in principle organisation of data within a NeXus file can be mapped into many different container formats the preferred and best supported backend is [[HDF5]]. [[XML]] is used for demonstration purposes mainly.

'''NeXML''' stands for "XML tools for NeXus", and is also the name of the automatically generated XML Schema for NeXus.

The '''Nicholson Guides''' are a set of books now published jointly by [[John Bartholomew and Son|Bartholomew]] and the [[Ordnance Survey]] as guides to the navigable waterways of England and Wales (and, more recently, Scotland).

The large-scale Guides are mainly intended for people traveling by boat along the river or canal. Generally, each page includes a map of a section of the waterway with features such as bridges, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], boatyards and services. Each section of the map includes references to nearby pubs, towns and villages, roads and railways.

The Guides were first produced, in the  1970s, by Robert Nicholson Publications and were published by [[British Waterways]]. The first edition sold for 75 [[pence]]; but by the early 1980s the price had increased to £1.50.

The format was a tall thin book which had the canal running top to bottom of each page, with the location north being adjusted to suit this format. Often pages had the canal 'straightened' mid page, with the location of north changing at the split point. 

The first edition came out as four Guides:
:''1 South East''
:''2 North West''
:''3 South West''
:''4 North East''
A fifth Guide, ''The Midlands'', came out in the early 1980s.

In 1981 the 'second revised edition' can in only three chapters; 3 North, 2 Midlands, 1 South and dropped the British Waterway Board affiliation. This edition was printed in two colours, black and blue, with the line of the canal being picked out in blue on an otherwise black and white map.
 
In 1985 the 'second edition' , now titled 'The Ordanace Survay Guide to the Waterway' published by Nicholsons had four chapters; 3 North, 2 Central, 1 South. Thames (and Wey).


The fifth edition in 1991 included 5 books:
:''1 South''
:''2 Central''
:''3 North''
:''River Thames''
:''Broads &amp; Fens''

7th Edition 1995, by this time Nicholsons had been an 'Imprint' of Harper Collins and was back down to four books, with a fifth publication being the first foldout small-scale map covering Great Britain.
:''1 South''
:''2 Central''
:''3 North''
:''River Thames''
:''Guide to Great Britain''



The 1997/2000/2003/2007 editions were extended to 8 books:
:''1 Grand Union, Oxford &amp; the South East''
:''2 Severn, Avon &amp; Birmingham''
:''3 Birmingham &amp; the Heart of England''
:''4 Four Counties &amp; the Welsh Canals''
:''5 North West &amp; the Pennines''
:''6 Nottingham, York &amp; the North East''
:''7 River Thames &amp; the Southern Waterways''
:''8 Scotland, the Highland and Lowland Waterways'' (only in the 2003 edition)

There are also two small-scale fold-out maps, one covering Great Britain in its entirety, and one of Scottish waterways.

From 1997 the maps became A5 format, and maps were in full colour, with the canal overlaid onto the current OS map of the time, north was fixed as being at the top of each page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1293">An '''online database''' is a [[database]] accessible from a local network or the [[Internet]], as opposed to one that is stored locally on an individual computer or its attached storage (such as a CD). Online databases are hosted on websites, made available as [[software as a service]] products accessible via a web browser. They may be free or require payment, such as by a monthly subscription. Some have enhanced features such as collaborative editing and email notification.

== Cloud database ==

A [[cloud database]] is a database that is run on and accessed via the Internet, rather than locally. So, rather than keep a customer information database at one location, a business may choose to have it hosted on the Internet so that all its departments or divisions can access and update it. Most database services offer web-based consoles, which the end user can use to provision and configure database instances.

[[Image:Johann Liss 006.jpg|thumb|''The fall of Phaethon'', [[Johann Liss]], early 17th century]]
'''Phaethon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|eɪ|.|ə|θ|ən}}; {{lang-grc|Φαέθων}}, ''Phaéthōn'', {{IPA-el|pʰa.é.tʰɔːn|pron}}) was the [[Ancient Greek]] name for the planet [[Jupiter]],&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cicero-on-the-nature-of-the-gods De Natura Deorum].&lt;/ref&gt; the motions and cycles of which were personified in poetry and [[Greek mythology|myth]].

==Mythology==
Phaethon was said to be the son of the [[Oceanid]] [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]] and the [[solar deity]] [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Phaethon Oxford Dictionaries, "Phaethon"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/phaethon?showCookiePolicy=true Collins English Dictionary, "Phaethon"]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, less common genealogies make him a son of [[Clymenus (son of Helios)|Clymenus]] by [[Oceanid]] Merope,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; of Helios and [[Rhodos]] (thus a full brother of the [[Heliadae]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Pindar]], Olympian Ode 6. 131&lt;/ref&gt; or of Helios and Prote.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Chiliades'', 4. 127&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phaethon, challenged by his playmates, sought assurance from his mother that his father was the sun god Helios. She gave him the requested assurance and told him to turn to his father for confirmation. He asked his father for some proof that would demonstrate his relationship with the sun. When the god promised to grant him whatever he wanted, he insisted on being allowed to drive the sun chariot for a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phaethon in Greek Mythology |url=https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/phaethon.html |website=Greek Legends and Myths |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gunnell|editor1-first=John A.|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=krause publications|page=14|edition=Second|quote=" ...okay to borrow the chariot of the Sun for a day."}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some accounts Helios tried to dissuade Phaethon, telling him that even [[Zeus]] was not strong enough to steer these horses, but  reluctantly kept his promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phaethon in Greek Mythology |url=https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/phaethon.html |website=Greek Legends and Myths |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed in charge of the chariot, Phaethon was unable to control the horses. In some versions, the Earth first froze when the horses climbed too high, but when the chariot then scorched the Earth by swinging too near, Zeus decided to prevent disaster by striking it down with a thunderbolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phaethon in Greek Mythology |url=https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/phaethon.html |website=Greek Legends and Myths |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phaethon fell to earth and was killed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZBlGCY1yy8C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Phaethon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uC8vUp3SFIKr7AbJs4GQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Phaethon&amp;f=false Olivia E. Coolidge, ''Greek Myths'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2001] {{ISBN|978-0-61815426-5}}), pp. 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Phaethon was the good friend or [[LGBT themes in classical mythology|lover]] of [[Cycnus (king of Liguria)]], who profoundly mourned his death and was turned into a swan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=40OqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=phaeton+cycnus+lovers#v=onepage&amp;q=phaeton%20cycnus%20lovers&amp;f=false|title=Kings of Greek Mythology|isbn=9781329854277|last1=Menoni|first1=Burton|date=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phaethon's seven sisters, the [[Heliades]], also mourned his loss, keeping vigil where Phaethon fell to Earth until the gods turned the sisters into [[populus|poplar]] trees, and their tears into [[amber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phaethon in Greek Mythology |url=https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/phaethon.html |website=Greek Legends and Myths |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato's ''Timaeus''===
In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', [[Critias]] tells the story of [[Atlantis]] as recounted to [[Solon]] by an Egyptian priest, who prefaced the story by saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"There have been, and will be again, many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story that even you [Greeks] have preserved, that once upon a time, Phaethon, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt.  Now this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs after long intervals."&lt;ref&gt;Translation by [[Benjamin Jowett]] (1817-1893) reproduced in, for example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTNctKDjxaMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Jowett+Timaeus+Phaethon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K1EwUt6bK-nC7Aa4zICgAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Jowett%20Timaeus%20Phaethon&amp;f=false John Michael Greer, ''Atlantis'' (Llewelyn Worldwide 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-73870978-9}}), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Ovid's version===
In the version of the myth told by [[Ovid]] in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Phaethon ascends into heaven, the home of his suspected father. His mother [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]] had boasted that his father was the [[Solar deity|Sun-God]] or [[Phoebus]]. Phaethon went to his father who swore by the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] to give Phaethon anything he would ask for in order to prove his divine sonship. Phaethon wanted to drive the [[chariot]] of the sun for a day. Phoebus tried to talk him out of it by telling him that not even [[Jupiter]] (the king of the gods) would dare to drive it, as the chariot was fiery hot and the [[horse]]s breathed out flames. He said:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The first part of the track is steep, and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb. In mid-heaven it is highest, where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me, and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear. The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control. Then even [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] herself, who receives me in her submissive waves, is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong. Moreover the rushing sky is constantly turning, and drags along the remote stars, and whirls them in rapid orbits. I move the opposite way, and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things, and I ride contrary to its swift rotation. Suppose you are given the chariot. What will you do? Will you be able to counter the turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts. The way runs through ambush, and apparitions of wild beasts! Even if you keep your course, and do not steer awry, you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull, Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer, raging Leo and the Lion's jaw, Scorpio's cruel pincers sweeping out to encircle you from one side, and Cancer's crab-claws reaching out from the other. You will not easily rule those proud horses, breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests. They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot, and their necks resist the reins. Beware my boy, that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you, while something can still be done to set right your request!"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph2.htm A.S. Kline's translation of Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Adolphe Sunaert - De Val van Phaëton.jpg|thumb|''The fall of Phaethon'' by [[Adolphe Pierre Sunaert]]]]
Phaethon was adamant. When the day came, the fierce horses that drew the chariot felt that it was empty because of the lack of the sun-god's weight and went out of control. Terrified, Phaethon dropped the reins. The horses veered from their course, scorching the earth, burning the vegetation, bringing the blood of the [[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Ethiopians]] to the surface of their skin and so turning it black, changing much of Africa into [[desert]], drying up rivers and lakes and shrinking the sea. Earth cried out to Jupiter who was forced to intervene by striking Phaethon with a lightning bolt. Like a falling star, Phaethon plunged blazing into the river [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanos]].

The epitaph on his tomb was:
:''Here Phaethon lies who in the sun-god's chariot fared. And though greatly he failed, more greatly he dared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edith Hamilton]], ''MYTHOLOGY: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes'', {{ISBN|0-446-60725-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Phoebus, stricken with grief at his son's death, at first refused to resume his work of driving his chariot, but at the appeal of the other gods, including Jupiter, returned to his task.

===Clement of Alexandria===
According to [[Clement of Alexandria]] in his ''[[Stromata]]'', "...in the time of [[Crotopus]] occurred the burning of Phaethon, and the deluges of [[Deucalion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book1.html |title=Clement of Alexandria: Stromata, Book 1 |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suetonius===
In ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Suetonius]] attributes to the emperor [[Tiberius]] the following repeated remark about the future emperor [[Gaius Caligula]]: "That to allow Gaius to live would prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was raising a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs4DPMV7si0C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=%22Phaethon+for+the+world%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rSIvUtjqH4fE7Abg64HAAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Phaethon%20for%20the%20world%22&amp;f=false Suetonius, ''Lives of the Caesars'' (Barnes &amp; Noble 2004] {{ISBN|978-0-76075758-1}}), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ancient writers===
[[Image:GustaveMoreau04.jpg|thumb|right|Phaethon, by [[Gustave Moreau]]]]

Fragments of [[Euripides]]' tragedy on this subject suggest that, in his account, ''Phaethon'' survives.  In reconstructing the lost play and discussing the fragments, [[James Diggle]] has discussed the treatment of the Phaethon myth (Diggle 2004).

In the ''[[True History]]'' by the satirical Greek writer [[Lucian]], Phaëthon is king of the sun and is at war with the moon.

== Post-classical works ==
* [[Dante]] refers to the episode in the ''Inferno'', in "Purgatorio" Canto IV and ''Paradiso'' Canto XVII of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.
* [[William Shakespeare]] uses the story of Phaethon in four places, most famously as an allegory in his play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''. He also makes [[Juliet]] wish "Phaëthon would whip [Apollo's horses] to the west" as she waits for [[Romeo]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 3.2.3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.william-shakespeare.info/act3-script-text-romeo-and-juliet.htm Text of ''Romeo and Juliet]&lt;/ref&gt;. It also appears briefly in ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' 3.1.154, and twice in ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' (1.4.33 and 2.6.12)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 43447224|title = The Phaëton Allusion in Richard II: The Search for|journal = English Literary Renaissance|volume = 17|issue = 3|pages = 277–287|last1 = Merrix|first1 = Robert P|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] includes reference to Phaeton in ''[[The Malcontent]]'' whereby Mendoza's monologue describes the '...sparkling glances (of women), ardent as those flames that singed the world by heedless Phaeton!' - Act 1, Scene 5
* [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] wrote a musical tragedy, ''[[Phaëton (Lully)|Phaëton]]'', in which he referred indirectly to the fate of [[Nicolas Fouquet]], whose ambitions to imitate [[Louis XIV]]—The Sun King—brought about his downfall. This opera is also used in the second version of [[Paul Hindemith]]’s opera ''[[Cardillac]]'' (1952).
* [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] wrote a symphonic poem entitled ''Phaéton'' in 1873.
* [[Niccolò Jommelli]] wrote an opera ''Fetonte'' to an Italian-language libretto by [[Mattia Verazi]] using various sources, principally [[Ovid]], for the myth of Phaeton. First performed at the [[Ducal Theatre]], [[Ludwigsburg]] in February, 1768, where [[Duke Karl-Eugen]] of [[Württemberg]] maintained an opera troupe.
* [[Wilhelm Waiblinger]]’s epistolary novel ''Phaëthon'' amalgamates the Phaethon myth with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]’s [[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Werther]] as well as [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]]’s [[Hyperion (Hölderlin novel)|Hyperion]].
* [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] published a poetic reconstruction of [[Euripides]]’ fragmented tragedy in ''Kunst und Altertum'' (1823), which served as a basis for various full-scale dramatic adaptations such as [[Marie Wernicke]]’s ''Phaethons Sturz'' (1893), [[Karl Wilhelm Geißler’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ''Phaëthon'' (1889) and [[Arnold Beer]]’s ''Phaeton'' (1875).
* [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]’s long poem ''Helios und Phaethon'' (1936) omits the cosmic desaster in order to focus on the relationship between godly father and mortal son.
* In [[Otakar Theer]]'s symbolist tragedy ''[[Faëthón]]'' (1916), the hero epitomizes man's revolt against the world order ("the gods") and against human destiny. The tragedy was adapted in 1962 into a celebrated eponymous radio play by Miloslav Jareš (director) and Jaromír Ptáček (dramaturge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Pekárek, Hynek | title = Otakar Theer: Faëthón |language = Czech | url = http://www.rozhlas.cz/vltava/literatura/_zprava/1183024 |publisher=Rozhlas.cz | accessdate = 2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paul Goodman]]’s early ''Phaëthon, Myth'' (1934) juxtaposes the Phaethon myth with a grotesque version of a Christological narrative.
* [[Benjamin Britten]]’s ''[[Six Metamorphoses after Ovid]]'' for oboe, first performed at the Aldeburgh Festival on 14 June 1951, include the short piece ''Phaeton'', which as a solo piece seems to focus on the individual lost in space rather than the furious effects emphasised by earlier instrumental renditions of the myth.
* In [[Ayn Rand]]'s 1957 novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', an in universe opera is composed by the character of Richard Halley where Phaeton succeeds in his attempt to control the chariot of the sun, as an allegory for the power of mankind and individualism.

'''''Phaic Tăn''''' (subtitled ''Sunstroke on a Shoestring'') is a parody travel guidebook examining [[fictional country|imaginary country]] Phaic Tăn. The book was written by Australians [[Tom Gleisner]], [[Santo Cilauro]], and [[Rob Sitch]]. It is the effective sequel to ''[[Molvanîa]]'', which was also published by [[Jetlag Travel]] and written by Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro, and Rob Sitch.

==About Phaic Tăn==

The Kingdom of Phaic Tăn is a composite creation of a number of stereotypes and clichés about Indochinese countries.

Phaic Tăn is said to be situated in [[Indochina]]. Place names in Phaic Tăn initially seem to be [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] or [[Thai language|Thai]], but they form English language [[pun]]s, hence the capital is called "Bumpattabumpah" ("bumper to bumper"). "Phaic Tăn" can be read as "Fake Tan". Also, the districts are the mountainous "Pha Phlung" ("far flung"), the infertile "Sukkondat" ("suck on that"), the hyper "Buhng Lunhg" ("bung lung"; Australian slang 'bung', meaning 'failed'), and the exotic "Thong On".

The country was formerly a colony of France, but was liberated in the early 20th century through student and [[Communist]] uprisings. A Marxist dictatorship under Chau Quoc continued until his death in 1947, which prompted the country to launch into a lengthy [[civil war]]. Eventually a [[CIA]]-backed coup ("Operation Freedom") made the country into a military dictatorship which it remains to this day. The country has a popular [[royal family]], though the current king has been deposed no fewer than 25 times.

Like ''[[Molvanîa]]'', the humour of the book comes from the guide's attempts to present Phaic Tăn as an attractive, enjoyable country when it is really little more than a squalid, third-world dump. The country is frequently plagued by [[monsoon]]s and [[earthquake]]s and many armed militia groups still patrol the streets.

The Phaic Tăn people are presented to be extremely superstitious, and obsessed with the concept of luck. The index of the book contains a list of almost 600 numbers the Phaic Tănese consider lucky, plus two considered unlucky (3 and 6). Turning left while driving is also considered unlucky, which causes a lot of traffic problems. Also unlucky is asking for a non-exotic massage, having more than 5 holes in Quic Pot, and to lose a lottery.

The current king is Sukhimbol Tralanhng III, ninth king of the Angit dynasty. King Falanhng prides himself on being something of a musician and composer. In fact, the country's national anthem was actually written by him and whenever it is played Phaic Tănese will immediately stand and place one hand over each ear. His wife is the very overweight Suahm Luprang, his crown prince is the perverted Ferduk, his daughter is the also overweight (and embarrassed) Buk Phang, and his youngest son is Luat the Brooding, who was arrested for misusing a gun.

===Geography and provinces===
According to the book, Phaic Tăn is a country situated in [[Indochina]] of [[Southeast Asia|South-east Asia]]. It is shown in the book's map as being bounded to the south by the Lhong Chuk Sea and the Pong and Kut Rivers to the north and east respectively.

Phaic Tăn is depicted as being roughly 650 kilometres abroad from east-west at its broadest point and the same distance from its far geographical north-east tip to the Pong Delta in the country's south-east.

The country is divided by several rivers, including the Sirikan, Upper Kut and the Nahkthong. The country's major rivers are the Pong and Nahkthong, which both finish in the Pong and Nahkthong [[river delta|Delta]]s respectively.

Phaic Tăn is made up of four [[province]]s (going in order clockwise), Sukkondat, Pha Phlung, Buhng Lung and Thong On. The provinces are connected by roads, but not by rail, as [[rail gauges]] vary throughout the country and sometimes even on the same line.

In one page the country's location is contradicted from being in Indochina to being [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|between]] [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South]] [[Korea]].

====Bumpattabumpah====
The [[capital city]] of Phaic Tăn is Bumpattabumpah, which is situated in Buhng Lung in a roughly central position on the Pong River and at the west end of the Upper Kut River. Bumpattabumpah is Phaic Tăn's largest [[city]], and presumably the most populous.

According to the book, Bumpattabumpah means "water convergence" and refers to the fact that the city is situated where the country's main river, the Pong meets untreated effluent from a [[sewage treatment plant]] further upstream.
Also, Bumpattabumpah was previously named "Phxux Xauan" but was changed because a survey revealed that less than 12% of the population were able to pronounce it.

An in-book map of Bumpattabumpah shows the names of its [[suburb]]s, all English-language puns: Qic Phuk, Phlat Tiht and Dud Bhonk. Many of the names of the roads throughout the city are also English puns, as is the name of the city's and country's major airport, Phlat Chat Airport.

High smog levels in the capital city mean that [[office blocks]] require no [[window tinting]], a result of heavy amounts of [[air pollution]]. In 1997, developers announced plans to build the tallest office block in the world. Construction actually began but only a short while after the foundations were dug the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian economic crisis]] hit, meaning the project was completely shelved. Bumpattabumpah now boasts the largest unfenced hole in the world.

====Sukkondat====
Sukkondat is traditionally Phaic Tăn's poorest province, due to the infertility of its soil, lack of [[natural resources]] and high number of [[casino]]s. An agricultural province, farmers harvest [[hay]] in order to camouflage their true primary crop, [[opium]]. The capital of the province is Sloh Phan, which is located about ninety kilometres north-east of Gunsa Wah, Phaic Tăn's tallest peak, at 2150 metres in height. Despite the fact that Sukkondat receives less than 2% of all visitors to Phaic Tăn every year, this statistic hasn't stopped its local Tourism Bureau from declaring the province 'the place to be'.

====Pha Phlung====
Pha Phlung in the country's northeast is mountainous and renowned for its [[rainforests]], [[waterfalls]] and mud-slides. Pha Phlung is traditionally known as the 'Land Of A Thousand Tigers' and while actual numbers may be closer to seven (counting five in the Lom Buak Grand Circus), nature walks through Pha Phlung are an excellent way to see nature and wildlife up close. The capital of this wet and humid province is Nham Pong.

====Buhng Lung====
According to the book, Buhng Lung is a busy province where all car horns have cruise control, set to go off every ten seconds. The Pong Delta is located in the south-east of the Buhng Lung province. The capital city of Bumpattabumpah is located in the north of the province.

====Thong On====
Thong On is an exotic province of which Pattaponga, located on the coast of Kru Kut Bay, is the capital. The coast is composed of many beaches. Of particular note is Zou Kow Bow Beach, which is said to have the whitest sand of any beach in the world. The beach sand's whiteness was formed in the 1980s by the rare combination of global warming and a huge spill from a tanker carrying laundry [[bleach]].

===Flag===
[[File:Flag Phaic Tan.svg|thumb|right|Flag of Phaic Tăn]]
The Phaic Tănese flag has the design of a [[ping-pong]] ([[table tennis]]) table. It is known as the Phing Pong, and is noted to be the world's only hinged flag, which while unconventional, "makes flag-folding ceremonies easier".

===Language===
The Phaic Tănese language is a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]] with four tones, sharing similarities with [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. There is also a fifth tone emerging, but this tone is largely restricted to use by rappers. It is spoken with an average of 192 syllables per minute.

===Pyangtru Yix Qaugen (Hospital of Hearts)===
The Phaic Tăn website features a spoof [[soap opera]] called ''Pyangtru Yix Qaugen'' (Hospital of Hearts), in which the characters (Doctor Lahbkot, 3-star General Kpow and his much younger millionairess wife) speak in what appears to be a dialect of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] spoken in [[Taiwan]] and parts of [[Fujian]], Vietnamese and some heavily accented garbled sounds made to resemble [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]d in a stilted form of English, with curious turns of phrase and [[double entendre]]s. This is a parody of the English subtitles often encountered on [[kung fu]] movies, or an attempt at [[Engrish]].

'''Reporter's privilege''' in the [[United States]] (also '''journalist's privilege,''' '''newsman's privilege,''' or '''press privilege'''), is a "reporter's protection under constitutional or statutory law, from being compelled to testify about confidential information or sources."&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', West Publishing-Thomson Reuters (9th ed. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It may be described in the US as the qualified (limited) [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or statutory right many jurisdictions have given to journalists in protecting their confidential sources from [[discovery (law)|discovery]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexmedia.com.au/2010/10/journalist-shield-laws.html|title=LexMedia|work=lexmedia.com.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907140217/http://www.lexmedia.com.au/2010/10/journalist-shield-laws.html|archivedate=2015-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C.]] Circuits have all held that a qualified reporter's privilege exists. In the recent case of ''[[U.S. v. Sterling]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth]] expressly denied a reporter's privilege exists under ''Branzburg''. Furthermore, forty states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes called [[shield law]]s protecting journalists' [[Protection of sources|anonymous sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news-media-law/news-media-and-law-summer-2011/number-states-shield-law-cl|title=Number of states with shield law climbs to 40|work=rcfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
=== Department of Justice guidelines (United States) ===

The [[United States Department of Justice]] created self-imposed guidelines intended to protect the [[news media]] by regulating the use of subpoenas against the press. These guidelines state that the government "should have made all reasonable attempts to obtain the information from alternative, non-media sources” before considering issuing a [[subpoena]] to a member of the news media.&lt;ref&gt;28 C.F.R. § 50.10(c)(4)(iii).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the guidelines require that federal prosecutors negotiate with the press, explaining the specific needs of the case.

Before any subpoena may be issued, the attorney general must approve the issuance.  The attorney general’s review for a subpoena to a member of the news media shall be based on the following criteria:
* In criminal cases, there should be reasonable grounds to believe, based on information obtained from non-media sources, that a crime has occurred, and that the information sought is essential to a successful investigation—particularly with reference to directly establishing guilt or innocence. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
* In civil cases there should be reasonable grounds, based on non-media sources, to believe that the information sought is essential to the successful completion of the litigation in a case of substantial importance. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
* The government should have unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the information from alternative non-media sources.
* The use of subpoenas to members of the news media should, except under exigent circumstances, be limited to the verification of published information and to such surrounding circumstances as relate to the accuracy of the published information.
* Even subpoena authorization requests for publicly disclosed information should be treated with care to avoid claims of harassment.
* Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material information regarding a limited subject matter, should cover a reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable and timely notice of the demand for documents.

While these guidelines seem extremely protective of the press, they explicitly deny the creation of “any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law.”&lt;ref name="28 C.F.R. 50.10n"&gt;28 C.F.R. § 50.10(j).&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does the policy have any substantive punishment for the federal government violations. If the federal prosecutors fail to obtain approval from the attorney general, the extent of the authorized punishment is “an administrative reprimand or other appropriate disciplinary action.”&lt;ref&gt;28 C.F.R. § 50.10(i).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some courts have found that the guidelines “create no enforceable right.”&lt;ref&gt;In re: Miller, 397 F.3d 964, 975 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (The appellant journalists claimed that the contempt charges should be reversed because the justice department had not complied with the guidelines issuing subpoenas to news media. Because the circuit court found that the guidelines did not create an enforceable right, it found no reason to determine the issue of compliance).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in circuits taking this approach, the news media have no right to appeal for enforcement of these policies before being compelled to testify.

=== Judith Miller's attempted use of reporter's privilege ===
The issue of a reporter's privilege came to the forefront of media attention in the 2005 case'' In re Miller'', involving reporters [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]]. Miller and Cooper were both served with grand jury subpoenas for testimony and information, including notes and documents pertaining to conversations with specific and all other official sources relating the [[Plame affair]]. Both refused to submit to the subpoenas, claiming a reporter’s privilege.&lt;ref&gt;In re Miller, 397 F.3d 964, 966-68 (D.C. Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal district court held both Miller and Cooper in civil [[contempt of court]], and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] upheld the orders of contempt.

Miller and Cooper, in their appeal to the appellate court pleaded several defenses including a First Amendment reporter’s privilege and a common law reporter’s privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 967. Miller and Cooper also put forward a due process defense and a defense based on guidelines for the Justice Department that are codified at 28 C.F.R. § 50.10 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The appellate court rejected both the First Amendment and common law claims for privilege. The court held Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court and sentenced both to eighteen months of jail time. The sentence was stayed pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] refused to hear the case.  Judith Miller began serving the remaining four months of the original eighteen-month sentence on July 6, 2005. Matthew Cooper’s confidential source released him from their confidentiality agreement, so he chose to comply with the subpoena and has agreed to testify before the grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Liptak and Maria Newman, ''New York Times Reporter Jailed for Keeping Source Secret'', [https://www.nytimes.com The New York Times], July 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional proposals ===
In 2004, two significant bills were introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and in the [[United States Senate]] to create a federal shield law. The first bill was introduced in identical form in both the Senate and the House by Senator [[Richard Lugar]] (R-IN) and Representative [[Mike Pence]] (R-IN).&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 581 (Free Flow of Information Act of 2005). This bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. See also S. 340 (Free Flow of Information Act of 2005) (referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary).&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Christopher Dodd]] introduced separate legislation that created a seemingly broader protection than the Pence/Lugar bill.&lt;ref&gt;S. 369. Sen. Dodd introduced the same bill in the 2004 congressional session. It was not acted on before the Senate adjourned. ''See'' S. 3020, 108th Congress, 2nd Sess. (2004); ''see also'' ''Second shield bill introduced in U.S. Senate'', [http://www.rcfp.org/news/2005/0217-con-second.html http://www.rcfp.org/news/2005/0217-con-second.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Rodney A. Smolla]] testified before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] on the topic of reporter's privilege.

On December 2, 2010, in a reaction to the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] by [[WikiLeaks]], [[John Ensign]] (R-NV) introduced S.4004 to amend section 798 of title 18, United States Code, to provide penalties for disclosure of classified information related to certain intelligence activities and for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|S|4004}}&lt;/ref&gt; While titled the SHIELD Act, the proposed legislation has little in common with [[shield laws in the United States]].

'''Sidi Amar Kammoun mausoleum''' ([[Arabic]]: زاوية سيدي عمر كمون) is one of the most important [[mausoleum]]s of the [[medina of Sfax]].

== Location ==
The mausoleum is on Borj Ennar street, very close to the walls of the medina. It is located in the east quarter of [[Bab Diwan]]. The top of the minaret offers a panoramic view of the facade of the medina facing the sea. The choice of this location for the building is linked to the close relationship between the family of the saint who is buried there, Sidi Amar Kammoun, and the sea, since his father was a [[sailor]] (rais in Tunisian dialect).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Corpus of Arab inscriptions of Islamic monuments of Sfax|last=Faouzi Mahfouth|first=Lotfi AbdelJawed|publisher=Dar El Amal|year=2016|isbn=|location=Tunis|pages=172–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Sidi Amar Kammoun from the outside.jpg|left|thumb|The minaret from outside the walls, which used to be a surveillance tower for marine attacks]]
The mausoleum was founded in the 18th century by order of [[Murad II Bey]] (1666-1675) to express gratitude to Sidi Amar Kammoun who treated him for a disease he got during one of his official visits to Sfax. The minaret was added later between 1636 and 1666&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inp.rnrt.tn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143:sfaxar&amp;catid=1:sites&amp;Itemid=6&amp;lang=fr|title=Sfax|website=Institut National du Patrimoine - Tunisie|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in two stages by Sidi Amar Kammoun, who himself  took in charge all the expenses of his construction thanks to his personal fortune.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Apart from its religious and spiritual role, the mausoleum provides a very important defensive role during several crises thanks to its strategic geographical situation which allows the surveillance of the coastal facade of the medina from the minaret&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; not only during a conflict with [[Sicily]] but also during the [[French protectorate of Tunisia|conquest of Tunisia by France]].

== Architecture ==
[[File:Mosquée kamoun 1.jpg|thumb|230x230px|The mausoleum's mosque]]
Comparing to the other mausoleums of the medina, Sidi Amar Kammoun mausoleum differs by the hybrid architecture of its minaret which combines both the old local style and Moroccan influences imported by the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsids]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].

The [[minaret]], of square shape, culminates at a height of 9,30 meters. Its summit is equipped with a platform crowned with merlons2.

The north facade of the minaret is decorated with two rectangular commemorative plaques, contiguous just below the engraved [[calligraphy]] band. The right plate measures 49&amp;nbsp;cm high and 25&amp;nbsp;cm long, while the left, which is currently at risk of losing all its details, is 50&amp;nbsp;cm high and 25&amp;nbsp;cm long. The texts of nine lines each are written with a partially punctuated Tunisian style. Apart from these plates, the facades are richly decorated with moldings, serrations and architectural elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Sfax Vol.I|last=Boubaker|first=Abdelkafi|publisher=|year=1966|isbn=|location=Sfax|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sidi Amar Kammoun ==
Sidi Amar Kammoun represents one of the most important icons of Sfaxian [[Sufism]] of the 18th century. Nowadays, it still keeps very important place in the Sfaxian community. Mahmoud Megdiche has devoted a big part of his book ''Nouzhat El Antha''r ([[Arabic]]: نزهة الأنظار) to highlight his qualities and accomplishments.

He received much of his education from his master, Sheikh Sidi Ameur El Mzoughi, and was very close to [[Murad II Bey]].

The first three ''Space Museum'' stories were reprinted in the DC Comics science fiction reprint anthology, ''[[From Beyond the Unknown]]'' #23 -25 (July/August 1973 - November/December 1973), but the title was then cancelled. Eighteen years later writer [[Gerry Conway]] re-introduced the Space Museum concept in "The Secret that Time Forgot" in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #206 (September 1982), and in 1984 writer [[Paul Kupperberg]] followed in ''[[Superboy#The New Adventures of Superboy (1980–1984)|The New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #50 (February 1984), this in a 30th-century [[Legion of Superheroes]] framing sequence by [[Keith Giffen]] around a modern-day [[Superboy]] story by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]. Two years later [[Dan Jurgens]] returned to the original 25th century Space Museum for the location of [[Booster Gold|Booster Gold's]] origin story.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' #6 (July 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the retrospective origin story of the Museum, "The Startling Secret of The Space Museum" in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #50 (August 1990) by editor [[Mark Waid]] and [[Gerard Jones]] (with Carmine Infantino again returning to the artwork), and two stories set in the Museum - "When Robots Attack" in ''Legionnaires'' #68 (Feb 1999) by [[Roger Stern]] and Tom McGraw, and ''Booster Gold'' #0 (April 2008) - the few other references since have all been in retellings of or allusions to Booster Gold's origin.&lt;ref&gt;"From the Depths - The Secret Origin of Booster Gold," ''Secret Origins'' vol. 2 #35 (1988); ''Adventures of Superman'' #476 (March 1991); ''Booster Gold'' vol 2 #1, (October 2007) and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional history==
===''Strange Adventures'' - 1959 - 1964===

''Space Museum'' in ''Strange Adventures'' was an anthology series set in the 25th century featuring mainly unlinked heroic tales of outer space adventure; with a regular framing sequence that opens and closes each episode with the only continuing characters - Howard Parker and his young son Tommy (and on three occasions his mother) making their monthly visit to the Space Museum,&lt;ref&gt;Unusually for comics of the day, Tommy ages almost in 'real time'; he has several named birthday visits to the Museum and is clearly drawn physically older in later issues.&lt;/ref&gt; later established as being in Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' #6 (July 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a museum dedicated to showcasing the history of five centuries of human space travel, and features many exhibits in transparent display cases, each artifact from an adventure an Earth space traveller had had in outer space. The objects in the display cases are often ordinary, although somehow they were used to either save the Earth or some other planet from disaster: ''Behind every object in the Space Museum there's a tale of heroism, daring, self sacrifice.''&lt;ref&gt;The opening story of the series, "The World of Doomed Spacemen," ''Strange Adventures'' #104 (May 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; During these visits Tommy always asks his father about one exhibit in particular, and Howard Parker then tells his son the story behind that exhibit, including:
* a pair of contact lenses that deflected an aliens' attempt at manipulating brain waves;&lt;ref&gt;"The World of Doomed Spacemen," ''Strange Adventures'' #104 (May 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a pocket watch that saved a planet by preventing magnetic storms from destroying it;&lt;ref&gt;"Secret of the Tick-Tock World," ''Strange Adventures'' #109 (October 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a gold medal and a spaceship called Ike (the only time a story features two artifacts in the Museum);&lt;ref&gt;"Revolt of the Spaceships," ''Strange Adventures'' #112 (January 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a stuffed magpie called Tommy (after which Tommy Parker was named) that saved the Earth from an invasion of deadly jewels;&lt;ref&gt;"The Gem Invasion of Earth," ''Strange Adventures'' #115 (April 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;
* an invisible being of pure energy;&lt;ref&gt;"The Billion-Year Old Spaceship," ''Strange Adventures'' #121 (October 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;
* one of Tommy's mother's blonde hairs, in a story which reveals that she was Admiral Ann 'Blondy' Gordon of the Space Marines and his father General 'Wrecker' Parker;&lt;ref&gt;"Earth Victory - By a Hair," ''Strange Adventures'' #124 (January 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a toy soldier that helped defeat an alien invasion;&lt;ref&gt;"The Toy Soldier War," ''Strange Adventures'' #130 (July 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a search for the Fountain of Youth;&lt;ref&gt;"The Immortal Spaceman!," ''Strange Adventures'' #133 (Oct 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a race against time to save the Universe;&lt;ref&gt;"Second-Best Spaceman!," ''Strange Adventures'' #136 (Jan 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a man who discovered he could turn anything into a weapon;&lt;ref&gt;"Secret of the Energy Weapon!"," ''Strange Adventures'' #139 (Apr 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a picture of Tommy, who had rescued his parents from aliens at the age of three;&lt;ref&gt;"Prisoners of the Space Flowers," ''Strange Adventures'' #142 (July 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a knitting needle used by Tommy's mother, then Ensign Gordon, to save Earth from aliens;&lt;ref&gt;"The Evolutionary Ensign of Space," ''Strange Adventures'' #148 (January 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;
* an alien woman who appears in the Museum every few years in thanks for being saved by Alan Strange, a descendant of [[Adam Strange]] and his wife Alanna.&lt;ref&gt;"Rescue By Moonlight," ''Strange Adventures'' #157 (October 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one tale does not fit into the normal narrative sequence, when Tommy and two of his friends in the Interplanetary Boy Scouts, using the skills Tommy has learned from the heroic stories he has been told, rescue Earth from aliens bent on stealing all its energy, and also rescue the Space Museum, which has been stolen by them.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mass Energy Robbers of Space," ''Strange Adventures'' #145 (October 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later appearances===

It is eventually revealed that the founding of the Space Museum, on the site of an old Military Surplus warehouse where hundreds of years worth of space history has piled up, came about because Tommy's father was a Space Marine guard there, and he "liberated" some of the momentoes, keeping them in his military footlocker.&lt;ref&gt;"The Startling Secret of The Space Museum," ''Secret Origins'' #50, (August 1990). Some of the relics he took are the same as referred to in the original ''Strange Adventures'' series - the contact lenses from "The World of Doomed Spacemen," ''Strange Adventures'' #104 (May 1959), the jewel from "Secret of the Space Jewel," ''Strange Adventures'' #106 (July 1959), the toy soldier from "Toy Soldier War," ''Strange Adventures #130 (July 1961) and the ray-gun from "Threat of the Planet Wreckers," ''Strange Adventures'' #118 (July 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his knowledge of space history, Tommy's father recognizes aliens who had attacked Earth before&lt;ref&gt;"Threat of the Planet Wreckers," ''Strange Adventures'' #118 (July 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; trying again (by pretending to be scrap dealers and taking the artifacts from the warehouse to use as weapons against humanity). He is able to use the objects he has saved to stop the aliens, although demolishing the warehouse at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;hence his nickname - General 'Wrecker' Parker.&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier wish ("People in my time have become jaded, bored with space travel. If only they were exposed to the heroism of Earth's star-spanning pioneers, their sense of adventure might be awakened."&lt;ref&gt;"The Startling Secret of The Space Museum," ''Secret Origins'' #50, (August 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;) is fulfilled when the military realize the value of "historical consciousness" and create the Space Museum on the site.

The Space Museum also figures prominently in the origin of the superhero Booster Gold.&lt;ref&gt;"To Cross the Rubicon," ''Booster Gold'' #6 (July 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2462&lt;ref&gt;this is around the time Tommy's visits to the Space Museum begin - he is specifically known to be aged about 15-16 in "Second-Best Spaceman," ''Strange Adventures'' #136 (January 1962) - which is dated to 2471, so would have been 6 or 7 in 2462. There is an oblique reference to Tommy in Booster Gold's origin in ''Booster Gold'' #6 July 1986 - "It was the enthusiasm of the children, I believe, on hearing tales of past adventures from their parents, that impressed Booster so deeply," coupled with frames showing a father and his young son going to the museum and looking at the exhibits.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Carter, a disgraced ex-football player is working as a night watchman in the Museum, and studies the history. He deactivates and steals [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]], a robot Museum guard with an encyclopaedic knowledge of 20th century Earth history, together with an alien power suit, some power gloves and control bands, mystic power rods, a [[Legion Flight Ring]], a forcefield belt, a credit card and other unspecified items from the displays, and escapes in [[Rip Hunter|Rip Hunter's]] Time Sphere, a time travel device from the 1960s, to journey back to the 1980s, become a superhero, and get rich and famous on the franchising opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Originally Dan Jurgens had planned to have Booster Gold as one of the custodians of the Superman Museum who went back in time to show Superman how he should be a super-hero, but John Byrne's revamp of the Superman character meant a different origin was required - "Secrets Behind the Origins," a text piece by Mark Waid in ''Secret Origins'' #35 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult Tommy Parker took his own son Gardner to the Museum and told him a story of the exhibits,&lt;ref&gt;"The Secret That Time Forgot," ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #206.&lt;/ref&gt; something he had hoped for years before.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mass Energy Robbers of Space," ''Strange Adventures'' #145 (October 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; At some later point [[Ultra the Multi-Alien]] is known to have searched for the cosmic staff of [[Starman (comics)#Prince Gavyn|Prince Gavin, Starman]], as an artifact for the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' vol 2, #55 (1999). Note: there is no clue as to where in DC continuity this [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] penned homage to the old ''Strange Adventures'' and ''[[Mystery in Space]]'' characters and stories fits.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2984 the Space Museum has been renamed ''The Museum of Heroes and Legends'', and has a whole wing dedicated to The Legion of Superheroes, as well as one to Earth's historical superheroes. That year one of the ''[[Dial H for Hero]]'' H-Dials is stolen from the museum by a petty crook while [[Reep Daggle|Chameleon Boy]] is attending a ceremony there. The villain escapes to 1984 with the help of the Dial, which is ripped to pieces by [[Krypto]] the Superdog before eventually being returned to the Museum in pieces by Chameleon Boy, where the Curator reveals they have another one.&lt;ref&gt;''New Adventures of Superboy'' #50 (February 1984) note: no longer part of DC Universe continuity since the ret-con removal of Superboy, but next year who knows!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A number of Internet sources state that [[Time Trapper|The Time Trapper]] later either stole the second H-Dial, or it was stolen by [[Lori Morning]] of The Legion, however there does not appear to be any reference for this.&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum appears to have been renamed the ''Time and History Museum'' some time later, and it is partly demolished by Xotar the Conqueror, a minor Justice League of America foe, on a mission to conquer the 30th century&lt;ref&gt;"When Robots Attack," ''[[Legionnaires (comics)|Legionnaires]]'' #68 (Feb 1999) - in which the Museum is shown to contain some inaccurate replicas of the [[Metal Men]] - Tin is a dog (in a confusion with [[Rin Tin Tin]]), and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay 'The Flash' Garrick]] is a member. It also exhibits [[Star Hawkins]]' robot assistant Ilda, both the Golden Age [[Robotman (Robert Crane)|Robotman]] and the [[Doom Patrol|Doom Patrol's]] [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]] exoskeltons, one of the [[G.I. Robot]]s from ''[[Weird War Tales]]'', a [[Cyberman]] and a [[Dalek]] (from ''[[Doctor Who]]''), and the power lantern of [[Alan Scott]] the original Green Lantern.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

In the non-continuity series ''[[Twilight (comic book)|Twilight]]'' by [[Howard Chaykin]], in the 22nd century Karel Sorensen of the [[Star Rovers]] creates a Church in her name and headquarters it at the Space Museum.&lt;ref&gt;''Twilight'' 1-3 (December 1990 - January 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stadtarchiv Speyer''' is the oldest municipal [[archive]] of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]].

The earliest document, which is kept in the city archives of [[Speyer]], is a document of emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich I]] of 1182, in which the privileges granted by emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich V]] to the town of Speyer in 1111 were confirmed and extended. The tradition of the archive dates back to the late 13th century, when Speyer became a [[Free Imperial Town]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1294. 

Now it is one of the oldest offices in Speyer. In addition to a large number of historically important documents and archives, it also offers today a large collection of photo and newspaper collections, 

== History ==
The most important documents were kept in the so-called ''Rote Lade''. This "red box" is a massive metal cabinet with a complicated closing mechanism. It is still in the city archives and one of the unique items, which are shown in regularly changing exhibitions in the city archives. The key to this archive was in the custody of municipal officials. The ''Archivarius'', the municipal archivist belonged to the city councilors or the [[syndic]]s.

The beginnings of the archives of the imperial city of Speyer were already published in the 14th / 15th century. On December 18, 1498, emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] asked the council of the city of Speyer to send him the oldest German document in the original from his archive. Other personalities, such as Christoph Lehmann (1568–1638), a [[municipal clerk]] and writer of a [[chronicle]], also used the archive intensively. Later, his meaning receded, and only a few connoisseurs knew about him. Between 1527 and 1689, Speyer had been the seat of the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court). 

Thus, over time, the rumor grew that the sources of the city's history had been lost during the demolition of Speyer in the [[Nine Years' War]] (1689). In fact the city archives had been fled to [[Frankfurt]] and [[Strasbourg]] and they had been kept in a completeness, as they can not show too many cities in this German region.&lt;ref&gt;''Feierstunde (Unterhaltungsblatt zur „Pfälzischen Presse“).'' 1893, No. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining documents had been stored since 1726 in the then new townhall. The historical archive magazine with its transportable wall cabinets is still preserved today.

In 1816 Speyer became the capital of the [[Circle of the Rhine|Bavarian Palatinate]], which was one of the administrative districts of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. The administration of the archive was assigned to an official of the Royal District Archives, Speyer, as a salaried office. As a result of the care provided by specialists, there was a change in the order, the preservation and the use of the archival materials. In 1909 the city archives the move to the new fire-resistant magazine took place.

In March 1995, the Stadtarchiv finally moved to its present premises in Johannesstrasse 22a. This former factory building was previously used by the Pfälzische Landesbibliothek.

== Present times ==
Since 1995, the ''Memory of the City'' is owner of a large reading room, which is also used as a lecture room, as well as two magazines and office spaces. Through the participation in the DFG project "Virtual German Urkundennetzwerk" (VdU), in which all documents have been digitized, the user has the opportunity to view Speyer documents in the virtual archive "Monasterium". The archive is currently also involved in the EU project "European network on archival cooperation" ("ENArC"), as well as in the interregional project "Archivum Rhenanum".

In addition, the City Archives Speyer regularly offer changing exhibitions, which inform about old and new stocks and innovations. Since 2011, the Stadtarchiv Speyer, which is active on Twitter, Facebook and Slideshare among others, belongs to the comparatively few German archives, which are intensively engaged in Web 2.0.

As a result of a restructuring of the departments of the City Administration of Speyer, the Stadtarchiv has been operating since May 2012 as its own department: ''Abteilung Kulturelles Erbe (Stadtarchiv, Museen, Gedenkstätten)'', "Department of Cultural Heritage (City Archives, Museums, Memorials)".

'''''Stormbreaker''''' (titled '''''Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker''''' in the United States) is a 2006 action [[spy film]] directed by [[Geoffrey Sax]]. The screenplay by [[Anthony Horowitz]] is based on his 2000 novel ''[[Stormbreaker]]'', the first novel in the [[Alex Rider|''Alex Rider'' series]]. The film stars [[Alex Pettyfer]] as [[Alex Rider (character)|Alex Rider]], and also stars [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Sophie Okonedo]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Sarah Bolger]], [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Ewan McGregor]]. ''Stormbreaker'' was an [[international co-production]] between companies and financiers from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany.

The film's plot follows a teenage boy who is recruited by [[MI6]] after his uncle, a [[secret agent]], is [[killed in action]]. He is sent on a mission in [[Cornwall]] to gather intelligence behind ''Stormbreaker'', an advanced computer system being provided to schools across Britain, and its creator, billionaire Darrius Sayle.

Intended to be the first entry in a [[film franchise]], ''Stormbreaker'' grossed between $20.7 and $23.9&amp;nbsp;million worldwide upon its theatrical release, failing to recoup its $40&amp;nbsp;million budget and making the film a [[box office bomb]].&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeflops.com/yearly-breakdowns/2006-3/alex-rider-operation-stormbreaker/|title=Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker (2006)|accessdate=2016-05-18|publisher=Box Office Flops}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-spy-book-idUKL1488204420071114|title=Alex Rider author sees 3 more books|accessdate=2016-05-18|publisher=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=Reuters|date=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film was largely criticised for its lack of originality and believability.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stormbreaker/|title=Alex Rider:  Operation Stormbreaker|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these factors, plans to produce further ''Alex Rider'' films were dropped.&lt;ref name=Sequels /&gt;

==Plot==
Alex Rider is a 14-year-old schoolboy who lives with his uncle Ian and their housekeeper Jack Starbright. Ian is supposedly a bank manager and is, much to Alex's regret, often away from home. One day, Alex is told that his uncle has died in a car crash, but quickly discovers that his uncle was in fact a spy working for [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and was murdered.

He is then recruited by his uncle's former employers, Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones of the Special Operations Division of MI6, who explain to Alex that his uncle has been training him as a spy. Alex initially refuses to cooperate but agrees when they threaten to not renew the visa and deport Jack as a result of her visa running out seven years before. Alex is then sent to a military training camp in the [[Brecon Beacons]], the home of the Special Air Service. At first, his fellow trainees look down on him because of his age, but he soon gains their respect for his capabilities.

He sets off on his first mission, aided by gadgets from Smithers. Billionaire Darrius Sayle is donating free high-powered computer systems codenamed ''Stormbreaker'' to every school in the United Kingdom. MI6 are suspicious of his seemingly generous plans and send Alex undercover as a competition winner to investigate. There, he meets Sayle himself and his two accomplices, Mr. Grin and Nadia Vole, and is shown the ''Stormbreaker'' computer in action. Later, while Alex is having dinner with Sayle, the suspicious Vole steals Alex's phone and tracks the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] to his house in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. She goes there and finds Alex's true identity; while there, she is disturbed by and consequently fights Jack. Despite being outclassed, Jack wins with the help of a [[blowfish]], leaving Nadia to flee the scene. That night, Alex sneaks out of his bedroom window to observe a midnight delivery of mysterious containers to Sayle's lair.

The next day, Alex finds himself in trouble when his cover is blown. After attempting to escape from the facility, he is captured, and Sayle explains his true reasons behind ''Stormbreaker'' – each system contains a modified strain of the [[smallpox virus]] which, upon activation in the ''Stormbreaker'' release, will kill all of the country's schoolchildren. Sayle leaves Alex tied up and departs for the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]]. Nadia drops Alex into a water-tank to be killed by a giant [[Portuguese Man o' War]], but he escapes using the [[Electrical discharge machining|metal-disintegrating]] [[spot cream]] supplied by Smithers, Nadia is subdued when she is hit by the jellyfish, rupturing the tank in the process. Alex then hitches a ride on a [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopter piloted by Mr. Grin, using a [[Sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]] arrow to gain Mr. Grin's obedience. Alex parachutes out of the helicopter and lands just as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] is about to press the button which will activate the computers. Alex uses a rifle to shoot the podium, which destroys the button, and ruins Sayle's plan.

Furious, Sayle leaves to carry out his back-up plan, and Alex, with the help of school friend Sabina Pleasure pursues Sayle through the streets of London. Fifty floors up on one of Sayle's skyscrapers, Alex reaches him and unplugs his backup transmitter. Sayle chases him out onto the roof and pushes both Alex &amp; Sabina off the roof, leaving them hanging by a dislodged cable. Unexpectedly, Yassen arrives in a helicopter and shoots Sayle (in the same manner he did Ian) before rescuing Alex. Yassen then tells Alex that Sayle had become an embarrassment to his employers, and that Alex should forget about him, but Alex refuses saying that the killing of his uncle Ian means they are still enemies.

Alex returns to school; he and Sabina are talking about what happened and he says that it will never happen again. The film ends with someone observing Alex from a distance. He notices it and realizes that it's not the end.

==Production==
[[File:US Stormbreaker poster.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The United States poster showing the change of title from ''Stormbreaker'' to ''Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker''.]]
''Stormbreaker'' was intended by [[Stormbreaker|the novel]]'s author, [[Anthony Horowitz]], to be the first entry in a [[film franchise]] based on his ''[[Alex Rider]]'' series.&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; Horowitz, already an established and prolific screenwriter in [[British television]], wrote the screenplay and worked very closely throughout the film's production with director [[Geoffrey Sax]] and producers [[Marc Samuelson|Marc]] and [[Peter Samuelson]]. The [[Weinstein Company]] acquired the North American rights to the film, which was filmed in Summer 2005 with six weeks on the [[Isle of Man]] and a further six weeks in London. Some of the scenes of the school were filmed in [[Grey Coat Hospital|The Grey Coat Hospital]] and [[Ballakermeen High School]], Douglas, Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/4150778.stm|title=Stormbreaker filming finishes|publisher=''BBC News Online''|accessdate=2007-05-22|date=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Alex Pettyfer]] was cast as [[Alex Rider (character)|Alex Rider]]. He was picked out of 500 hopefuls who auditioned for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1051932006|title=Calm amid the storm|publisher=''The Scotsman''|accessdate=2007-05-22|last=Maddocks|first=Fiona|date=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pettyfer was originally offered a role in the then-upcoming film ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' but turned it down, noting that he preferred ''Stormbreaker'' because it would be filmed nearer home while Eragon would film in the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/movies/18stor.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1153368000&amp;en=00794b0b1eb222d2&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin|title=He Was a Teenage Spy, Surrounded by Treacherous Adults|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2007-05-22|date=18 July 2006 | first=Sarah | last=Lyall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, the producers signed a deal with [[Nintendo]] that made the [[Nintendo DS]] a prominent feature in the film, much like the [[Power Glove]] in ''[[The Wizard (1989 film)|The Wizard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gonintendo.com/?p=3345 |title= The Nintendo DS – Heading to a theater near you! |publisher=''Go Nintendo'' |accessdate= 2007-05-22 |date= 27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an upgrade from the [[Game Boy Color]] that Alex used in the novel version. In addition to the Nintendo marketing in the film, Alex's mobile phone is a [[Nokia 7710]] and he uses a [[Sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]] pen to get to London, not a gun.

In August 2006, the film was retitled ''Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker'' for North American release. A new poster and trailer were released along with the announcement. It was also revealed that the US [[Film premiere|premiere]] would take place on the [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|Intrepid aircraft carrier]] at the [[Hudson River]], New York City.

The name of the villain also changed from Herod Sayle to Darrius Sayle, with his nationality switched from Lebanese (Egyptian in the US version of the novel) to American. This was because [[Mickey Rourke]] was already in talks to take on the role, so Horowitz adapted the character to suit him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7mpictures.com/inside/anthonyhorowitz_feature.htm|title=An Interview with Anthony Horowitz|publisher=''7(M) Pictures''|accessdate=2007-05-22|last=Carr|first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Stormbreaker'' was distributed by [[Entertainment Film Distributors]] in the United Kingdom, where the film made $2,313,496 on its [[opening weekend]], well below its expected target of [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] status.&lt;ref name=Flop/&gt; The film's grosses gradually declined each week for the remainder of its run, totalling of $12,872,046, making up more than half of what would become the film's final worldwide gross.&lt;ref name=Flop/&gt; In the United States, the film was distributed by [[The Weinstein Company]] in 221 theatres and grossed $215,177, with an average of $973 per screen&lt;ref name=Flop/&gt; and ranking No. 27 during its opening weekend. The film earned $677,646 in the United States and $23,260,224 internationally for a total of $23,937,870 on an estimated budget of $40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt; [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] reported a worldwide gross of $20.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt; In Germany, the film was given a [[direct-to-video]] release.&lt;ref name=Flop/&gt;

In a 2007 interview for [[Reuters]], Horowitz blamed ''Stormbreaker''{{'}}s financial failings on The Weinstein Company's handling of the film's distribution on the American market, particularly their decision to not give it a [[wide release]]. According to the writer, "[[Harvey Weinstein]] decided not to distribute it. It is one of the most bizarre and annoying things that the film didn't get given its shot in America. To this day I don't know why."&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], the film has a score of 34% based on 67 reviews with an average rating of 4.7 out of 10. The critical consensus states "Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker is strictly children's fare, as it lacks originality, excitement, and believabiltity."&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt; The film also has a score of 42 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 20 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/alex-rider-operation-stormbreaker | title=Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC]] critic Neil Smith gave the film three out of five stars but criticised the "unsubtle turns" from both [[Bill Nighy]] and [[Stephen Fry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/07/20/stormbreaker_2006_review.shtml|title=Stormbreaker (2006)|work=BBC Films|accessdate=22 May 2007|last=Smith|first=Neil|date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' branded the film as "a lame and disappointing affair". Although likening it to both the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[James Bond]]'' series, reviewer Ray Bennett said the film "lacks any kind of suspense" due to the script. He ended saying that ''Stormbreaker'' was unlikely to have a "license to kill at the box-office".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002879297|title=Stormbreaker|publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter''|accessdate=2007-05-22|last=Bennett|first=Ray|date=26 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200932/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002879297 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cinema Blend'' editor-in-chief Josh Tyler gave the film two and a half stars out of five, and said that, "Most of the problems with ''Stormbreaker'' all boil down to believability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Alex-Rider-Operation-Stormbreaker-1823.html|title=Stormbreaker|publisher=''Cinema Blend''|accessdate=2008-04-01|last=Tyler|first=Josh|date=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Boston.com''{{'}}s reporter Wesley Morris also gave ''Stormbreaker'' two stars out of five, and said that "Geoffrey Sax's filmmaking holds few surprises... but it's swift and competent, despite too many shots of cars on roads that bloat the running time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=8722|title='Stormbreaker' is kid lit without the pages|publisher=''Boston.com''|accessdate=2008-04-01|last=Morris|first=Wesley|date=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancelled sequels==
Prior to or after ''Stormbreaker''{{'}}s theatrical release, Horowitz had written a screenplay based on ''[[Point Blanc]]'', but stated that the chances of further films based on the ''Alex Rider'' novels were "fairly slim" due to the film's underperformance at the box office.&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; [[The Weinstein Company]] eventually cancelled their plans for a sequel, and Horowitz later expressed that the novels "do not translate well to the big screen".&lt;ref name=Sequels&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/young-adult/244957/9-franchise-starting-young-adult-films-that-struggled| title=9 franchise-starting young adult films that struggled | publisher=[[Den of Geek]] | date=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''''Tarry v Ashton''''' (1876) 1 QBD 314, an important case in [[English tort law]]. 

==Facts==
A lamp that the defendant had employed an independent contractor to repair was not securely fastened to the wall of the defendant's house. It fell on a passer-by. 

==Judgment==
Finding the defendant to be liable, [[Lord Blackman]] said the following:

{{Cquote|But it was the defendant's duty to make the lamp reasonably safe, the contractor failed to do that; and the defendant, having the duty, has trusted fulfillment of that duty to another who has not done it. Therefore the defendant has not done his duty, and he is liable to the plaintiff for the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The People's Almanac''''' was a series of three books published in 1975, 1978 and 1981 by [[David Wallechinsky]] and his father  [[Irving Wallace]], the novelist responsible for co-authoring the series ''[[The Book of Lists]]''. 

The format of the almanac departs from a [[almanac|conventional almanac]] and included many obscure facts, lists and [[esoteric knowledge]]. Under “World Nations and People,” for instance, the authors list every country and try to describe not only who is officially in charge, but also which entities hold greater power unofficially. Some corporations are listed together with nations. Special sections include ones on natural and man-made disasters, "Footnote People in World History," biographies of fictional characters (such as [[Superman]]), past predictions by psychics – both correct and incorrect, and predictions for the years 1975 and on. Odd and unexplained happenings are also discussed (such as the [[Devil's Footprints]]), though authoritative references are not generally given.

In '''''Van Eeden v. Minister of Safety and Security (Women's Legal Centre Trust, as [[Amicus Curiae]])''''', an important case in the [[South Africa]]n of law of delict as well as the country's [[criminal law]], the [[appellant]], Ghia Van Eeden, was [[assault]]ed, [[rape]]d, and [[robbery|robbed]] by a known, dangerous [[criminal]] who had escaped from [[police custody]]. The [[court of law|court]] held that the state was obliged to protect individuals by taking active steps to prevent violations of the [[constitutional right]] to freedom and security of the person, ''inter alia'' by protecting everyone from [[violent crime]]. It was also obliged under [[international law]] to protect women specifically from violent crime.

In light of these imperatives, the court could no longer support the requirement of a special relationship between the [[plaintiff]] and the [[defendant]] for the imposition of a legal duty; it held that the [[police]] have a duty to protect the public in general from known dangerous criminals in their custody.

The '''''Vita Pardulfi''''' is a work on the life of [[St Pardulf]] (d. 737), a [[Benedictine]] abbott from the [[Limoges]] area, which was written around the middle of the eighth century. 

The ''Vita Pardulfi'' is notable for the insight it provides into life in [[Aquitaine]] during the time of its writing. The work also indicates the high esteem in which Duke [[Odo of Aquitaine]] was held, in contrast to the negative picture provided by the ''[[Chronicle of Fredegar|Continuations of Fredegar]]'', which were compiled on the instructions of Duke [[Childebrand]], half-brother of Odo's rival [[Charles Martel]].
