[[Image:Alice Dixon LePlongeon Portrait.jpeg|200 px|thumb|right|Portrait of Alice Dixon Le Plongeon, taken by her husband [[Augustus Le Plongeon|Augustus]], ca. 1875]]
'''Alice Dixon Le Plongeon''' (1851–1910) was an English photographer, amateur archeologist, traveller, and author. She was one of the first people to excavate and study the ancient Maya sites of [[Chichen Itza|Chicén Itzá]] and [[Uxmal]].

== Early life ==
Alice Dixon was born in London on December 12, 1851. She was the second of nine children born to Henry Dixon and Sophia Cook. Henry Dixon was a copper-plate printer who later became a successful photographer. Henry Dixon was recognized in the late nineteenth century for his contribution to the development of [[panchromatic]] photography and for his photos of London architecture taken for the [[Society for Photographing Relics of Old London]]. Alice learned the principles of photography from her father and worked as an assistant at his studio.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yacatan Through Her Eyes|last=Desmond|first=Lawrence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another member of the family who had a strong influence on Alice was her uncle, Dr. Jacob Dixon. Dr. Dixon practiced [[Spiritualism]] and Alice became involved in the Spiritualist movement in England at a young age. 1871, Alice participated in a séance at her Uncle's home. In her memoirs Alice reports that at this séance a spirit predicted that she would be married before she was twenty and that she would move very far from England.

Later the same year Alice met [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] while he was in London studying Mexican and Maya artifacts at the British Museum. After she first met Augustus, Alice told her mother, "Mother, while I was out today I met him who I know that I shall have to marry by and by."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/2004.M.18/2004.M.18.xml;chunk.id=ref15;brand=default|title=Finding Aid for Augustus and Alice Dixon Le Plongeon Papers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Getty Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five years her senior, Augustus Le Plongeon was a French-American photographer and amateur archeologist who had already traveled and worked in Chile, California, and Peru. He was in London to prepare for a trip into the jungles of Yucatán. Alice grew interested in ancient Maya civilization, studied John L. Stephen's ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan,'' and agreed to join Augustus on his expedition. Alice and Augustus, not yet married, traveled from London to New York to complete the last of their preparations.

== Career ==
The couple married in New York before traveling to Mexico in 1873. After arriving in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], Alice Dixon Le Plongeon became seriously ill with [[yellow fever]]. Augustus nursed her back to health, and they stayed in Mérida while she regained her strength. The pair became acquainted with local scholars and learned to speak [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]]. Their first trip out of Mérida was a short visit to [[Uxmal]], where they explored the site and took some photographs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dream of Maya|last=Desmond|first=Lawrence|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Le Plongeons were in Yucatán during the years of the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]], a conflict between the Maya, called the Chan Santa Cruz, and the army of Yucatán. In 1875, they left Mérida and traveled to Chicen Itza with a military escort, who was assigned to stay with the archeologists while they worked.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When out in the field, the Le Plongeons practiced archeology by taking numerous photographs, sketching drawings and maps, making molds of bas-reliefs, and digging excavation tunnels to explore buildings. Their photography equipment consisted of two Scovill Manufacturing Company view cameras with an assortment of lenses. They took a variety of photographs, including 3D [[Stereo imaging|stereo images]], which were developed in a darkroom set up on site. In addition to the detachment of soldiers, the Le Plongeons hired local Maya men to cut back the vegetation and clear growth from the site. The whole crew faced illness and hunger, heat, insects, and other dangerous wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to exploring the sites of Chichen Itza and Uxmal, Alice and her husband worked around the city of Mérida, and at [[Mayapan]]. In 1878 they traveled south to British Honduras before financial difficulties forced them to return to the United States to solicit sponsorship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1880 to 1884 the Le Plongeons spent time in Mexico City and continued their work at sites in Yucatán. During this time, they made a few trips back to New York when their finances were strained. Among their sponsors was cigarette manufacturer [[Pierre Lorillard II|Pierre Lorillard]] and [[Phoebe Hearst]]. When in New York the couple gave lectures on their work and attempted to sell their bas-relief molds to museums and collectors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Findings and theories ==
By studying the murals and statues at Chicen Itza, Augustus and Alice developed theories about the past Maya rulers and the influence of the Maya. They pieced together a narrative of an ancient Maya ruler named Queen Moo (from the Maya word for macaw) and her brother and consort Prince Coh, sometimes called Prince Chaacmol (named for the Maya words chaac and mol, meaning powerful warrior). Throughout their careers, the Le Plongeons would expand on their theories. Eventually, they came to believe the ancient Maya had helped found ancient Egyptian civilization as well as the lost civilization of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=Sean|date=January–February 2007|title=The Lure of Moo|url=|journal=Archaeology|volume=60|issue= 1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1875 the Le Plongeons unearthed a large statue from near the Platform of the Eagles and Jaguars at Chicen Itza. The statue was of a reclining man and the Le Plongeons believed it was a representation of Prince Chaacmol. So, the statue was named [[Chacmool]] and was lauded by the American Geographical Society as a great archeological find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salisbury|first=Stephen|date=1877|title=An Account of the Statue Called Chac-Mool, Discovered in Yucatan by Dr. Augustus Le Plongeon|url=|journal=Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artifacts were found near the statue including flint, ceramic pieces, and a piece of jadeite that Augustus had set in a gold brooch. Alice would keep and wear this talisman for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Life in New York ==
In 1884 the Le Plongeons left Mexico and settled in New York. There, Alice focused on her writing and giving lectures. She published articles and organized her field notes. Alice also became involved in a number of social movements. She was a member of [[Sorosis]], a professional women's organization. She also gave lectures to fund raise for the New York Diet Kitchen Association, an organization which aimed to fed the poor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alice had a strong interest in [[Spiritualism]], [[Freemasonry]], and the [[Rosicrucians]], and was active in the [[Theosophical Society]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The archeological community was not welcoming to the Le Plongeon's theories about Queen Moo. Alice wrote that she was "bitterly indignant" about the lack of recognition for her and her husband's work. Despite these critics the pair continued to write and lecture on their findings. In 1886 Alice published ''Here and There in Yucatan'' and in 1902 her epic poem ''Queen Moo's Talisman'' was published. She also wrote about the Maya establishing the ancient civilization of Atlantis in ''A Dream of Atlantis'', which was published in serial form in ''The World Magazine,'' a Theosophy serial, from 1909-1911.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Augustus Le Plongeon experienced declining health in the summer of 1908. Alice spent much of her time attending to his needs before he died in December of that year. Alice continued to write and give lectures after her husband's death but became ill and was diagnosed with breast cancer in February 1910. She died on June 8 at New York Women's Hospital.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The professional journal '''''American Antiquity''''' is published by the [[Society for American Archaeology]], an organization of professional [[archaeology|archaeologists]] of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity# Cambridge.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is considered to be the flagship journal of American archaeology.

''American Antiquity'' is a quarterly journal published in January, April, July and October. Each copy of the journal has about 200 pages, with articles covering topics such as archaeological method, [[archaeological science]], [[pre-Columbian]] societies or [[List of pre-Columbian civilizations|civilizations]], ongoing work at archaeological sites, and interim reports of excavations.

Since the publication of the first issue of the related journal ''[[Latin American Antiquity]]'' in 1990, ''American Antiquity'' articles and excavation reports rarely cover work done in Latin American countries.

'''Annmarie Adams''' (born 1960) is an [[architectural historian]] and university professor. Currently she is the Chair of the [[McGill University Department of Social Studies of Medicine|Department of Social Studies of Medicine]] and is the former Director of the [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering|School of Architecture]] at [[McGill University]]. Adams specializes in healthcare architecture and gendered space. At McGill she teaches courses in architectural history and [[research methods]].&lt;ref name="Director: Annmarie Adams" /&gt; She is the inaugural holder of the [[Ian Stevenson|Stevenson Chair]] in the History and Philosophy of Science, including Medicine. She is an active member of the Society of Architectural Historians and the Vernacular Architecture Forum.

== Career ==
Adams focused on domestic architecture in the 1990s and turned to hospital environments about 2000. A paper comparing the intentions and experience of women and children in suburban California established research questions to which Adams would return repeatedly.&lt;ref name="The Eichler Home" /&gt;  How do buildings express behavioral expectations and do users of houses simply do what they are told? She followed this up with studies of wartime housing in Canada;&lt;ref name="Wartime Housing" /&gt; privacy and girlhood in 19th-century Quebec;&lt;ref name="Chez Fadette" /&gt; and sick children and maternal care.&lt;ref name="Sick Children" /&gt;  More recently, she and colleagues contributed to an award-winning website, Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History, by showcasing the role of a Montreal house in an unsolved double murder.&lt;ref name="Redpath Mansion" /&gt;

Adams has received numerous awards for her academic work including the President's Medal for Media in Architecture (2017) from the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]], the [[Hilda Neatby|Hilda Neatby Prize]] (1994) from the [[Canadian Historical Association]] (CHA), the Jason Hannah Medal (1999) from the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (RSA), and a Woman of Distinction award (2002) from the Montreal [[YWCA]].&lt;ref name=Awards /&gt;&lt;ref name=Awards2 /&gt;

She has served in administrative roles including a Curator of the [[Osler Library]] and Director of the Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies (IGSF) at McGill University in 2010-11.&lt;ref name=IGSF /&gt;

==Bibliography==

''Architecture in the Family Way: Doctors, Houses, and Women, 1870-1900''. 1996. McGill-Queen's University Press. {{ISBN|9780773513860}}
:*Contrary to the widely held belief that the home symbolized a refuge and safe haven to Victorians, Adams reveals that middle-class houses were actually considered poisonous and dangerous and explores the involvement of physicians in exposing "unhealthy" architecture and designing improved domestic environments.

''"Designing Women": Gender and the Architectural Profession''. (co-written with Peta Tancred) 2000. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|9780802082190}}
:*Adams and Tancred examine the issue of gender and its relation to the larger dynamics of status and power. They argue that many women architects have reacted with ingenuity to the difficulties they have faced, making major innovations in practice and design.

''Medicine by Design:  The Architect and the Modern Hospital, 1893-1943''. 2008. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. {{ISBN|9780816651146}}
:*''Medicine by Design'' examines how hospital design influenced the development of twentieth-century medicine and demonstrates the importance of these specialized buildings in the history of architecture.

The Arabian Peninsula plays a critical [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] role in the [[Middle East]] and the [[Arab world]] due to its vast reserves of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]].

Before the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: [[Hejaz]] ([[Tihamah]]), [[Najd]] ([[Al-Yamama]]), [[Southern Arabia]] ([[Hadhramaut]]) and [[Eastern Arabia]]. Hejaz and Najd make up most of Saudi Arabia. Southern Arabia consists of [[Yemen]] and some parts of Saudi Arabia ([[Najran Region|Najran]], [[Jizan Region|Jizan]], [[Asir]]) and Oman ([[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]]). Eastern Arabia consists of the entire coastal strip of the Persian Gulf.

==Geography==
{{see also|Geography of Saudi Arabia}}
[[File:Two-point-equidistant-asia.jpg|thumb|Africa, Arabian subcontinent (Asia), and Eurasia.]]
The Arabian Peninsula is located in the continent of Asia and bounded by (clockwise) the [[Persian Gulf]] on the northeast, the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and the [[Gulf of Oman]] on the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the southeast and south, the [[Gulf of Aden]] on the south, the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] strait on the southwest and the [[Red Sea]], which is located on the southwest and west.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Arabia"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern portion of the peninsula merges with the [[Syrian Desert]] with no clear border line, although the northern boundary of the Arabian Peninsula is generally considered to be the northern borders of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Arabia" /&gt;

The most prominent feature of the peninsula is [[desert]], but in the southwest there are mountain ranges, which receive greater rainfall than the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. [[Harrat ash Shaam]] is a large volcanic field that extends from the northwestern Arabian Peninsula into [[Jordan]] and southern [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Y. |title=A transition from strombolian to phreatomagmatic activity induced by a lava flow damming water in a valley|journal= Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research |date=1 January 2007|volume= 159|issue=1–3|pages=Pages 267–284 |doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2006.06.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political boundaries===
[[File:Arabian peninsula definition.PNG|thumb|left|The Arabian Peninsula.]]
The peninsula's constituent countries are (clockwise north to south) [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) on the east, [[Oman]] on the southeast, [[Yemen]] on the south and [[Saudi Arabia]] at the center.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Arabia" /&gt; The island nation of [[Bahrain]] lies off the east coast of the peninsula.

Six countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman) form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Alsharhan, Z. A. Rizk, A. E. M. Nairn [et al.], 2001, Hydrogeology of an Arid Region, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers the greater part of the peninsula. The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. The peninsula contains the world's largest reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are economically the wealthiest in the region. [[Qatar]], a small peninsula in the Persian Gulf on the larger peninsula, is home of the [[Arabic language|Arabic-language]] television station [[Al Jazeera]] and its English-language subsidiary [[Al Jazeera English]]. [[Kuwait]], on the border with Iraq, is an important country strategically, forming one of the main staging grounds for coalition forces mounting the [[invasion of Iraq]] in 2003.

Though historically lightly populated, political Arabia is noted for a high population growth rate – as the result of both very strong inflows of migrant labor as well as sustained high birth rates. The population tends to be relatively young and heavily skewed gender ratio dominated by males. In many states, the number of South Asians exceeds that of the local citizenry. The four smallest states (by area), which have their entire coastlines on the Persian Gulf, exhibit the world's most extreme population growth, roughly tripling every 20 years.

In 2014, the estimated population of the Arabian Peninsula was 77,983,936 (including expatriates).&lt;ref name=yam&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html|title=The World Fact book|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=2008-08-12 |date=2007-08-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080812233855/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html| archivedate= 12 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabian Peninsula  is known for having one of the most uneven adult sex ratios in the world with females in some regions (especially the east) constituting only a quarter of vicenarians and tricenarians.&lt;ref&gt;Alrouh, Hekmat, Awatef Ismail, and Sohaila Cheema.

[[Haplogroup J-P209|Haplogroup J]] is the most abundant component in the Arabian peninsula, embracing more than 50% of its Y-chromosomes. Its two main subclades ([[Haplogroup J-M267|J1-M267]] and [[Haplogroup J-M172|J2-M172]]), show opposite latitudinal gradients in the Middle East.

Geologically, this region is perhaps more appropriately called the Arabian subcontinent because it lies on a [[tectonic plate]] of its own, the [[Arabian Plate]], which has been moving incrementally away from the rest of Africa (forming the Red Sea) and north, toward Asia, into the [[Eurasian Plate]] (forming the [[Zagros Mountains]]). The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the [[Arabian-Nubian Shield]] near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved [[ophiolite]] on Earth, the [[Semail Ophiolite]], lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.

The peninsula consists of:
# A central plateau, the [[Najd]], with fertile valleys and pastures used for the grazing of [[sheep]] and other livestock
# A range of deserts: the [[Nefud]] in the north,&lt;ref name=Prothero15&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

# In [[Hejaz]], ranges of mountains, paralleling the [[Red Sea]] coast on the west (e.g. [[Asir]] province) but also at the southeastern end of the peninsula (Oman). The mountains show a steady increase in altitude westward as they get nearer to Yemen, and the highest peaks and ranges are all located in Yemen The highest, [[Jabal an Nabi Shu'ayb]] in Yemen, is 3666 m high
# Stretches of dry or marshy coastland with coral reefs on the [[Red Sea]] side ([[Tihamah]])
# Oases and marshy coast-land in [[Eastern Arabia]] on the [[Persian Gulf]] side

Arabia has few lakes or permanent rivers. Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. [[Al-Hasa]] and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.

According to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003–2013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.&lt;ref name="NASA_GRACE"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers "have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted" and thirteen of them are "considered significantly distressed."&lt;ref name="NASA_GRACE" /&gt;

A plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula. The plateau slopes eastwards from the massive, rifted escarpment along the coast of the Red Sea, to the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The interior is characterised by ''cuestas'' and valleys, drained by a system of ''wadis''. A crescent of sand and [[gravel]] deserts lies to the east.

===Land and sea===
[[File:Al hafa corniche.jpg|thumb|Coconut palms line corniches of Oman (Al Hafa).]]
[[File:Coral Reef in the Red Sea.JPG|thumb|Red sea coral reefs.]]
Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making irrigation and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}.
[[File:Yemen landscape 05.jpg|thumb|Terraced fields in Yemen.]]
The fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation.

The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}
During the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|Αραβία}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix "Arabia", encompassing a larger area than the current term "Arabian Peninsula":
* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.
* [[Arabia Deserta]] ("Desert Arabia"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).
* [[Arabia Felix]] ("Fortunate Arabia"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.

The Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&amp;pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' – Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;ots=hkDuOYZzif&amp;pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=0-520-07196-4 |pages=60–61 |work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the subcontinent itself starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Palestine: The Reality, Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries, Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Arabia 600 AD.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Approximate locations of some of the important tribes and Empire of the Arabian Peninsula at the dawn of Islam (approximately 600 CE / 50 BH).]]
The seventh century saw the introduction of Islam to the Arabian Peninsula. The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.

He established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].

Muhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or "Wars of Apostasy".&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Holt (1977a), p.57
* Hourani (2003), p.22
* Lapidus (2002), p.32
* Madelung (1996), p.43
* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or "Wars of Apostasy"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or "rightly guided" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.&lt;ref&gt;See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L. Gardet"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Islam|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online|author=L. Gardet|author2=J. Jomier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] remained the spiritually most important places in the [[Muslim world]]. The [[Qur'an]] requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the [[five pillars of Islam]], to make a pilgrimage, or [[Hajj]], to [[Mecca]] during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] at least once in his or her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Caesar (1994). Islam: Beliefs and Observances (5th ed.), pp.145–147 {{ISBN|978-0-8120-1853-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Masjid al-Haram]] (the Grand Mosque) in [[Mecca]] is the location of the [[Kaaba]], Islam's holiest site, and the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] (the Prophet's Mosque) in [[Medina]] is the location of [[Muhammad]] tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the [[Islamic world]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt, Jr., Arthur; Lawrence Davidson (2005). A Concise History of the Middle East (8th ed.), p.48 {{ISBN|978-0-8133-4275-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Despite its spiritual importance, in political terms Arabia soon became a peripheral region of the [[Islamic world]], in which the most important [[Caliphate|medieval Islamic states]] were based at various times in such far away cities as [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Cairo]].

However, from the 10th century (and, in fact, until the 20th century) the [[Hashemite]] [[Sharifs of Mecca]] maintained a state in the most developed part of the region, the [[Hejaz]]. Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the [[Abbasids]] of [[Baghdad]], and the [[Fatimids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Online: History of Arabia"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia Encyclopædia Britannica Online: History of Arabia] retrieved 18 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It was put in charge of Syria, Cilicia, Iraq, and the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;see History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Stanford J.

The [[Damascus Protocol]] of 1914 provides an illustration of the regional relationships. Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised [[Cilicia]] – [[İskenderun]] and [[Mersin]], [[Iraq]] with [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]], [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], [[Jordan]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;As cited by R, John and S. Hadawi's, Palestine Diary, pp. 30–31, the 'Damascus Protocol' stated: "The recognition by Great Britain of the independence of the Arab countries lying within the following frontiers: North: The Line Mersin_Adana to parallel 37N. and thence along the line Birejek-Urga-Mardin-Kidiat-Jazirat (Ibn 'Unear)-Amadia to the Persian frontier; East: The Persian frontier down to the Persian Gulf; South: The Indian Ocean (with the exclusion of Aden, whose status was to be maintained). West: The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea back to Mersin. The abolition of all exceptional privileges granted to foreigners under the capitulations.

In the modern era, the term bilad al-Yaman came to refer specifically to the southwestern parts of the peninsula. Arab geographers started to refer to the whole peninsula as 'jazirat al-Arab', or the peninsula of the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&amp;pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered, |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher= University of California Press |year=1988 |isbn= 0-520-07196-4| pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Ottoman rule and the Hejaz Railway====
[[File:Arabia 1914.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The Arabian Peninsula in 1914.]]
In the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project: the construction of a railway connecting [[Istanbul]], the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the seat of the Islamic [[Caliphate]], and [[Hejaz]] with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the [[Hajj]]. Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.

The [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] (1050&amp;nbsp;mm) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpaşa Terminal]]).

The railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.&lt;ref&gt;King Hussein And The Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Arab Revolt and the unification of Saudi Arabia====
The major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916–1918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.

These events were followed by the [[unification of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued [[Al-Hasa]], [[Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi–Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.

====Oil reserves====

The second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].

====Civil war in Yemen====
The [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'état]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.

The royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.

By 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=enein&gt;{{Cite news

In 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[invasion of Kuwait]] by Iraqi forces led to the 1990–91 [[Gulf War]]. [[Egypt]], [[Qatar]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] joined a multinational [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition]] that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by [[Jordan]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called "Damascus Declaration" formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt's Bid for Arab Leadership: Implications for U.S. Policy, By Gregory L.

==Transport and industry==
The extraction and refining of oil and gas are the major industrial activities in the Arabian Peninsula. The region also has an active construction sector, with many cities reflecting the wealth generated by the oil industry. The service sector is dominated by financial and technical institutions, which, like the construction sector, mainly serve the oil industry. Traditional handicrafts such as carpet-weaving are found in rural areas of Arabia.

The '''B-52 Victory Museum, Hanoi''' or ''Bảo Tàng Chiến Thắng B.52'' is located at 157 Đội Cấn, Ba Đình district, [[Hanoi]].

The museum comprises one main building with displays on the history of the Vietnamese revolution, the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Vietnam War]], Operations [[Operation Rolling Thunder|Rolling Thunder]], [[Operation Linebacker|Linebacker]] and [[Operation Linebacker II|Linebacker II]] and the air defense of Hanoi. The outdoor displays include the wreckage of a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52D or G Stratofortress]] apparently shot down during Operation Linebacker II (although no specific details are provided) and various air defense equipment.

The museum is open Tuesday-Thursday and Saturday-Sunday from 08:00 to 11:30 and 13:00 to 16:30. Entry is free.

The Museum is located approximately 300m south of the "B-52 lake", Hồ B-52 or Huu Tiep Lake which appears to contain part of the undercarriage section of the B-52 at the Museum. A plaque at the lake states that the aircraft was a B-52G shot down by a [[Surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) fired by the 72nd Battalion, 285th Air Defence Missile Regiment on 27 December 1972, however the only B-52s lost that day were two B-52Ds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=James|title=USAF Southeast Asia Monograph Series Volume VI Monograph 8 Linebacker II: A View from the Rock|publisher=Office of Air Force History|year=1985|url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101013-045.pdf|isbn=978-1477541937|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Canary Islands]]''' have been known since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Until the [[Conquest of the Canary Islands|Spanish colonization]] between 1402 and 1496, the Canaries were populated by an [[indigenous people|indigenous population]], whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.

The islands were visited by the [[Phoenicians]], the [[Greeks]] and the [[Carthaginians]]. According to the 1st century CE [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] author and philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[archipelago]] was found to be uninhabited when visited by the Carthaginians under [[Hanno the Navigator]] in 5th century BCE, but ruins of great buildings were seen.&lt;ref name="Galindo"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galindo |first=Juan de Abreu |title=The History of the Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year= |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |location= |language= |isbn=1-4021-7269-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=173 |chapter=VII |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This story may suggest that the islands were inhabited by other peoples prior to the Guanches.

At the time of medieval [[Europe]]an engagement, the Canary Islands were inhabited by a variety of indigenous communities. The pre-colonial population of the Canaries is generically referred to as [[Guanches]], although, strictly speaking, Guanches were originally the inhabitants of [[Tenerife]]. According to the chronicles, the inhabitants of [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]] were referred to as ''Maxos'', [[Gran Canaria]] was inhabited by the ''Canarii'', [[El Hierro]] by the ''Bimbaches'', [[La Palma]] by the ''Auaritas'' and [[La Gomera]] by the ''Gomeros''. Evidence does seem to suggest that inter-insular interaction was relatively low and each island was populated by its own distinct socio-cultural groups who lived in relative isolation separated from each other.

==Historical background==
&lt;!-- see AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY 18:540–555 (2006) for loads of references to check as regards anatomy, linguistics, and molecular studies --&gt;
The origins of the Canarian indigenous people remain the subject of debate. Numerous theories have achieved varying degrees of acceptance.

Various [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean civilization]]s in antiquity knew of the islands' existence and established contact with them. Visitors included [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Carthaginians]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], an expedition of Mauretanians sent by King [[Juba II]] (d. 23 CE) to the [[archipelago]] visited the islands, finding them uninhabited, but noting ruins of great buildings.&lt;ref name="Galindo"/&gt;  When King Juba, the Roman protegé, dispatched a contingent to re-open the dye production facility at [[Mogador]] (historical name of Essaouira, Morocco) in the early 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17910 C.Michael Hogan, ''Chellah'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt; Juba's naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base.

The peak of [[Teide]] on Tenerife can be seen on clear days from the African coast. The [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] captain [[Hanno the Navigator]] may have visited the islands during his voyage of exploration along the African coast. The Phoenicians may have arrived seeking the precious red dye extracted from the [[orchil]] - if the Canaries represent [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Purple Isles'' or the [[Hesperides]] of legend. Although no evidence has survived of any permanent Roman settlements, in 1964 Roman [[amphora]]e were discovered in waters off [[Lanzarote]]. Discoveries made in the 1990s have demonstrated in more definite detail that the Romans traded with the indigenous inhabitants. Excavations of a settlement at El Bebedero on Lanzarote, made by a team under Pablo Atoche Peña of the [[University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and Juan Ángel Paz Peralta of the [[University of Zaragoza]], yielded about a hundred Roman [[potsherd]]s, nine pieces of metal and one piece of glass at the site, in strata dated between the 1st and 4th centuries. Analysis of the clay indicated origins in [[Campania]], [[Hispania Baetica]] and the [[Africa (province)|province of Africa]] (modern [[Tunisia]]).

The Romans named each of the islands: ''Ninguaria'' or ''[[Nivaria]]'' (Tenerife), ''Canaria'' (Gran Canaria), ''Pluvialia'' or ''Invale'' (Lanzarote), ''Ombrion'' (La Palma), ''Planasia'' (Fuerteventura), ''Iunonia'' or ''Junonia'' (El Hierro) and ''Capraria'' (La Gomera).

From the 14th century onward, sailors from [[Mallorca]], [[Portugal]] and [[Genoa]] made numerous visits. [[Lancelotto Malocello]] settled on the island of Lanzarote in 1312. The [[Mayorcans]] established a [[missionary|mission]] with a bishop that lasted from 1350 to 1400. It is from this mission that the various paintings and statues of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] that are currently venerated in the island were preserved. European disembarkations of Genovese, [[Castilian people|Castilian]] and Portuguese missionaries and pirates on Canarian shores became relatively common and the prehispanic populations experienced a long and ongoing process of Westernisation before formal colonization took place.

A variety of theories regarding the origins of pre-colonial Canarians explain them by the hypothesis of a more recent immigration. Some scholars (mainly from the [[University of La Laguna]], in Tenerife) defend the theory that the Canarian populations are [[Punic]]-Phoenician in origin. Professor D. Juan Álvarez Delgado, on the other hand, argued that the Canaries remained uninhabited until 100 BCE, when Greek and Roman sailors began to explore the area. In the second half of the 1st century BCE, King [[Juba II]] of [[Numidia]] abandoned [[North Africa]]n prisoners on the islands, who eventually became the pre-Hispanic Canarians.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} If the first inhabitants were abandoned prisoners, this explains, according to Álvarez Delgado, their lack of navigational acumen.

Genetic analysis using [[mitochondrial DNA]] points to the Moroccan [[Berber people|Berbers]] as the African population most closely related to the Guanches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Maca-Meyer | first1 = N. | last2 = Arnay | first2 = M. | last3 = Rando | first3 = J.

== Archaeology ==
[[Archaeology]] suggests that the original settlers arrived by sea, importing [[domestic animal]]s such as [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s and [[dog]]s and [[cereal]]s such as [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[lentil]]s. They also brought with them a set of well-defined socio-cultural practices that seem to have originated and been in use for a long period of time elsewhere.

Today, [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies have led most scholars to accept the view that the pre-colonial population of the Canaries shared common origins with North [[Africa]]n [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes from the [[Atlas Mountains]] region who began to arrive in the Canaries by sea around 1000 BCE or earlier. However, there is no archaeological or historical evidence to prove that either the Berber tribes of the Atlas Mountains or the Canarian pre-colonial population had knowledge or made use of navigation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lissner |first=Ivar |title=The Silent Past: Mysterious and Forgotten Cultures of the World |edition=2003 |year=1962 |publisher=Putnam |isbn= |pages=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of [[Tenerife]] is visible from the African coast on the very clearest of days, but the currents around the islands tend to lead the boats southwest and west, past the archipelago and into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Most scholars would now agree that the earliest reliable dates related to permanent human occupation can be traced back to about 1000 BCE, but different absolute dating technologies such as [[carbon-14]] and [[thermoluminescence]] have provided variable results. Inadequate methodologies and an insufficient number of absolute datings carried out throughout the archipelago have yielded inconsistencies and information gaps.

Studies of precolonial Canarian society illustrate both agricultural and pastoral ways of life in the Canaries.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Diego Cuscoy 1963: 44; González Antón &amp; Tejera Gaspar 1990: 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population genetics ==

A 2003 genetics research article by Nicole Maca-Meyer et al. published in the [[European Journal of Human Genetics]] compared aboriginal Guanche mtDNA (collected from Canarian archaeological sites) to that of today's Canarians and concluded that, "despite the continuous changes suffered by the population (Spanish colonisation, slave trade), aboriginal mtDNA [direct maternal] lineages constitute a considerable proportion [42 – 73%] of the Canarian gene pool. Although the [[Berber people|Berbers]] are the most probable ancestors of the Guanches, it is deduced that important human movements [e.g., the Islamic-Arabic conquest of the Berbers] have reshaped Northwest Africa after the migratory wave to the Canary Islands" and the "results support, from a maternal perspective, the supposition that since the end of the 16th century, at least, two-thirds of the Canarian population had an indigenous substrate, as was previously inferred from historical and anthropological data."&lt;ref name=Maca&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maca-Meyer N, Arnay M, Rando JC |title=Ancient mtDNA analysis and the origin of the Guanches |journal=Eur.

&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most common mtDNA haplogroup found in aboriginal Guanche archaeological burial sites.&lt;ref name=Maca/&gt;

[[Y-DNA]], or Y-chromosomal, (direct paternal) lineages were analysed in a later study by Rosa Fregel and colleagues published in ''BMC Evolutionary Biology''. Y-DNA was extracted from the same
aboriginal Guanche samples used by Nicole Maca-Meyer et al., and compared to samples from 17th-18th century remains post-dating the Spanish conquest of the islands, and samples from the present population. They found [[Berber people|Berber]] Y-chromosome lineages (E-M81, E-M78 and J-M267) prominent in the indigenous remains, confirming the North West African origin for the Guanches deduced Nicole Maca-Meyer et al. from mitochondrial DNA results. "However, in contrast with their female lineages, which have survived in the present-day population since the conquest with only a moderate decline, the male indigenous lineages have dropped constantly being substituted by European lineages." They conclude that the European colonization of the Canary Islands changed the local gene-pool most dramatically in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fregel Rosa | year = 2009 | title = Demographic history of Canary Islands male gene-pool: replacement of native lineages by European | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-9-181.pdf | format = PDF | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 181 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-9-181 | pmid=19650893 | pmc=2728732|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society ==
Although denied by certain scholars (cf. Abreu Galindo 1977: 297), [[division of labour|specialisation of labour]] and a [[hierarchy]] system seem to have governed the social structures of the Canarian precolonial populations. In [[Tenerife]] the highest figure was known as the ''[[Mencey]]'', although, by the time the first Spanish incursions in the Canaries took place, Tenerife had already been divided into nine ''menceyatos'' (i.e. separate regions of the island controlled by its own Mencey), namely ''Anaga, Tegueste, Tacoronte, Taoro, Icod, Daute, Adeje, Abona and Güimar''. Despite the fact that all ''Menceys'' were independent and absolute owners of their territory within the island, it was the ''Mencey of Taoro'' who acted, according to the chronicles, as primus inter pares. [[Gran Canaria]], on the other hand, appears to have been divided into two ''guanartematos'' (i.e. functionally, politically and structurally differentiated regions): ''Telde'' and ''Gáldar'', each governed by a ''Guanarteme''.

Little information has survived regarding the religious and cosmological beliefs of the Guanches. Indigenous Canarian people often performed their religious practices in places marked by particular striking geographical features or types of [[vegetation]]. Certain sites containing architectonic remains and [[cave paintings]] have been identified as sanctuaries.

'''Easter Week''' is the period of seven days from [[Easter]] Sunday through the Saturday following. It follows [[Holy Week]].

==Western Church==
In the [[Latin Rite]] of [[Catholicism]], [[Anglican]] and other [[Western Christianity|Western churches]], Easter Week is the week beginning with the [[Christian]] [[Calendar of Saints|feast]] of [[Easter]] and ending a week later on [[Easter Saturday]].&lt;ref name=CofE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/calendar/seasons.html|title=The Calendar: The Seasons|publisher=[[The Archbishops' Council]] of the [[Church of England]]|year=2000–2006|accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes inaccurately used to mean the week ''before'' Easter, which is properly known as [[Holy Week]], and particularly confusing in this context is the secular misuse of the term ''Easter Saturday'' to refer to the day known [[Christian liturgy|liturgically]] as [[Holy Saturday]] or Easter Eve (the day before Easter), rather than the Saturday following Easter.

While the first day of Easter Week is called ''Easter Day'' or ''Easter Sunday'', the other days in the week may be designated according to any of the following patterns: (1) ''Monday of Easter Week'' (e.g. in the Church of England's ''[[Common Worship]]'' calendar&lt;ref name=CofE /&gt;), (2) ''Monday in Easter Week'' (e.g., in the Anglican Church's ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' calendar&lt;ref name="prayerbook.ca"&gt;http://prayerbook.ca/the-prayer-book-online/85--the-collects-epistles-and-gospels-page-94&lt;/ref&gt;), or (3) ''Easter Monday''. In former years, Easter, as the most important celebration in [[Christianity]], was observed for a week, and it still is celebrated in the liturgy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Anglicanism]] with an [[octave (liturgy)|octave]].&lt;ref name="prayerbook.ca"/&gt; The [[Te Deum]] is sung at the conclusion of [[Matins]]/Office of Readings and the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]] is sung at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] each day of the Octave. The paschal [[sequence]], [[Victimae Paschali Laudes]], may be sung before the Gospel reading on each of these days as well and the gospel readings for each of these days is a scriptural account of the resurrection of Christ (''Monday''—Matthew 28:8-15; ''Tuesday''—John 20:11-18; ''Wednesday''—Luke 24:13-35; ''Thursday''—Luke 24:35-48; ''Friday''—John 21:1-14; ''Saturday''—Mark 16:9-15).

Owing to modern working patterns, many Easter celebrations now occur only on Easter Sunday and [[Easter Monday]] (the latter known in some places, especially those under Polish and Bohemian influence, as [[Śmigus-Dyngus|"Dyngus Day"]]). Easter Tuesday is a [[Public holidays in Australia|public holiday]] in [[Tasmania]] observed by some awards/agreements and the State Public Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=;doc_id=96%2B%2B2000%2BAT%40EN%2B20080816000000;histon=;prompt=;rec=-1;erm=|title=Statutory Holidays Act 2000|publisher=[[Government of Tasmania]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workplacestandards.tas.gov.au/resources/public_holidays/2014|title=Public holidays for 2014|website=workplacestandards.tas.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easter Monday is also a national holiday in the Scandinavian countries which have Lutheran [[state church]]es, and in The Netherlands.

==Eastern Church==
{{main|Bright Week}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and in [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the days of Bright Week are named: [[Bright Monday]], Bright Tuesday, etc. Each day repeats the joyful hymns of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter), with only a few variations, taken from the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]], according to the [[Octoechos|Eight Tones]] of the Orthodox liturgy. One tone (with the exception of the Seventh Tone—known as the "Grave Tone") is assigned to each day:

* Sunday of Pascha (Tone One)
* Bright Monday (Tone Two)
* Bright Tuesday (Tone Three)
* Bright Wednesday (Tone Four)
* Bright Thursday (Tone Five)
* Bright Friday (Tone Six)
* Bright Saturday (Tone Eight)

Bright Week is considered to be one single joyful day, although the celebrations on the Sunday of Pascha are the most solemn. The [[Divine Services]] are completely different during this time than any other time of the year. Everything during the service is sung joyfully, rather than read. There is no reading from the [[Psalter]], and the services are much shorter than usual. There is no [[fasting]] during Bright Week. The [[Holy Doors]] in the [[iconostasis]] remain open throughout the entire week, and the [[Artos]] (a leavened loaf of bread that was blessed during the [[Paschal Vigil]]) remains in the church and is venerated by everyone as they enter the temple as a way of "greeting the Resurrected Christ".

[[Bright Friday]] is the annual [[feast day]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]), as the "Life-giving Spring", and there are optional hymns which may be chanted in honor of the feast in addition to the paschal hymns. If any other feasts on the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|fixed cycle]] occur during Bright Week, they are transferred to a convenient day after [[Thomas Sunday]]. 

Just before the beginning of the [[Ninth Hour]] on [[Bright Saturday]], the Holy Doors are closed, and the services begin to return to their more normal form, although the chanting of the [[Troparion]] of Pascha, "Christ is risen from the dead...", as well as certain other paschal hymns, continue to be chanted until [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].

After receiving her PhD, Boone secured a [[research associate]] position at [[University of Texas at San Antonio]]'s Research Center for the Arts, where she worked for three years. In 1980 Boone took up a position in [[pre-Columbian]] studies at the [[research institution]] she would be associated with for the next fifteen years, the [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection]] located in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Initially as associate [[curator]] (1980–83) and then as Director of Pre-Columbian Studies and Curator of the Pre-Columbian Collection (1983–95), Boone oversaw and held responsibility for Dumbarton Oaks' research and scholarship programs, [[academic conference|symposia]] and [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquia]], scheduled publications and the curatorship of the institution's libraries and collection of pre-Columbian artworks.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae Boone 2006" /&gt; From 2006 onwards Boone has retained a position as one of the six-member Board of Senior Fellows in pre-Columbian Studies at Dumbarton Oaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |title=Senior Fellows in Pre-Columbian Studies |url=http://www.doaks.org/research/pre_columbian/doaks_pco_senior_fellows.html |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks and Trustees for Harvard University |accessdate=2008-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718054307/http://www.doaks.org/research/pre_columbian/doaks_pco_senior_fellows.html |archivedate=July 18, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Boone relocated to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to become professor of art history at Tulane University, where she teaches courses on Mesoamerican, Aztec and colonial-era art history, general art interpretation and theory, and continues to publish research papers and books in the field.

In 1990 Boone was awarded the [[Orden del Águila Azteca]] (Order of the Aztec Eagle), [[Mexico]]'s highest decoration awarded to non-citizens.

'''Giambattista Vico''' (born '''Giovan Battista Vico''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|iː|k|oʊ}}, {{IPA-it|ˈviko|lang}}; 23 June 1668 – 23 January 1744) was an Italian [[political philosopher]] and [[rhetorician]], [[historian]] and [[jurist]], of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He criticized the expansion and development of modern [[rationalism]], was an [[apologist]] for [[Classical Antiquity]], a precursor of systematic and complex thought, in opposition to [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] analysis and other types of [[reductionism]], and was the first expositor of the fundamentals of [[social science]] and of [[semiotics]]. 

The Latin aphorism ''Verum esse ipsum factum'' ("What is true is precisely what is made") coined by Vico is an early instance of [[constructivist epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst von Glasersfeld, ''An Introduction to Radical Constructivism''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bizzell and Herzberg, ''The Rhetorical Tradition'', p. 800.&lt;/ref&gt; He inaugurated the modern field of the [[philosophy of history]], and, although the term ''philosophy of history'' is not in his writings, Vico spoke of a “history of philosophy narrated philosophically."&lt;ref&gt;The contemporary interpretation of Vico is by Verene, Donald Philip. See: "Giambattista Vico" (2002), ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', Steven M. Nadler, ed. London:Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-21800-9}}, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was not an [[historicism|historicist]], contemporary interest in Vico usually has been motivated by historicists, such as [[Isaiah Berlin]], an [[historian of ideas]]&lt;ref&gt;''Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas''&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Edward Said]], a literary critic, and [[Hayden White]], a metahistorian.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico (1976), "The Topics of History: The Deep Structure of the New Science", in Giorgio Tagliacozzo and Donald Philip Verene, eds, "Science of Humanity", Baltimore and London:1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico: An International Symposium.  Giorgio Tagliacozzo and Hayden V. White, eds. Johns Hopkins University Press: 1969.  Attempts to inaugurate a non-historicist interpretation of Vico are in ''Interpretation: A Journal of Political Philosophy'' [http://www.interpretationjournal.com/], Spring 2009, Vol. 36.2, and Spring 2010 37.3; and in ''Historia Philosophica'', Vol. 11, 2013 [http://www.libraweb.net/sommari.php?chiave=5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Giambattista Vico's intellectual ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' is the book ''[[Scienza Nuova]]'' (1725, ''New Science''), which attempts a systematic organization of the [[humanities]] as a single science that recorded and explained the historical cycles by which societies rise and fall.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Encyclopedia'' (2006), David Crystal, ed., p. 1,409.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born to a bookseller in Naples, Italy, Giovan Battista Vico attended several schools, but ill health and dissatisfaction with the [[scholasticism]] of the [[Jesuit]]s led to his being educated at home by tutors. Evidence from his autobiographical work indicates that Vico likely was an autodidact educated under paternal influence, during a three-year absence from school, consequence of an accidental fall when the boy was seven years old.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Costelloe|first=Timothy|title=Giambattista Vico|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vico/|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovann Battista’s formal education was at the [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]] from which he was graduated in 1694, as Doctor of Civil and Canon Law.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

In 1686, after surviving a bout of [[typhus]], he accepted a job as a tutor, in Vatolla, south of [[Salerno]], which became a nine-year professional engagement that lasted till 1695.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; Four years later, in 1699, Vico married Teresa Caterina Destito, a childhood friend, and accepted a chair in [[rhetoric]] at the University of Naples, which he held until ill-health retirement, in 1741.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; Throughout his academic career, Vico would aspire to, but never attain, the more respectable chair of jurisprudence; however, in 1734, he was appointed [[historiographer royal]], by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], King of Naples, at a salary greater than he had earned as a university professor.

==The rhetoric and humanism of Vico==
Vico's version of rhetoric is product of his [[Humanism|humanistic]] and [[pedagogic]] concerns. In the 1708 commencement speech ''De Nostri Temporis Studiorum Ratione'' (''On the Order of the Scholarly Disciplines of Our Times''), Vico said that whoever “intends a career in public life, whether in the courts, the senate, or the pulpit” should be taught to “master the art of topics and [to] defend both sides of a controversy, be it on Nature, Man, or politics, in a freer and brighter style of expression, so he can learn to draw on those arguments which are most probable and have the greatest degree of [[verisimilitude]]”; yet, in ''[[Scienza Nuova]]'', Vico denounced defending both sides in controversies as ''false eloquence''.

As Royal Professor of Latin Eloquence, Vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of Law and of [[Jurisprudence]]; thus, his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric, including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument. Yet, Vico chose to emphasize the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] connection of rhetoric with [[logic]] and [[dialectic]], thereby placing ends (rhetoric) at their center. Vico's objection to modern rhetoric is that it is disconnected from common sense (''sensus communis''), defined as the “worldly sense” that is common to all men.

In lectures and throughout the body of his work, Vico's rhetoric begins from a central [[argument]] (''medius terminus''), which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience. [[Probability]] and circumstance retain their proportionate importance, and [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] — reliant upon topics (''loci'') — supersedes [[axiom]]s derived through reflective, abstract thought. In the tradition of classical Roman rhetoric, Vico sets out to educate the [[orator]] (rhetorician) as the transmitter of the ''oratio'', a speech with ''ratio'' (reason) at the centre. What is essential to the oratorical art (Gr. ῥητορική, ''rhētorikē'') is the orderly link between common sense and an end commensurate with oratory; an end that is not imposed upon the [[imagination]] from above (in the manner of the moderns and dogmatic Christianity), but that is drawn from common sense, itself.  In the tradition of [[Socrates]] and [[Cicero]], Vico's true orator will be midwife to the birth of “the true” (as an idea) from “the certain”, the ignorance in the mind of the student.

Rediscovery of "the most ancient wisdom" of the senses, a wisdom that is ''humana stultitia'' (“human foolishness”), Vico's emphases on the importance of civic life and of professional obligations are in the humanist tradition. He would call for a maieutic (jurisprudential) oratory art against the grain of the modern privilege of the dogmatic form of reason, in what he called the “geometrical method” of [[Descarte|René Descartes]] and the logicians at the [[Port-Royal-des-Champs]] abbey.

==Response to the Cartesian Method==

As he relates in his autobiography, Vico returned to Naples from Vatolla to find "the physics of Descartes at the height of its renown among the established men of letters." Developments in both [[metaphysics]] and the natural sciences abounded as the result of Cartesianism. Widely disseminated by the Port Royal Logic of [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]], Descartes's method was rooted in verification: the only path to truth, and thus knowledge, was through axioms derived from observation. Descartes's insistence that the "sure and indubitable" (or, "clear and distinct") should form the basis of reasoning had an obvious impact on the prevailing views of logic and discourse. Studies in rhetoric{{spaced ndash}}indeed all studies concerned with civic discourse and the realm of probable truths{{spaced ndash}}met with increasing disdain.

Vico's humanism and professional concerns prompted an obvious response that he would develop throughout the course of his writings: the realms of verifiable truth and human concern share only a slight overlap, yet reasoning is required in equal measure in both spheres. One of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the ''De Italorum Sapientia'', where Vico argues that
{{quote|to introduce geometrical method into practical life is "like trying to go mad with the rules of reason," attempting to proceed by a straight line among the tortuosities of life, as though human affairs were not ruled by capriciousness, temerity, opportunity, and chance. Similarly, to arrange a political speech according to the precepts of geometrical method is equivalent to stripping it of any acute remarks and to uttering nothing but pedestrian lines of argument.}}
Vico's position here and in later works is not that the Cartesian method is irrelevant, but that its application cannot be extended to the civic sphere. Instead of confining reason to a string of verifiable axioms, Vico suggests (along with the ancients) that appeals to ''phronēsis'' (φρόνησις or [[practical wisdom]]) must also be made, and likewise appeals to the various components of [[persuasion]] that comprise rhetoric. Vico would reproduce this argument consistently throughout his works, and would use it as a central [[wikt:tenet|tenet]] of the ''[[Scienza Nuova]]''.

==The principle of ''Verum factum''==
Vico is best known for his ''verum factum'' principle, first formulated in 1710 as part of his ''De antiquissima Italorum sapientia, ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda'' (1710) ("On the most ancient wisdom of the Italians, unearthed from the origins of the Latin language").&lt;ref&gt;His wording was "Verum et factum reciprocantur seu convertuntur" ("The true and the made are convertible into each other"), an idea which can be found also in [[occasionalism]] and [[Scotism|Scotist]] [[scholasticism]]&lt;/ref&gt; The principle states that truth is verified through creation or invention and not, as per [[René Descartes|Descartes]], through observation: “The criterion and rule of the true is to have made it. Accordingly, our clear and distinct idea of the mind cannot be a criterion of the mind itself, still less of other truths. For while the mind perceives itself, it does not make itself.” This criterion for truth would later shape the history of [[civilization]] in Vico’s opus, the ''[[Scienza Nuova]]'' (''The New Science'', 1725), because he would argue that civil life{{spaced ndash}}like [[mathematics]]{{spaced ndash}}is wholly constructed.

==The ''Scienza Nuova''==
{{main|Scienza Nuova}}
[[File:Vico La scienza nuova.gif|right|thumb|Title page of ''Principj di Scienza Nuova'' (1744 ed.)]]
''The New Science'' (1725, ''Scienza Nuova'') is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history, and for historicists such as Isaiah Berlin and Hayden White.

==Influence==
[[Samuel Beckett|Samuel Beckett's]] first published work, in the selection of critical essays on [[James Joyce]] entitled ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'', is "Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce". In it, Beckett sees a profound influence of Vico's philosophy and poetics — as well the cyclical form of the ''Scienza Nuova'' — on the avant-garde compositions of Joyce, and especially the titular Work in Progress, viz. [[Finnegans Wake]].

In ''Knowledge and Social Structure'' (1974), Peter Hamilton identified Giambattista Vico as the “sleeping partner” of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0710077462|location = London|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time, and read only in his native Naples, the ideas of Vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the Enlightenment. Moreover, recognition of Vico’s intellectual influence began in the 19th century, when the French Romantic historians used his works as methodological models and guides.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0710077462|location = London|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Das Kapital|Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1867), [[Karl Marx]]’s mention of Vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history, the role of historical actors, and an historical method of narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Capital, Book 1|last = Marx|first = Karl|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = Book 1, part IV, chapter 13, n. 89 (footnote)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Vico saw [[Class conflict|social-class warfare]] as the means by which men achieve the end of [[Equality before the law|equal rights]]; Vico called that time the "Age of Men". Marx concluded that such a state of affairs is the optimal end of social change in a society, but Vico thought that such complete equality would lead to socio-political chaos and the consequent collapse of society. In that vein, Vico proposed a social need for religion, for a supernatural [[Divine Providence]] to keep order in human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaix-Ruy|first=Jules-Marie|title=Giambattista Vico|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/627497/Giambattista-Vico|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Orientalism]]'' (1978), [[Edward Said]] acknowledged his scholar’s debt to Vico;&lt;ref name="Orientalism"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Orientalism|last = Said|first = Edward|publisher = Penguin Classics|year = 2003 |origyear=1978|isbn = |location = |pages = xviii, 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose “ideas anticipate and later infiltrate the line of German thinkers I am about to cite. They belong to the era of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolf]], later to be followed by [[Goethe]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Gadamer]], and finally the great Twentieth Century Romance philologists [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Leo Spitzer]], and [[Ernst Robert Curtius]].”&lt;ref name="Orientalism" /&gt; As a humanist and early philologist, Vico represented “a different, alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work”, which differed from mainstream Western prejudice against the Orient and the dominating “standardization” that came with modernity and culminated in [[National Socialism]].&lt;ref name="Orientalism" /&gt; That the interdependence of human history and culture facilitates the scholars’ task to “take seriously Vico’s great observation that men make their own history, that what they can know is what they have made, and extend it to geography. As geographical and cultural entities — to say nothing of historical entities — such locales, regions, and geographical sectors as ‘Orient’ and ‘Occident’ are man-made.”&lt;ref name="Orientalism" /&gt;

[[File:Iron Age Italy.svg|thumb|300px|Approximate distribution of languages in Iron Age [[Italy]] during the 6th century BC. Latin is confined to [[Latium]], a small region on the coast of west central Italy, hemmed in by other Italic peoples on the east and south and the powerful [[Etruscan civilization]] on the north.]]

[[Latin]] is a member of the broad family of [[Italic languages]]. Its alphabet, the [[Latin alphabet]], emerged from the [[Old Italic alphabet]]s, which in turn were derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] scripts. Historical Latin came from the prehistoric language of the [[Latium]] region, specifically around the River [[Tiber]], where [[ancient Rome|Roman civilization]] first developed. How and when Latin came to be spoken by the Romans are questions that have long been debated. Various influences on Latin of [[Italo-Celtic|Celtic dialects]] in [[northern Italy]], the non-Indo-European [[Etruscan language]] in [[Central Italy]], and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] of [[southern Italy]] have been detected, but when these influences entered the native Latin is not known for certain.

Surviving [[Latin literature]] consists almost entirely of [[Classical Latin]] in its broadest definition. It includes a polished and sometimes highly stylized [[literary language]] sometimes termed Golden Latin, which spans the 1st century BC and the early years of the 1st century AD. However, throughout the history of ancient Rome the spoken language differed in both grammar and vocabulary from that of literature, and is referred to as [[Vulgar Latin]]. &lt;!-- Classical Latin literature was by definition written, and thus didn't have pronunciation---&gt; In addition to Latin, the [[Greek language]] was often spoken by the well-educated elite, who studied it in school and acquired Greek tutors from among the influx of enslaved educated Greek prisoners of war, captured during the [[Roman Greece|Roman conquest of Greece]]. In the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which became the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Greek [[Koine]] of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] remained current and was never replaced by Latin. It continued to influence the Vulgar Latin that evolved into the [[Eastern Romance languages]].

The name Latin derives from the Italic tribal group named [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]] that settled around the 10th century BC in Latium, and the dialect spoken by these people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Robert Palmer]] - The Latin language - 372 pages   [https://books.google.com/books?id=O7z4Sl-SgFEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7 University of Oklahoma Press, 1987] Retrieved 2012-02-01 {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Italic''' languages form a ''[[centum]]'' subfamily of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. These include the [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], and [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] languages, and a number of extinct ones.

Broadly speaking, in initial syllables the Indo-European simple vowels — ''(*a), *e, *i, *o, *u''; short and long — are usually retained in Latin. The [[Schwa#Schwa indogermanicum|schwa indogermanicum]] (''*ə'') appears in Latin as ''a'' (cf. IE ''*pəter'' &gt; L ''pater''). Diphthongs are also preserved in Old Latin, but in Classical Latin some tend to become monophthongs (for example ''oi'' &gt; ''ū'' or ''oe'', and ''ei'' &gt; ''ē'' &gt; ''ī'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramat|first=Anna G.|author2=Paolo Ramat|year=1998|title=The Indo-European Languages|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=272–75|isbn=0-415-06449-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-initial syllables, there was more vowel reduction.  The most extreme case occurs with short vowels in medial [[open syllable]]s (i.e. short vowels followed by at most a single consonant, occurring neither in the first nor last syllable): All are reduced to a single vowel, which appears as ''i'' in most cases, but ''e'' (sometimes ''o'') before ''r'', and ''u'' before an ''l'' which is followed by ''o'' or ''u''.  In final syllables, short ''e'' and ''o'' are usually raised to ''i'' and ''u'', respectively.

Consonants are generally more stable.  However, the Indo-European voiced aspirates ''bh, dh, gh, gwh'' are not maintained, becoming ''f, f, h, f'' respectively at the beginning of a word, but usually ''b, d, g, v'' elsewhere. Note that non-initial ''dh'' becomes ''b'' next to ''r'' or ''u'', e.g. ''*h₁rudh-'' "red" &gt; ''rub-'', e.g. ''rubeō'' "to be red"; ''*werdh-'' "word" &gt; ''verbum''.  ''s'' between vowels famously becomes ''r'', e.g. ''flōs'' "flower", gen. ''flōris''; ''erō'' "I will be" vs. root ''es-''; ''aurōra'' "dawn" &lt; *''ausōsā'' (cf. [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] ''*aust-'' &gt; English "east", [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''uṣā́s'' "dawn"); ''soror'' "sister" &lt; ''*sosor'' &lt; ''*swesōr'' (cf. [[Old English]] ''sweostor'' "sister").

Of the original eight [[Grammatical case|case]]s of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], Latin inherited six: [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], and [[ablative]]. The Indo-European [[locative]] survived in the declensions of some place names and a few common nouns, such as ''Roma'' "Rome" (locative ''Romae'') and ''domus'' "home" (locative ''domī'' "at home"). Vestiges of the [[instrumental case]] may remain in adverbial forms ending in ''-ē''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramat|first=Anna G.|author2=Paolo Ramat|year=1998|title=The Indo-European Languages|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=313|isbn=0-415-06449-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the earliest surviving inscription is a seventh-century B.C. pin known as the ''[[Praenestine fibula]]'', which reads ''Manios med fhefhaked Numasioi'' "Manius made me for Numerius".&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy J.

==Old Latin==
[[File:Duenos inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Duenos inscription]], from the 6th century BC, is the second-earliest known [[Old Latin|Latin]] text.]]
{{main|Old Latin}}
'''Old Latin''' (also called '''Early Latin''' or '''Archaic Latin''') refers to the period of Latin texts before the age of [[Classical Latin]], extending from textual fragments that probably originated in the [[Roman monarchy]] to the written language of the late [[Roman republic]] about 75 BC. Almost all the writing of its earlier phases is inscriptional.

Some phonological characteristics of older Latin are the case endings ''-os'' and ''-om'' (later Latin ''-us'' and ''-um'').  In many locations, classical Latin turned intervocalic /s/ into /r/.  This had implications for [[declension]]: early classical Latin, ''honos'', ''honosis''; Classical ''honor'', ''honoris'' ("honor").  Some  Latin texts preserve /s/ in this position, such as the [[Carmen Arvale]]'s ''lases'' for ''[[lares]]''.

==Classical Latin==
{{main|Classical Latin}}
[[File:Commentarii de Bello Gallico.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] is one of the most famous classical Latin texts of the Golden Age of Latin. The unvarnished, journalistic style of this upper-class general has long been taught as a model of the urbane Latin officially spoken and written in the floruit of the [[Roman republic]].]]
'''Classical Latin''' is the form of the Latin language used by the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] in Classical Latin literature. In the latest and narrowest [[philology|philological model]] its use spanned the Golden Age of Latin literature – broadly the 1st century BC and the early 1st century AD – possibly extending to the Silver Age – broadly the 1st and 2nd centuries. It was a polished [[writing|written]] [[literary language]] based on the refined spoken language of the upper classes. Classical Latin differs from Old Latin: the earliest inscriptional language and the earliest authors, such as [[Ennius]], [[Plautus]] and others, in a number of ways; for example, the early ''-om'' and ''-os'' endings shifted into ''-um'' and ''-us'' ones, and some lexical differences also developed, such as the broadening of the meaning of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=W. Sidney|year=1989|title=Vox Latina|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=83–84|isbn=0-521-22049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadest and most ancient sense, the classical period includes the authors of Early Latin, the Golden Age and the Silver Age.

===Golden Age===
The '''[[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of Latin literature''' is a period consisting roughly of the time from 75&amp;nbsp;BC to AD&amp;nbsp;14, covering the end of the [[Roman Republic]] and the reign of [[Augustus Caesar]]. In the currently used philological model this period represents the peak of Latin literature. Since the earliest post-classical times the Latin of those authors has been an ideal norm of the best Latin, which other writers should follow.

===Silver Age===
In reference to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] literature, the '''Silver age''' covers the first two centuries AD directly after the [[Golden age of Latin Literature|Golden age]]. Literature from the Silver Age is more embellished with mannerisms.

==Late Latin==
{{main|Late Latin}}
'''Late Latin''' is the administrative and literary language of [[Late Antiquity]] in the late Roman empire and states that succeeded the [[Western Roman Empire]] over the same range. By its broadest definition it is dated from about 200 AD to about 900 AD when it was replaced by written [[Romance languages]]. Opinion concerning whether it should be considered classical is divided. The authors of the period looked back to a classical period they believed should be imitated and yet their styles were often classical. According to the narrowest definitions, Late Latin did not exist and the authors of the times are to be considered medieval.

==Vulgar Latin==
{{main|Vulgar Latin}}
[[File:pompeii-graffiti.jpg|frame|300px|Vulgar Latin, as in this political [[graffiti|graffito]] at [[Pompeii]], was the language of the ordinary people of the [[Roman Empire]], distinct from the [[Classical Latin]] of literature.]]
'''Vulgar Latin''' (in Latin, ''sermo vulgaris'') is a blanket term covering [[vernacular]] dialects of the Latin language spoken from earliest times in Italy until the latest dialects of the [[Western Roman Empire]], diverging still further, evolved into the early [[Romance languages]] – whose writings began to appear about the 9th century.

This spoken Latin differed from the [[literary language]] of Classical Latin in its grammar and vocabulary. It is likely to have evolved over time, with some features not appearing until the late Empire. Other features are likely to have been in place much earlier. Because there are few phonetic transcriptions of the daily speech of these Latin speakers (to match, for example, the post-classical [[Appendix Probi]]) Vulgar Latin must be studied mainly by indirect methods.

[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|300px|A replica of the Old Roman Cursive inspired by the [[Vindolanda tablets]]]]
Knowledge of Vulgar Latin comes from a variety of sources.  First, the [[comparative method]] reconstructs items of the mother language from the attested Romance languages. Also, [[Prescription and description|prescriptive grammar]] texts from the Late Latin period condemn some usages as errors, providing insight into how Latin was actually spoken. The [[solecism]]s and non-Classical usages occasionally found in late Latin texts also shed light on the spoken language. A windfall source lies in the chance finds of [[wax tablet]]s such as those found at [[Vindolanda]] on [[Hadrian's Wall]]. The [[Roman cursive]] script was used on these tablets.

==Romance languages==
{{main|Romance languages}}

The '''Romance languages''', a major branch of the Indo-European language family, comprise all languages that descended from Latin, the language of the Roman Empire.  The Romance languages have more than 700 million native speakers worldwide, mainly in the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]], as well as in many smaller regions scattered through the world.

All Romance languages descend from Vulgar Latin, the language of soldiers, settlers, and slaves of the [[Roman Empire]], which was substantially different from that of the Roman ''literati''. Between 200 BC and AD 100, the expansion of the Empire and the administrative and educational policies of Rome made Vulgar Latin the dominant vernacular language over a wide area which stretched from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] to the west coast of the [[Black Sea]]. During the Empire's decline and after its collapse and fragmentation in the 5th century, Vulgar Latin began to evolve independently within each local area, and eventually diverged into dozens of distinct languages. The overseas empires established by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] and [[French colonial empires|France]] after the 15th century then spread these languages to other continents – about two thirds of all Romance speakers are now outside Europe.

In spite of the multiple influences of pre-Roman languages and later invasions, the [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexicon]], and [[syntax]] of all Romance languages are predominantly derived from Vulgar Latin. As a result, the group shares a number of linguistic features that set it apart from other Indo-European branches.

==Ecclesiastical Latin==
{{main|Ecclesiastical Latin}}
'''Ecclesiastical Latin''' (sometimes called '''Church Latin''') is a broad and analogous term referring to the Latin language as used in documents of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], its [[liturgy|liturgies]] (mainly in past times) and during some periods the preaching of its ministers. Ecclesiastical Latin is not a single style: the term merely means the language promulgated at any time by the church. In terms of stylistic periods, it belongs to Late Latin in the Late Latin period, Medieval Latin in the Medieval Period, and so on through to the present. One may say that, starting from the church's decision in the early Late Latin period to use a simple and unornamented language that would be comprehensible to ordinary Latin speakers and yet still be elegant and correct, church Latin is usually a discernible substyle within the major style of the period. Its authors in the [[New Latin]] period are typically paradigmatic of the best Latin and that is true in contemporary times. The decline in its use within the last 100 years has been a matter of regret to some, who have formed organizations inside and outside the church to support its use and to use it.

==Medieval Latin==
{{main|Medieval Latin}}
[[File:Carmina Cantabrigiensia Manuscr-C-fol436v.jpg|thumb| Page with medieval Latin text from the ''[[Carmina Cantabrigiensia]]'' (Cambridge University Library, Gg. 5. 35), 11th century]]

'''Medieval Latin''', the literary and administrative Latin used in the [[Middle Ages]], exhibits much variation between individual authors, mainly due to poor communications in those times between different regions. The individuality is characterised by a different range of [[solecisms]] and by the borrowing of different words from [[Vulgar Latin]] or from local vernaculars. Some styles show features intermediate between Latin and Romance languages; others are closer to classical Latin. The stylistic variations came to an end with the rise of [[Nation state | nation states]] and new empires in the [[Renaissance]] period, and the authority of early [[university | universities]] imposing a new style: [[Renaissance Latin]].

==Renaissance Latin==
{{main|Renaissance Latin}}
'''Renaissance Latin''' is a name given to the Latin written during the European [[Renaissance]] in the 14th-16th centuries, particularly distinguished by the distinctive Latin style developed by [[Renaissance humanism|the humanist movement]].

''[[Ad fontes]]'' was the general cry of the humanists, and as such their Latin style sought to purge Latin of the [[medieval Latin]] vocabulary and stylistic accretions that it had acquired in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire.  They looked to Golden Age Latin literature, and especially to [[Cicero]] in [[prose]] and [[Virgil]] in [[poetry]], as the arbiters of Latin style.  They abandoned the use of the [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]] and other accentual forms of [[meter in poetry|meter]], and sought instead to revive the Greek formats that were used in [[Latin poetry]] during the Roman period.  The humanists condemned the large body of medieval Latin literature as "[[High Medieval|gothic]]" – for them, a term of abuse – and believed instead that only ancient Latin from the Roman period was "real Latin".

The humanists also sought to purge written Latin of medieval developments in its [[orthography]].  They insisted, for example, that ''ae'' be written out in full wherever it occurred in classical Latin; medieval scribes often wrote ''e'' instead of ''ae''.  They were much more zealous than medieval Latin writers in distinguishing ''t'' from ''c'': because the effects of [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] made them [[homophone]]s, medieval scribes often wrote, for example, ''eciam'' for ''etiam''.  Their reforms even affected [[handwriting]]: humanists usually wrote Latin in a script derived from [[Carolingian minuscule]], the ultimate ancestor of most contemporary [[lower-case]] [[typeface]]s, avoiding the [[black-letter]] scripts used in the Middle Ages.  [[Erasmus]] even proposed that the [[Latin regional pronunciation|then-traditional pronunciations]] of Latin be abolished in favour of his [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed version]] of [[classical Latin]] pronunciation.

The humanist plan to remake Latin was largely successful, at least in [[education]].  Schools now taught the humanistic spellings, and encouraged the study of the texts selected by the humanists, largely to the exclusion of later Latin literature.  On the other hand, while humanist Latin was an elegant [[literary language]], it became much harder to write books about [[law]], [[medicine]], [[science]] or contemporary [[politics]] in Latin while observing all of the humanists' norms of vocabulary purging and classical usage.  Because humanist Latin lacked precise vocabulary to deal with modern issues, their reforms accelerated the transformation of Latin from a working language to an object of antiquarian study.  Their attempts at literary work, especially poetry, often have a strong element of [[pastiche]].

==New Latin==
[[File:akihitum-et-michikam.jpg|thumb|300px|A Recent Latin inscription at [[Salamanca University]] commemorating the visit of the then-Prince "[[Akihito|Akihitus]]" and Princess "[[Empress Michiko of Japan|Michika]]" of Japan on 28 February 1985]]
{{main|New Latin}}
'''New Latin''' (or '''Neo-Latin''') is a post-medieval version of Latin, now  used primarily in [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[systematics]]. The term came into widespread use towards the end of the 1890s among [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[scientist]]s.

[[Classics|Classicist]]s use the term "Neo-Latin" to describe the use of the Latin language for any purpose, scientific or literary, after the [[Renaissance]] (for which purpose they often use the date 1500), although, for example, the editors of the [[I Tatti Renaissance Library]] call their [[Renaissance]] Latin language texts Neo-Latin as well.  Such [[Contemporary Latin]] includes ecclesiastical use, as well as translations from modern languages into Latin and the occasional poetry.  Under the name "Living Latin", some have advocated reviving the language as a means of spoken communication.

==Phonological changes==

===Vowels===
[[Proto-Italic]] inherited all ten of the early post-[[Proto-Indo-European]] simple vowels (i.e. at a time when laryngeals had colored and often lengthened adjacent vowels and then disappeared in many circumstances): ''*a, *e, *i, *o, *u, *ā, *ē, *ī, *ō, *ū''.  It also inherited all of the post-PIE diphthongs except for ''*eu'', which became ''*ou''.  [[Proto-Italic]] and [[Old Latin]] had a [[stress accent]] on the first syllable of a word, and this caused steady reduction and eventual deletion of many short vowels in non-initial syllables while affecting initial syllables much less.  Long vowels were largely unaffected in general except in final syllables, where they had a tendency to shorten.

====Pure vowels====

=====Initial syllables=====
In initial syllables, Latin generally preserves all of the simple vowels of Proto-Italic (see above):
*PIE ''*h₂eǵros'' "field" &gt; ''*agro-'' &gt; ''ager'', gen. ''agrī'' (cf. Greek ''agrós'', English ''acre'', Sanskrit ''ájra-'')
*PIE ''*kápr̥-'' "penis" &gt; ''*kapros'' &gt; ''caper'' "he-goat", gen. ''caprī'' (cf. Greek ''kápros'' "boar", Old English ''hæfer'' "he-goat", Sanskrit ''kápr̥th-'' "penis")
*PIE ''*seḱs'' "six", ''septḿ̥'' "seven" &gt; ''sex, septem'' (cf. Greek ''heks, heptá'', Lithuanian ''šešì'', ''septynì'', Sanskrit ''ṣáṣ, saptá'')
*PIE *''kʷis'' &gt; ''quis'' "who?" (Greek ''tís'',&lt;ref&gt;''kʷi-'' &gt; ''ti-'' is normal in [[Attic Greek]]; Thessalian Greek had ''kís'' while Cypro-Arcadian had ''sís''.&lt;/ref&gt; Avestan ''čiš'', Sanskrit ''kíḥ'')
*PIE *''kʷod'' &gt; ''quod'' "what, that" (relative) (Old English ''hwæt'' "what", Sanskrit ''kád'')
*PIE ''*oḱtōu'' "eight" &gt; ''octō'' (Greek ''oktṓ'', Irish ''ocht'', Sanskrit ''aṣṭā́(u)'')
*PIE ''*nokʷts'' "night" &gt; ''nox'', gen. ''noctis'' (Greek ''nuks'' &lt; ''*nokʷs'', Sanskrit ''nák'' &lt; ''*nakts'', Lithuanian ''naktìs'')
*PIE ''*(H)yug-óm'' "yoke" &gt; ''iugum'' (Greek ''zugón'', Gothic ''juk'', Sanskrit ''yugá-'')
*PIE ''*méh₂tēr'' "mother" &gt; ''*mā́tēr'' &gt; ''māter'' ([[Doric Greek]] ''mā́tēr'', Old Irish ''máthir'', Sanskrit ''mātár-'')
*PIE ''*sweh₂dús'' "pleasing, tasty" &gt; ''*swādu-'' &gt; ''*swādwi-'' (remade into ''i''-stem) &gt; ''suāvis'' (Doric Greek ''hādús'', English ''sweet'', Sanskrit ''svādú-'')
*PIE ''*sēmi-'' (or ''*seh₁mi-'') "half" &gt; ''sēmi-'' (Greek ''hēmi-'', Old English ''sām-'')
*PIE ''*gneh₃-tó-'' "known" &gt; ''*gnō-tó-'' &gt; ''nōtus'' (cf. ''i-gnōtus'' "unknown"; Welsh ''gnawd'' "customary", Sanskrit ''jñātá-''; Greek ''gnōtós''&lt;ref&gt;Greek is ambiguously either &lt; ''*gneh₃-tó-'' or ''*gn̥h₃-tó-''&lt;/ref&gt;)
*PIE ''*muHs'' "mouse" &gt; ''mūs'' (cf. Old English ''mūs'', Greek ''mûs'', Sanskrit ''mū́ṣ-'')

Short vowel changes in initial syllables:
# ''*swe-'' &gt; ''so-'':
#*''*swesōr'' &gt; ''soror'', gen. ''sorōris'' "sister"
#*''*swépnos'' (or *''swópnos'') &gt; ''somnus'' "sleep"
# ''*we-'' &gt; ''wo-'' before labial consonants or [[Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarized ''l'']] [ɫ] (''l pinguis''; i.e. an ''l'' not followed by ''i'', ''ī'' or ''l''):
#*''*welō'' "I want" &gt; ''volō'' (vs. ''velle'' "to want" before ''l exīlis'')
#*''*wemō'' "I vomit" &gt; ''vomō'' (cf. Greek ''eméō'', Sanskrit ''vámiti'')
# ''e'' &gt; ''i'' before {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (spelled ''n'' before a velar, or ''g'' before ''n''):
#*PIE *''dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s'' &gt; ''*dn̥ɣwā'' &gt; ''*denɣʷā'' &gt; Old Latin ''dingua'' &gt; ''lingua'' "tongue" (''l-'' from ''lingō'' "to lick")
#*PIE ''*pénkwe'' "five" &gt; *''kʷenkʷe'' &gt; ''quīnque'' (long ''ī'' from ''quīntus'' "fifth" &lt; ''*quīnctos'', where lengthening is normal before ''nct'')
#*PIE ''*deḱ-no-'' &gt; *''deŋno-'' &gt; ''dignus'' "worthy"

There are numerous examples where PIE ''*o'' appears to result in Latin ''a'' instead of expected ''o'', mostly next to labial or labializing consonants. A group of cases showing ''*-ow-'' &gt; ''-av-'' (before stress), ''*-ōw-'' &gt; ''-āv-'' is known as '''Thurneysen-Havet's law'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=N. E.|last=Collinge|title=The Laws of Indo-European|year=1985|publisher=John Benjamins|ISBN=90-272-3530-9|pp=193–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;: examples include PIE ''*lowh₃ṓ'' &gt; ''*lowṓ'' &gt; ''lavō'' 'I wash'; PIE ''*oḱtōwos'' &gt; ''octāvus'' 'eighth' (but ''octō'' 'eight'). Other cases remain more disputed, such as ''mare'' 'sea', in contrast to Irish ''muir'', Welsh ''môr'' (Proto-Celtic *mori) &lt; PIE ''*móri''; ''lacus'' 'lake', in contrast to Irish ''loch'' &lt; PIE ''*lok-u-''. De Vaan (2008: 8) suggests a general shift ''*o'' &gt; ''a'' in open syllables when preceded by any of ''*b'', ''*m''; ''*kʷ'', ''*w''; ''*l''. Vine (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Brent|last=Vine|title=Initial ''*mo-'' in Latin and Italic|year=2011|journal=Münchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft|issue=65|pp=261–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; disputes the cases with ''*moCV'', but proposes inversely that ''*mo-'' &gt; ''ma-'' when followed by ''r'' plus a velar (''k'' or ''g'').

=====Medial syllables=====
In non-initial syllables, there was more vowel reduction of short vowels.  The most extreme case occurs with short vowels in medial syllables (i.e. short vowels in a syllable that is neither the first nor the last), where all five vowels usually merge into a single vowel:

1. They merge into ''e'' before ''r'' (sometimes original ''o'' is unaffected)
*''*in-armis'' &gt; ''inermis'' "unarmed" (vs. ''arma'' "arms")
*Latin-[[Faliscan language|Faliscan]] ''*pe-par-ai'' "I gave birth" &gt; ''peperī'' (vs. ''pariō'' "I give birth")
*''*kom-gesō'' &gt; ''congerō'' "to collect" (vs. ''gerō'' "to do, carry out")
*''*kinis-es'' "ash" (gen.sg.) &gt; ''cineris'' (vs. nom.sg. ''cinis'')
*''*Falisioi'' &gt; ''Faleriī'' "Falerii (major town of the Faliscans)" (vs. ''Faliscus'' "Faliscan")
*''*-foro-'' "carrying" (cf. Greek ''-phóros'') &gt; ''-fero-'', e.g. ''furcifer'' "gallows bird"
*PIE ''*swéḱuros'' "father-in-law" &gt; ''*swekuros'' &gt; Old Latin ''*soceros'' &gt; ''socer'', gen. ''socerī''

2. They become Old Latin ''o'' &gt; ''u'' before ''l pinguis'', i.e., an ''l'' not followed by ''i, ī,'' or ''l'':
*''*en-saltō'' "to leap upon" &gt; ''īnsoltō'' (with lengthening before ''ns'') &gt; ''īnsultō'' (vs. ''saltō'' "I leap")
*''*ad-alēskō'' "to grow up" &gt; ''adolēscō'' &gt; ''adulēscō'' (vs. ''alō'' "I nourish")
*''*ob-kelō'' "to conceal" &gt; ''occulō'' (vs. ''celō'' "I hide")
*Greek ''Sikelós'' "a Sicilian" &gt; ''*Sikolos'' &gt; ''Siculus'' (vs. ''Sicilia'' "Sicily")
*''te-tol-ai'' &gt; ''tetulī'' "I carried" (formerly ''l pinguis'' here because of the original final ''-ai'')
*''kom-solō'' "deliberate" &gt; ''cōnsulō''
*PIE ''*-kl̥d-to-'' "beaten" &gt; ''*-kolsso-''&lt;ref&gt;''l̥'' &gt; ''ol'' is normal in Proto-Italic.&lt;/ref&gt; &gt; ''perculsus'' "beaten down"

3. But they remain ''o'' before ''l pinguis'' when immediately following a vowel:
*Latin-[[Faliscan language|Faliscan]] ''*fili-olos'' &gt; ''filiolus'' "little son"
*Similarly, ''alveolus'' "trough"

4. Before /w/ the result is always ''u'', in which case the /w/ is not written:
*''*eks-lawō'' "I wash away" &gt; ''ēluō''
*''*mon-i-wai'' "I warned" &gt; ''monuī''
*''*tris-diw-om'' "period of three days" &gt; ''trīduom'' &gt; ''trīduum''
*''*dē nowōd'' "anew" &gt; ''dēnuō''

5. They become ''i'' before one consonant other than ''r'' or ''l pinguis'':
*''*re-fakjō'' "to remake" &gt; ''*refakiō'' &gt; ''reficiō'' (vs. ''faciō'' "I do, make")
*Latin-[[Faliscan language|Faliscan]] ''*ke-kad-ai'' "I fell" &gt; ''cecidī'' (vs. ''cadō'' "I fall")
*''*ad-tenējō'' &gt; ''attineō'' "to concern" (vs. ''teneō'' "I hold")
*''*kom-regō'' &gt; ''corrigō'' "to set right, correct" (vs. ''regō'' "I rule; straighten")
*Greek ''Sikelía'' "Sicily" &gt; ''Sicilia'' (vs. ''Siculus'' "a Sicilian")
*PIE ''*me-món-h₂e'' (perfect) "thought, pondered" &gt; Latin-Faliscan ''*me-mon-ai'' &gt; ''meminī'' "I remember"
*''*kom-itājō'' "accompany" &gt; ''comitō''
*''*nowotāts'' "newness" &gt; ''novitās''
*''*kornu-kan-'' "trumpeter" &gt; ''cornicen''
*''*kaput-es'' "head" (gen. sg.) &gt; ''capitis'' (vs. nom.sg. ''caput'')

6. But they sometimes become ''e'' before one consonant other than ''r'' or ''l pinguis'', when immediately following a vowel:
*''*sokiotāts'' "fellowship" &gt; ''societās''
*''*wariogājesi'' "to make diverse" &gt; ''variegāre''
*But: ''*tībia-kan-'' "flute-player" &gt; ''*tībiikan-'' &gt; ''tībīcen''
*But: ''*medio-diēs'' "midday" &gt; ''*meriodiēs'' (dissimilative rhotacism) &gt; ''*meriidiēs'' &gt; ''merīdiēs'' "noon; south"

7. Variation between ''i'' and (often earlier) ''u'' is common before a single labial consonant (''p, b, f, m''), underlyingly the [[sonus medius]] vowel:
*From the root ''*-kap-'' "grab, catch":
**''occupō'' "seize" vs. ''occipiō'' "begin"
**From the related noun ''*-kaps'' "catcher": ''prīnceps'' "chief" (lit. "seizer of the first (position)"), gen. ''prīncipis'', vs. ''auceps'' "bird catcher", gen. ''aucupis''
**''*man-kapiom'' &gt; ''mancupium'' "purchase", later ''mancipium''
*''*sub-rapuit'' &gt; ''surrupuit'' "filches", later ''surripuit''
*''*mag-is-emos'' &gt; ''maxumus'' "biggest", later ''maximus''; similarly ''proxumus'' "nearest", ''optumus'' "best" vs. later ''proximus'', ''optimus''
*''*pot-s-omos'' &gt; ''possumus'' "we can"; ''*vel-omos'' &gt; ''volumus'' "we want"; but ''*leg-omos'' &gt; ''legimus'' "we gather", and all other such verbs (''-umus'' is isolated in ''sumus'', ''possumus'' and ''volumus'')

Medially before two consonants, when the first is not ''r'' or ''l pinguis'', the vowels do not merge to the same degree:

1. Original ''a'', ''e'' and ''u'' merge into ''e'':
*Greek ''tálanton'' &gt; ''*talantom'' &gt; ''talentum''
*''*sub-raptos'' "filched" &gt; ''surreptus'' (vs. ''raptus'' "seized")
*''*re-faktos'' "remade" &gt; ''refectus'' (cf. ''factus'' "made")
*''*ad-tentos'' &gt; ''attentus'' "concerned" (cf. ''tentus'' "held", ''attineō'' "to concern")

2. But original ''i'' is unaffected:
*''*re-likʷtos'' "left (behind)" &gt; ''relictus''

3. And original ''o'' raises to ''u'':
*''*legontor'' "they gather" &gt; ''leguntur''
*''*ejontes'' "going" (gen. sg.) &gt; ''euntis''
*''rōbos-to-'' &gt; ''rōbustus'' "oaken" (cf. ''rōbur'' "oak" &lt; ''*rōbos'')

=====Syncope=====
'''Exon's Law''' dictates that if there are two light medial syllables in a row (schematically, ''σσ̆σ̆σ'', where ''σ'' = syllable and ''σ̆'' = light syllable, where "light" means a short vowel followed by only a single consonant), the first syllable syncopates (i.e. the vowel is deleted):
*''*deksiteros'' "right (hand)" &gt; ''dexterus'' (cf. Greek ''deksiterós'')
*''*re-peparai'' &gt; ''repperī'' "I found" (cf. ''peperī'' "I gave birth" &lt; ''*peparai'')
*''*prīsmo-kapes'' &gt; ''prīncipis'' "prince" gen. sg. (nom. sg. ''prīnceps'' &lt; ''*prīsmo-kaps'' by analogy)
*''*mag-is-emos'' &gt; ''maximus'' "biggest" (cf. ''magis'' "more")

Syncopation tends to occur after ''r'' and ''l'' in all non-initial syllables, sometimes even in initial syllables.&lt;ref name="Sihler 1995"&gt;Sihler, New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
*''*feret'' "he carries" &gt; ''fert''
*''*agros'' "field" &gt; ''*agr̩s'' &gt; ''*agers'' &gt; ''*agerr'' &gt; ''ager''
* ''*imbris'' "rainstorm" &gt; ''*imbers'' &gt; ''imber''
*''*tris'' "three times" &gt; ''*tr̩s'' &gt; ''*ters'' &gt; Old Latin ''terr'' &gt; ''ter''
*''*faklitāts'' &gt; ''facultās''
Sometimes early syncope causes apparent violations of Exon's Law:
*''kosolinos'' "of hazel" &gt; ''*kozolnos'' (not ''**koslinos'') &gt; ''*korolnos'' &gt; ''*korulnos'' (''o &gt; u'' before ''l pinguis'', see above) &gt; ''colurnus'' (metathesis)

Syncope of ''-i-'' also occurred in ''-ndis'', ''-ntis'' and ''-rtis''.&lt;ref name="Sihler 1995"/&gt; ''-nts'' then became ''-ns'' with lengthening of the preceding vowel, while ''-rts'' was simplified to ''-rs'' without lengthening.
* ''*montis'' "hill" &gt; ''*monts'' &gt; ''mōns''
* ''*gentis'' "tribe" &gt; ''*gents'' &gt; ''gēns''
* ''*frondis'' "leaf" &gt; ''*fronts'' &gt; ''frōns''
* ''*partis'' "part" &gt; ''*parts'' &gt; ''pars''

=====Final syllables=====
In final syllables of polysyllabic words before a final consonant or cluster, short ''a, e, i'' merge into either ''e'' or ''i'' depending on the following consonant, and short ''o, u'' merge into ''u''.

1. Short ''a, e, i'' merge into ''i'' before a single non-nasal consonant:
*Proto-Italic ''*rededas, *rededat'' &gt; ''reddis, reddit'' "you return, he returns"
*PIE thematic 2nd/3rd sg. ''*-esi, *-eti'' &gt; PI ''*-es, *-et'' &gt; ''-is, -it'' (e.g. ''legis, legit'' "you gather, he gathers")
*i-stem nom. sg. ''*-is'' &gt; ''-is''

2. Short ''a, e, i'' merge into ''e'' before a cluster or a single nasal consonant:
*''*prīsmo-kaps'' &gt; ''prīnceps'' "first, chief" (cf. ''capiō'' "to take")
*''*kornu-kan-(?s)'' &gt; ''cornicen'' "trumpeter" (cf. ''canō'' "to sing")
*''*mīlets'' &gt; ''mīles'' "soldier"
*''*in-art-is'' &gt; ''iners'' "unskilled" (cf. ''ars'' "skill")
*''*septḿ̥'' &gt; ''septem'' "seven"
*i-stem acc. sg. ''*-im'' &gt; ''-em''

3. Short ''o, u'' merge into ''u'':
*o-stem nominative ''*-os'' &gt; Old Latin ''-os'' &gt; ''-us''
*o-stem accusative ''*-om'' &gt; Old Latin ''-om'' &gt; ''-um''
*PIE thematic 3rd pl. ''*-onti'' &gt; ''*-ont'' &gt; ''-unt''
*PIE ''*yekʷr̥'' &gt; ''*jekʷor'' &gt; ''iecur'' "liver"
*PIE thematic 3rd sg. [[mediopassive]] ''*-etor'' &gt; ''-itur''
*''*kaput'' &gt; ''caput'' "head"

4. All short vowels apparently merge into ''-e'' in absolute final position.{{dubious|date=March 2014}}
*PIE ''*móri'' &gt; PI ''*mari'' &gt; ''mare'' "sea" (cf. plural ''maria'')
*Proto-Italic ''*kʷenkʷe'' &gt; ''quīnque'' "five"
*2nd sg. passive ''-ezo'', ''-āzo'' &gt; ''-ere'', ''-āre''
*PI s-stem verbal nouns in ''*-zi'' &gt; infinitives in ''-re''
*'''But:''' u-stem neuter nom./acc. sg. ''*-u'' &gt; ''-ū'', apparently by analogy with gen. sg. ''-ūs'', dat./abl. sg. ''-ū'' (it is not known if this change occurred already in Proto-Italic)

Long vowels in final syllables shorten before most consonants (but not final ''s''), yielding apparent exceptions to the above rules:
*Proto-Italic ''*amāt'' &gt; ''amat'' "he/she loves" (cf. passive ''amātur'')
*Proto-Italic ''*amānt'' &gt; ''amant'' "they love"
*a-stem acc. sg. ''*-ām'' &gt; ''-am''
*PIE thematic 1st sg. [[mediopassive]] ''*-ōr'' &gt; ''-or''
*''*swesōr'' &gt; ''soror'' "sister" (cf. gen. ''sorōris'')

Absolutely final long vowels are apparently maintained with the exception of ''ā'', which is shortened in the 1st declension nominative singular and the neuter plural ending (both &lt; PIE *''-eh₂'') but maintained in the 1st conjugation 2nd sg. imperative (&lt; PIE *''-eh₂-yé'').

====Diphthongs====

=====Initial syllables=====
Proto-Italic maintained all PIE diphthongs except for the change ''*eu'' &gt; ''*ou''.  The Proto-Italic diphthongs tend to remain into [[Old Latin]] but generally reduce to pure long vowels by Classical Latin.

1. PIE ''*ei'' &gt; Old Latin ''ei'' &gt; ''ẹ̄'', a vowel higher than ''ē'' &lt; PIE ''*ē''. This then developed to ''ī'' normally, but to ''ē'' before ''v'':
*PIE ''*deiḱ-'' "point (out)" &gt; Old Latin ''deicō'' &gt; ''dīcō'' "to say"
*PIE ''*bʰeydʰ-'' "be persuaded, be confident" &gt; *''feiðe-'' &gt; ''fīdō'' "to trust"
*PIE ''*deywós'' "god, deity" &gt; Very Old Latin ''deiuos'' ([[w:Duenos inscription|Duenos inscription]]) &gt; ''dẹ̄vos'' &gt; ''deus''
* But nominative plural ''*deivoi'' &gt; ''*deivei'' &gt; ''*dẹ̄vẹ̄'' &gt; ''dīvī'' &gt; ''diī''; vocative singular ''*deive'' &gt; ''*dẹ̄ve'' &gt; ''dīve''

2. PIE ''*eu, *ou'' &gt; Proto-Italic ''*ou'' &gt; Old Latin ''ou'' &gt; ''ọ̄'' (higher than ''ō'' &lt; PIE ''*ō'') &gt; ''ū'':
*PIE ''*(H)yeug-'' "join" &gt; *''youg-s-mn̥-to-'' &gt; Old Latin ''iouxmentom'' "pack horse" &gt; ''iūmentum''
*PIE ''*louk-s-neh₂'' &gt; ''*louksnā'' &gt; Old Latin ''losna'' (i.e. ''lọ̄sna'') &gt; ''lūna'' "moon" (cf. Old Prussian ''lauxnos'' "stars", [[Avestan]] ''raoχšnā'' "lantern")
*PIE *''deuk-'' &gt; *''douk-e-'' &gt; Old Latin ''doucō'' &gt; ''dūcō'' "lead"

3. PIE ''*ai'', *''Hei'' &gt; ''ae'':
*PIE *''kh₂ei-ko-'' &gt; ''*kaiko-'' &gt; ''caecus'' "blind" (cf. [[Old Irish]] ''cáech'' {{IPA|/kaiχ/}} "blind", Gothic ''háihs'' "one-eyed", Sanskrit ''kekara-'' "squinting")

4. PIE ''*au'' &gt; ''au'':
*PIE ''*h₂eug-'' &gt; *''augeje/o'' &gt; ''augeō'' "to increase" (cf. Greek ''aúksō'', Gothic ''áukan'', Lithuanian ''áugti'')

5. PIE ''*oi'' &gt; Old Latin ''oi, oe'' &gt; ''ū'' (occasionally preserved as ''oe''):
*PIE *''h₁oi-nos'' &gt; Old Latin ''oinos'' &gt; ''oenus'' &gt; ''ūnus'' "one"
*Greek ''Phoiniks'' &gt; ''Pūnicus'' "[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]"
*But: PIE ''*bʰoidʰ-'' &gt; *''foiðo-'' &gt; ''foedus'' "treaty" (cf. ''fīdō'' above)

=====Medial syllables=====
All diphthongs in medial syllables become ''ī'' or ''ū''.

1. (Post-)PIE ''*ei'' &gt; ''ī'', just as in initial syllables:
*''*en-deik-ō'' &gt; ''indīcō'' "to point out" (cf. ''dīcō'' "to say")

2. (Post-)PIE ''*oi'' &gt; ''ū'', just as in initial syllables:
*PIE ''*n̥-poini'' "with impunity" &gt; ''impūne'' (cf. ''poena'' "punishment").

3. (Post-)PIE ''*eu, *ou'' &gt; Proto-Italic ''*ou'' &gt; ''ū'', just as in initial syllables:
*''*en-deuk-ō'' &gt; ''*indoucō'' &gt; ''indūcō'' "to draw over, cover" (cf. ''dūcō'' "to lead")

4. Post-PIE ''*ai'' &gt; Old Latin ''ei'' &gt; ''ī'':
*''*ke-kaid-ai'' "I cut", perf. &gt; ''cecīdī'' (cf. ''caedō'' "I cut", pres.)
*''*en-kaid-ō'' "cut into" &gt; ''incīdō'' (cf. ''caedō'' "cut")
*Early Greek (or from an earlier source) ''*elaíwā'' "olive" &gt; ''olīva''

5. Post-PIE ''*au'' &gt; ''ū'' (rarely ''oe''):
*''*en-klaud-ō'' "enclose" &gt; ''inclūdō'' (cf. ''claudō'' "close")
*''*ad-kauss-ō'' "accuse" &gt; ''accūsō'' (cf. ''causa'' "cause")
*''*ob-aud-iō'' "obey" &gt; ''oboediō'' (cf. ''audiō'' "hear")

=====Final syllables=====
Mostly like medial syllables:
*''*-ei'' &gt; ''ī'': PIE ''*meh₂tr-ei'' "to mother" &gt; ''mātrī''
*''*-ai'' &gt; ''ī'' in multisyllabic words: Latin-Faliscan ''peparai'' "I brought forth" &gt; ''peperī''
*''*-eu/ou-'' &gt; ''ū'': post-PIE ''manous'' "hand", gen. sg. &gt; ''manūs''

Different from medial syllables:
*''-oi'' &gt; Old Latin ''-ei'' &gt; ''ī'' (not ''ū''): PIE o-stem plural ''*-oi'' &gt; ''-ī'' (cf. Greek ''-oi'');
*''-oi'' &gt; ''ī'' also in monosyllables: PIE ''kʷoi'' "who" &gt; ''quī''
*''-ai'' &gt; ''ae'' in monosyllables: PIE ''*prh₂ei'' "before" &gt; ''prae'' (cf. Greek ''paraí'')

====Syllabic resonants and laryngeals====
The PIE syllabic resonants ''*m̥, *n̥, *r̥, *l̥'' generally become ''em, en, or, ol'' (cf. Greek ''am/a, an/a, ar/ra, al/la''; Germanic ''um, un, ur, ul''; Sanskrit ''am/a, an/a, r̥, r̥''; [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''im̃, iñ, ir̃, il̃''):
*PIE ''*déḱm̥(t)'' "ten" &gt; ''decem'' (cf. Irish ''deich'', Greek ''deka'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''taíhun'' {{IPA|/tɛhun/}})
*PIE ''*(d)ḱm̥tóm'' "hundred" &gt; ''centum'' (cf. Welsh ''cant'', Gothic ''hund'', Lithuanian ''šim̃tas'')
*PIE ''*n̥-'' "not" &gt; OL ''en-'' &gt; ''in-'' (cf. Greek ''a-/an-'', English ''un-'')
*PIE ''*tn̥tós'' "stretched" &gt; ''tentus'' (cf. Greek ''tatós'', Sanskrit ''tatá-'')
*PIE ''*ḱr̥d-'' "heart" &gt; ''*cord'' &gt; ''cor'' (cf. Greek ''kēr'', English ''heart'', Lithuanian ''širdìs'')
*PIE ''*ml̥dús'' "soft" &gt; ''*moldus'' &gt; ''*moldwis'' (remade as ''i''-stem) &gt; ''*molwis'' &gt; ''mollis'' (cf. Irish ''meldach'' "pleasing", English ''mild'', Czech ''mladý'')

The laryngeals ''*h₁, *h₂, *h₃'' appear in Latin as ''a'' when between consonants, as in most languages (but [[Greek language|Greek]] ''e/a/o'' respectively, Sanskrit ''i''):
*PIE ''*dʰh₁-tós'' "put" &gt; L ''factus'', with /k/ of disputed etymology (cf. Greek ''thetós'', Sanskrit ''hitá-'' &lt; ''*dhitá-'')
*PIE ''*ph₂tḗr'' "father" &gt; L ''pater'' (cf. Greek ''patḗr'', Sanskrit ''pitā́'', English ''father'')
*PIE ''*dh₃-tós'' "given" &gt; L ''datus'' (cf. Greek ''dotós'', Sanskrit ''ditá-'')

A sequence of syllabic resonant + laryngeal, when before a consonant, produced ''mā, nā, rā, lā'' (as also in Celtic, cf. Greek ''nē/nā/nō, rē/rā/rō'', etc. depending on the laryngeal; Germanic ''um, un, ur, ul''; Sanskrit ''ā, ā, īr/ūr, īr/ūr''; Lithuanian ''ím, ín, ír, íl''):
* PIE ''{{PIE|*ǵr̥h₂-nom}}'' "grain" &gt; ''grānum'' (cf. Old Irish ''grán'', English ''corn'', Lithuanian ''žìrnis'' "pea")
* PIE ''{{PIE|*h₂wl̥h₁-neh₂}}'' "wool" &gt; ''*wlānā'' &gt; ''lāna'' (cf. Welsh ''gwlân'', Gothic ''wulla'', Greek ''lēnos'', Lithuanian ''vìlna'')
* PIE ''{{PIE|*ǵn̥h₁-tos}}'' "born" &gt; ''gnātus'' "son", ''nātus'' "born" (participle) (cf. Middle Welsh ''gnawt'' "relative", Greek ''dió-gnētos'' "Zeus' offspring", English ''kind'')

===Consonants===

====Aspirates====
The Indo-European voiced aspirates ''bʰ, dʰ, gʰ, gʷʰ'', which were probably breathy voiced stops, first devoiced in initial position ([[fortition]]), then fricatized in all positions, producing pairs of voiceless/voiced [[fricative]]s in [[Proto-Italic]]:  ''f'' ~ ''β'', ''{{IPA|θ}}'' ~ ''ð'', ''{{IPA|χ}}'' ~ ''{{IPA|ɣ}}'', ''{{IPA|χʷ}}'' ~ ''{{IPA|ɣʷ}}'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;James Clackson &amp; Geoffrey Horrocks, ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The fricatives were voiceless in initial position. However, between vowels and other voiced sounds, there are indications — in particular, their evolution in Latin — that the sounds were actually [[voiced consonant|voiced]]. Likewise, Proto-Italic /s/ apparently had a voiced allophone [z] in the same position.

In all Italic languages, the word-initial voiceless fricatives ''f'', ''θ'', and ''χʷ'' all merged to ''f''; thus, in Latin, the normal outcome of initial PIE ''bʰ, dʰ, gʰ, gʷʰ'' is ''f, f, h, f'', respectively. Examples:
*PIE ''*bʰréh₂tēr'' "brother" &gt; ''*bʰrā́tēr'' &gt; ''frāter'' (cf. Old Irish ''bráthair'', Sanskrit ''bhrā́tar-'', Greek ''phrā́tēr'' "member of a phratry")
*PIE ''*bʰére'' "carry" &gt; ''ferō'' (cf. Old Irish ''beirim'' "I bear", English ''bear'', Sanskrit ''bhárati'')
*PIE ''*dʰwṓr'' "door" &gt; ''θwor-'' &gt; *''forā'' &gt; ''forēs'' (pl.) "door(s)" (cf. Welsh ''dôr'', Greek ''thurā'', Sanskrit ''dhvā́raḥ'' (pl.))
*PIE ''*dʰeh₁-'' "put, place" &gt; *''dʰh₁-k-'' &gt; *''θaki-'' &gt; ''faciō'' "do, make" (cf. Welsh ''dodi'', English ''do'', Greek ''títhēmi'' "I put", Sanskrit ''dádhāti'' he puts")
*PIE ''*gʰabʰ-'' "seize, take" &gt; *''χaβ-ē''- &gt; ''habeō'' "have" (cf. Old Irish ''gaibid'' "takes", Old English ''gifan'' "to give", Polish ''gabać'' "to seize")
*PIE ''*ǵʰh₂ens'' "goose" &gt; *''χans-'' &gt; ''(h)ānser'' (cf. Old Irish ''géiss'' "swan", German ''Gans'', Greek ''khḗn'')
*PIE ''*ǵʰaidos'' "goat" &gt; *''χaidos'' &gt; ''haedus'' "kid" (cf. Old English ''gāt'' "goat", Polish ''zając'' "hare", Sanskrit ''háyas'' "horse")
*PIE ''*gʷʰerm-'' "warm" &gt; *''χʷormo-'' &gt; ''formus'' (cf. Old Prussian ''gorme'' "heat", Greek ''thermós'', Sanskrit ''gharmáḥ'' "heat")
*PIE ''*gʷʰen-dʰ-'' "to strike, kill" &gt; *''χʷ(e)nð-'' &gt; ''fendō'' (cf. Welsh ''gwanu'' "to stab", Old High German ''gundo'' "battle", Sanskrit ''hánti'' "(he) strikes, kills")

Word-internal ''*-bʰ-, *-dʰ-, *-gʰ-, *-gʷʰ-'' evolved into Proto-Italic ''β'', ''ð'', ''ɣ'', ''ɣʷ''. In Osco-Umbrian, the same type of merger occurred as that affecting voiceless fricatives, with ''β'', ''ð'', and ''ɣʷ'' merging to ''β''. In Latin, this did not happen, and instead the fricatives defricatized, giving ''b, d ~ b, g ~ h, g ~ v ~ gu''.

''*-bʰ-'' is the simplest case, consistently becoming ''b''.
*PIE ''*bʰébʰrus'' "beaver" &gt; *''feβro'' &gt; Old Latin ''feber'' &gt; ''fiber''

''*-dʰ-'' usually becomes ''d'', but becomes ''b'' next to ''r'' or ''u'', or before ''l''.
*PIE ''*bʰeidʰ-'' "be persuaded" &gt; *''feiðe'' &gt; ''fīdō'' "I trust" (cf. Old English ''bīdan'' "to wait", Greek ''peíthō'' "I trust")
*PIE ''*medʰi-o-'' "middle" &gt; *''meðio-'' &gt; ''medius'' (cf. Old Irish ''mide'', Gothic ''midjis'', Sanskrit ''mádhya-'')
*PIE *''h₁rudʰ-ró-'' "red" &gt; ''*ruðro-'' &gt; ''ruber'' (cf. Old Russian ''rodrŭ'', Greek ''eruthrós'', Sanskrit ''rudhirá-'')
*PIE ''*werh₁-dʰh₁-o-'' "word" &gt; *''werðo-'' &gt; ''verbum'' (cf. English ''word'', Lithuanian ''var̃das'')
*PIE ''*sth̥₂-dʰlom'' &gt; ''*staðlom'' &gt; ''stabulum'' "abode" (cf. German ''Stadel'')
*PIE ''*krei(H)-dʰrom'' "sieve, sifter" &gt; *''kreiðrom'' &gt; ''crībrum'' "sieve" (cf. Old Irish ''críathar'' {{IPA|/krīə̯θəρ/}} "sieve", Old English ''hrīder'' "sieve")

The development of ''*-gʰ-'' is twofold:  ''*-gʰ-'' becomes ''h'' [ɦ] between vowels but ''g'' elsewhere:
*PIE ''*weǵʰ-'' "carry" &gt; *''weɣ-e/o'' &gt; ''vehō'' (cf. Greek ''okhéomai'' "I ride", Old English ''wegan'' "to carry", Sanskrit ''váhati'' "(he) drives")
*PIE ''*dʰi-n-ǵʰ-'' "shapes, forms" &gt; *''θinɣ-e/o'' &gt; ''fingō'' (cf. Old Irish ''-ding'' "erects, builds", Gothic ''digan'' "to mold, shape")

''*-gʷʰ-'' has three outcomes, becoming ''gu'' after ''n'', ''v'' between vowels, and ''g'' next to other consonants.  All three variants are visible in the same root ''*snigʷʰ-'' "snow" (cf. Irish ''snigid'' "snows", Greek ''nípha''):
*PIE ''*snigʷʰ-s'' &gt; *''sniɣʷs'' &gt; *''nigs'' &gt; nom. sg. ''nix'' "snow"
*PIE ''*snigʷʰ-ós'' &gt; *''sniɣʷos'' &gt; *''niβis'' &gt; gen. sg. ''nivis'' "of snow"
*PIE ''*snei-gʷʰ-e/o'' &gt; *''sninɣʷ-e/o'' (with ''n''-infix) &gt; ''ninguit'' "it snows"
Other examples:
*PIE ''*h₁le(n)gʷʰu-'' &gt; ''*h₁legʷʰu-'' &gt; *''leɣʷus'' &gt; *''leβwi-'' (remade as ''i''-stem) &gt; ''levis'' "lightweight" (cf. Welsh ''llaw'' "small, low",  Greek ''elakhús'' "small", Sanskrit ''laghú-'', ''raghú-'' "quick, light, small")

====Labiovelars====
''*gʷ'' has results much like non-initial ''*-gʷʰ'', becoming ''v'' /w/ in most circumstances, but ''gu'' after a nasal and ''g'' next to other consonants:
*PIE *''gʷih₃wos'' &gt; ''*ɣʷīwos'' &gt; ''vīvus'' "alive" (cf. Old Irish ''biu'', ''beo'', Lithuanian ''gývas'', Sanskrit ''jīvá- "alive")
*PIE ''*gʷm̥i̯e/o-'' "come" &gt; *''ɣʷen-je/o'' &gt; ''veniō'' (cf. English ''come'', Greek ''baínō'' "I go", Avestan ''ǰamaiti'' "he goes")
*PIE ''*gʷr̥h₂us'' "heavy" &gt; ''*ɣʷraus'' &gt; ''grāvis'' (cf. Greek ''barús'', Gothic ''kaúrus'', Sanskrit ''gurú-'')
*PIE ''*h₃engʷ-'' &gt; ''*onɣʷ-en'' &gt; ''unguen'' "salve" (cf. Old Irish ''imb'' "butter", [[Old High German]] ''ancho'' "butter", Sanskrit ''añjanam'' "anointing, ointment")
*PIE ''*n̥gʷén-'' "(swollen) gland" &gt; ''*enɣʷen'' &gt; ''inguen'' "bubo; groin" (cf. Greek ''adḗn'' gen. ''adénos'' "gland", Old High German ''ankweiz'' "pustules")

''*kʷ'' remains as ''qu'' before a vowel, but reduces to ''c'' /k/ before a consonant or next to a ''u'':
*PIE ''*kʷetwóres'', neut. ''*kʷetwṓr'' "four" &gt; ''quattuor'' (cf. Old Irish ''cethair'', Lithuanian ''keturì'', Sanskrit ''catvā́raḥ'')
*PIE ''*sekʷ-'' "to follow" &gt; ''sequor'' (cf. Old Irish ''sechem'', Greek ''hépomai'', Sanskrit ''sácate'')
*PIE ''*leikʷ-'' (pres. *''li-né-kʷ-'') "leave behind" &gt; ''*linkʷ-e/o-'' : ''*likʷ-ē-'' &gt; ''linquō'' "leaves" : ''liceō'' "is allowed; is for sale" (cf. Greek ''leípō, limpánō'', Sanskrit ''riṇákti'', Gothic ''leiƕan'' "to lend")
*PIE ''*nokʷts'' "night" &gt; ''nox'', gen. sg. ''noctis''

The sequence ''*p ... *kʷ'' assimilates to ''*kʷ ... *kʷ'':
*PIE ''*pénkʷe'' "five" &gt; ''quīnque'' (cf. Old Irish ''cóic'', Greek ''pénte'', Sanskrit ''páñca'')
*PIE ''*pérkʷus'' "oak" &gt; ''quercus'' (cf. [[Trentino]] ''porca'' "fir", Punjabi ''pargāī'' "holm oak", Gothic ''faírƕus'' "world", ''faírgun-'' "mountain"&lt;ref&gt;Both "world" and "mountain" evolve out of the early association of oak trees with strength, cf. Latin ''robur'' = "oak" but also "strength"&lt;/ref&gt;)
*PIE ''*pekʷō'' "I cook" &gt; ''*kʷekʷō'' &gt; ''coquō'' (cf. ''coquīna, cocīnā'' "kitchen" vs. ''popīna'' "tavern" &lt; Oscan, where ''*kʷ'' &gt; ''p'', Polish ''piekę'' "I bake")

The sequences ''*ḱw, *ǵw, *ǵʰw'' develop identically to ''*kʷ, *gʷ, *gʷʰ'':
*PIE ''*éḱwos'' "horse" &gt; ''*ekʷos'' &gt; Old Latin ''equos'' &gt; ''ecus'' &gt; ''equus'' (assimilated from other forms, e.g. gen. sg. ''equī''; cf. Sanskrit ''aśva-'', which indicates ''-ḱw-'' not ''-kʷ-'')
*PIE ''*ǵʰweh₁ro-'' "wild animal" &gt; *''χʷero-'' &gt; ''ferus'' (cf. Greek ''thḗr'', [[Lesbian Greek|Lesbian]] ''phḗr'', Lithuanian ''žvėrìs'')
*PIE ''*mreǵʰus'' "short" &gt; ''*mreɣu-'' &gt; ''*mreɣwi-'' (remade as ''i''-stem) &gt; ''brevis'' (cf. Old English ''myrge'' "briefly",  Greek ''brakhús'', [[Avestan]] ''mǝrǝzu-'')
*PIE ''*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂''&lt;ref&gt;PIE ''*dn̥ǵhwéh₂''; ''-ǵʰw-'' not ''-gʷʰ-'' indicated by [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''języ-kŭ'' "tongue" &lt; ''*n̥ǵhu-H-k-'' with loss of initial ''*d-''; ''-gʷh-'' would yield /g/, not /z/.&lt;/ref&gt; "tongue" &gt; ''*dn̥ɣwā'' &gt; ''*denɣʷā'' &gt; Old Latin ''dingua'' &gt; ''lingua''

====Other sequences====
Initial ''*dw-'' (attested in Old Latin as ''du-'') becomes ''b-'', thus compensating for the dearth of words beginning with ''*b'' in PIE:
*PIE ''*dwis'' "twice" &gt; ''duis'' &gt; ''bis'' (cf. Greek ''dís'', Sanskrit ''dvis'')
*PIE ''*deu-l̥-'' "injure" &gt; ''duellom'' "war" &gt; ''bellum'' (a variant ''duellum'' survived in poetry as a trisyllabic word, whence English "duel")

====S-rhotacism====
Indo-European ''s'' between vowels was first voiced to [z] in late [[Proto-Italic]] and became ''r'' in Latin and [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]], a change known as [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]. Early Old Latin documents still have ''s'' [z], and [[Cicero]] once remarked that a certain Papirius Crassus officially changed his name from Papisius in 339 {{smallcaps|b}}.{{smallcaps|c}}.,&lt;ref&gt;Fortson, Benjamin W., ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the approximate time of this change. This produces many alternations in Latin declension:
*''flōs'' "flower", gen. ''flōris''
*''mūs'' "mouse", pl. ''mūrēs''
*''est'' "he is", fut. ''erit'' "he will be"
Other examples:
* Proto-Italic ''*ausōs'', ''ausōsem'' &gt; ''*auzōs'', ''auzōzem'' &gt; ''aurōra'' "dawn" (change of suffix; cf. English ''east'', [[Aeolic Greek]] ''aúōs'', Sanskrit ''uṣā́s'')
* Proto-Italic ''*swesōr'' &gt; ''*swozōr'' &gt; ''soror'' "sister" (cf. [[Old English]] ''sweostor'', Sanskrit ''svásar'')
* Proto-Italic ''*a(j)os'', ''a(j)esem'' &gt; ''*aes'', ''aezem'' &gt; ''aes'', ''aerem'' "bronze", but PI ''*a(j)es-inos'' &gt; ''*aeznos'' &gt; ''aēnus'' "bronze (adj.)"
However, before another ''r'', [[dissimilation]] occurred with ''sr'' [zr] becoming ''br'' (likely via an intermediate ''*ðr''):
* Proto-Italic ''*swesr-īnos'' &gt; ''*swezrīnos'' ~ ''*sweðrīnos'' &gt; ''sobrīnus'' "maternal cousin"
* Proto-Italic ''*keras-rom'' &gt; ''*kerazrom'' ~ ''*keraðrom'' &gt; ''cerebrum'' "skull, brain" (cf. Greek ''kéras'' "horn")

'''Hit-and-run DDoS''' is a type of [[Denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service (DDoS) attack]] that uses short bursts of high volume attacks in random intervals, spanning a time frame of days or weeks. The purpose of a hit-and-run DDoS is to prevent a user of a service from using that service by bringing down the host [[Server (computing)|server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =EC-Council | first = | authorlink = | title =Computer Forensics: Investigating Network Intrusions and Cyber Crime | publisher =Cengage Learning | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2009 | location = | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =9781435483521 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of attack is to be distinguished from a persistent DDoS attack which continues until the attacker stops the attack or the host server is able to defend against it.&lt;ref name="CyberAttackBook"&gt;{{cite book | last =Wiles | first =Jack | authorlink = | title =The Best Damn Cybercrime and Digital Forensics Book Period | publisher =Syngress | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2011 | location = | pages =559 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=hI3dqOyboegC&amp;pg=PA559&amp;lpg=PA559&amp;dq=hit+and+run+ddos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIttkZTKqH&amp;sig=BbXXhJWk1zQKSR0Gm7451ELy5Vw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nBDoUsvXLIyiqQHM9YD4Aw&amp;ved=0CIQBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=hit%20and%20run%20ddos&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn =9780080556086 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Method of attack==

A DDoS attack is characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Richmond | first =Riva | coauthors = | title =What ‘DDoS’ Attacks Are and How to Survive Them | newspaper =Entrepreneur | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224099 | accessdate =28 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A hit-and-run DDoS is accomplished by using high volume network or application attacks in short bursts. The attacks only last long enough to bring down the server hosting the service, normally 20 to 60 minutes. The attack is then repeated every 12 to 24 hours over a period of days or weeks, causing issues for the company hosting the service. 

Hit-and-run DDoS is sometimes used as a test DDoS attack. An attacker will inject a few bad [[Network packet|packets]] into a network to test if it is online and functioning. Once the network is verified as functioning, an attacker will then use a persistent DDoS attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =EC-Council | first = | authorlink = | title =Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures: Linux, Macintosh and Mobile Systems | publisher =Cengage Learning | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2009 | location = | pages = | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=LYFoU2HG_AkC&amp;pg=SA3-PA11&amp;lpg=SA3-PA11&amp;dq=hit+and+run+ddos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QX62CViyLW&amp;sig=dCjJAJwKHfsOaQkHEzmTGFyKm7M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hx7oUuvKKIf3rAGq6IGgDg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=hit%20and%20run%20ddos&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn =9781435483644| mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hit-and-run DDoS exploits anti-DDoS software and services which are used to defend against prolonged DDoS attacks. Activating such software can take longer than the actual attack, allowing a denial of service before DDoS protection can start to defend from the attack.

The '''Instituto Hondureño de Antropología e Historia''' ('''IHAH''', ''Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History'') is a government institution in the republic of [[Honduras]].

It formed on July 22, 1952 by Decree No. 24 originally under the name of National Institute of Anthropology and History under the government of Dr. [[Juan Manuel Gálvez]].

In 1968, Decree No. 118, changed its name to the ''Instituto Hondureño de Antropología e Historia '', which changed its administrative autonomy, legal personality and own patrimony.

The IHAH has a website, where their publications are available daily.

The Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History has the following departments:

*Department of Anthropological Research (DIA)
*Department of Historical Research
*Department of Museums
*Restoration Department
*Department of Protection of Cultural Heritage

'''Iraj Afshar''' (8 October 1925 &amp;ndash; 9 March 2011) ({{lang-fa|ایرج افشار}}) was a bibliographer, historian, and an iconic figure in the field of [[Persian studies]]. He was a consulting editor of ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' at [[Columbia University]] and a full professor emeritus of [[University of Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ehsan Yarshater|Yarshater, Ehsan]]. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iraj_afshar_memorial "Iraj Afshar (1925-2011)"]. ''Encyclopædia Iranica''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iraj Afshar recorded the monuments of [[Yazd]] in his three-volume "yādegār-hāye Yazd (Monuments of Yazd)". [http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/01/06/bam_ed3_.php] He was known as "the doyen of standard Persian language bibliographers". Afshar played a significant role in the development of the field of Iranology in Iran and throughout the world during the second half of the 20th century. 
He was the editor of ''Sokhan'', a prolific Iranology journal, under the responsibility of [[Parviz Natel-Khanlari]] and also the editor of ''rāhnamāye ketāb'' (Bibliography Guide), ''Mehr'', ''farhang-e Iranzamin'' (Culture of Iran) and ''[[Ayandeh (journal)|Ayandeh]]''.

He was the chief bibliographer of Persian books at [[Harvard University]]. Afshar was associated with [[UNESCO]] and taught at the  [[University of Bern]] and [[University of Tehran]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6441">'''Johanna Wilhelmina Antoinette Naber''' (March 25, 1859 – May 30, 1941) was a Dutch feminist, historian and author during the [[first-wave feminism|first feminist wave]]. She was one of the three founders of the [[International Archives for the Women's Movement]] (1935), now known as [[Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history]], and was herself a prolific author of historical texts about influential women and the women’s movement.

}}

==Biography==
Naber was born in [[Haarlem]] to an affluent and intellectual Dutch family. She was the second child and first daughter of rector and (future) professor of philology and classical languages Samuel Adrianus Naber (1828–1913) and his wife Anna Elizabeth L’Honoré (1830–1915). Two of her brothers went on to become professors. The Naber family moved from [[Zwolle]] (where they had moved to in 1864) to [[Amsterdam]] in 1870. In 1876, Johanna Naber received her [[Hogere Burgerschool|HBS]] diploma after which she continued studying to acquire several teaching certificates.  Despite his daughter’s ambitions, Samuel Naber did not allow her to study at university. Naber remained unmarried and was therefore expected to stay at home and care for her elderly parents and, later, her unmarried brothers. Naber lived on her own for the first time at age 77. Naber’s first book, pertaining to artistic needlework, was published under the pseudonym of Rechlindis in 1887.&lt;ref name="Atria"&gt;“Johanna Naber.” [https://www.atria.nl/search/collection/bio/show/3502?lang=en ''Atria''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Haan"&gt;De Haan, Francisca. “A ‘Truly International’ Archive for the Women’s Movement (IAV, now IIAV): From its Foundation in Amsterdam in 1935 to the Return of its Looted Archives in 2003.” ''Journal of Women’s History'', vol. 16, no. 4, 2004, 149-72. Available at [https://www.atria.nl/earticles/2004/TrulyInternational.pdf ''Atria''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement with the women’s movement==
Naber’s involvement with the Dutch women’s movement started in 1896 when she signed up to contribute to the organisation of the National Exhibition on Women’s Work. During the exhibition, which took place in 1898, she served as editor and writer for its official magazine ''Vrouwenarbeid'' (‘Women’s Work’). Naber went on to become board member and press officer of the ''Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht'' (the Dutch Organisation for Women’s Suffrage). She was one of six Dutch women who were present at the inaugural meeting of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA) in Berlin in 1904. She briefly serves as the IWSA’s Second Assistant Secretary, but was forced to resign due to her commitments as historian and author.&lt;ref name="De Haan"/&gt; She was involved in the organisation of a second exhibition on women’s contributions to society in 1913 and consequently met several times with Dutch queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]] who eventually knighted her in the [[Order of Oranje-Nassau]].
She was president of the [[Dutch Women's Council]] between 1917 and 1922. In her capacity as president, she was also involved with the [[International Council of Women]]. In the 1930s, she participated in the (eventually) successful opposition of a bill that proposed to ban married women from working (something she had also successfully opposed in 1910).&lt;ref name="Atria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grever"&gt;Grever, Maria. “Naber, Johanna Wilhelmina Antoinette.” [http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/Naber ''Digitaal Vrouwelexicon van Nederland''], 16 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian and author==
Naber was a self-taught historian. During the 1890s, she started publishing on important female historical figures. During her lifetime she published many biographies of noteworthy women as well as works on the early Dutch women’s movement in the 19th century. Some notable works include her 1909 ''Wegbereidsters'' ('Pioneers') about various women who had paved the way for the women’s movement and ''Frederika Bremer (1901-1865). Naar hare brieven'' (1921) a biography of Swedish feminist and author [[Frederika Bremer]] based on her letters. She furthermore braved an attempt at an overview of the Dutch Women's Movement (entitled ''Eerste Proeve van een Chronologisch Overzicht van de Geschiedenis der Vrouwenbeweging in Nederland''). This text later functioned as an important reference work for fellow IAV-founder Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot’s seminal overview of the Dutch women’s movement since the 19th century ''Van Moeder op Dochter'' (‘Mother to Daughter’).&lt;ref name="Atria"/&gt;
In 1914, Naber established ''De Nederlandsche Vrouwengids'' (‘The Dutch Women’s Guide’) to address women’s issues and concerns. The ''Guide'' ran until 1919. In 1918, she became the first female board member of the prestigious [[Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde]] or Society of Dutch Literature.

In 1935 she collaborated with Dutch feminists [[Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot]] and [[Rosa Manus]] to establish the [[International Archives for the Women's Movement]] (IAV), now known as [[Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history]].

==Politics and later life==
Unlike many of her contemporaries in the women’s movement, Naber was a staunch opposer of pacifism and was involved in several organisations that plead for a strong army in the early 1920s. She was a member of the [[Liberal State Party]] and her perspective on gender equality was adopted as part of the party’s programme.&lt;ref name="Grever"/&gt;

Naber died at age 82 on May 30, 1941 in the Hague.

'''Joice "Teurai-Ropa" Mujuru''' (born '''Runaida Mugari'''; 15 April 1955) is a Zimbabwean politician who served as [[Vice-President of Zimbabwe]] from 2004 to 2014. Previously she had served as a government minister. She also served as Vice-President of [[ZANU-PF]]. She was married to [[Solomon Mujuru]] until his death in 2011 and was long considered a potential successor to President [[Robert Mugabe]], but in 2014 she was denounced for allegedly plotting against Mugabe. As a result of the accusations against her, Mujuru lost both her post as Vice-President and her position in the party leadership. She was expelled from the party a few months later, after which she formed the new Zimbabwe People First party.

==Early life==
Mujuru was born in Zimbabwe's Northeastern district of [[Mount Darwin, Zimbabwe|Mt. Darwin]], a [[Shona people|Shona]] from the [[Korekore]] language group . As a Shona (a conglomeration of various tribes with a common sounding Bantu language) she is of the same language group as Vice-President [[Joseph Msika]] and President Robert Mugabe as well as political rivals [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] and [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]]. However, they come from different dialect groups with Mugabe being Zezuru and Mnangagwa being Karanga. Tsvangirai is a Manyika from [[Buhera District]] in [[Manicaland]].

At eighteen years old, Mujuru was the only woman who trained in [[Lusaka]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pennington|first=Reina|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots: a Biographical Dictionary of Military Women|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0313327076|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing two years of secondary education, she decided to join the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. She is said to have downed a helicopter with a machine gun on 17 February 1974 after refusing to flee.The helicopter downing incident has been vehemently denied by War Veterans chairman, the acid tongued [[Christopher Mutsvangwa]] after her (Mujuru) expulsion from the party, other ballistic experts have also questioned the possibility of shooting down a helicopter with such a light weapon as narrated on her story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=VP Mujuru stole my picture: War veteran |newspaper=The Herald |location=Harare, Zimbabwe |url=http://www.herald.co.zw/vp-mujuru-stole-my-picture-war-veteran/ |access-date=9 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1975, she was the political instructor of two successful military bases. At 21, Mujuru was camp commander at [[Chimoio]] military and refugee camp in [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

She took the [[nom de guerre|nom-de-guerre]] ''Teurai Ropa'' (spill blood),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Dictionary of Women's Biography|year=1985|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|isbn=0-8264-0192-9|page=342|chapter=Nhongo (née Mugari), Joyce (1955–)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then rose to become one of the first women commanders in Mugabe's [[ZANLA]] forces. In 1977, she married Solomon Mujuru, known then as ''Rex Nhongo'', deputy commander-in-chief of ZANLA. That same year, she became the youngest member of the Central Committee, a member of the National Executive.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Her political activity made her a target for the Rhodesian security forces, which tried to capture her but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On 23rd November 1977 the ZANLA camp at Chimoio came under attack from Rhodesian forces as part of Operation Dingo. Mujuru  avoided capture by carefully concealing herself in a well-used communal pit latrine&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Barbara The Elite: The Story of the Rhodesian Special Air Service&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1978, when her camp came under attack, Muruji—nine months pregnant at the time—was still an active combatant. She gave birth only days later.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Upon return from the war, little was known of the origins of her name and her real name. Her mother, in an interview for The Sunday Mail newspaper at her rural Mount Darwin home, spoke exclusively to journalist and media anthropologist Robert Mukondiwa, to whom she revealed that Joice was a name she had also adopted during her time away at the war. Her actual name, he was told, was Runaida, which had been her late paternal aunt's name.

The Mujurus now live on a {{convert|3500|acre|km2|adj=on}} requisitioned farm, [[Alamein Farm]], {{convert|45|mi|km}} south of Harare, which has been found by the Supreme Court in Zimbabwe to have been illegally seized from the farm owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6507993.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Profile: The Mujuru couple|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
At independence in 1980, Mujuru became the youngest cabinet minister in the cabinet, taking the portfolio of sports, youth and recreation. She fitted secondary school in between her busy schedule after she was appointed minister.

As Minister of Telecommunications, she tried to stop [[Strive Masiyiwa]] from establishing his independent cellphone network Econet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Zim government leaves out cellphone pioneer |date=24 March 1997 |newspaper=ZA*NOW (Electronic Mail and Guardian) |location=South Africa |url=http://www.chico.mweb.co.za/mg/za1/24mar-news.html#zimcell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414132818/http://www.chico.mweb.co.za/mg/za1/24mar-news.html#zimcell |archive-date=14 April 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masiyiwa had been given an ultimatum by the cabinet to sell his imported equipment to his rivals. On 24 March 1997, Mujuru decided to issue Zimbabwe's second cellular telephone licence to the previously unknown Zairois consortium Telecel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btimes.co.za/98/1018/world/world03.htm How a man called Strive beat off the corrupt cronies] Business Times&lt;/ref&gt; cutting out Masiyiwa. The Zairois consortium included her husband Solomon and President Robert Mugabe's nephew Leo. After many legal fights, Masiyiwa won his licence in December 1997.

===Vice-President===
The ZANU-PF Women's League resolved at its annual conference held in September 2004 to put forward a female candidate for the party's vice-presidency, a position left vacant following the death of [[Simon Muzenda]].

Mugabe bowed to pressure from a ZANU-PF faction led by Mujuru's husband, General Solomon Mujuru, to give a woman the second vice-presidency post—effectively sidelining Speaker of Parliament [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], widely seen as his favoured heir. This ZANU-PF reshuffle was dubbed "the night of the long knives" by the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4058369.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Mugabe moves against party rivals|date=1 December 2004|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mujuru was sworn in as Vice-President of Zimbabwe on 6 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=52333 "ZIMBABWE: Mujuru sworn in as vice president"], IRIN, 6 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mujuru was nominated as ZANU-PF's candidate for the [[House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|House of Assembly]] seat from [[Mt. Darwin West]] in the [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2008|March 2008 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200802150006.html |title=Zimbabwe: Zanu-PF Names Poll Candidates |newspaper=[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Herald]] |date=15 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219020318/http://allafrica.com/stories/200802150006.html |archive-date=19 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to official results she won the seat by an overwhelming margin, receiving 13,236 votes against 1,792 for Gora Madzudzo, the candidate of the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) faction led by [[Morgan Tsvangirai]]. This ran contrary to earlier claims from the MDC that Mujuru had lost the seat.&lt;ref&gt;Mutongi Gava, [http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/electoral204.17985.html "VP Mujuru not defeated"], newzimbabwe.com, 31 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, she was again sworn in as Vice-President by Mugabe on 13 October 2008, together with Msika.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/6514510.html "Zimbabwe President Mugabe swears in vice presidents"], Xinhua, 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the subject of personal sanctions imposed by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zwnews.com/issuefull.cfm?ArticleID=13267 US Personal Sanctions] ZWNews&lt;/ref&gt;

She currently lives on [[Alamein Farm]], a productive and high-value operation illegally requisitioned as part of the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform programme]] from Guy Watson-Smith in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-3319957-we-were-given-minutes-to-leave.do "Farm owner given minutes to leave his Farm"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805144548/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-3319957-we-were-given-minutes-to-leave.do |date=5 August 2011 }}, ''London Evening Standard'', 10 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; as found by the Zimbabwe High Court and international courts. In 2001 the Mujuru family became the subject of the first legal action against any member of Mr Mugabe's inner circle implicated in the illegal seizure of land and assets.

The seizure of Alamein Farm was ruled illegal by the [[Supreme Court of Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/1366242/Evicted-farmer-sues-for-return-of-2m-assets.html " Evicted farmer sues for return of £2m assets"], ''The Telegraph'', 24 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120914142124/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-541448-britain-must-act-on-zimbabwe.do "Britain must act on Zimbabwe"], ''London Evening Standard'', 25 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mujuru was considered a potential successor to President Mugabe, competing against Emmerson Mnangagwa. She rallied support among the [[politburo]], central committee and the [[presidium]], and the provincial party chairs. She also garnered support from the general Zimbabwean population, indicated by the election of her loyalists to the youth league. However, her succession was expected to be challenged at the December 2014 congress, where the members of all politburo and central committee cadres were expected to seek re-election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/southern-africa/zimbabwe/b103-zimbabwe-waiting-for-the-future.pdf "Zimbabwe: Waiting for the Future"], International Crisis Group, 29 September 2014. Retrieved 9 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsion and new political party===
In late 2014, Mujuru was accused of plotting against Mugabe and became an outcast within ZANU-PF. She lost her positions in the party leadership at the December 2014 congress, and shortly afterward, on 8 December 2014, Mugabe dismissed her from her post as Vice-President, along with ministers who were identified with her faction. In comments published on 9 December, the same day the dismissals were announced, Mujuru said that the claims that she had plotted against Mugabe were "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald Dzirutwe, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-zimbabwe-mujuru-idUSKBN0JN0P420141209 "Zimbabwe's Mugabe fires deputy, seven ministers"], Reuters, 9 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2014, Mugabe appointed Mujuru's long-time rival in the succession battle, [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], to replace her as Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald Dzirutwe, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/10/us-zimbabwe-politics-idUSKBN0JO1GW20141210 "Zimbabwe's Mugabe names 'The Crocodile' Mnangagwa as deputy"], Reuters, 10 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mujuru was expelled from ZANU-PF on 3 April 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32176164|title=Zimbabwe ruling party expels Mugabe rival Joyce Mujuru|date=3 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/2015/04/03/mujuru-expelled-from-zanu-pf|title=Mujuru expelled from Zanu PF|last=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently moved on to form the Zimbabwe People First party, in opposition to ZANU-PF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/11852311/Robert-Mugabes-new-opponent-his-daughter-Joice-Mujuru.html "Robert Mugabe's new opponent: his 'daughter' Joice Mujuru"], ''The Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 after expelling seven senior members of the ''Zimbabwe People First'' party, she changed its name to ''National People's Party'' when the expelled members challenged ownership of the Zimbabwe People First name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herald.co.zw/latest-mujuru-changes-party-name-to-national-peoples-party/ "Mujuru change her faction's party name to National People's Party"], ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Joice Mujuru has recently signed an alliance with 20 smaller parties. This is believed to be a counter to Tsvangirai's MDC alliance that is to give her a large bargaining power on the coalition table. THE Tendai Biti-led People's Democratic Party (PDP), Dumiso Dabengwa's Zapu and the National People's Party (NPP) led by former Vice-President Joice Mujuru unveiled a coalition pact to challenge Zanu PF in Matabeleland in the 2018 elections.The Zapu, NPP and PDP leadership said they would not contest each other for any parliamentary seats in Matabeleland, before noting that "doors were still open" for a broader coalition with other opposition parties, raising fears that the MDC Alliance, which was announced recently, could have hit turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;Nqbani Ndlovu and Sharon Sibindi,  [https://www.newsday.co.zw/2017/09/mujuru-biti-dabengwa-form-coalition/ "Mujuru, Biti, Dabengwa form own coalition"], ''Newsday'', 23 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is part of the 23 candicates running for the Presidency &lt;ref&gt;https://m.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/mujuru-promises-to-leave-no-stone-unturned-in-finding-missing-mugabe-critic-20180405 | Mujuru promises to leave no stone unturned in finding missing Mugabe critic | News24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zimbabwe "illegal gold sale bid"==

Joice Mujuru was implicated in a 2009 attempted sale of up to 3.5 tonnes of gold from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to a European company, in contravention of European Union sanctions on the part of that company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7907177.stm|title=Zimbabwe 'illegal gold sale bid'|publisher=BBC|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan José de Jesús Yas''' (1856 - 1917) was a Japanese photographer who established himself in [[Antigua Guatemala]], [[Guatemala]] and documented that city toward the end of the 19th century and early 20th century.

==Biography==
[[File:Manueldejesusyas3.jpg|200px|thumb|Yas and his wife on their wedding day.]]

Yas arrived to Guatemala as translator of the famous Mexican astronomer Covarrubias and he liked photography so much, that he became a student of German professor Herbruger.&lt;ref name=fotofest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotofest.org/exhibitions/faces-of-history/yas.htm |title=Yas |date=2012 |accessdate=22 August 2015 |website=Fotofest |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515220748/http://www.fotofest.org/exhibitions/faces-of-history/yas.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathleen M. Coleman''' is an academic and writer who is the James Loeb Professor of the [[Classics]] at [[Harvard University]]. Her research interests include [[Latin literature]], history and culture in the early [[Roman Empire]], and arena spectacles. Her expertise in the latter area led to her appointment as Chief Academic Consultant for the 2000 film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.

==Career==
Coleman was born and raised in [[Zimbabwe]]. She received her BA from the University of Cape Town in 1973, followed by a [[BA Hons]] from the [[University of Rhodesia]] in 1975 and a DPhil from [[Lady Margaret Hall]], Oxford in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kathleen Coleman|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/kcoleman/home|website=scholar.harvard.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught at the [[University of Cape Town]] from 1979 to 1993 and held the chair of Latin at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] from 1993 to 1998. Since 1998 she has been a professor at [[Harvard College]]. In 2009 Coleman was elected an Honorary Member of the [[Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies]] and in 2012 a Corresponding Member of the [[Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] (Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities). Coleman has been a Fellow of the [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]] and the [[Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung]]. In 2005 she was awarded the Joseph R. Levenson Teaching Prize for Senior Faculty by the Undergraduate Council of Harvard College, and in 2011 she served as President of the [[American Philological Association]] (now the Society for Classical Studies). Coleman is a member of the editorial boards of [[The American Journal of Philology]], Eirene, [[Exemplaria Classica]], [[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]] and Mnemosyne Supplements, and [[Rivista di Filologia e Istruzione Classica]].

Due to her extensive knowledge of gladiatorial combat and its history, she acted as Chief Academic Consultant on the script of [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Roman Theater of Cruelty|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/09/the-roman-theater-of-cru-html|work=Harvard Magazine|date=1 September 2000|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Coleman purportedly found her work as a historical consultant to have had such little effect that she asked to be listed in the credits without any mention of her function.&lt;ref&gt;Allen M. Ward, "''Gladiator in Historical Perspective''" in Winkler, Martin, M. ''Gladiator: Film and History'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2004) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; She has since contributed an essay entitled "The Pedant Goes to Hollywood: The Role of the Academic Consultant" to [[Martin Winkler]]'s collection of essays on the topic.

[[File:loi m.gif|thumb|A typical LOI]]A '''letter of intent''' ('''LOI''' or '''LoI''', and sometimes capitalized as ''Letter of Intent'' in legal writing, but only when referring to a specific document under discussion) is a document outlining one or more agreements between two or more parties before the agreements are finalized. The concept is similar to a [[Heads of agreement (law)|heads of agreement]], [[term sheet]] or [[memorandum of understanding]]. Such outlined agreements may be mergers and acquisitions transaction agreements,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.themalawyer.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ma-letters-of-intent/|title = What you need to know about M&amp;A letters of Intent|date = July 20, 2015|accessdate = August 28, 2015|website = The M&amp;A Lawyer Blog|publisher = Jasso Lopez PLLC|last = Lopez|first = Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; joint venture agreements, real property lease agreements and several other categories of agreements that may govern material transactions.
* LOIs resemble short, written [[contract]]s, but are usually in tabular form and not binding on the parties in their entirety. Many LOIs, however, contain provisions that are binding, such as those governing [[non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure]], [[governing law]], [[Exclusive right|exclusivity]] or [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] to negotiate in [[good faith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An LOI may sometimes be interpreted by a court of law as binding the parties to it if it too-closely resembles a formal contract and does not contain clear disclaimers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mintz.com/newsletter/2013/Advisories/3203-0713-NAT-COR/index.html|title = When a Non-binding Term Sheet Becomes Binding|date = July 8, 2013|accessdate = August 28, 2015|website = Mintz Levin|publisher = Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo PC|last = Burwell|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter of intent may be presented by one party to another party and subsequently negotiated before execution (or signature). If carefully negotiated, an LOI may serve to protect both parties to a transaction. For example, a seller of a business may incorporate what is known as a non-solicitation provision, which would restrict the buyer's ability to hire an employee of the seller's business should the two parties not be able to close the transaction. On the other hand, an LOI may protect the buyer of a business by expressly conditioning its obligation to complete the transaction if is unable to secure financing for the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exitpromise.com/letter-of-intent-to-buy-or-sell-a-business/|title=Letter of Intent to Buy A Business - Exit Promise|author=|date=11 March 2013|website=exitpromise.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes of an LOI ==
Common purposes of an LOI are:
* To allow parties to sketch out fundamental terms quickly before expending substantial resources on negotiating definitive agreements, finalizing due diligence, pursuing third-party approvals and other matters&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* To declare officially that the parties are currently negotiating, as in a [[merger]] or [[joint venture]] proposal
* To provide safeguards in case a deal collapses during negotiation
* To verify certain issues regarding payments made for someone else (''e.g.'', credit card payments)

Potential downsides to using an LOI may include:
* The parties may engage in protracted negotiations on only a subset of a deal’s terms
* Management time and focus may be diverted
* Alternative opportunities may be missed and markets may move against the parties during negotiations
* Parties may reduce their lack of a workable deal framework into an LOI, with a hope of making progress later
* Public disclosure obligations may be inadvertently triggered
* The risk of leaks, exacerbated by the desire of some to tout the LOI to the world, or shop it to other parties&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specific examples==
{{See also|National Letter of Intent}}
In [[academia]], a letter of intent is part of the application process,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=For what? Grad school? Grants?}} in which it is also known as a statement of purpose or [[Admissions essay|application essay]]. In education in the [[United States]], letters of intent are also frequently reached between high school senior athletes and colleges/universities, for the reservation of [[athletic scholarship]]s for the athletes upon graduation from high school.  [[Head teacher|School administrator]]s in [[secondary education]] often require a letter of intent before approving the formation of a [[Extracurricular activity|student club]].

In [[real estate]], in cases where the [[real property]] in question is not listed on a [[multiple listing service]], there may not be an easy way to notify the owner of the property and other interested parties of intent to purchase. Often it is necessary to officially begin the process of a purchase, and allow all peripheral interested parties to begin any other processes, with a letter of intent. For example, a multimillion-dollar loan for a commercial property may require a letter of intent before a financial institution will allow personnel to spend time working on said loan necessary for the completion of the sale. The same may be followed at the time of purchase by any company. A tenant and landlord may sign a letter of intent prior to signing a lease agreement to stipulate rental rates and all regulations of the future tenancy.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

In the [[solicitation]] of government grants, a letter of intent is highly encouraged but it is not required or binding, and does not enter into the review of a subsequent application.  The information that it contains allows agency staff to estimate the potential workload and plan the review.&lt;ref name="WSHCA"&gt;Typical example: {{Citation|author= |title=2008 Grant Solicitation for Consumer-Controlled Health Record Bank Pilots |url=http://www.hca.wa.gov/hit/documents/officialhrbgrant051408.pdf |accessdate=2008-05-21 |publisher=Washington State Health Care Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723192909/http://www.hca.wa.gov/hit/documents/officialhrbgrant051408.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18926">The '''''Lex Scantinia''''' (less often '''''Scatinia''''') is a poorly documented&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116, calls it a "notoriously elusive" law to which "scattered and vague references" are made in the ancient sources, in contrast to the well-documented ''Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis''. See also [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992), p. 106; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 224; John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman law|ancient Roman law]] that penalized a [[sex crime]] (''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Moral and legal concepts|stuprum]]'') against a freeborn male minor (''[[ingenui|ingenuus]]'' or ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|praetextatus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law'', pp. 140–141; Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', pp. 86, 224; Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality'', p. 67, pointing out that this is the only certain provision of the law.&lt;/ref&gt; The law may also have been used to prosecute adult male citizens who willingly took a passive role in having sex with other men. It was thus aimed at protecting the citizen's body from sexual abuse (''stuprum''), but did not prohibit homosexual behavior as such, as long as the passive partner was not a citizen in good standing. The primary use of the ''Lex Scantinia'' seems to have been harassing political opponents whose lifestyles opened them to criticism as passive homosexuals or [[Greek love#Ancient Rome|pederasts in the Hellenistic manner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Fantham]], "''Stuprum'': Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome," in ''Roman Readings: Roman Response to Greek Literature from Plautus to Statius and Quintilian'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), p. 138, and see [[#Prosecutions|"Prosecutions" below]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The law may have made ''stuprum'' against a minor a capital crime, but this is unclear: a large fine may have been imposed instead, as executions of Roman citizens were rarely imposed by a court of law during the [[Roman Republic|Republic]]. The conflation of the ''Lex Scantinia'' with later or other restrictions on sexual behaviors has sometimes led to erroneous assertions that the Romans had strict laws and penalties against homosexuality in general.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Walters, "Invading the Roman Body," in ''Roman Sexualites'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 33–35, noting particularly the too-broad definition of the law by Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1953, reprinted 1991), pp. 559 and 719, as prohibiting pederasty in general.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Roman boy wearing bulla.jpg|thumb|125px|Roman boy wearing a ''[[bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'', which marked him as sexually off-limits]]

{{See also|Sexuality in ancient Rome}}
[[Latin]] has no words that are straightforwardly equivalent to "homosexual" and "heterosexual."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The main dichotomy within Roman sexuality was active/dominant/masculine and passive/submissive/"feminized."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 18 ''et passim''; Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 98ff.; Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The adult male citizen was defined by his ''libertas'', "liberty," and allowing his body to be used for pleasure by others was considered servile or submissive and a threat to his integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326; Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|Roman's masculinity]] was not compromised by his having sex with males of lower status, such as male [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]] or [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], as long as he took the active, penetrating role.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 18 ''et passim''; Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex relations among Roman men thus differed from the Greek ideal of homosexuality among freeborn men of equal social status, but usually with some difference in age (see "[[Homosexuality in ancient Greece]]" and "[[Pederasty in ancient Greece]]"). The adult Roman male who enjoyed receiving [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] or performing [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] was thought to lack ''[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'', the quality that distinguished a man (''vir'').&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993) 523-573.&lt;/ref&gt;

The protective amulet (''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'') worn by freeborn Roman boys was a visible sign that they were [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|sexually off-limits]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546.&lt;/ref&gt; Puberty was considered a dangerous transitional stage in the formation of masculine identity.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–548.&lt;/ref&gt; When a boy [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rites of passage|came of age]], he removed his ''bulla'', dedicated it to the [[Lares|household gods]], and became sexually active under the patronage of [[Liber]], the god of both political and sexual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Bonfante, introduction to ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 7; Shelley Stone, "The Toga: From National to Ceremonial Costume," in ''The World of Roman Costume'', p. 41; Judith Lynn Sebesta, "Women's Costume and Feminine Civic Morality in Augustan Rome," ''Gender &amp; History'' 9.3 (1997), p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Greek love#Ancient Rome|Pederasty among the Romans]] involved an adult male citizen and a youth who was typically a slave between the ages of 12 and 20.

==The law==
As [[John Boswell]] has noted, "if there was a law against homosexual relations, no one in [[Cicero]]'s day knew anything about it."&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Lex Scantinia'' is mentioned in several ancient sources,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Ad familiares'' 8.12.3, 8.14.4; [[Suetonius]], ''Life of Domitian'' 8.3; [[Juvenal]], ''Satire'' 2, as noted by Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 224. Cantarella, ''Bisexuality'', p. 107, lists references in addition in the Christian writers [[Ausonius]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Prudentius]].&lt;/ref&gt; its provisions are unclear. It penalized the debauchery (''stuprum'') of a youth, but may also have permitted the prosecution of citizens who chose to take the [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome#Pathicus|pathic]] ("passive" or "submissive") role in homosexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 224; Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 71; Marguerite Johnson and Terry Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suetonius]] mentions the law in the context of punishments for those who are "unchaste," which for male citizens often implies pathic behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ausonius]] has an epigram in which a ''semivir'', "half-man," fears the ''Lex Scantinia''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has sometimes been argued that the ''Lex Scantinia'' was mainly concerned with the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#The rape of men|rape of freeborn youth]],&lt;ref&gt;Fantham, "''Stuprum'': Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome," p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; but the narrowness of this interpretation has been doubted.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The law may have codified traditional sanctions against ''stuprum'' involving men, as a forerunner to the ''[[Lex Julia#Augustan moral legislation|Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis]]'' that criminalized [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|adultery]] involving women.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 122–126.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Christian poet [[Prudentius]] makes a scathing joke that if [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] had been subject to Roman law, he could have been convicted under both the Julian and the Scantinian laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Prudentius]], ''Peristephanon'' 10.201–205; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only youths from freeborn families in good standing were protected under the law;&lt;ref&gt;Walters, "Invading the Roman Body," pp. 34–35; Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; children born or sold into slavery, or those who fell into slavery through military conquest, were subject to prostitution or [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|sexual use by their masters]]. Male prostitutes and entertainers, even if technically "free," were considered ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', of no social standing, and were also excluded from the protections afforded the citizen's body. Although male slaves were sometimes granted freedom in recognition of a favored sexual relationship with their master, in some cases of genuine affection they may have remained legally slaves, since under the ''Lex Scantinia'' the couple could have been prosecuted if both were free citizens.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Butrica, "Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'' (Haworth Press, 2005), pp. 234–236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecutions==
The infrequency with which the ''Lex Scantinia'' is invoked in the literary sources suggests that prosecutions during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]] were aimed at harassing political opponents, while those during the reign of [[Domitian]] occurred in a general climate of political and moral crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Butrica, "Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality," p. 231; [[Ray Laurence]], ''Roman Passions: A History of Pleasure in Imperial Rome'' (Continuum, 2009, 2010), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two letters written to Cicero by [[Marcus Caelius Rufus|Caelius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ad familiares'' 8.12 and 8.14 (letters 97 and 98 in the numbering of [[D.R. Shackleton Bailey|Shackleton Bailey]]).&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the law was used as a "political weapon";&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p.224.&lt;/ref&gt; ancient Rome had no public prosecutors, and charges could be filed and prosecuted by any citizen with the legal expertise to do so. Abuse of the courts was reined in to some extent by the threat of ''[[Calumnia (Roman law)|calumnia]]'', a charge of [[malicious prosecution]],&lt;ref&gt;H. Galsterer, "The Administration of Justice," in The Cambridge Ancient History: The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.–A.D. 69 (Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; but retaliatory charges motivated by politics or personal enmity, as Caelius makes clear in this case, were not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; In 50 BC, Caelius was engaged in a feud with [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 54 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]], the [[Roman consul|consul]] of 54 BC and a current [[Roman censor|censor]], who had refused to lend him money and with whose [[Clodia Metelli|sister]] Caelius had a disastrous love affair.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Skinner, ''Clodia Metelli: The Tribune's Sister'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Appius's term as censor was a moral "reign of terror" that stripped multiple [[Roman senator|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]] of their rank;&lt;ref&gt;[[D.R. Shackleton Bailey]], ''Cicero Epistulae ad familiares'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), vol. 1, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; sometime during the fall of that year he indicted&lt;ref&gt;The actual prosecutor was the obscure Sevius or Servius Pola.&lt;/ref&gt; Caelius, a sitting [[curule aedile]], under the ''Lex Scantinia''. Caelius was happy to respond in kind. Both cases were presided over by the [[praetor]] [[Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus]]—ironically, in the view of Caelius, since Drusus himself was "a notorious offender"&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton Bailey, ''Epistulae'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;—and evidently came to  nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Alexander, ''Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 BC to 50 BC'' (University of Toronto Press, 1990), pp. 167–168, records no outcome for either.&lt;/ref&gt; "Few people," [[Eva Cantarella]] observed, "were completely free of suspicion in this area."&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the law remained on the books, it had been largely ignored&lt;ref&gt;As implied by Juvenal, ''Satire'' 2.43f.; Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; until Domitian began to enforce it as part of his broad program of judicial reform. The crackdown on "[[public morals]]" included sexual offenses such as adultery and illicit sex (''[[incestum]]'') with a [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal]], and several men from both the senatorial and equestrian order were condemned under the ''Lex Scantinia''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Domitian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#8 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quintilian]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]] ''Institutio Oratoria'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/4B*.html#2.69 4.2.69]: "He assaulted a freeborn boy, and the latter hanged himself, but that is no reason for the author of the assault to be awarded capital punishment as having caused his death; he will instead pay 10,000 sesterces, the fine imposed by law for such a crime" (''ingenuum stupravit et stupratus se suspendit: non tamen ideo stuprator capite ut causa mortis punietur, sed decem milia, quae poena stupratori constituta est, dabit'').&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a fine of 10,000 [[sesterces]] for committing ''stuprum'' with a freeborn male, sometimes construed as referring to the ''Lex Scantinia'',&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; though the law is not named in the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, "Invading the Roman Body," p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the law==
A Roman law (''lex'', plural ''leges'') was typically named after the official who proposed it, and never after a [[defendant]]. In 227 or 226 BC, Gaius Scantinius Capitolinus was put on trial for sexually molesting the [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 196 BC)|son]] of [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]; a certain irony would attend the ''Lex Scantinia'' if in fact he had been its proposer.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that a relative of Scantinius Capitolinus proposed the law in a display of probity to disassociate the [[Roman naming conventions|family name]] from the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 111; Fantham, "''Stuprum:'' Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome," p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The law has also been dated to 216 BC, when a Publius Scantinius was [[College of Pontiffs|pontifex]], or 149 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 111; Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', p. 278. Cantarella rejects the proposal that the law be dated to 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest direct mention of it occurs in 50 BC, in the correspondence of Cicero,&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', p. 278..&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears not at all in the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17088">'''List of historic reserves in Ukraine''' includes historic sites that in Ukraine is known as '''Historic and Cultural Reserves'''. Main historic reserves are officially listed by the [[Ministry of Culture (Ukraine)|Ministry of Culture of Ukraine]] and usually known as national. There are other historic reserves that are established at regional level.

==Definition and background==
Historic and cultural reserves ({{lang-uk|Історико-культурні заповідники|translit=Istoryko-Kulturni Zapovidnyky}}) are special legally defined territories that include ensembles and complexes of landmarks of history and culture, which possess exceptional historic, scientific and cultural value and placed under protection of the state.

===In Ukraine===
First historic and cultural reserves in Ukraine were created in 1920s. Resolutions of the [[Council of People's Commissars (Ukraine)|Council of People's Commissars]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] proclaimed next territories as reserves: Ancient Greek Colony of [[Pontic Olbia (archaeological site)|Olbia]] (31 May 1924), the [[Taras Hill|Monk's Hill]] in Kaniv &amp;ndash; Taras Shevchenko burial (20 August 1925), [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] (29 September 1926), [[:uk:Монастир Кармелітів Босих (Бердичів)|Monastery of Barefoot Carmelites]] in Berdychiv (8 March 1928), [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle|Castle-Fortress in Kamianets-Podilskyi]] (23 March 1928), [[Starokostiantyniv Castle|Prince Ostrogski Castle]] in Starokostiantyniv (15 January 1929), so called Dytynets in Chernihiv, territories of [[Trinity Monastery (Chernihiv)|Chernihiv Saint Trinity Elijah Monastery]] and Chernihiv Yelets Dormition Monastery (18 March 1929) as well as Novhorod-Siverskyi Saint Transfiguration Monastery and Saint Cyril Church in Kiev. In total at the end of 1920s in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] existed 9 historic and cultural reserves. At that time there was started creation of reserves of local significance. Particularly according to respective decisions of local authorities there existed historic and archaeological reserve in Verkhniy Saltiv (1929; [[Vovchansk Raion]]), manor house and park "[[Kachanivka]]" (1928), others.

During 1930s due to mass repressions among specialists of cultural heritage conservation and fall of the cultural heritage conservation system, many reserved territories lost their reserved status. After the [[World War II]], portion of earlier created reserves that during the war suffered damage were not renewed in its reserved status. There were created new reserves, particularly the Kiev Acropolis with remnants of [[Church of the Tithes]] (1945), museum-reserve "Fields of Battle for Kiev" (1945), "Fields of Battle of Poltava" (1949), Ivan Tobilevych museum-reserve "Khutir Nadia" (1956). In 1965 there was announced creation of historic and cultural reserve at [[Khortytsia]] island in [[Zaporizhia]], however due to unleashed ideological campaign in fight against the so called Ukrainian bourgeoisie nationalism all respective events were stopped.

In the mid 1970-80s process of creation of historic and cultural reserves started to be reviewed as an effective way to preserve not only separate landmarks, but whole historic and cultural complexes. The status of reserves was expanded to streets, neighborhoods, districts, historic city centers, historic landscapes. There were proclaimed historic and cultural reserves in cities of Lviv (1975), Kamianets-Podilskyi (1977), Sevastopol (1978), Ostroh (1981), Lutsk (1985), Putyvl (1986), Ancient Kiev (1987), Kerch (1987), Chyhyryn (1989), and others.

With proclamation of state independence of Ukraine, the process of establishing historic and cultural reserves had awakened. Particularly in the first half of 1990s there was initiated or reorganized 32 state reserves by providing them with more status weight. Among them were Historic and Cultural Reserve "Taras Shevchenko Homeland", "Berestechko Battle Fields", "Hetmanate Capital", "Trakhtemyriv" as well as historic and architectural and archaeological complexes in cities of Alupka, Bakhchysarai, Vyshhorod, Halych, Hlukhiv, Dubno, Zhovkva, Zbarazh, Zolochiv, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Novhorod-Siverskyi, village Verkhniy Saltiv, others.

The Presidential decree of 11 October 1994 "About National Institutions of Culture" defined status and order of creation national historic and cultural reserves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Kuchma|Kuchma, L]]. ''[http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/587/94 About National Institutions of Culture]''. [[Verkhovna Rada]] website. 11 October 1994&lt;/ref&gt; First national reserves became, particularly, historic and ethnographic reserve "Pereyaslav", historic and archaeological reserve "Chersonesos of Taurica", historic and architectural reserves "Sophia of Kiev", "National Kiev Pechersk Historic and Cultural Reserve", "Chernihiv the Ancient", "Old Halych", "Chyhyryn", "Khortytsia".

In medieval and early modern Germany, the '''Münzmeister''' ("mint master", the Latin term is ''monetarius'') was the director or administrator of a [[Mint (coin)|mint]], a [[moneyer]] with responsibility for the minting of coins, or [[Coin|specie]]. His duties were defined differently at different locations and ages.

==Middle ages==
The need for currency was relatively low during [[Merovingian]] times. The ''Münzmeister'' produced coins in small workshops, working alone or with the aid of a few assistants, and handled the precious metals required. During [[Carolingian]] times, minting of specie became the task of royally appointed officials.

During the High Middle Ages they were replaced by the ''Münzerhausgenossenschaft'', or minting house cooperative. Its members came from the ranks of rich [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s: usually merchants, precious-metal traders, moneychangers, goldsmiths, who in turn appointed one out of their ranks as ''Münzmeister''. For their labor, the members of the cooperative were due a share of the minting profits. They also enjoyed certain rights and privileges, including a monopoly on the purchase of gold and silver, exemption from customs duties and taxes, and independent jurisdiction in minting matters. The house cooperatives saw their heyday in the 13th and 14th centuries.

In the late Middle Ages, the minting house cooperatives vanished when minting was taken over by sovereigns or cities. The ''Münzmeister'' was now an entrepreneur who determined weight, precious-metal content, [[seignorage]] and their own share, by way of free negotiations with the principals. Next to mines and shipyards, mints had become the largest enterprises of the age.

==Modern era==
In [[modernity]], local entrepreneurs and their mints gained in importance. The era saw the rise of ''Münzmeister'' dynasties, with leases that were extended over several generations. Frequently the coins bear symbols engraved by the ''Münzmeister'', often as tiny rosettae, tools, monographs or initials. In the 17th and 18th century the number of Jewish leaseholders in minting increased, not least because access of Jews to other occupations became more restricted on religious grounds.

During the [[Habsburg era]] in Austria and Germany, the government soon began to establish a minting system. Austria created the office of a supreme heritable ''Münzmeister'' that provided for a sinecure without a share in profits. In Bohemia, too, the supreme office of ''Münzmeister'' was held by dukes and noblemen who at the same time supervised all the kingdom's mining facilities.

Besides the ''Münzmeister'', there were other minting officials, such as the master smith, the dye-cutter, and the minter. The [[Münzwardein]] (in Latin, ''wardinus'') was tasked with making sure that minting was done properly from the right alloy. He also had to take samples that were presented to the ''Probationstag'' (= sampling commission) in line with official regulations. The sampling commission was constituted from the royal court or local gentry or their representatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65532">{{About|the use of the term "new world order" in international politics|its use in conspiracy theory|New World Order (conspiracy theory)|other uses|New World Order (disambiguation)}}

The term "'''new world order'''" has been used to refer to any new period of history evidencing a dramatic change in world political thought and the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. Despite various interpretations of this term, it is primarily associated with the ideological notion of [[global governance]] only in the sense of new collective efforts to identify, understand, or address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual [[nation state|nation-states]] to solve.

One of the first and most well-known Western uses of the term was in [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]],{{citation needed|reason=This phrase never occurs in the speech|date=August 2016}} and in a call for a [[League of Nations]] following the devastation of [[World War I]]. The phrase was used sparingly at the end of [[World War II]] when describing the plans for the [[United Nations]] and the [[Bretton Woods system]], and partly because of its negative associations with the failed League of Nations. However, many commentators have applied the term retroactively to the order put in place by the [[Allies of World War II|World War II victors]] as a "new world order."

The most widely discussed application of the phrase of recent times came at the end of the [[Cold War]]. Presidents [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] used the term to try to define the nature of the [[post Cold War era]], and the spirit of [[great power]] cooperation that they hoped might materialize. Gorbachev's initial formulation was wide-ranging and [[idealism (international relations)|idealistic]], but his ability to press for it was severely limited by the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|internal crisis of the Soviet system]]. Bush's vision was, in comparison, not less circumscribed: "A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/bush/speeches/speech-3425 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602115313/http://millercenter.org/president/bush/speeches/speech-3425 |archivedate=2016-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the new [[unipolarity|unipolar]] status of the United States, Bush's vision was realistic: "...there is no substitute for American leadership."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Gulf War]] of 1991 was regarded as the first test of the new world order: "Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order... The Gulf war put this new world to its first test..."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-bab.com/Arab/docs/pal/pal10.htm|title=Document: New world order: George Bush's speech, 6 Mar 1991|website=Al-bab.com|accessdate=17 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531214717/http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/pal10.htm|archivedate=31 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Freedman]], 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' ''Survival'', 33/3, (1991): p 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical usage==
[[File:Origin of the League of Nations.png|right|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson]] and the Origin of the [[League of Nations]]]]

The phrase "new world order" was explicitly used in connection with [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s global zeitgeist during the period just after World War I, during the formation of the [[League of Nations]]. "[[The war to end all wars]]" had been a powerful catalyst in international politics, and many felt the world could simply no longer operate as it once had.  The First World War had been justified not only in terms of U.S. [[national interest]] but in moral terms&amp;mdash;to "make the world safe for democracy." After the war, Wilson argued for a new world order which transcended traditional great power politics, instead emphasizing collective security, democracy, and self-determination. However, the [[United States Senate]] rejected membership of the League of Nations, which Wilson believed to be the key to a new world order. Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] argued that American policy should be based on human nature "as it is, not as it ought to be."&lt;ref name="econ1"&gt;"The bloodhounds of history." ''[[The Economist]]''.  April 10, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi activist and future German leader Adolf Hitler used the term in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-0IryYbwVIPGFodSS/Hitler%20-%20New%20World%20Order%20%281928%29_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Winston Churchill with Franklin D. Roosevelt on board USS Augusta (CA-31) on 9 August 1941 (NH 67201).jpg|left|thumb|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] during the meeting that would result in the [[Atlantic Charter]], precursor to the [[Bretton Woods system]]]]

The term fell from use when it became clear the League was not living up to expectations, and as a consequence was used very little during the formation of the United Nations. Former [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] felt that this new world order was a projection of the [[American dream]] into Europe, and that, in its naïveté, the idea of a new order had been used to further the parochial interests of [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]], thus ensuring the League's eventual failure.&lt;ref name="waldheim"&gt;Kurt Waldheim. "The United Nations: The Tarnished Image." ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' (1984, Fall)&lt;/ref&gt; Although some have claimed the phrase was not used at all, [[Virginia Gildersleeve]], the sole female delegate to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945, did use it in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The phrase was used by some in retrospect when assessing the creation of the post–[[World War II]] set of international institutions: the United Nations; the U.S. security alliances such as [[NATO]]; the [[Bretton Woods system]] of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]; and even the [[Truman Doctrine]] and [[Marshall Plan]] were seen as characterizing or comprising this new order.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[H.G. Wells]] wrote a book published in 1940 entitled ''[[The New World Order (Wells)|The New World Order]]''. It addressed the ideal of a world without war in which law and order emanated from a [[World government|world governing]] body and examined various proposals and ideas.

[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in his "Armistice Day Address Before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier" on November 11, 1940, referred to ''[[Novus ordo seclorum]]'', inscribed on the [[Great Seal of the United States]] and traced to antiquity. By this phrase [[Vergil]] announced the Augustan Golden Age. That Age was the dawn of the divine [[universal monarchy]], but Roosevelt on that occasion promised to take the world order into the opposite, democratic direction, led by the United States and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Frankline Delano Roosevelt, "Armistice Day Address Before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier," (November 11, 1940), http://greatseal.com/mottoes/neworderFDR.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post–Cold War "new world order"==

The phrase "new world order", as used to herald in the post–Cold War era, had no developed or substantive definition. There appear to have been three distinct periods in which it was progressively redefined, first by the Soviets, and later by the United States before the Malta Conference, and again after Bush's speech of September 11, 1991. 
#At first, the new world order dealt almost exclusively with [[nuclear disarmament]] and security arrangements. Gorbachev would then expand the phrase to include UN strengthening, and [[great power]] cooperation on a range of North-South, economic, and security problems. Implications for NATO, the [[Warsaw Pact]], and [[European integration]] were subsequently included.
#The Malta Conference collected these various expectations, and they were fleshed out in more detail by the press.  [[German reunification]], [[human rights]], and the [[polarity (power)|polarity]] of the international system were then included.
#The [[First Gulf War|Gulf War]] crisis refocused the term on [[superpower]] cooperation and regional crises.  Economics, North-South problems, the integration of the Soviets into the international system, and the changes in economic and military polarity received greater attention.

===Gorbachev's formulation===
The first press reference to the phrase came from Russo-[[India]]n talks, November 21, 1988.  [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] used the term in reference to the commitments made by the USSR through the [[Declaration of Delhi]] of two years previous.  The new world order which he describes is characterized by "[[non-violence]] and the principles of peaceful coexistence."  He also includes the possibility of a sustained peace, an alternative to the nuclear [[balance of terror]], dismantling of [[nuclear weapons]] systems, significant cuts in strategic arms, and eventually a general and complete disarmament.&lt;ref name="gandhi"&gt;"Gorbachev and Indian Prime Minister Hold Talks on November 19 Speeches Made at Peace Prize."  November 21, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article quotes [[NATO#Secretaries General|NATO Secretary General]] [[Manfred Wörner]] as saying that the Soviets have come close to accepting NATO's doctrine of military stability based on a mix of nuclear as well as [[conventional weapons|conventional arms]].  This, in his opinion, would spur the creation of "a new security framework" and a move towards "a new world order."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"Soviets 'in arms strategy shift'", ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 24, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

But the principal statement creating the new world order concept came from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s December 7, 1988 speech to the United Nations General Assembly.  His formulation included an extensive list of ideas in creating a new order.  He advocated strengthening the central role of the United Nations, and the active involvement of all members&amp;mdash;the Cold War had prevented the UN and its Security Council from performing their roles as initially envisioned.  The de-[[ideology|ideologizing]] of relations among states was the mechanism through which this new level of cooperation could be achieved.  Concurrently, Gorbachev recognized only one world economy—essentially an end to [[trade bloc|economic bloc]]s.  Furthermore, he advocated Soviet entry into several important international organizations, such as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] and [[International Court of Justice]].  Reinvigoration of the [[UN peacekeeping]] role,  and recognition that superpower cooperation can and will lead to the resolution of regional conflicts was especially key in his conception of cooperation.  He argued that the use of force or the threat of the use of force was no longer legitimate, and that the strong must demonstrate restraint toward the weak.  He foresaw, as the major powers of the world, the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, India, China, Japan, and Brazil. He asked for cooperation on [[environmental protection]], on [[debt relief]] for [[developing countries]], on disarmament of nuclear weapons, on preservation of the [[ABM treaty]], and on a convention for the elimination of [[chemical weapons]].  At the same time he promised the significant withdrawal of Soviet forces from Eastern Europe and Asia, as well as an end to the jamming of [[Radio Liberty]].

Gorbachev described a phenomenon that could be described as a global political awakening:

{{quote|We are witnessing most profound social change.  Whether in the East or the South, the West or the North, hundreds of millions of people, new nations and states, new public movements and ideologies have moved to the forefront of history.  Broad-based and frequently turbulent popular movements have given expression, in a multidimensional and contradictory way, to a longing for independence, democracy and [[social justice]]. The idea of democratizing the entire world order has become a powerful socio-political force.  At the same time, the scientific and technological revolution has turned many economic, food, energy, environmental, information and population problems, which only recently we treated as national or regional ones, into global problems.  Thanks to the advances in [[mass media]] and means of transportation, the world seems to have become more visible and tangible. International communication has become easier than ever before.}}

In the press, Gorbachev was compared to [[Woodrow Wilson]] giving the Fourteen Points, to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Churchill promulgating the [[Atlantic Charter]], and to Marshall and Truman building the [[Western Alliance]].  His speech, while visionary, was to be approached with caution.  He was seen as attempting a fundamental redefinition of international relationships, on economic and environmental levels.  His support "for independence, democracy and social justice" was highlighted.  But the principle message taken from his speech was that of a new world order based on [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], tolerance, and cooperation.&lt;ref name="wapo1"&gt;"Vision on the World Stage", ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 9, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For a new type of progress throughout the world to become a reality, everyone must change. Tolerance is the [[alpha and omega]] of a new world order.|Gorbachev, June 1990}}

A month later, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' ran a longer analysis of the speech and its possible implications.  The promises of a new world order based on the forswearing of military use of force was viewed partially as a threat, which might "lure the West toward complacency" and "woo Western Europe into neutered [[Neutral country|neutralism]]." The more overriding threat, however, was that the [[Western world|West]] did not yet have any imaginative response to Gorbachev—leaving the Soviets with the moral initiative, and solidifying Gorbachev's place as "the most popular world leader in much of [[Western Europe]]." The article noted as important his de-ideologized stance, willingness to give up use of force, commitment to troop cuts in Eastern Europe (accelerating political change there), and compliance with the ABM treaty. According to the article, the new world order seemed to imply: shifting of resources from military to domestic needs; a world community of states based on the [[rule of law]]; a dwindling of security alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact; and, an inevitable move toward European integration. The author of the ''Time'' article felt that Bush should counter Gorbachev's "[[Common European Home|common home]]" rhetoric toward the Europeans with the idea of "common ideals," turning an alliance of necessity into one of shared values.  Gorbachev's repudiation of [[expansionism]] leaves America in a good position, no longer having to support [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[dictator]]s, and able to pursue better goals: the environment, [[nonproliferation]] of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, reducing [[famine]] and poverty, and resolving regional conflicts.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;"The Gorbachev Challenge", ''[[Time Magazine]]'', December 19, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[A World Transformed]]'', Bush and Scowcroft's concern about losing leadership to Gorbachev is noted, and they worry that the Europeans might stop following the U.S. if it appears to drag its feet.&lt;ref name="world1"&gt;George H.W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft. ''[[A World Transformed]]'', {{ISBN|0-679-75259-5}}, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Europe passed into the new year, the implications of the new world order for the [[European Community]] surfaced.  The EC was seen as the vehicle for integrating East and West in such a manner that they could "pool their resources and defend their specific interests in dealings with those superpowers on something more like equal terms."  It would be less exclusively tied to the U.S., and stretch "from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to [[Brest-Litovsk]], or at least from [[Dublin]] to [[Lublin]]."&lt;ref name="ft1"&gt;"The Dog that Failed to Bark", ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 10, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  By July 1989, newspapers were still criticizing Bush for his lack of response to Gorbachev's proposals.  Bush visited Europe but "left undefined for those on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]] his vision for the new world order", leading commentators to view the U.S. as over-cautious and reactive, rather than pursuing long-range strategic goals.&lt;ref name="bg1"&gt;"Still searching for the Bush Doctrine", ''[[Boston Globe]]'', July 23, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Malta Conference===

[[File:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, 1989 official portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[George H. W. Bush]]]]

In ''A World Transformed'', Bush and Scowcroft detail their crafting of a strategy aimed at flooding Gorbachev with proposals at the [[Malta Summit|Malta Conference]] to catch him off guard, preventing the U.S. from coming out of the summit on the defensive.&lt;ref name="world2"&gt;''A World Transformed'', pp. 163–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malta Conference on December 2–3, 1989 reinvigorated discussion of the new world order.  Various new concepts arose in the press as elements on the new order.  Commentators expected the replacement of containment with superpower cooperation. This cooperation might then tackle problems such as reducing armaments and troop deployments, settling regional disputes, stimulating economic growth, lessening East-West trade restrictions, the inclusion of the Soviets in international economic institutions, and protecting the environment. Pursuant to superpower cooperation, a new role for NATO was forecast, with the organization perhaps changing into a forum for negotiation and treaty verification, or even a wholesale dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact following the resurrection of the four-power framework from World War II (i.e. the U.S., [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Russia]]). However, continued U.S. military presence in Europe was expected to help contain "historic antagonisms", thus making possible a [[European integration|new European order]].&lt;ref name="list1"&gt;Compiled from:
*"U.S. must get involved in shaping a new world order", ''Boston Globe'', December 3, 1989
*"New World Order Galloping Into Position", ''Washington Post'', February 25, 1990
*"A Workmanlike Summit", ''[[New York Times]]'', June 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, German reunification was seen as part of the new order.  However, [[Strobe Talbott]] saw it as more of a brake on the new era, and believed Malta to be a holding action on part of the superpowers designed to forestall the "new world order" because of the German question.&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;"American Abroad; Braking the Juggernaut", ''Time Magazine'', December 18, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Political change in Eastern Europe also arose on the agenda. The Eastern Europeans believed that the new world order didn't signify superpower leadership, but that superpower dominance was coming to an end.&lt;ref name="bg2"&gt;"Soviet hopes are undaunted", ''Boston Globe'', December 3, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the new security structure arising from superpower cooperation seemed to indicate to observers that the new world order would be based on the principles of political liberty, self-determination, and non-intervention. This would mean an end to the sponsoring of military conflicts in third countries, restrictions on global arms sales, and greater engagement in the [[Middle East]] (especially regarding [[Syria]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], and [[Israel]]). The U.S. might use this opportunity to more emphatically promote human rights in China and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="list1" /&gt;

Economically, debt relief was expected to be a significant issue, as East-West competition would give way to North-South cooperation.  Economic tripolarity would arise with the U.S., [[Germany]], and [[Japan]] as the three motors of world growth. Meanwhile, the Soviet social and economic crisis was manifestly going to limit its ability to project power abroad, thus necessitating continued U.S. leadership.&lt;ref name="list1" /&gt;

Commentators assessing the results of the Conference, and how the pronouncements measured up to expectations, were underwhelmed.  Bush was criticized for taking refuge behind notions of "[[status quo]]-plus" rather than a full commitment to new world order. Others noted that Bush thus far failed to satisfy the out-of-control "soaring expectations" that Gorbachev's speech unleashed.&lt;ref name="list1" /&gt;

===The Gulf War and Bush's formulation===

[[File:Bush troops.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Bush greeting troops on the eve of the First [[Gulf War]]]]

Bush started to take the initiative from Gorbachev during the run-up to the Persian Gulf War, when he began to define the elements of the new world order as he saw it and link the new order's success to the international community's response in [[Kuwait]].

Initial agreement by the Soviets to allow action against Saddam highlighted this linkage in the press. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' declared that this superpower cooperation demonstrates that the Soviet Union has joined the international community, and that in the new world order Saddam faces not just the U.S. but the international community itself.&lt;ref name="wapo2"&gt;"Summit Decision Signals Superpower Cooperation", ''Washington Post'', September 2, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''New York Times'' editorial was the first to assert that at stake in the collective response to Saddam was "nothing less than the new world order which [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] and other leaders struggle to shape." &lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;"The Month that Shook the World", ''New York Times'', September 2, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A World Transformed'', Scowcroft notes that Bush even offered to have Soviet troops amongst the coalition forces liberating Kuwait. Bush places the fate of the new world order on the ability of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to respond to Hussein's aggression.&lt;ref name="world3"&gt;''A World Transformed'', pp. 361–364.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the Persian Gulf War would usher in the new world order began to take shape. Bush notes that the "premise [was] that the United States henceforth would be obligated to lead the world community to an unprecedented degree, as demonstrated by the [[Iraq]]i crisis, and that we should attempt to pursue our [[national interest]]s, wherever possible, within a framework of concert with our friends and the [[international community]]."&lt;ref name="world4"&gt;''A World Transformed'', pp. 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 1991, President Bush addressed Congress in a speech often cited as the Bush administration's principal policy statement on the new world order in the Middle East, following the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.&lt;ref name="OrenPFnF"&gt;[[Michael Oren]], ''[[Power, Faith and Fantasy]]'', p. 569, 2011, W W Norton &amp; Son, {{ISBN|978-0393330304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  [[Michael Oren]] summarizes the speech, saying; "The president proceeded to outline his plan for maintaining a permanent U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf, for providing funds for Middle East development, and for instituting safeguards against the spread of unconventional weapons.  The centerpiece of his program, however, was the achievement of an Arab-Israeli treaty based on the territory-for-peace principle and the fulfillment of Palestinian rights." As a first step Bush announced his intention to reconvene the international peace [[Madrid Conference of 1991|conference in Madrid]].&lt;ref name="OrenPFnF"/&gt;

A pivotal point came with Bush's September 11, 1990 "Toward a New World Order" speech ([[wikisource:Toward a New World Order|full text]]) to a joint session of [[United States Congress|Congress]].  This time it was Bush, not Gorbachev, whose idealism was compared to [[Woodrow Wilson]], and to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the creation of the UN.  Key points picked up in the press were:
* Commitment to U.S. strength, such that it can lead the world toward rule of law, rather than use of force.  The Gulf crisis was seen as a reminder that the U.S. must continue to lead, and that military strength does matter, but that the resulting new world order should make military force less important in the future.
* Soviet–American partnership in cooperation toward making the world safe for democracy, making possible the goals of the UN for the first time since its inception.  Some countered that this was unlikely, and that ideological tensions would remain, such that the two superpowers could be partners of convenience for specific and limited goals only.  The inability of the USSR to project force abroad was another factor in skepticism toward such a partnership.
* Another caveat raised was that the new world order was based not on U.S.-Soviet cooperation, but really on Bush-Gorbachev cooperation, and that the personal diplomacy made the entire concept exceedingly fragile.
* Future cleavages were to be economic, not ideological, with the First and Second world cooperating to contain regional instability in the [[Third World]]. Russia could become an ally against economic assaults from Asia, [[Islamic terrorism]], and [[war on drugs|drugs]] from [[Latin America]].
* Soviet integration into world economic institutions, such as the [[G7]], and establishment of ties with the European Community.
* Restoration of German [[sovereignty]] and [[Cambodia]]'s acceptance of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]]'s peace plan on the day previous to the speech were seen as signs of what to expect in the new world order.
* The reemergence of Germany and Japan as members of the great powers, and concomitant reform of the UN Security Council was seen as necessary for great power cooperation and reinvigorated UN leadership
* Europe was seen as taking the lead on building their own world order, while the U.S. was relegated to the sidelines.  The rationale for U.S. presence on the continent was vanishing, and the Persian Gulf crisis was seen as incapable of rallying Europe.  Instead Europe was discussing the European Community, the CSCE, and relations with the USSR.  Gorbachev even proposed an all-European security council to replace the CSCE, in effect superseding the increasingly irrelevant NATO.
* A very few postulated a bi-polar new order of U.S. power and UN [[moral authority]], the first as global policeman, the second as global judge and jury. The order would be collectivist, in which decisions and responsibility would be shared.
These were the common themes that emerged from reporting about Bush's speech and its implications.&lt;ref name="list2"&gt;Compiled from:
*"Evoking the memory of Wilson and 'a new world order'", ''Boston Globe'', September 12, 1990
*"Superpowers to Superpartners", ''[[Newsweek]]'', September 17, 1990
*"Steps to a new world order", ''Financial Times'', September 17, 1990
*"U.S. leads the new world order", ''[[Toronto Star]]'', September 19, 1990
*"Europe choreographs new world order, but Bush is out of step", ''Boston Globe'', November 21
&lt;/ref&gt; Critics held that Bush and Baker remained too vague about what exactly the order entailed.

{{quote|Does it mean a strengthened U.N.? And new regional security arrangements in the gulf and elsewhere? Will the U.S. be willing to put its own military under international leadership? In the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush has rejected a UN command outright. Sometimes, when Administration officials describe their goals, they say the U.S. must reduce its military burden and commitment. Other times, they appear determined to seek new arrangements to preserve U.S. military supremacy and to justify new expenditures.}}

The ''New York Times'' observed that the [[American liberalism|American left]] was calling the new world order a "rationalization for imperial ambitions" in the Middle East, while the [[American Conservatism|right]] rejected new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of UN revival.&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;"George Bush Meet Woodrow Wilson", ''New York Times'', November 20, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pat Buchanan]] predicted that the Persian Gulf War would in fact be the demise of the new world order, the concept of UN peacekeeping, and the U.S.'s role as global policeman.&lt;ref name="world5"&gt;''A World Transformed'', pp. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[LA Times]]'' reported that the speech signified more than just the rhetoric about superpower cooperation.  In fact, the deeper reality of the new world order was the United States' emergence "as the single greatest power in a multipolar world."  Moscow was crippled by internal problems, and thus unable to project power abroad.  The United States, while hampered by economic malaise, was militarily unconstrained for the first time since the end of World War II.  Militarily, it was now a unipolar world, as illustrated by the Persian Gulf crisis.  While diplomatic rhetoric stressed a U.S.-Soviet partnership, the U.S. was deploying troops to [[Saudi Arabia]], a mere 700 miles from the Soviet frontier, and was preparing for war against a former Soviet [[client state]].  Further, U.S. authority over the Soviets was displayed in 1) the unification of Germany, withdrawal of Soviet forces, and almost open appeal to Washington for aid in managing the Soviet transition to democracy, 2) withdrawal of Soviet support for Third World clients, and 3) Soviets seeking economic aid through membership in Western international economic and trade communities.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;"With Moscow Crippled, U.S. Emerges as Top Power", ''[[LA Times]]'', September 12, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was indeed pivotal but the meaning hidden. A pivotal interpretation of the speech came the same month a week later, on September 18, 1990. Then [[Charles Krauthammer]] delivered a lecture in Washington in which he introduced the idea of American [[unipolarity]]. By the fall 1990, his essay was published in ''Foreign Affairs'' titled "The Unipolar Moment."&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', 69/5: (Winter 1990/91), p 23-33.&lt;/ref&gt; It had few to do with Kuwait. The main point was:

{{quote|It has been assumed that the old bipolar world would beget a multipolar world… The immediate post-Cold War world is not multipolar. It is unipolar. The center of world power is an unchallenged superpower, the United States, attended by its Western allies.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', 69/5: (Winter 1990/91), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In fact, as [[Lawrence Freedman]] commented in 1991, a "unipolar" world is now taken seriously. He details:

{{quote|An underlying theme in all the discussions is that the United States has now acquired a preeminent position in the international hierarchy. This situation has developed because of the precipitate decline of the Soviet Union. Bush himself has indicated that it is the new relationship with Moscow that creates the possibility for his new order. For many analysts, therefore, the new order's essential feature is not the values it is said to embody nor the principles upon which it is to be based, but that it has the United States at its center... In effect, the debate is over the consequences of the West's victory in the Cold War rather than in the Gulf for the generality of international conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' ''Survival'', 33/3, (1991): p 197.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Washington's capacity to exert overwhelming military power and leadership over a multinational coalition provides the "basis for a ''[[Pax Americana]]''." Indeed, one of the problems with Bush's phrase: "a call for 'order' from Washington chills practically everyone else, because it sounds suspiciously like a ''Pax Americana''."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' ''Survival'', 33/3, (1991): p 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; The unipolarity, Krauthammer noted, is the "most striking feature of the post-Cold War world."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The article proved to be epochal. Twelve years later, Krauthammer in "The Unipolar Moment Revisited"&lt;ref&gt;''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the "moment" is lasting and lasting with "acceleration."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He replied to those who still refused to acknowledge the fact of unipolarity: "If today's American primacy does not constitute unipolarity, then nothing ever will."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In 1990, Krauthammer had estimated that the "moment" will last forty years at best; in 2002 he adjusted the estimation: "Today, it seems rather modest. The unipolar moment has become the unipolar era."&lt;ref&gt;''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; On the latter occasion, Krauthammer added perhaps his most significant comment: the new unipolar world order represents a "unique to modern history" structure.&lt;ref&gt;''National Interest'', 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presaging the Iraq War of 2003====

[[File:JamesBaker.jpeg|thumb|left|[[James Baker]], Secretary of State under George H. W. Bush]]

''[[The Economist]]'' published an article explaining the drive toward the Persian Gulf War in terms presaging the run-up to the [[Iraq War of 2003]].  The author notes directly that despite the coalition, in the minds of most governments this is America's war, and Bush that "chose to stake his political life on defeating Mr Hussein."  An attack on Iraq would certainly shatter Bush's alliance, they assert, predicting calls from Security Council members saying that diplomacy should have been given more time and that they will not wish to allow a course of action "that leaves America sitting too prettily as sole remaining superpower." When the unanimity of the Security Council ends, "all that lovely talk about the new world order" will too.  And when casualties mount, "Bush will be called a warmonger, an [[imperialism|imperialist]] and a bully."  The article goes on to say that Bush and [[James Baker]]'s speechifying cannot save the new world order once they launch a controversial war.  It closes noting that a wide consensus is not necessary for U.S. action—only a hardcore of supporters: Saudi Arabia, [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], [[Egypt]], and Britain.  The rest need only not interfere.&lt;ref name="econ2"&gt;"New World Order Inc", ''The Economist'', November 10, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In a passage with similar echoes of the future, Bush and Scowcroft explain in ''A World Transformed'' the role of the [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary General]] in attempting to avert the Persian Gulf War. UN Secretary-General [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] arrived at [[Camp David]] to ask what he could do to head off the war.  Bush told him that it was important that we get full implementation on every UN resolution.  "If we compromise, we weaken the UN and our own credibility in building this new world order," I said. "I think Saddam Hussein doesn't believe force will be used—or if it is, he can produce a stalemate."  Additional meetings between Baker or Pérez and the Iraqis are rejected for fear that they will simply come back empty-handed once again.  Bush fears that Javier will be cover for Hussein's manipulations.  Pérez suggests another Security Council meeting, but Bush sees no reason for one.&lt;ref name="world6"&gt;''A World Transformed'', pp. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Following the Persian Gulf War===

Following the Persian Gulf War which was seen as the crucible in which great power cooperation and collective security would emerge the new norms of the era&amp;mdash;several academic assessments of the "new world order" idea were published.

[[John Lewis Gaddis]], a Cold War historian, wrote in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' about what he saw as the key characteristics of the potential new order: unchallenged American primacy, increasing integration, resurgent [[nationalism]] and religiosity, a diffusion of security threats, and collective security.  He casts the fundamental challenge as one of integration versus fragmentation, and the concomitant benefits and dangers associated with each.  Changes in [[telecommunication|communications]], the international economic system, the nature of security threats, and the rapid spread of new ideas would prevent nations from retreating into [[isolationism|isolation]].  In light of this, Gaddis sees a chance for the [[democratic peace theory|democratic peace]] predicted by [[Liberal international relations theory|liberal international relations theorists]] to come closer to reality. However, he illustrates that not only is the fragmentary pressure of nationalism manifest in the former Communist bloc countries and the [[Third World]], but is also a considerable factor in the West. Further, a revitalized [[Islam]] could play both integrating and fragmenting roles&amp;mdash; emphasizing common identity but also contributing to new conflicts that could resemble the [[Lebanese Civil War]].  The integration coming from the new order could also aggravate [[ecology|ecological]], [[demography|demographic]], and [[epidemic]] threats.  National [[self-determination]], leading to the breakup and reunification of states (such as Yugoslavia on one hand, and Germany on the other) could signal abrupt shifts in the balance of power, with a destabilizing effect.  Integrated markets, especially energy markets, are now a security liability for the world economic system, as events affecting [[energy security]] in one part of the globe could threaten countries far removed from potential conflicts.  Finally, diffusion of security threats requires a new security paradigm involving low-intensity but more frequent deployment of peacekeeping troops&amp;mdash;a type of mission that is hard to sustain under budgetary or public opinion pressure.  Gaddis calls for aid to Eastern European countries, updated security and economic regimes for Europe, UN-based regional conflict resolution, a slower pace of international economic integration, and paying off the U.S. [[Government debt|debt]].&lt;ref name="gaddis"&gt;John Lewis Gaddis.

However, statesman [[Strobe Talbott]] wrote of the new world order that it was only in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War that the United Nations took a step toward redefining its role to take account of both interstate relations and intrastate events. Furthermore, he asserted that it was only as an unintended postscript to Desert Storm that Bush gave meaning to the "new world order" slogan. But, by the end of the year Bush stopped talking about a new world order. His advisers explained that he had dropped the phrase because he felt it suggested more enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the planet than he actually felt. He wanted, as an antidote to the uncertainties of the world, to stress the old verities of territorial integrity, national sovereignty and international stability.&lt;ref name="talbott"&gt;Strobe Talbott. "Post-Victory Blues." ''Foreign Affairs.'' December 1991 January 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Gergen]] suggested at the time that it was the [[Late 1980s recession|recession of 1991–92]] which finally killed the new world order idea within the White House. The economic downturn took a deeper psychological toll than expected while domestic politics were increasingly frustrated by paralysis, with the result that the United States toward the end of 1991 turned increasingly pessimistic, inward and nationalistic.&lt;ref name="gergen"&gt;David Gergen.

In 1992, [[Hans Köchler]] published a critical assessment of the notion of the "new world order," describing it as an ideological tool of legitimation of the global exercise of power by the US in a unipolar environment.&lt;ref name="köchler"&gt;Hans Köchler. ''Democracy and the New World Order''. Studies in International Relations, XIX. Vienna: International Progress Organization, 1993. {{ISBN|3-900704-13-9}}. (Translation of the German edition of 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Joseph S. Nye, Jr.]]'s analysis (1992), the collapse of the Soviet Union did not issue in a new world order per se, but rather simply allowed for the reappearance of the liberal institutional order that was supposed to have come into effect in 1945.  This success of this order was not a fait accomplis, however.&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;Joseph S. Nye, Jr. "What New World Order." ''Foreign Affairs''. 1992, Spring&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later, [[G. John Ikenberry]] would reaffirm Nye's idea of a reclamation of the ideal post-World War II order, but would dispute the nay-sayers who had predicted post–Cold War chaos.&lt;ref name="ikenberry"&gt;G. John Ikenberry. "The Myth of Post–Cold War Chaos." ''Foreign Affairs''. May 1996 / June 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1997, [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]] produced an analysis calling the restoration of the post-World War II order a "chimera... infeasible at best and dangerous at worst."  In her view, the new order was not a liberal institutionalist one, but one in which state authority disaggregated and decentralized in the face of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="slaughter"&gt;Anne-Marie Slaughter.

[[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] wrote critically of the "new world order" and of [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s ''[[The End of History and the Last Man|End of History]]'' theory in ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'':
:The expectation of harmony was widely shared. Political and intellectual leaders elaborated similar views. The Berlin wall had come down, communist regimes had collapsed, the United Nations was to assume a new importance, the former Cold War rivals would engage in "partnership" and a "grand bargain," peacekeeping and peacemaking would be the order of the day. The President of the world's leading country proclaimed the "new world order"...

:The moment of euphoria at the end of the Cold War generated an illusion of harmony, which was soon revealed to be exactly that. The world became different in the early 1990s, but not necessarily more peaceful. Change was inevitable; progress was not... The illusion of harmony at the end of that Cold War was soon dissipated by the multiplication of ethnic conflicts and "[[ethnic cleansing]]," the breakdown of law and order, the emergence of new patterns of alliance and conflict among states, the resurgence of neo-[[communist]] and [[neo-fascist]] movements, intensification of religious [[fundamentalism]], the end of the "diplomacy of smiles" and "[[policy of yes]]" in Russia's relations with the West, the inability of the United Nations and the United States to suppress bloody local conflicts, and the increasing assertiveness of a rising China. In the five years after the Berlin wall came down, the word "[[genocide]]" was heard far more often than in any five years of the Cold War.

:The one harmonious world paradigm is clearly far too divorced from reality to be a useful guide to the post–Cold War world. Two Worlds: Us and Them. While one-world expectations appear at the end of major conflicts, the tendency to think in terms of two worlds recurs throughout human history. People are always tempted to divide people into us and them, the in-group and the other, our civilization and those barbarians.&lt;ref name="huntington"&gt;Samuel P. Huntington.

Despite the criticisms of the new world order concept, ranging from its practical unworkability to its theoretical incoherence, [[Bill Clinton]] not only signed on to the idea of the "new world order," but dramatically expanded the concept beyond Bush's formulation. The essence of Clinton's [[United States presidential election, 1992|election year]] critique was that Bush had done too little, not too much.&lt;ref name="hendrickson"&gt;David C. Hendrickson.

American intellectual [[Noam Chomsky]], author of the 1994 book ''[[World Orders Old and New]]'', often describes the New World Order as a post-Cold-War era in which "the [[New World]] gives the orders". Commenting on the [[Kosovo War|1999 US-NATO bombing of Serbia]], he writes:

{{quote|The aim of these assaults is to establish the role of the major imperialist powers—above all, the United States—as the unchallengeable arbiters of world affairs. The "New World Order" is precisely this: an international regime of unrelenting pressure and intimidation by the most powerful capitalist states against the weakest.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Chomsky | first = Noam | authorlink = Noam Chomsky |title =  US-NATO bombs fall on Serbia: the "New World Order" takes shape | year = 1999 | url = http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/mar1999/nato-m25.shtml | accessdate = 2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the rise of [[Boris Yeltsin]], eclipsing Mikhail Gorbachev, and the [[United States presidential election, 1992|election victory]] of Clinton over George H.W. Bush, the term "new world order" fell from common usage. It was replaced by competing, similar concepts about how the post–Cold War order would develop.  Prominent among these were the ideas of the "era of [[globalization]]," the "unipolar moment," the "end of history," and the "[[Clash of Civilizations]]."&lt;ref name="garfinkle"&gt;Adam Garfinkle. "The Present Opportunity." ''[[The National Interest]]''. 2001 Fall&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viewed in retrospect===
A 2001 paper in ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' examined the idea of the "new world order" as it was presented by the Bush administration (mostly ignoring previous uses by Gorbachev).  Their conclusion was that Bush really only ever had three firm aspects to the new world order:
#Checking the offensive use of force;
#Promoting [[collective security]]; and,
#Using great power cooperation.
These were not developed into a policy architecture, but came about incrementally as a function of domestic, personal, and global factors.  Because of the somewhat overblown expectations for the new world order in the media, Bush was widely criticized for lacking vision.&lt;ref name="psq"&gt;Eric A. Miller and Steve A. Yetiv, [http://unitedelite.net/bush.html "The New World Order in Theory and Practice: The Bush Administration’s Worldview in Transition."]  ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gulf crisis is seen as the catalyst for Bush's development and implementation of the new world order concept.  The authors note that before the crisis, the concept remained "ambiguous, nascent, and unproven" and that the United States had not assumed a leadership role with respect to the new order.  Essentially, the Cold War's end was the permissive cause for the new world order, but the Persian Gulf crisis was the active cause.&lt;ref name="psq" /&gt;

[[File:Richard Cheney 2005 official portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dick Cheney]], then [[Secretary of Defense]] under George H. W. Bush (1989-1993)]]
They reveal that in August 1990, U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia [[Charles W. Freeman, Jr.]] sent a diplomatic cable to Washington from Saudi Arabia in which he argued that U.S. conduct in the Persian Gulf crisis would determine the nature of the world.  Bush would then refer to the "new world order" at least 42 times from the summer of 1990 to the end of March 1991.  They also note that [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] gave three priorities to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on fighting the Persian Gulf War: prevent further aggression; protect oil supplies; and, further a new world order. The authors note that the new world order did not emerge in policy speeches until after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, maintaining that the concept was clearly not critical in the U.S. decision to deploy.  [[John H. Sununu]] later indicated that the administration wanted to refrain from talking about the concept until Soviet collapse was more clear.  A reversal of Soviet collapse would have been the death knell for the new order.&lt;ref name="psq" /&gt;

Bush and Scowcroft were frustrated by the exaggerated and distorted ideas surrounding the new world order.  They did not intend to suggest that the U.S. would yield significant influence to the UN, or that they expected the world to enter an era of peace and tranquility.  They preferred [[multilateralism]], but did not reject [[unilateralism]].  The new world order did not signal peace, but a "challenge to keep the dangers of disorder at bay."&lt;ref name="psq" /&gt;

Bush's drive toward the Persian Gulf War was based on the world making a clear choice.  Baker recalls that UNSCR 660's "language was simply and crystal clear, purposely designed by us to frame the vote as being for or against aggression".  Bush's motivation centered around 1) the dangers of [[appeasement]], and 2) failure to check aggression could spark further aggression.  Bush repeatedly invoked images of World War II in this connection, and became very emotional over [[List of war crimes#Invasion of Kuwait .28Iraq.29|Iraqi atrocities being committed in Kuwait]].  He also believed that failure to check Iraqi aggression would lead to more challenges to the U.S.-favored status quo and global stability.  While the end of the Cold War increased U.S. security globally, it remained vulnerable to regional threats.  Furthermore, Washington believed that addressing the Iraqi threat would help reassert U.S. predominance in light of growing concerns about relative decline, following the resurgence of Germany and Japan.&lt;ref name="psq" /&gt;

[[File:Eduard shevardnadze.jpg|thumb|[[Eduard Shevardnadze]], then [[Soviet Foreign Minister]]]]
The Gulf War was also framed as a test case for UN credibility.  As a model for dealing with aggressors, Scowcroft believed that the United States ought to act in a way that others can trust, and thus get UN support.  It was critical that the U.S. not look like it was throwing its weight around.  Great power cooperation and UN support would collapse if the U.S. marched on the [[Baghdad]] to try to remake Iraq.  However, practically, superpower cooperation was limited.  For example, when the U.S. deployed troops to Saudi Arabia, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] became furious at not being consulted.&lt;ref name="psq" /&gt;

By 1992, the authors note, the U.S. was already abandoning the idea of collective action.  The leaked draft of the ([[Paul Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]]-[[Lewis Libby|Libby]]) 1992 Defense Guidance Report effectively confirmed this shift, as it called for a unilateral role for the U.S. in world affairs, focusing on preserving American dominance.&lt;ref name="psq" /&gt;

In closing ''A World Transformed'', Scowcroft sums up what his expectations were for the new world order.  He states that the U.S. has the strength and the resources to pursue its own interests, but has a disproportionate responsibility to use its power in pursuit of the common good, as well as an obligation to lead and to be involved.  The U.S. is perceived as uncomfortable in exercising its power, and ought to work to create predictability and stability in international relations.  America need not be embroiled in every conflict, but ought to aid in developing multilateral responses to them.  The U.S. can unilaterally broker disputes, but ought to act whenever possible in concert with equally committed partners to deter major aggression.&lt;ref name="world7"&gt;''A World Transformed'', pp. 565–566.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent political usage==
[[Henry Kissinger]] stated in 1994, "The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the most significant single component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions."&lt;ref&gt;World Affairs Council Press Conference, Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, April 19, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Then on January 5, 2009, when asked on television by CNBC anchors about what he suggests  [[Barack Obama]] focus on during the current Israeli crises he replied that it is a time to reevaluate American foreign policy and that "he can give new impetus to American foreign policy ... I think that his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period, when really a 'new world order' can be created. It's a great opportunity. It isn't such a crisis."

Former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] (then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), on December 17, 2001, stated that "This is not the first time the world has faced this question – so fundamental and far-reaching. In the 1940s, after the greatest of wars, visionaries in America and elsewhere looked ahead to a new world and – in their day and for their times – built a new world order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_146_01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113232033/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_146_01.htm |archivedate=2010-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown also called for a "new world order" in a 2008 speech in [[New Delhi]], to reflect the rise of Asia and growing concerns over [[global warming]] and [[global finance|finance]]. Brown said the new world order should incorporate a better representation of "the biggest shift in the balance of economic power in the world in two centuries." He then went on, "To succeed now, the post-war rules of the game and the post-war international institutions – fit for the Cold War and a world of just 50 states – must be radically reformed to fit our world of globalisation."&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain, India push for UN Security Council reform |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iQVSQB8calOpCj31LxqQ29dxK1gw |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=January 21, 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called for the revamping of [[Bretton Woods system|post-war global institutions]] including the [[World Bank]], [[G8]] and [[International Monetary Fund]].

Some scholars of international relations have advanced the thesis that the declining global influence of the United States and the rise of largely illiberal powers such as China threaten the established norms and beliefs of the liberal, rule-based world order. They describe three pillars of the prevailing order that are upheld and promoted by the West: peaceful international relations (the Westphalian norm), democratic ideals, and free-market capitalism. Stewart Patrick suggests that emerging powers, China included, "often oppose the political and economic ground rules of the inherited Western liberal order"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patrick|first=Stewart|title=Irresponsible Stakeholders?

beliefs many in the West truly hold. It is part of an ideological challenge to the legitimacy of the policies and regimes of other nations, mixed with a measure of self-congratulatory exceptionalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|title=A Liberal, Rule-Based Order?|journal=International Journal of Contemporary Sociology|date=April 2013|volume=50|issue=1|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5267">'''Nils Ivar Agøy''' (born 19 November 1959) is a Norwegian historian, theologian, [[Tolkien research|tolkienologist]] and translator.

He hails from [[Gjøvik]].&lt;ref name=50y&gt;{{cite news|title=Jubilanter|date=19 November 2009|work=Aftenposten|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the [[cand.philol.]] degree in history at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1987, with the master's thesis ''Kampen mot vernetvangen. Militærnekterspørsmålet i Norge 1885–1922''. The thesis chronicled and explained [[conscientious objection]] in Norway before &lt;!--it was legalized under certain circumstances in--&gt;1922. His academic advisor was Jorunn Bjørgum.

Already in 1988 he graduated with the [[cand.theol.]] degree in theology at the [[MF Norwegian School of Theology]]. Subsequently, he was employed as a [[research fellow]] in history at the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]],&lt;ref name=50y/&gt; finishing his [[dr.philos.]] degree in history in 1994. His thesis ''Militæretaten og "den indre fiende" fra 1905 til 1940. Hemmelige sikkerhetsstyrker i Norge sett i et skandinavisk perspektiv'' explored the military precautions against "inner enemies"—defined as revolutionary segments—between the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|1905 Norwegian independence]] and the Second World War, against a Scandinavian backdrop. His doctoral advisor was [[Ottar Dahl]].

He was appointed as [[associate professor]] of modern history at [[Telemark University College]] in 1994, and was promoted to professor in 2002.&lt;ref name=50y/&gt; In 2010 he released ''Kirken og arbeiderbevegelsen'', the result of ten years of work. The book explores ties between the [[Church of Norway]] and other congregations, and the labour movement in Norway. He concluded that the relations between Christians and labour leaders were less marked by strife and more by cooperation that hitherto believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiendar med sams kamp|date=22 December 2010|pages=26–27|author=Kulås, Guri|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiendskap og fellesskap|date=22 January 2011|pages=56–57|author=Ravn, Lars|work=Telemarksavisa|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agøy is a co-founder of Norwegian Tolkien Society Arthedain.

Agøy's translation debut was [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Silmarillion]]''. For this he was awarded the [[Bastian Prize]], a translator's prize in Norway, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bastianprisen til Moren Vesaas|date=5 October 1995|agency=Norwegian News Agency|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has later been a jury member for the children's literature class of the Bastian Prize, which is awarded by the [[Norwegian Association of Literary Translators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ble satt pris på|date=3 October 2003|work=Klassekampen|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he released the second Norwegian translation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=– Vår tids største eventyrforteller|date=20 December 2001|page=|author=Wærhaug, Sølvi|work=VG|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has also translated ''[[Unfinished Tales|Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norsk bok om Tolkiens verden|date=5 November 2003|page=40|author=Hanssen, Kurt|work=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he released a book on J. R. R. Tolkien himself, titled ''Mytenes mann'' ("Man of the Myths"). The purpose was to write an introductory Tolkien book in Norwegian, and Agøy used original Tolkien documents archived in [[Oxford]] to construct a compounded biography and analysis of Tolkien's body of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nordmann med bok om den ukjente Tolkien|date=15 December 2003|page=47|author=Wærhaug, Sølvi|work=VG|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a favourable review in ''[[Verdens Gang|VG]]''; the reviewer gave a [[dice throw (review)|dice throw]] of 5 out of 6 and complimented Agøy for his "deep insight in Tolkien's world of ideas and sources of inspiration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atter en Tolkien-bok|date=15 December 2003|page=47|author=Rydne, Jon H|work=VG|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Aftenposten]]'' praised it moderately as a "readable entry portal to the world of Tolkien".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tar massekulturen på alvor|date=17 December 2003|page=|author=Lund, Ingrid K|work=Aftenposten|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He resides in [[Bø i Telemark]], where Telemark University College is located, and is married to current secretary-general and former chair of the [[Church of Norway Council on Ecumenical and International Relations]], [[Berit Hagen Agøy]].

''' Ortaköy''' is a village in the district of [[Uludere]] in [[Şırnak province]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yerelnet.org.tr/koyler/koy.php?koyid=266346|title=[YerelNET] ORTAKÖY KÖYÜ|website=www.yerelnet.org.tr|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortaköy is {{convert|55|km}} away from the district of Uludere and it is located in [[southeastern Turkey]], just on the western border of the [[Hakkari province]].

==History==
The village used to be an ancient [[Assyrian tribe]], part of [[Assyria]], called ''Ārosh Taxtayta'' (Lower Arosh) within the historical Assyrian district of [[Tyari]] and was populated by [[Assyrian people]] up until [[Seyfo]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/maps/chevalier/chevalier8.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian village ''Ārosh Alayta'' (Upper Arosh), now named Yukariarus, in [[Hakkari]], is less than {{convert|1|km}} away, closely bordering the province of Sirnak. Halmon is around {{convert|4|km}} to the northeast in Andaç and Gérāmon to the northwest, just right next to Halmon. Assyrian inhabitants of these proximate villages have ever since intermixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/maps/hakkarimap.png|title=Assyrian villages in Hakkari Assyrian villages in Hakkari|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Rather close to the border of [[Northern Iraq]] and within the upper reaches of [[Mesopotamia]], the village is situated in a precipitous highland on a [[valley]] and is surrounded by mountains. The area's vegetation is [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]]. Summers are hot and dry with temperatures around 33&amp;nbsp;°C and winters are cold and wet, hovering around 4&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Snowfall]] is common in the cool months.

==Economy==
The economy of the village is based on [[livestock]] and [[beekeeping]].

==Infrastructure==
There is a primary school in the village. The village has [[drinking water]] network but there is no [[Sewerage|sewer]] network. There is no [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|PTT]] branch and agency. There is no [[health clinic]]. There is [[electricity]] and fixed telephone [[ADSL]] internet infrastructure in the village.

[[File:Bloc orastie.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Dacia]]n-themed mural on a [[Communist Romania|Communist-era]] apartment block in [[Orăştie]]]]
{{Communist Romania}}
'''Protochronism''' (anglicized from the {{lang-ro|Protocronism}}, from the [[Ancient Greek]] terms for "first in time") is a [[Romania]]n term describing the tendency to ascribe, largely relying on questionable data and subjective interpretations, an idealized past to the country as a whole. While particularly prevalent during the [[Romanian Socialist Republic|regime]] of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], its origin in Romanian scholarship dates back more than a century.

The term refers to perceived aggrandizing of Dacian and earlier roots of today's [[Romanians]]. This phenomenon is also pejoratively labelled "'''Dacomania'''" or sometimes "'''Thracomania'''", while its proponents prefer "'''Dacology'''".

==Overview==

In this context, the term makes reference to the trend (noticed in several versions of [[Romanian nationalism]]) to ascribe a unique quality to the [[Dacians]] and their civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.160-161&lt;/ref&gt; Protochronists attempt to prove either that Dacians had a major part to play in [[Ancient history]], or even that they had the ascendancy over all cultures (with a particular accent on [[Ancient Rome]], which, in a complete reversal of the [[founding myth]], would have been created by Dacian migrants).&lt;ref name="Boia"&gt;Boia, p.149-151&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted are the exploitation of the [[Tărtăria tablets]] as certain proof that writing originated on proto-Dacian territory, and the belief that the [[Dacian language]] survived all the way to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Boia"/&gt;

An additional—but not universal—feature is the attempted connection between the supposed [[monotheism]] of the [[Zalmoxis]] cult and [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; in the belief that Dacians easily adopted and subsequently influenced the religion. Also, Christianity is argued to have been preached to the Daco-Romans by [[Saint Andrew]], who is considered, doubtfully, as the clear origin of modern-day [[Romanian Orthodoxy]]. Despite the lack of evidence to support this, it is the official church stance, being found in history textbooks used in Romanian Orthodox seminaries and theology institutes.&lt;ref&gt;Lavinia Stan, Lucian Turcescu, ''Religion and Politics in Post-Communist Romania'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ideas have been explained as part of an [[inferiority complex]] present in Romanian nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; one which also manifested itself in works not connected with Protochronism, mainly as a rejection of the ideas that Romanian territories only served as a colony of Rome, voided of initiative, and subject to an influx of Latins which would have completely wiped out a Dacian presence.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.85, 127-147&lt;/ref&gt;

Protochronism most likely came about with the views professed in the 1870s by [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]],&lt;ref&gt;Boia, 138-139, 140, 147; Verdery, p.326&lt;/ref&gt; one of the main points of the dispute between him and the [[conservatism|conservative]] ''[[Junimea]]''. For example, Hasdeu's ''Etymologicum magnum Romaniae'' not only claimed that Dacians gave Rome many of her Emperors (an idea supported in recent times by [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]]),&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; but also that the ruling dynasties of early medieval [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were descendants of a [[caste]] of Dacians established with "King" ([[tribal chief|chieftain]]) [[Burebista]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates of the idea before [[World War I]] included the amateur [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Cezar Bolliac]],&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.139-140&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Teohari Antonescu]] and [[Nicolae Densuşianu]]. The latter composed an intricate and unsupported theory on Dacia as the center of European prehistory,&lt;ref name="Boia_2"&gt;Boia, p.147-148&lt;/ref&gt; authoring a complete parallel to Romanian official history, which included among the Dacians such diverse figures as those of the [[Asen dynasty]], and [[Horea]].&lt;ref name="Boia_2"/&gt; The main volume of his writings is ''[[Dacia Preistorică]]'' ("Prehistoric Dacia").

After [[World War I]] and throughout [[Greater Romania]]'s existence, the ideology increased its appeal. The [[Iron Guard]] flirted with the concept, making considerable parallels between its projects and interpretations of what would have been Zalmoxis' message.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.320&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Eliade]] was notably preoccupied with Zalmoxis' cult, arguing in favor of its structural links with Christianity;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.152; Eliade, "Zalmoxis, The Vanishing God", in ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (December 1974), p.807-809&lt;/ref&gt; his theory on Dacian history, viewing [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] as a limited phenomenon, is celebrated by contemporary partisans of Protochronism.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.152; Şimonca&lt;/ref&gt;

In a neutral context, the Romanian archaeology school led by [[Vasile Pârvan]] investigated scores of previously ignored Dacian sites, which indirectly contributed to the idea's appeal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.145-146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 [[Edgar Papu]] published in the mainstream cultural monthly ''Secolul XX'' an essay titled "The Romanian Protochronism", arguing for Romanian chronological priority for some European achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.122-123; Martin&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was promptly adopted by the nationalist Ceauşescu regime, which subsequently encouraged and amplified a cultural and historical discourse claiming the prevalence of autochthony over any foreign influence.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.117-126&lt;/ref&gt; Ceauşescu's ideologues developed a singular concept after the 1974 11th Congress of the [[Communist Party of Romania]], when they attached Protochronism to official [[Marxism]], arguing that the Dacians had produced a permanent and "unorganized State".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The Dacians had been favored by several communist generations as autochthonous insurgents against an "[[Imperialist]]" Rome (with the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] leadership of the 1950s proclaiming them to be closely linked with the [[Slavic peoples]]);&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.154-155, 156&lt;/ref&gt; however, Ceauşescu's was an interpretation with a distinct motivation, making a connection with the opinions of previous protochronists.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.155-157; 330-331&lt;/ref&gt;

The regime started a partnership with [[Italy|Italian]] resident, former Iron Guardist and millionaire [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]], who continued championing the Dacian cause even after the fall of Ceauşescu.&lt;ref&gt;Verdary, p.343&lt;/ref&gt; Critics regard these excesses as the expression of an [[Economic nationalism|economic nationalist]] course, amalgamating provincial frustrations and persistent nationalist rhetoric, as [[autarky]] and cultural isolation of the late Ceauşescu's regime came along with an increase in protochronistic messages.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.338&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer backed by a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state structure after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], the interpretation still enjoys popularity in several circles.&lt;ref&gt;Babeş; Boia, p.356&lt;/ref&gt; The main representative of current Protochronism is still Drăgan, but he is seconded by the [[New York City]]-based physician [[Napoleon Săvescu]]. Together, they issue the magazine ''Noi, Dacii'' ("We Dacians") and organize a yearly "International Congress of Dacology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=89101 "Ca şi cînd precedentele reuniuni n-ar fi fost de ajuns, dacologii bat cîmpii in centrul Capitalei"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', 22 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dacian script==
[[File:Poiana vase.jpg|right|thumb|A Dacian script or the work of an illiterate potter?]]
'''Dacian alphabet''' is a term used in Romanian Protochronism for [[pseudohistorical]] claims of  a supposed alphabet of the [[Dacians]] prior to the conquest of [[Dacia]] and its absorption into the [[Roman Empire]].
Its existence was first proposed in the late 19th century by [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalists]], but has been completely rejected by mainstream modern scholarship.

In the opinion of [[Sorin Olteanu]], a modern expert at the [[Vasile Pârvan Institute of Archaeology]], Bucharest, "[Dacian script] is pure fabrication [...] purely and simply Dacian writing does not exist", adding that many scholars believe that the use of writing may have been subject to a religious taboo among the Dacians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistanoinu.com/Scrierea-daca-este-pura-inventie.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107022513/http://www.revistanoinu.com/Scrierea-daca-este-pura-inventie.html |archivedate=2011-01-07 |df= }}  "Este un bun prilej să demontăm un alt mit drag tracomanilor, anume cel al 'scrierii dacice' si al vechimii ei 'imemorabile'.

Nu este nici măcar vorba de incertitudini, de chestiuni de interpretare (din ce punct de vedere privim) s.a.m.d., ci pur si simplu nu există nici o scriere dacă [...] Asa cum cred multi dintre învătati, este foarte posibil ca la daci, întocmai ca si la celti până la un anumit moment, scrierea să fi fost supusă unui tabu religios.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that the ancient [[Dacians]] used the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daicoviciu|first=Hadrian|title=Dacii|publisher=Editura Enciclopedică Română|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; though possibly not as early as in neighbouring [[Thracians|Thrace]] where the [[Thracian language#Inscriptions|Ezerovo ring]] in Greek script has been dated to the 5th century BC.

The main critic of ''protochronism'' in Romania, Lucian Boia (lector of History University at Bucharest), was heavily criticized by two PhD historians, both members of Romanian Academy, Ion Aurel Pop, rector at Babes-Boliay University from Cluj-Napoca and professor Ioan Scurtu.&lt;ref name="books.google.ro"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ioan Scurtu|editor=Editura Mica Valahie|title=Istoria Romanilor de la Carol I la Nicolae Ceausescu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7_jjYVZ_Y8C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=lucian+boia+secretar+de+partid+cu+propaganda|publisher=Editura Mica Valahie|language=ro|isbn=978-606-8304-05-2|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	  	
What Pop says about Boia is that Boia is a specialist in 20th century historiography (i.e. protochronism), but Boia isn't a specialist in ancient or medieval history. So Pop does not disagree with the negative arguments mounted by Boia (i.e. dispelling the myths of National-Communist historiography), but says that Boia is unable to provide [[positivism|positive]] knowledge about the ancient and medieval history of Romania.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{YouTube|Bb-XONv1KVo|Acad. prof. univ. dr. Ioan-Aurel Pop - Despre falsificarea istoriei}}&lt;/ref&gt; E.g. Boia's 2015 book about [[Mihai Eminescu]] is a book about the myths about Eminescu (i.e. imagology), it isn't a book about Eminescu's life (i.e. the facts about him).

Lucian Boia was accused{{by whom?|date=February 2017}} as well that during Communist period he followed strictly the history line imposed by the Party as he was the head of communist propaganda department from Bucharest University.&lt;ref name="books.google.ro"/&gt;{{quotation needed|date=February 2017}}

He started to become a critic just after 1989, when he became related with ''Soros Foundation'' which published his books at their publishing house in Budapest, Hungary. He was supported later on political basis,{{weasel inline|date=February 2017}} and he was advanced directly lector, jumping over pre-lector position as it was normal,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  and received grants for studies abroad (both before 1989, when agreement and preparation from former political secret police, [[Securitate]], was needed for such, and after).&lt;ref name="books.google.ro"/&gt;{{reliable source?|date=February 2017}}

Romanian nationalists compared him with [[Mihail Roller|Mihai Roller]], the chief historian imposed by Soviets during 50's, famous for his attempts to rewrite national history and who was promptly eliminated from mainstream history circles even since the 60's. Boia was criticized as well because he is just a ''historian of ideas'' (i.e. how others write history) and not a specialist in historical domains he is talking about (like ancient history, medieval history, ethnology, archeology or linguistics), so his opinion in those subjects doesn't hold the necessary weight.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;

== Protochronism in other countries ==

During the 1940s, protochronism in the Soviet Union claimed that Russians had been the first to invent the lightbulb and telephone.&lt;ref name="Priestland404"/&gt; Imitating Stalinist trends in the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist Bloc]], Albania developed its own version of protochronist ideology which stressed the [[Origin of the Albanians|continuity of Albanians]] from ancient peoples such as the [[Illyrians]].&lt;ref name="Priestland404"&gt;{{cite book|last=Priestland|first=David|title=The Red Flag: Communism and the making of the modern world|year=2009|location=London|publisher=Penguin UK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEEpAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The+Red+Flag%3A+Communism+and+the+Making+of+the+Modern+World&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=non-Slavic|isbn=9780141957388|pages=404|ref=harv}} "Protochronism became an enormously popular idea in Romanian culture in the 1970s and 1980s...

'''Robert Barclay''' (4 August 1833– 11 Nov. 1876) was an [[English people|English]] [[Quaker]] [[historiographer]].

==Life and education==
Barclay was born 4 August 1833 at [[Croydon]]. He was the younger son of John Barclay. After passing through a preparatory school at [[Epping, Essex|Epping]], he went to the Friends' school at [[Hitchin]], conducted by Isaac Brown, afterwards head of the Flounders Institute, [[Ackworth, West Yorkshire|Ackworth]]. His education was finished at Bruce Grove House, [[Tottenham]]. He attained a good knowledge of [[botany]] and [[chemistry]], was fond of [[electrical]] experiments, and had skill as a [[watercolour]] artist.

He married on 14 July 1857 Sarah Matilda, eldest daughter of [[Francis Fry]], and had nine children, of whom six survived him. He died of a [[brain aneurysm]] on 11 November 1876.

==Business career==
In 1855, he bought a London manufacturing [[stationery]] concern in Bucklersbury, (afterwards in College Street and Maiden Lane), taking into partnership his brother-in-law, J. D. Fry, in 1867. In March 1860 he patented an ‘[[indelible]] [[writing paper]]’ for the prevention of forgery, the process of manufacturing which he described in a communication to the [[Society of Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Quaker views and historiography==
Though not ‘recorded’ as a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[Society of Friends]] (to which body he belonged), he preached in their meetings and missions. A posthumous volume gives thirty-six of his sermons, which were usually written, an uncommon thing with Friends.

In 1868 he delivered a lecture on the position of the Society of Friends in relation to the spread of the [[gospel]] during the last sixty years. He endorsed the view of [[Herbert Skeats]] that the early Society of Friends was the first home mission association, and was anxious to see the body regaining its position as an aggressive [[Christian]] church. He was strongly in favour of the public reading of the Bible in Friends' meetings, and thought [[Richard Claridge]]'s ‘Treatise of the Holy Scriptures,’ 1724, presented a more correct view of the sentiments of the early Friends than their controversial writings. He was as strongly opposed to the practice of birthright membership, introduced among Friends in 1737.

His opinions on these points led to his undertaking a series of investigations which culminated in his work on the internal constitution of the obscurer Commonwealth sects, whose origin, ramifications, and practical tendencies. His presentation of the doctrinal aspects of primitive Quakerism was criticised from the standpoint of another Friend, in an ‘Examen’ (1878), by Charles Evans, M.D., of Philadelphia.

'''Royllo''' (also '''Roillo'''), is a legendary [[phantom island]] that was once thought to be located in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Probably identical with the island originally called '''Ymana''' in a 1424 [[nautical chart]] of [[Zuane Pizzigano]].  The island is usually depicted in many 15th-century maps as a small island located slightly to the west (20 [[League (unit)|leagues]] or so) of the much larger [[Antillia]] island.&lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, "[http://bell.lib.umn.edu/map/PORTO/MYS/cort.html Armando Cortesão and Island Names]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is often found in the group ''insulae de novo repertae'', or "newly discovered islands" along with other legendary islands.

'''Standish James O'Grady''' ({{lang-ga|Anéislis Séamus Ó Grádaigh}}; 18 September 1846 – 18 May 1928) was an Irish author, journalist, and historian. O'Grady was inspired by [[Sylvester O'Halloran]] and played a formative role in the [[Celtic Revival]], publishing the tales of [[Irish mythology]], as the ''History of Ireland: Heroic Period'' (1878), arguing that the Gaelic tradition had rival only from the tales of [[Homeric]] [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. O'Grady was a paradox for his times, proud of his [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] heritage, he was also a member of the [[Church of Ireland]], a champion of [[aristocratic]] virtues (particularly decrying bourgeois values and the uprooting cosmopolitanism of modernity) and at one point advocated a revitalised Irish people taking over the [[British Empire]] and renaming it the Anglo-Irish Empire.

O'Grady's influence crossed the divide of the [[Anglo-Irish]] and Irish-Ireland traditions in literature. His influence was explicitly stated by the [[Abbey Theatre]] set with [[Lady Gregory]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[George William Russell]] attributing their interest in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of Gaelic tradition in part to him. Some of the figures associated with the political party [[Sinn Féin]], including its founder Arthur Griffith, had positive things to say about his efforts in helping to retrieve from the past the Gaelic heroic outlook.

==Family==
His father was the Reverend [[Thomas O'Grady]], the scholarly [[Church of Ireland]] minister of Castletown Berehaven, [[County Cork]], and his mother Susanna Doe (or Dowe).  Standish O'Grady's childhood home – the Glebe – lies a mile west of Castletownbere near a famine mass grave and ruined Roman Catholic chapel. He was a cousin of [[Standish Hayes O'Grady]], another noted figure in Celtic literature, and of [[Standish O'Grady, 1st Viscount Guillamore]]. 

He married Margaret Allen Fisher, daughter of William Allen Fisher and had three sons. Advised to move away from Ireland for the sake of his health, he passed his later years living with his eldest son, a clergyman in England, and died on the [[Isle of Wight]].

His eldest son, Hugh Art O'Grady, was for a time editor of the [[Cork Free Press]] before he enlisted in the [[Great War]] early in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Maume, Patrick: ''A Nursery of Editors; the Cork Free Press, 1910–16'' in "History IRELAND" March/April 2007 p.44&lt;/ref&gt; He became better known as Dr Hugh O'Grady, later Professor of the Transvaal University College, Pretoria (later the [[University of Pretoria]]), who wrote the biography of his father in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Maume, Patrick: History IRELAND p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rather severe education at [[The Abbey School (Tipperary)|Tipperary Grammar School]], Standish James O'Grady followed his father to [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he won several prize medals and distinguished himself in several sports.

==Career==
He proved too unconventional of mind to settle into a career in the church, and qualified as a [[barrister]], though earning much of his living by writing for the Irish newspapers. Reading [[Sylvester O'Halloran]]'s "General history of Ireland" sparked an interest in early Irish history. After an initial lukewarm response to his writing on the legendary past in "History of Ireland: Heroic Period" (1878–81) and "Early Bardic Literature of Ireland" (1879), he realised that the public wanted romance, and so followed the example of [[James Macpherson]] in recasting Irish legends in literary form, producing historical novels including "[[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Finn]] and his Companions" (1891), "The Coming of [[Cú Chulainn|Cuculain]]" (1894), "The Chain of Gold" (1895), "Ulrick the Ready" (1896) and "The Flight of the Eagle" (1897), and "The Departure of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Dermot]]" (1913). 

He also studied Irish history of the Elizabethan period, presenting in his edition of Sir [[Thomas Stafford (MP)|Thomas Stafford]]'s "Pacata Hibernia" (1896) the view that the Irish people had made the Tudors into kings of Ireland to overthrow their unpopular landlords, the Irish chieftains. His "The Story of Ireland" (1894) was not well received, as it shed too positive a light on the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] for the taste of many Irish readers. He was also active in social and political campaigns in connection with such issues as unemployment and taxation.

Until 1898, he worked as a journalist for the ''[[Daily Express (Dublin)|Daily Express]]'' of Dublin, but in that year, finding Dublin journalism in decline, he moved to [[Kilkenny]] to become editor of the ''[[Kilkenny Moderator]]'', which was printed at number 28 High Street. It was here he became involved with [[Ellen Cuffe, Countess of Desart]] and [[Captain Otway Cuffe]]. He engaged in the revival of the local woollen and woodworking industries. In 1900 he founded the ''[[All-Ireland Review]]'', and returned to Dublin to manage it until it ceased publication in 1908. O'Grady contributed to James Larkins' ''[[The Irish Worker]]'' paper.

O'Grady's works were an influence on [[WB Yeats]] and [[George William Russell|George Russell]] and this led to him being known as the "Father of the [[Celtic Revival]]". Being as much proud of his family's [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionism]] and Protestantism as of his [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic Irish]] ancestry – identities that were increasingly seen as antithetical in the late 1800s – he was described by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] as a "[[fenian]] [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eire-ireland/v039/39.1maume.html|title=Patrick Maume – Standish James O'Grady: Between Imperial Romance and Irish Revival – Éire-Ireland 39:1&amp;2|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of England}}
{{Periods in English History}}
The '''Stuart period''' of British history lasted from 1603 to 1714 during the dynasty of the [[House of Stuart]]. The period ended with the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] from the German [[House of Hanover]].

The period was plagued by internal and religious strife, and a large-scale civil war which resulted in the execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1649. The [[Interregnum (1649–1660)|Interregnum]], largely under the control of [[Oliver Cromwell]], is included here for continuity, even though the Stuarts were in exile. The Cromwell regime collapsed and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] had very wide support for his taking of the throne in 1660. His brother [[James II of England|James II]] was overthrown in 1689 in the [[Glorious Revolution]]. He was replaced by his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and her Dutch husband [[William III of England|William III]]. Mary's sister Anne was the last of the line. For the next half century James II and his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] and grandson [[Charles Edward Stuart]] claimed that they were the true Stuart kings, but they were in exile and attempts  to return with French aid were defeated.

==Political history==

===James VI and I: 1603–1625===
{{Main|Jacobean era|James VI and I}}

====Rule of the upper-classes====
England was ruled at the national level by royalty and nobility, and at the local level by the lesser nobility and the gentry. Together they comprised about 2% of the families, owned most of the good farmland, and controlled local government affairs.&lt;ref&gt;For in-depth coverage, start with Lawrence Stone, ''The crisis of the aristocracy: 1558–1641'' (abridged edition, 1967) pp 23–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocracy was growing steadily in numbers, wealth, and power. From 1540 to 1640, the number of peers (dukes, earls, marquises, viscounts, and barons) grew from 60 families to 160. They inherited their titles through [[primogeniture]], had a favoured position in legal matters, enjoyed the highest positions in society, and held seats in the House of Lords. In 1611, the king looking for new revenue sources created the hereditary rank of [[baronet]], with a status below that of the nobility, and no seat in Lords, and a price tag of about £1100. The vast land holdings seized from the monasteries under [[Henry VIII of England]] in the 1530s were sold mostly to local gentry, greatly expanding the wealth of that class of gentlemen. The gentry tripled to 15,000 from 5000 in the century after 1540. Many families died out, and others moved up, so that three-fourths of the peers in 1714 had been created by Stuart kings since 1603.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Roberts, David Roberts, and Douglas R. Bisson, ''A History of England: Volume 1 (Prehistory to 1714)'' (4th ed. 2001) 1: 255, 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Wrightson|title=English Society 1580–1680|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbuIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23|year=2002|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kishlansky, ''A Monarchy Transformed, Britain 1630–1714'' (1997) pp 19–20, 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians engaged in a lively debate—dubbed the "[[Storm over the gentry]]"—about the theory that the rising gentry class increasingly took power away from the static nobility, and generally reject it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald H. Fritze, |author2=William B. Robison |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Historical Dictionary of Stuart England, 1603–1689|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8goko0Lpr5sC&amp;pg=PA205|year=1996 |pages=205–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the gentry and the nobility were gaining power, and the [[English Civil War]] was not a battle between them.&lt;ref&gt;David Loades, ed. ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) 2:1200–1206; J.H. Hexter, ''On History'' (1979) pp. 149–236&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of religious affiliation in England, the Catholics were down to about 3% of the population, but comprised about 12% of the gentry and nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tombs, ''The English and Their History'' (2015) p 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Three kingdoms====
{{See also|Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}
James VI, king of Scotland, also became king of the entirely separate kingdom of England when [[Elizabeth I of England]] died. He also became king of Ireland, but the English were just reestablishing lost control there. The English re-conquest was completed after victory in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]], 1594–1603. James' appointees in Dublin as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] established real control over Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native lordships. The great majority of the Irish population remained Catholic, but James promoted heavy Protestant migration from Scotland into the [[Ulster]] region. The new arrivals were known as [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] or Scotch-Irish. In turn many of them migrated to the new American colonies during the Stuart period.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Blethen and Curtis Wood, eds., ''Ulster and North America: transatlantic perspectives on the Scotch-Irish'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles I: 1625–1649===
{{Main|Caroline era|Charles I of England}}
King James was failing in physical and mental strength, because of this he was often mocked by his family and his own father would throw objects at him when he would try to stand up, and decision-making was increasingly in the hands of Charles and especially [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]] (1592–1628), (he was Earl of Buckingham from 1617 and Duke from 1623). Buckingham showed a very high degree of energy and application, as well as a huge appetite for rewards and riches. By 1624 he was effectively the ruler of England. In 1625 Charles became the king of a land deeply involved in a European war and rent by escalating religious controversies. Buckingham and Charles developed a foreign policy based on an alliance with France against Spain. Major foreign adventures against [[Cádiz]] in 1625 and in support of French [[Huguenots]] in 1627 were total disasters. Widespread rumour shaped public opinion that blamed Buckingham, rather than the king, for the ills that beset England. When Parliament twice opened impeachment proceedings, the king simply prorogued (suspended) the Parliament. Buckingham was assassinated in 1628 by [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]], a dissatisfied Army officer. The assassin was executed, but he nevertheless became a heroic martyr across the three kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;David Coast, "Rumor and 'Common Fame': The Impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham and Public Opinion in Early Stuart England." ''Journal of British Studies'' 55.2 (2016): 241–267. [http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/7202/1/7202.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, King Charles believed in the [[divine right of kings]] to rule, and one was unable to work successfully with Parliament. By 1628 he and Buckingham had transformed the political landscape. In 1629 the king dissolved parliament and began a period of eleven years of personal rule.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Sharpe, ''The personal rule of Charles I'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovell J. Reeve, ''Charles I and the road to personal rule'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal rule: 1629–1640====
{{Further|Charles I of England#Personal rule}}
English government was quite small, for the king had no standing army, and no bureaucracy stationed around the country. Laws were enforced primarily by local officials controlled by the local elites. Military operations were typically handled by hired mercenaries. The greatest challenge King Charles faced in ruling without a parliament was raising money. The crown was in debt nearly £1.2 million; financiers in the City refused new loans.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Early Stuarts'' pp 82–85&lt;/ref&gt; Charles saved money by signing peace treaties with France in 1629 and Spain in 1630, and avoiding involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. He cut the usual budget but it was not nearly enough. Then he discovered a series of ingenious methods to raise money without permission of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, ''Stuart Age'' pp 136– 45.&lt;/ref&gt; They had been rarely used, but were nevertheless legal. He sold monopolies, despite their unpopularity. He fined the landowners for supposedly encroaching on the royal forests. Compulsory [[knighthood]] had been established in the Middle Ages when men of certain wealth were ordered to become knights in the king's service, or else pay a fine. When knighthood lost its military status, the payments continued, but they had been abandoned by 1560. James reinstated the fine, and hired new officials to search local records to find wealthy men who did not have knighthood status. They were forced to pay, including [[Oliver Cromwell]] among thousands of other country gentlemen across rural England. £173,000 was raised, in addition to raising bitter anger among the gentry.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Leonard, "Distraint of Knighthood: The Last Phase, 1625–41." ''History'' 63.207 (1978): 23–37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24410394 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The king finally crossed the line of legality when he began to levy "[[ship money]]", intended for naval defences, upon interior towns. Protests now escalated to include urban elites. All the new measures generated long-term outrage, but they did balance the short-term budget, which averaged £600,000, without the need to call Parliament into session.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Gordon, "The Collection of Ship-money in the Reign of Charles I." ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' 4 (1910): 141–162. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3678388 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long Parliament of 1640====
{{Main article|Long Parliament}}
Revolts broke out in Scotland in response to the king's imposition of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which threatened to undermine the religion of the people. The Scots drove English forces out and forced the king to subsidise the insurgents who were now occupying part of northern England. A major revolt among Catholics in Ireland killed thousands of Scots Irish—there was no doubt it had to be suppressed and new taxes would be needed to pay the costs of military action. A new Parliament had to be called.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, ''Stuart Age'' pp 152–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The Long Parliament elected in 1640 proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach and remove the king's leading counsellors for high treason. [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]] was taken into custody on 10 November; [[William Laud]], the [[List of Archbishops of Canterbury|Archbishop of Canterbury]] was impeached on 18 December; [[John Finch, 1st Baron Finch]], now [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]], was impeached the following day, and he fled to [[Holland]]. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the [[Triennial Act]], which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted [[royal assent]] in February 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Gregg, ''King Charles I'' (1981), pp 324–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Russell, "Why Did Charles I Call the Long Parliament?." ''History'' 69.227 (1984): 375–383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24419688 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Christianson, "The Peers, the People, and Parliamentary Management in the First Six Months of the Long Parliament." ''Journal of Modern History'' 49.4 (1977): 575–599. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1875621 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War and Interregnum: 1642–1660===
{{Main|English Civil War|Commonwealth of England|Interregnum (1649–1660)}}
The [[First English Civil War]] of 1642–1645 ended in victory for the Parliamentarians over the Royalists (often called "[[Cavaliers]]"). The Parliamentarians were often called "[[Roundhead]]s" because of their short practical haircuts. The [[Second English Civil War]] was fought in 1648–1649; Charles lost and was executed in January 1649.

The monarchy was temporarily displaced by the Commonwealth of England from 1649 to 1660. [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled directly from 1653 to his death in 1658, whereupon his Commonwealth disintegrated. The [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], son of Charles I, to return from exile and become king.

The war period (1642–1651) saw a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists, with most of the fighting in England. The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642–1646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648–1649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649–1651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651. Historians debate whether the main determinant of the outcome was based on superior operational decisions and decisive battlefield events (as argued by Malcolm Wanklyn), or rather Parliament's long-run superiority in manpower and money (as argued by Clive Holmes).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gaunt, ''The English Civil War: A Military History'' (2014) pp 223–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall outcome was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649–1653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653–1658). When Cromwell died his son [[Richard Cromwell]] was incapable of governing, and the Puritan army directly ruled the three kingdoms, to the growing disgust of all classes of people. The monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on religion was strengthened by the suppression of the last remnants of Catholicism, and the powerful forces of [[Puritans|Puritanism]] and [[Nonconformist|Nonconformism]]. Constitutionally, the wars convinced everyone that an English monarch cannot govern alone, nor could Parliament. They were both essential.&lt;ref&gt;Useful textbooks include Clayton Roberts, F. David Roberts, and Douglas Bisson, ''A History of England, Volume 1: Prehistory to 1714'' (5th ed. 2016) ch 14; Michael Lynch, ''The interregnum: 1649–60'' (1994); and Angela Anderson, ''The civil wars 1640-9'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cromwell====
{{Further|Oliver Cromwell|Commonwealth of England|The Protectorate}}
In 1649–59 the dominant figure in England—although he refused the offer of kingship—was [[Oliver Cromwell]], the highly successful Parliamentarian general.&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Morrill, ''Oliver Cromwell and the English revolution'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked hard at the time to ensure good publicity for his reign, and his successful wars. He remains a favourite topic of historians even as he is one of the most controversial figures in British history and his intense religiosity has long been out of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Greenspan, ''Selling Cromwell's Wars: Media, Empire and Godly Warfare, 1650–1658'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Commonwealth: 1649–1653=====
After the execution of the King, a republic was declared, known as the [[Commonwealth of England]]. A Council of State was appointed to manage affairs, which included Cromwell among its members. His real power base was in the army; Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original group of 'Royal Independents' centred around St John and Saye and Sele, but only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. From the middle of 1649 until 1651, Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to fight each other. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell eventually dismissed the Rump Parliament in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;Blair Worden, ''The Rump Parliament 1648–53'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; He summoned a new Parliament, whose members were all nominated.  Sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, it was also called the [[Barebones Parliament]]. The Parliament was based on an idea of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]]'s for a "[[sanhedrin]]" of saints. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs – which saw a sanhedrin as the precondition of Christ's rule on earth – he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of a cross-section of sects.&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Midgley, "Political thinking and the creation of the Assembly of 1653." ''The Seventeenth Century'' 31.1 (2016): 37–56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, its failure to deal with the complex political, legal and religious problems facing England soon led to its closeure.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Woolrych, ''Commonwealth to protectorate'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Protectorate: 1653–1658=====

In December 1653 Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector, with powers akin to those of a monarch. Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army, which he had built up during the civil wars, and which he subsequently prudently guarded, and during his period of dictatorship he divided England into military districts ruled by Army Major Generals who answered only to him.  The 15 major generals and deputy major generals—called "godly governors"—were central to Cromwell's moral crusade beginning in October 1655. They lasted less than a year. The generals not only supervised militia forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and insured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. They were resented by provincials. Many members of Parliament feared the generals threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which Parliament voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Durston, "The Fall of Cromwell's Major-Generals," ''English Historical Review'' (1998) 113#450: 18–37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/576177 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] broke out in 1652, against the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]], eventually won by the Royal Navy under [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Admiral Robert Blake]] in 1654.

Cromwell was aware of the contribution that Jewish financiers made to the economic success of Holland, now England's leading commercial rival.  It was this that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]], 350 years after their banishment, in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Osterman, "The Controversy over the Proposed Readmission of the Jews to England (1655)." ''Jewish Social Studies]] (1941): 301–328 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4464425 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by a re-constituted Parliament; since he had been instrumental in abolishing the monarchy he said no after long deliberation. He ruled as king in all but name, but his office was not hereditary. Instead Cromwell was to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the 1653 [[Instrument of Government]].

====Historiography====
The older [[historiography]] came in two flavours: The [[Whig history]] interpretation and the [[Marxist historiography]] interpretation. The Whig model, dominant in the 19th century, saw an inherent conflict between irresistible, truly English ideals of [[liberty]] and [[individualism]] represented by The Puritans and Roundheads, overcoming the medieval concept of the [[Divine right of kings|king as the unquestionable voice of God]]. Historians became increasingly uncomfortable with the writing of history as a [[Determinism|predetermined]] search for an [[Ideal (ethics)|idealistic goal]], and the Whig approach lost favour after the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–1918). Meanwhile, in the late 19th century, the remarkably high quality scholarship of archivally oriented historians, especially [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] and [[Charles Harding Firth]] had provided the rich details on national politics, practically on a day-by-day basis. Scholars, however, generally neglected the local dimension.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (Manchester UP, 1998) pp 65–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[post-war]] era (1945–), the [[class conflict]] of the Marxist interpretation emerged as a powerful explanation that seemed to tie all the details together. It portrayed a battle between the declining [[The Crown|Crown]] and [[upper class]] [[Feudalism|feudalistic]] [[aristocracy]], versus the rising [[middle class]] [[gentry]]. Marxists downplayed the religious dimension. On one side, influential names included [[R. H. Tawney]], [[Lawrence Stone]], and the Marxist [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. The main argument was that the Civil War was a challenge launched by the rising gentry class to overcome the power of the Crown and the aristocracy. Marxists like Hill saw the war as England's [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] revolution—that is, the overthrow of an outdated feudal order by the new middle class. The class conflict interpretation was vigorously challenged by conservative scholars, such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that the gentry was not rising but instead felt that its status was being undermined. It fought back against its exclusion from the power, [[patronage]] and payoff by an extravagant court, by the king's swelling state [[bureaucracy]] and by the [[nouveau riche]] [[Investor#Role of the financier|financiers]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Blair Worden, "History's Heroic Age" ''History Today'' (2012) 62#4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 98–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Trevor-Roper, [http://www.historytoday.com/hugh-trevor-roper/country-house-radicals-1590-1660 "Country-House Radicals 1590–1660" ''History Today'' (1953) 3#7 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist historiography itself lost much of its intellectual support after the 1960s. "[[Historical revisionism|Revisionists]]" came to the fore, rejecting both Whig and Marxist approaches because they assumed historical events were the automatic playing out of mysterious forces such as "liberty"and "class conflict."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 169–72.&lt;/ref&gt; New microscopic local studies demonstrated that the class differences between the two sides varied greatly from place to place, and did not explain very much.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 133–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Once The revisionists had dispatched the older models, the "post-revisionists" began to offer a multiplicity of small-scale explanations that fitted particular localities. Historians now give much more emphasis to [[religiosity]], and to the diversity of local situations. Instead of an argument that massive popular anger had built up in the early 17th century and caused the Civil War, the current approaches depict the early Stuart period as marked by harmony, good government, and popular support. How then could there be a civil war? The current scholarly solution is to emphasise what historians call the "British problem", involving the impossible tensions occurring when a single person tried to hold together his three kingdoms with their entirely different geographical, ethnic, political, and religious values and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Coward and Peter Gaunt, ''The Stuart Age: England, 1603–1714'' (5th ed. 2017) [https://www.amazon.com/Stuart-Age-England-1603-1714/dp/1138944173/ pp 4–5 available at Amazon].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''The debate on the English Revolution'' (1998) pp 150–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration and Charles II: 1660–1685===
{{Main|English Restoration|Charles II of England}}
Widespread dissatisfaction with the lack of the king led to the Restoration in 1660, which was based on strong support for inviting Charles II to take the throne.&lt;ref&gt;David Ogg, ''England in the Reigns of James II and William III'' (1955) pp 195–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration settlement of 1660 reestablished the monarchy, and incorporated the lessons learned in the previous half century. The first basic lesson was that the king and the parliament were both needed, for troubles cumulated when the king attempted to rule alone (1629–1640), when Parliament ruled without a king (1642–1653) or when there was a military dictator (1653–1660). The [[Tory]] perspective involved a greater respect for the king, and for the Church of England. The [[Whiggism|Whig]] perspective involved a greater respect for Parliament. The two perspectives eventually coalesced into opposing political factions throughout the 18th century. The second lesson was that the highly moralistic Puritans were too inclined to divisiveness and political extremes. The Puritans and indeed all Protestants who did not closely adhere to the Church of England, were put under political and social penalties that lasted until the early 19th century. Even more severe restrictions were imposed on Catholics and Unitarians. The third lesson was that England needed protection against organised political violence. Politicized mobs in London, or popular revolts in the rural areas, were too unpredictable and too dangerous to be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Bucholz and Key, ''Early Modern England'', pp 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''Charles the Second, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (Oxford UP, 1989) pp 133 – 214&lt;/ref&gt; The king's solution was a [[standing army]], a professional force controlled by the king. This solution became highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, ''The Machiavellian moment: Florentine political thought and the Atlantic republican tradition'' (1975) pp 406–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Restoration of 1660 was a deliberate return to the stability of the early 17th century. There was very little recrimination. King Charles acted with moderation and self-restraint, and with energy and attention to details.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp. 136, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The king reached out to everyone, finding high positions for his old friends and allies as well as places for his former enemies. By far the most important role went to [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], who was made Earl of Clarendon and [[List of Lord Chancellors and Lord Keepers|Lord Chancellor]] in 1660. He was largely in control of royal affairs, especially after his daughter [[Anne Hyde]] married the king's brother James (he became king in 1685). When the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] ended in failure in 1667, the king removed Clarendon in a severe confrontation; the earl was accused of treason and was banished to France.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp 249–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was willing to talk to every faction in England, Ireland and Scotland, even with the [[Quakers]], who were hated by practically everyone else. Charles gave out high offices in England with an eye toward favouring his longtime allies, and making sure his erstwhile enemies received at least some symbolic positions. In Scotland he included all of the important factions from the 1640s. In Ireland he retained the men currently in power.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The King and Parliament agreed on a general pardon, the [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]] (1660). It covered everyone, with the exception of three dozen [[regicide]]s who were tracked down for punishment. The terms of the settlement included giving the King a fixed annual payment of £1.2 million; Scotland and Ireland added small additional amounts. It was illegal to use dubious non-parliamentary fund-raising such as payments for knighthood, forced loans, and especially the much-hated ship money. Parliament did impose an entirely new excise tax on alcoholic beverages that raise substantial sums, as did the customs, for foreign trade was flourishing. Parliament closed down the harsh special courts that Charles had used before 1642, such as the [[Star Chamber]], [[Court of High Commission]], and the [[Council of the North]]. Parliament watched Charles' ministers closely for any signs of defiance, and was ready to use the impeachment procedure to remove offenders and even to pass bills of attainder to execute them without a trial.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his Kingdom 1660–1685'' (2003), pp 43–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious issues proved the most difficult to resolve. Charles reinstated the bishops, but also tried to reach out to the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. Catholics were entirely shut out of opportunities to practice their religion or connect to the [[Papal States]] in Rome. The Royalists won a sweeping [[English general election, 1661|election victory in 1661]]; only 60 Presbyterians survived in Parliament. Severe restrictions were now imposed on the Nonconformist Protestant bodies in England, preventing them from holding scheduled church services, and prohibiting their members from holding government offices at the national or local level. For example, The five-mile law in 1665 made it a crime for nonconformist clergymen to be within 5 miles of their old parish.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p 53&lt;/ref&gt; The Puritans still controlled the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and the [[Connecticut Colony]], but they kept a low profile during the interregnum. Charles II cancelled their charters and imposed centralised rule through the [[Dominion of New England]]. His colonial policies were reversed by William III. Most of the smaller independent religious factions faded away, except for the Quakers. The Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and Baptists remain, and were later joined by the Methodists. These non-Anglican Protestants continued as a political factor, with its leaders moving toward what became the Whig party. The country gentry continued to form the basis of support for the Church of England, and for what became the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]].&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Kenyon, ''Stuart England'' (1985) pp 195–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament was especially alarmed at the success of Cromwell's [[New Model Army]], which demonstrated that a well-organized, well-led professional army was far superior to poorly trained [[militia]] units. Cromwell had used his standing army to take full personal control, and so it was much to be feared as a threat to traditional liberties. The New Model Army was permanently disbanded, and all the soldiers received their full back pay. On the other hand, as long as enemy nations such as Spain and France, had large standing armies, England was practically defenceless on land. King and Parliament all agreed on the wisdom of a strong expanded [[Royal Navy]]. But while the king tried to build up a small standing army, Parliament kept a very close, nervous watch.&lt;ref&gt;Correlli Barnett, ''Britain and her army, 1509–1970: a military, political and social survey'' (1970) pp 90–98, 110–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puritanism was entirely out of fashion, as the royal court introduced a level of [[hedonism]] that far exceeded anything England had ever seen. Harris says, "At the center of this world was a [[libertine]] court – a society of Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]] given more to drinking, gambling, swearing and whoring than to godliness – presided over by the King himself and his equally rakish brother James, Duke of York." &lt;ref&gt;Harris, p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

====Standing army====
{{Further|History of the British Army#Origins}}
England never had a [[standing army]] with professional officers and careerist corporals and sergeants. It relied on militia organised by local officials, private forces mobilised by the nobility, or on hired mercenaries from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 24–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell changed all that with his New Model Army of 50,000 men, that proved vastly more effective than untrained militia, and enabled him to exert a powerful control at the local level over all of England. At the restoration, Parliament paid off Cromwell's army and disbanded it. For many decades the Cromwellian model was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H. Firth ed. 1913) 1:136-38&lt;/ref&gt; The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so. However, King Charles managed to pull together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of £122.000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent [[British Army]], By 1685 it had grown to 7500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1400 men permanently stationed in garrisons. A rebellion in 1685 allowed James II to raise the forces to 20,000 men. There were 37,000 in 1678, when England played a role in the closing stage of the [[Franco-Dutch War]]. In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000 soldiers, and then to 94,000 in 1694. Parliament became very nervous, and reduced the cadre to 7,000 in 1697. Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were unofficially merged with the English force.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 46–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689===
{{main|Glorious Revolution}}
The British have always regarded the overthrow of King [[James II of England]] in 1688 as a decisive break in history, especially as it made the Parliament of England supreme over the King and guaranteed a bill of legal rights to everyone. [[Steven Pincus]] argues that this revolution was the first modern revolution; it was violent, popular, and divisive. He rejects older theories to the effect that it was an aristocratic coup or a Dutch invasion. Instead, Pincus argues it was a widely supported and decisive rejection of James II. The people could not tolerate James any longer. He was too close to the French throne; he was too Roman Catholic; and they distrusted his [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] modernisation of the state. What they got instead was the vision of William of Orange, shared by most leading Englishmen, that emphasised consent of all the elites, religious toleration of all Protestant sects, free debate in Parliament and aggressive promotion of commerce. Pincus sees a dramatic transformation that reshaped religion, political economy, foreign policy and even the nature of the English state.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pincus, ''1688: The First Modern Revolution'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. A. Pincus, ''England's Glorious Revolution 1688–1689: A Brief History with Documents'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===William and Mary: 1688–1702===
{{Main|William III of England|Mary II of England}}
During the joint rule of William and Mary, William made the decisions when he was in Britain; Mary was in charge when he was out of the country and also handled Church affairs. William encouraged the passage of major laws that protected personal liberties.&lt;ref&gt;E.N. Williams, ed., ''The Eighteenth-century Constitution 1688–1815'' (1960) pp 1–66.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Toleration Act 1689]], which guaranteed [[religious toleration]] to Protestant [[nonconformist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;David Ogg, ''England in the Reigns of James II and William III'' (1955) pp 231–33.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the [[religious liberty]] of Roman Catholics, [[Nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarians]], and those of non-Christian faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Wout Troost, ''William III, The Stadholder-king: A Political Biography'' (2005) p 219.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1689, one of the fundamental constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed. The Act restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]], and established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]]. It provided that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the [[right to petition]], raise a [[standing army]] during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the [[right to bear arms]] to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require [[excessive bail]] or inflict [[cruel and unusual punishments]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, ''England in the Reigns of James II and William III'' (1955) pp 241–45.&lt;/ref&gt; William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, ''William III'' pp 212–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A land of liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000), pp 13–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policy====
{{Further|Nine Years' War|William III of England}}
[[File:Europe c. 1700.png|thumb|right|300px|Europe in 1700; England and Ireland are in red.]]

The primary reason the English elite called on  [[William III of England|William]] to invade England in 1688 was to overthrow the king James II, and stop his efforts to reestablish Catholicism and tolerate Puritanism. However the primary reason William accepted the challenge was to gain a powerful ally in his war to contain the threatened expansion of King [[Louis XIV of France]]. William's goal was to build coalitions against the powerful French monarchy, protect the autonomy of the Netherlands (where William continued in power) and to keep the Spanish Netherlands (present-date Belgium) out of French hands. The English elite was intensely [[anti-French]], and generally supported William's broad goals.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956)  pp 148–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Roberts et al., ''A History of England: volume I Prehistory to 1714'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 245–48.&lt;/ref&gt; For his entire career in Netherlands and Britain, William was the arch-enemy of Louis XIV. The French king, and the, denounced William  as a usurper who had illegally taken the throne from the legitimate king [[James II of England|James II]] and ought to be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Thomson, "Louis XIV and William III, 1689–1697." ''English Historical Review'' 76.298 (1961): 37–58. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/557057 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1689, William, now king of England, with the support of Parliament, declared war on France. England and France would be at war almost continuously until 1713, with a short interlude 1697–1701 made possible by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (1956)  pp 160–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The combined English and Dutch fleets could overpower France in a far-flung naval war, but France still had superiority on land. William wanted to neutralise that advantage by allying with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], the Habsburg Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1658–1705), who was based in Vienna, Austria. Leopold, however, was tied down in [[Great Turkish War|war with the Ottoman Empire]] on his eastern frontiers; William worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the Ottomans and the Empire. William displayed in imaginative Europe-wide strategy, but Louis always managed to come up with a counter play.&lt;ref&gt;For the European context, see J.S. Bromley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688–1725'' (1970) pp 154–192, 223–67, 284–90, 381–415, 741–54.&lt;/ref&gt; William was usually supported by the English leadership, which saw France as its greatest enemy. But eventually the  expenses, and war weariness, but the second thoughts.  At first, Parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars, and for his subsidies to smaller allies. Private investors created the  [[Bank of England]] in 1694; it provided a sound system that made financing wars much easier by encouraging bankers to loan money.&lt;ref&gt;John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: War, money, and the English state, 1688–1783'' (1989) p 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (1956)  pp 174–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the long-running [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–97) his main strategy was to form a military alliance of England, the Netherlands, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and some smaller states, to attack France at sea, and from land in different directions, while defending the Netherlands.  Louis XIV tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognise William as king of England, and by giving diplomatic, military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the English throne, all based in France.Williams focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars, spending a great deal of time in the Netherlands (where he continued to hold the dominant political office).  His closest foreign-policy advisers were Dutch, most notably [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]]; they shared little information with their English counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;David Onnekink, "'Mynheer Benting now rules over us': the 1st Earl of Portland and the Re-emergence of the English Favourite, 1689–99." ''English Historical Review'' 121.492 (2006): 693–713. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3806356 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The net result was that the Netherlands remained independent, and France never took control of the Spanish Netherlands. The wars were very expensive to both sides but inconclusive.  William died just as the continuation war, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], (1702–1714), was beginning. It was fought out by Queen Anne, and ended in a draw.&lt;ref&gt;For summaries of foreign policy see J.R. Jones, ''Country and Court: England, 1658–1714'' (1979), pp 279–90; Geoffrey Holmes, ''The Making of a Great Power: Late Stuart and Early Georgian Britain, 1660–1722'' (1993), pp 243–50, 434–39; Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2002), pp 89–166; and for greater detail, Stephen B. Baxter. ''William III and the Defense of European Liberty, 1650–1702'' (1966), pp 288–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy of William III====
Historian [[Stephen B. Baxter]] is a leading specialist on  William III, and like nearly all his biographers he has a highly favourable opinion of the king:
:William III was the Deliverer of England from the tyranny and arbitrary government of the Stuarts....He repaired and improved an obsolete system of government, and left it strong enough to withstand the stresses of the next century virtually unchanged.  The army of Marlborough, and that of Wellington, and to a large extent that of Raglan, was the creation of William III. So too was the independence of the judiciary..... [His government] was very expensive; at their peak the annual expenditures of William III were four times as large as those of James II. This new scale of government was bitterly unpopular.  But the new taxes, which were not in fact heavy by comparison with those borne by the Dutch, made England a great power.  And they contributed to the prosperity of the country while they contributed to its strength, by the process which is now called 'pump-priming.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen B.

===Queen Anne: 1702–1714===
{{Main|Anne, Queen of Great Britain}}
[[File:Queen Anne of Great Britain.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Anne by [[Charles Jervas]]]]
Anne became queen in 1702 at age 37, succeeding William III whom she hated.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts 1660–1714.'' (2nd ed. 1955) pp 200–262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Coward and Peter Gaunt, ''The Stuart Age'' (5th ed. 2017) ch 13.&lt;/ref&gt; For practically her entire reign, the central issue was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in which Britain played a major role in the European-wide alliance against [[Louis XIV of France]]. Down until 1710, the Parliament was dominated by the "[[Whig Junto]]" coalition. She disliked them and relied instead on her old friends [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] (and his wife [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]]), and chief minister [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (1702–1710).&lt;ref&gt;Coward and Gaunt, ''The Stuart Age'' pp 439–45.&lt;/ref&gt; She made Marlborough captain-general and head of the army; his brilliant victories boded well for Britain at first. But the war dragged on into an expensive stalemate. The opposition Tories had opposed the war all along, and now won a major electoral victory in 1710. Anne reacted by dismissing Marlborough and Godolphin and turning to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]]. She had 12 miscarriages and 6 babies, but only one survived and he died at age 11, so her death ended the Stuart period. Anne's intimate friendship with Sarah Churchill turned sour in 1707 as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs as ignorant and easily led, which was a theme widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gregg, ''Queen Anne'' (Yale UP, 2001) pp viii–ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gregg, "Anne (1665–1714)," ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford UP, 2004; online edn, Jan 2012) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/560, accessed 29 Aug 2017] doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/560&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne took a lively interest in affairs of state, and was a noted patroness of theatre, poetry and music. She subsidised [[George Frideric Handel]] with £200 a year.&lt;ref&gt;James Anderson Winn, ''Queen Anne: Patroness of Arts'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; She began the practice of awarding high-quality gold medals as rewards for outstanding political or military achievements. They were produced at the Mint by [[Isaac Newton]] and engraver [[John Croker (engraver)|John Croker]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hone, "Isaac Newton and the Medals for Queen Anne." ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 79#1 (2016): 119–148. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/612988 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Union with Scotland in 1707====
Scotland and England were entirely separate countries, having the same ruler since 1603. Queen Anne, ruling both countries, worked to bring them together in the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. Public opinion in Scotland was generally hostile, but elite opinion was supportive, especially after the English provided generous financial terms and timely bribes. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] agreed to the terms and disbanded. The new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] was in practice simply the old [[Parliament of England]] augmented by 45 Scots elected to Commons; it selected 16 Scottish peers for the House of Lords. Scotland was much smaller in terms of population and wealth. Its colonial venture in the [[Darien scheme]] had been a major financial and humanitarian disaster. The Acts of Union refunded the losses of the Scottish investors in Darien. In basic terms, Scotland retained its own Presbyterian established church, and its own legal and educational systems, as well it's its own separate nobility. The Scots now paid English taxes, although in reduced rates, and had a voice in the affairs of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;T.M. Devine, ''The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700–2000'' (1999) pp 1–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karin Bowie, ''Scottish Public Opinion and the Anglo-Scottish Union, 1699–1707'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term economic benefits took a couple of generations to be realised, and long-standing distrust continued for generations. The risk of war between the two was greatly diminished, although [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] raids launched from the north hit England for another forty years. The new Britain used its power to undermine the [[Scottish clan|clanship system]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]] &lt;ref&gt;Devine, ''The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700–2000'' (1999) pp 31–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambitious Scots now had major career opportunities in the fast-growing overseas [[Crown colony|British colonies]], and in the rapidly growing industrial and financial communities of England. Scotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining "freedom of trade with England and the colonies" as well as "a great expansion of markets." Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was:
:of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations&amp;nbsp;... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;G.N. Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) pp 290–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] made their tour in 1773, recorded in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'', Johnson noted that Scotland was "a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing" and in particular that [[Glasgow]] had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Brown|title=My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRz1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|year=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and economic history==

===Population===
The total population of England grew steadily in the 17th century, from 1600 to about 1660, then declined slightly and stagnated between 1649 and 1714. The population was about 4.2&amp;nbsp;million in 1603, 5.2&amp;nbsp;million in 1649, 5.1&amp;nbsp;million in 1660, 4.9&amp;nbsp;million in 1688, and 5.3&amp;nbsp;million in 1714.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Wrigley and R.S. Schofield, ''The population history of England 1541–1871'' (1981) p 528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Sharpe, ''Early modern England: a social history 1550–1760'' (1997) pp 36–42.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1714 the [[Greater London]] area held about 674,000 people, or one in nine of England's population. The next cities in size were [[Norwich]] and [[Bristol]] (with a population of about 30,000 each). About 90% of the people lived in rural areas in 1500, compared to 80% of a much larger population in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;John Clapham, ''A concise economic history of Britain: From the earliest Times to 1750'' (1949), pp 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witchcraft and magic===
Historians have recently placed stress on how people at the time dealt with the supernatural, not just in formal religious practice and theology, but in everyday life through [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]]. The [[Witch-hunt|persecution of witches]] began in England in 1563, and hundreds were executed. England was spared the frenzy on [[Continental Europe]]; with over 5% of Europe's population in 1600, England executed only 1% of the 40,000 witches killed in the period 1400–1800.&lt;ref&gt;William Monter, "Re-contextualizing British witchcraft." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 35.1 (2004): 105–111. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3656417 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The government made witchcraft a capital crime under Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1563. King James VI and I made the suppression of witchcraft a high priority in both Scotland, and (in 1604) in England. Judges across England sharply increased their investigation of accused 'witches', thus generating a body of highly detailed local documentation that has provided the main basis for recent historical research on the topic.  Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996) pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft was endemic year in and year out, rather than happening in epidemic outbursts. Older women were the favourite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Peter Homer has emphasised the political basis of the witchcraft issue in the 17th century, with the Puritans taking the lead in rooting out the [[Devil]]'s work in their attempt to [[Paganism|depaganise]] England and build a godly community. As the process of psychological modernisation reached more and more people, fears of witchcraft and magic tended to steadily diminish. After 1660 Puritans were largely excluded from the judiciary and lost their power to investigate. In 1712, [[Jane Wenham (alleged witch)|Jane Wenham]] was the last woman found guilty of witchcraft in England. In 1735 Parliament no longer believed that witchcraft was real—despite the efforts of [[James Erskine, Lord Grange]], the Scottish Lord who made a fool of himself speaking in opposition. Parliament passed the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]] which made it a crime to accuse someone of witchcraft. The laws against witchcraft were not fully repealed until 1951 with the passing of the [[Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Elmer, ''Witchcraft, Witch-Hunting, and Politics in Early Modern England'' (2016) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Witchcraft was a minor issue of little importance in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sneddon, "Witchcraft belief and trials in early modern Ireland." ''Irish Economic and Social History'' 39.1 (2012): 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scotland was a major centre of suppression; 3900 Scots were tried; two thirds were convicted and executed, the last of whom was [[Janet Horne]] in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;Brian P. Levack, ''Witch-hunting in Scotland: Law, Politics and Religion'' (2007) pp 1–2. [http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/E1748538X0900034X?journalCode=jshs online review]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
There was no free schooling for ordinary children, but in the towns and cities small local private schools were opened for the benefit of the boys of the middle classes, and a few were opened for girls. The rich and the nobility relied on private tutors. Private schools were starting to open for young men of the upper classes, and universities operated in Scotland and England. The [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] provided some education for prospective Anglican ministers, but otherwise had academic standards well below their counterparts in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Lawson|author2=Harold Silver|title=A Social History of Education in England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZJFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=116, 154–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Broadie, ed. ''The Scottish Enlightenment'' (1999) pp 10–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have looked at local documents to see how many men and women used their signature and how many used X's. Literacy rates were very low before 1500, but grew steadily in the next three centuries, with men twice as likely to be literate as comparable women. In 1500, literacy rates for women were 1%; by 1560 they had reached 5%; by 1640 about 10%; by 1710 about 25% (versus 50% for men). Two forces were at work: Protestant religion called for the ability to read the [[Bible]], and changing social and economic conditions. For example, towns grew rapidly, providing jobs in retailing in which literacy was a distinct advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Jackie Eales, "To booke and pen: Women, education and literacy in Tudor and Stuart England." ''Historian'' 119 (2013): 24:24–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Gardiner, ''English Girlhood at School: A Study of Women's Education through twelve centuries'' (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
{{Further|Restoration comedy|English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries}}
[[Image:Love in a Tub.png|thumb|Refinement meets burlesque in Restoration comedy. In this scene from [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'', musicians and well-bred ladies surround a man who is wearing a tub because he has lost his trousers.]]
When the [[Puritans]] fell out of power, Britain began to enjoy itself again.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, "Popular culture in seventeenth-century London." ''The London Journal'' 3.2 (1977): 143–162. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1179/ldn.1977.3.2.143 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The theatres returned, and played a major role in high society in London, where they were patronised by royalty. Historian George Clark argues:
:The best-known fact about the Restoration drama is that it is immoral. The dramatists did not criticise the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper&amp;nbsp;... The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (1956) p 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Lloyd's coffee house drawing.jpg|thumb|left|A later imaginative drawing of Lloyd's Coffee House]]
The first coffee houses appeared in the mid-1650s and quickly became established in every city in many small towns. They exemplified the emerging standards of middle-class masculine civility and politeness.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence E. Klein, "Coffeehouse Civility, 1660–1714: An Aspect of Post-Courtly Culture in England" ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 59#1 (1996), pp. 30– 51. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3817904 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown London boasted about 600 by 1708. Admission was a penny for as long as a customer wanted. The customers could buy coffee, and perhaps tea and chocolate, as well as sandwiches and knickknacks. Recent newspapers and magazines could be perused by middle-class men with leisure time on their hands. Widows were often the proprietors. The coffeehouses were quiet escapes, suitable for conversation, and free of noise, disorder, shouting and fighting in drinking places. The working class could more usually be found drinking in pubs, or playing dice in the alleyways.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Cowan, "What Was Masculine about the Public Sphere? Gender and the Coffeehouse Milieu in Post-Restoration England." ''History Workshop Journal.'' No. 51: 127–157. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4289724 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businessmen conducted their affairs there, and some even kept scheduled hours. Historian Mark Pendergast observes:
: Each coffeehouse specialised in a different type of clientele. In one, physicians could be consulted. Others served Protestants, Puritans, Catholics, Jews, literati, merchants, traders, fops, Whigs, Tories, army officers, actors, lawyers, clergy, or wits. The coffeehouses provided England's first egalitarian meeting place, where a man was expected to chat with his tablemates whether he knew them or not.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Pendergrast, ''Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World'' (1999) p 13 [https://www.questia.com/library/99868846/uncommon-grounds-the-history-of-coffee-and-how-it online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lloyd's Coffee House]] opened in 1686 and specialised in providing shipping news for a clientele of merchants, insurers, and shipowners. In a few years it moved to a private business office that eventually became the famous insurance exchange [[Lloyd's of London]]. By the 1790s private clubs had become more popular and the penny coffee houses largely closed down.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Suter, "The Rise and Fall of English Coffee Houses," ''Contemporary Review'' (Feb. 2005) 286#1669 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-130276491/the-rise-and-fall-of-english-coffee-houses online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===High culture===

In science, the [[Royal Society]] was formed in 1660; it sponsored and legitimised a renaissance of major discoveries, led most notably by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Robert Hooke]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hunter, ''Science and society in Restoration England'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Banqueting House London.jpg|thumb|right|The Banqueting House, Whitehall]]
Out in the countryside, numerous architects built country houses – the more magnificent the better, for the nobility and the wealthier gentry. [[Inigo Jones]] is the most famous. In London, Jones built the magnificent [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]] in 1622.  Numerous architects worked on the decorative arts, designing intricate wainscoted rooms, dramatic staircases, lush carpets, furniture, and clocks that are still be seen in country houses open to tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Ford, ed., ''The Cambridge Cultural History of Britain: Volume 4, Seventeenth Century Britain'' (1992), pp 52–103, 276–307.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|St Paul's Cathedral by Christopher Wren]]
The [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 created the urgent necessity to rebuild many important buildings and stately houses. Sir [[Christopher Wren]] was in charge of the rebuilding damaged churches. More than [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|50 City churches]] are attributable to Wren.  His greatest achievement was [[St Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth McKellar|title=The Birth of Modern London: The Development and Design of the City 1660–1720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knRh5EOwaOEC&amp;pg=PA8|year=1999|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localism and transport===
Historians have always emphasised the localism in rural England, with readers gaining the impression that the little villages were self-contained communities.  However, Charles Phythian-Adams has used local evidence to paint a much more complex picture.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Phythian-Adams, ''Societies, Cultures and Kinship, 1580–1850: Cultural Provinces and English Local History'' (Leicester, 1996), pp. 9–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the location of brides and grooms, the sources of financial credit, and patterns of migration indicate that each village was embedded in a network of villages and transportation routes. People could relocate from one village to another inside these networks without feeling like they were strangers. The network would include for example one or more market towns, county centres, or small cities. Roads existed and were supplemented by turnpikes. However the chief means of transportation was typically by water, since it was much cheaper to move wagon loads of commodities, especially wool and cloth, by boat than over land.  Much effort was made to improve the river system, by removing obstacles. A mania to build canals, 1790–1840, enlarged the range and lowered costs. After 1840, the coming of railroads enlarged the range of local networks so much that the localism was overwhelmed&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos and D.H. Aldcroft, ''British transport: an economic survey from the seventeenth century to the twentieth'' (1969)  pp 19–44, 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World trade===
The 18th century was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:  
:we are the most "diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

As an island there was little incentive for gaining new territory. In the Tudor and Stuart periods the main foreign policy goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion) was the building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  Wool was the great commercial product. Home production of wool supplied internal needs, while raw wool and wool cloth made up 75–90% of exports.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowden, ''The Wool Trade in Tudor and Stuart England'' (1962) [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-349-81676-7 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Trade was extensive with France, the Low Countries, and the Baltic. The [[Hanseatic League]] of German trading cities had once controlled 40% of the English trade, but it rapidly lost that role after 1500 and was expelled from England in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Coleman, ''The economy of England, 1450–1750'' (1977), pp 48–55, 130–45.&lt;/ref&gt;    The English colonies in the West Indies provided sugar, most of which was re-exported to the Continent. The [[13 American colonies]] provided land for migrants, masts for the navy,  food for the West Indies slaves, and tobacco for the home and the re-export trades. The British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports were stable at £2.5 million from 1613 to 1669, then soared £6.5 million in 1700, to £14.7 million in 1760 and £43.2 million in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1931) p 188-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government supported the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region.&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business History Review'' 62#3 (1988): 398–419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115542 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia. Other prominent enterprises included he [[East India Company]] (1599), and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (1670) in Canada. The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasised trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wool trade====
Woolen cloth was the chief export and most important employer after agriculture. The golden era of the Wiltshire woolen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woolens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.&lt;ref&gt;G.D. Ramsay, ''The English woollen industry, 1500–1750'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England: vol 2: The age of mercantilism'' (7th 1964) pp 10–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowden, ''Wool Trade in Tudor and Stuart England'' (1962) [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-349-81676-7#toc online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Government intervention proved a disaster in the early 17th century. A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]]. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England. Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back. However, the trade losses became permanent.&lt;ref&gt;C.G.A. Clay, ''Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500–1700: Volume 2, Industry, Trade and Government'' (1984)  pp 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign policy==
Stuart England was primarily consumed with internal affairs. [[James VI and I|King James I]] (reigned 1603–25) was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, but for Europe as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lockyer, ''James VI and I'' (1998) pp 138–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked Puritans and Jesuits alike, because of their eagerness for warfare. He called himself "Rex Pacificus" ("King of peace.")&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Smuts, "The making of ''Rex Pacificus'': James VI and I and the Problem of Peace in an Age of Religious War," in Daniel Fischlin and Mark Fortier, eds., ''Royal Subjects: Essays on the Writings of James VI and I'' (2002) pp 371–87&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Europe was deeply polarised, and on the verge of the massive [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires. On assuming the throne, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his son to the Spanish Infanta (princess) [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]] in the "[[Spanish Match]]". The marriage of James' daughter Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] on 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple's union had important political and military implications. Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the [[Protestant Union]], headquartered in [[Heidelberg]], the capital of the [[Electoral Palatinate]]. King James calculated that his daughter's marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants. He thus planned to have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements. In his naïveté, he did not realise that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving the destruction of the other side. Spain's ambassador [[Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, 1st Count of Gondomar]] knew how to manipulate the king. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], the [[Vienna]]-based leader of the Habsburgs and head of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], were both heavily influenced by the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]]. They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Patterson, "King James I and the Protestant cause in the crisis of 1618–22." ''Studies in Church History'' 18 (1982): 319–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Buckingham in the 1620s wanted an alliance with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey Davies, ''The Early Stuarts: 1603–1660'' (1959), pp 47–67&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the Infanta in 1623. However, Spain's terms were that James must drop Britain's anti-Catholic intolerance or there would be no marriage. Buckingham and Charles were humiliated and Buckingham became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain. Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to provide them with military support for their cause. James' son-in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, an event which outraged Vienna. The Thirty Years' War began, as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], and massacred their followers. The Catholic [[Duchy of Bavaria]] then invaded the [[Electoral Palatinate]], and James's son-in-law begged for James's military intervention. James finally realised that his policies had backfired and refused these pleas. He successfully kept Britain out of the European-wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades. James's backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry. Parliament and the British people were strongly opposed to any Catholic marriage, were demanding immediate war with Spain, and strongly favoured the Protestant cause in Europe. James had alienated both elite and popular opinion in Britain, and Parliament was cutting back its financing. Historians credit James for pulling back from a major war at the last minute, and keeping Britain in peace.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Scott, ''England's Troubles: 17th-century English Political Instability in European Context'' (Cambridge UP, 2000), pp 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick's election as King of Bohemia in 1619 deepened the [[Thirty Years' War]]—a conflagration that destroyed millions of lives in central Europe, but only barely touched Britain. The intense hatred and rivalry of Catholic versus Protestant princes was the main cause. King James' determination to avoid involvement in the continental conflict, even during the "war fever" of 1623, was one of the most significant, and most positive, aspects of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;G.M.D. Howat, '' Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy'' (1974) pp 17–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1600–1650 the kings made repeated efforts to colonise [[The Guianas|Guiana]] in [[South America]]. They all failed and the lands ([[Suriname]]) were ceded to the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1667.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Lorimer, "The failure of the English Guiana ventures 1595–1667 and James I's foreign policy." ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 21#.1 (1993): 1–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Loomie, ''Spain &amp; the Early Stuarts, 1585–1655'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglo-Dutch Wars===
The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] were a series of three wars which took place between the English and the Dutch from 1652 to 1674. The causes included political disputes and increasing competition from merchant shipping. Religion was not a factor, since both sides were Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. A. Pincus, ''Protestantism and Patriotism: Ideologies and the Making of English Foreign Policy, 1650–1668'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The British in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] (1652–54) had the naval advantage with larger numbers of more powerful "[[Ship of the line|ships of the line]]" which were well suited to the naval tactics of the era. The British also captured numerous Dutch merchant ships. In the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] (1665–67) Dutch naval victories followed. This second war cost London ten times more than it had planned on, and the king sued for peace in 1667 with the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]]. It ended the fights over "[[mercantilism]]" (that is, the use of force to protect and expand national trade, industry, and shipping.) Meanwhile, the French were building up fleets that threatened both the Netherlands and Great Britain. In the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] (1672–74), the British counted on a new alliance with France but the outnumbered Dutch outsailed both of them, and King Charles II ran short of money and political support. The Dutch gained domination of sea trading routes until 1713. The British gained the thriving colony of [[New Netherland]], which was renamed as the [[Province of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;James Rees Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch wars of the seventeenth century'' (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0582056306 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gijs Rommelse, "The role of mercantilism in Anglo‐Dutch political relations, 1650–74." ''Economic History Review'' 63#3 (2010): 591–611.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
The Stuart period began in 1603 with the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and the accession of King James I. There was a break in the middle but the Stuarts were restored to the throne in 1660. It ended in 1714 (after 111 years) with the death of Queen Anne and the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], the first king of the [[House of Hanover]]. The yellow bars show Stuart rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2121">The '''Suwannee point''' is a large unfluted [[lanceolate]] [[Paleo-Indians]] [[projectile point]] that features a recurvate profile with a slightly narrowed waist and a convex base. The point is one of the earliest forms of lanceolate types and is dated between 10500–9500 [[Before Present]].&lt;ref name=Hranicky2011 /&gt; It represents a typical example of the Middle Paleoindian subperiod.&lt;ref name=Ward1999 /&gt; Experts are divided over whether the type predates or postdates the [[Clovis point]] but have noted that the two share similarities in their construction.&lt;ref name=Webb2006 /&gt; Suwanee specimens are generally unfluted, which distinguishes them from the generally fluted Clovis. However, a few rare examples of fluted Suwanee have also been discovered.&lt;ref name=Webb2006 /&gt; The largest concentration of Suwanee points appear in Florida, where the classification was first named in 1968 by Ripley P. Bullen for [[Suwannee County]].&lt;ref name=Webb2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hranicky2011 /&gt;

'''Winchester''' is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and the [[county town]] of [[Hampshire]], England. The city lies at the heart of the wider [[City of Winchester]], a local government district, and is located at the western end of the [[South Downs]] National Park, along the course of the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]].&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;{{Cite book | title= Landranger 185: Winchester &amp; Basingstoke | publisher= [[Ordnance Survey]] | scale= 1:50,000 | year= 2005 | isbn=978-0-319-22884-5 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated {{convert|61|mi|km}} south-west of [[London]] and {{convert|13.6|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]], its closest city. At the time of the 2011 Census, Winchester had a population of 45,184.

Winchester developed from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of [[Venta Belgarum]], which in turn developed from an [[Iron Age]] [[oppidum]]. Winchester's major landmark is [[Winchester Cathedral]], one of the largest cathedrals in Europe, with the distinction of having the longest nave and overall length of all [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals in Europe. The city is home to the [[University of Winchester]] and [[Winchester College]], the oldest public school in the United Kingdom still using its original buildings.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==History==

===Prehistory===
The area around Winchester has been inhabited since [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric times]], with three [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[British hillforts|hillforts]], [[Oram's Arbour]], [[St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire|St. Catherine's Hill]], and Worthy Down all in the nearby vicinity. In the [[Late Iron Age]], a more urban settlement type developed, known as an [[oppidum]], although the archaeology of this phase remains obscure. It was overrun by the confederation of [[Gauls|Gaulish]] [[list of Celtic tribes|tribes]] known as the [[Belgae]] sometime during the first century BCE. It seems to have been known as '''Wentā''' or '''Venta''', derived from the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] for "town" or "meeting place",&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko. [http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/lemma.html?id=17429 "wentā" in the ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'' at ''Indo-European Etymological Dictionaries Online''. Brill Online, 2014. Accessed 24 July 2014.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the word for "white" ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwyn''), due to Winchester's situation upon chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Long |first1=Henry Lawes |title=Observations Upon Certain Roman Roads and Towns in the South of Britain |date=1836 |publisher=Nichols and sons |location=Oxford University |isbn=978-1354701065 |page=26 |accessdate=17 October 2018|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iGUGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dqs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
{{Main article|Venta Belgarum}}
After the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], the settlement served as the capital ({{lang-la|civitas}}) of the Belgae and was distinguished as '''Venta Belgarum''', "Venta of the Belgae". Although in the early years of the Roman province it was of subsidiary importance to [[Silchester Roman Town|Silchester]] and [[Noviomagus Reginorum|Chichester]], Venta eclipsed them both by the latter half of the second century.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe B. ''Wessex to AD 1000'' 1997&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the third century, Winchester was given protective stone walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/DestinationsUK/Winchester.htm |title=Winchester |publisher=Historic-uk.com |date= |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time the city covered an area of {{convert|144|acres}}, making it among the largest towns in Roman Britain by surface area.&lt;ref name="Roman towns"&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Roman Settlements|url=http://www.british-towns.net/maps/roman-roads-map |publisher=British towns|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a limited suburban area outside the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PJO archaeology|url=http://www.pjoarchaeology.co.uk/academic-consultancy/report-winchester-roman-cemeteries-and-suburbs.html|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other Roman towns however, Winchester began to decline in the later fourth century.&lt;ref name="Roman towns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/winchester.html |title=A History of Winchester |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Winchester-alfred-wyrdlight.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Alfred the Great]] by [[Hamo Thornycroft]] in Winchester]]

===Medieval period===
Following the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in 410, urban life seems to have continued at Venta Belgarum until around 450 AD, and a small administrative centre might have continued after that on the site of the later Anglo-Saxon palace. [[David Nash Ford|Ford]] identifies the community as the {{nowrap|'''Cair Guinntguic'''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}). [[Theodor Mommsen]] ({{abbr|ed.|Editor}}). [[s:la:Historia Brittonum#VI. CIVITATES BRITANNIAE|''Historia Brittonum'', VI.]] Composed after {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;830. {{la icon}} Hosted at [[s:la:Main Page|Latin Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[Caer|Fort]] Venta") listed by [[Nennius]] among the 28 cities of [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] in his ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britons]]''.&lt;ref name=nashford&gt;Ford, David Nash. "[http://www.britannia.com/history/ebk/articles/nenniuscities.html The 28 Cities of Britain]" at Britannia. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the [[Saxon invasions of Britain]], cemeteries dating to the 6th and 7th centuries suggest a revival of settlement.

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - Wintan ceastre (British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A VI, folio 12r).jpg|thumb|left|A mention of Wintan-ceastre in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'']]
The city became known as '''Wintan-ceastre''' ("Fort Venta") in [[Old English]].&lt;ref name="Anglo-Saxon Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title='Wintan-ceaster'|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/035936|website=Anglo Saxon Dictionary|publisher=Bosworth-Toller|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 648, [[King Cenwalh of Wessex|King Cenwalh]] of [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] erected the Church of SS Peter and Paul, later known as the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]]. This became a cathedral in the 660s when the West Saxon bishopric was transferred from [[Dorchester-on-Thames]]. The present form of the city dates to reconstruction in the late 9th century, when king [[Alfred the Great]] obliterated the Roman street plan in favour of a new grid in order to provide better defence against the [[Viking invasions of Britain|Vikings]]. The city's first mint appears to date from this period.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England|year=2014|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-22492-1|title=Winchester|first=John|last=Crook|editors=Lapidge, Michael et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] was a leading figure in the monastic reform movement of the later tenth century. He expelled the secular canons of both minsters and replaced them with monks. He created the drainage system, the 'Lockburn', which served as the town drain until 1875, and still survives. Also in the late tenth century, the Old Minster was enlarged as a centre of the cult of the ninth century [[Bishop of Winchester]], Saint [[Swithun]]. The three minsters were the home of what architectural historian John Crook describes as "the supreme artistic achievements" of the ''Winchester School''.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt;

[[File:The Buttercross in Winchester.jpg|thumb|left|The Winchester [[Buttercross]] ]]
There was a fire in the city in 1141 during the [[Rout of Winchester]]. [[William of Wykeham]] played a role in the city's restoration. As [[Bishop of Winchester]] he was responsible for much of the current structure of the cathedral, and he founded the still extant public school [[Winchester College]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the city was an important centre of the wool trade, before going into a slow decline.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The [[curfew bell]] in the bell tower (near the clock in the picture), still sounds at 8:00 pm each evening.

While Jews lived in Winchester from at least 1148, in the 13th century the Jewish community in the city was one of the most important in England. There was an [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1727-archa archa] in the city, and the Jewish quarter was located in the city's heart (present day Jewry street). There were a series of [[blood libel]] claims levied against the Jewish community in the 1220s and 1230s, which likely was the cause of the hanging of the community's leader, Abraham Pinch, in front of the synagogue that he was head of. [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] ransacked the Jewish quarter in 1264, and in 1290 all Jews were [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] from England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Winchester |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/winchester |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
The City Cross (also known as the [[Buttercross]]) has been dated to the 15th century, and features 12 statues of the [[Virgin Mary]], saints and various historical figures. Several statues appear to have been added throughout the structure's history. In 1770, [[Thomas Dummer]] purchased the Buttercross from the Corporation of Winchester, intending to have it re-erected at [[Cranbury Park]], near [[Otterbourne]]. When his workmen arrived to dismantle the cross, they were prevented from doing so by the people of the city, who "organised a small riot"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Buttercross, Winchester |url=http://www.cityofwinchester.co.uk/history/html/buttercross.html |year= 1998| publisher= City of Winchester |accessdate= 23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were forced to abandon their task. The agreement with the city was cancelled and Dummer erected a [[lath and plaster]] facsimile, which stood in the park for about sixty years before it was destroyed by the weather.&lt;ref name = "Yonge8"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yonge |first=Charlotte M. |title= Chapter 8: Old Otterbourne |url= http://www.online-literature.com/charlotte-yonge/john-keble/8/ |year= 1898|work= [[John Keble]]'s Parishes |publisher= Online literature |accessdate=23 September 2009 |authorlink = Charlotte M.

It is now a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= City Cross or 'Butter Cross', Winchester |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1002938 | publisher= [[Historic England]] |accessdate= 16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three notable bronze sculptures can be seen in or from the High Street by major sculptors of the 19th and 20th Centuries, the earliest a monumental statue of [[Queen Victoria]], now in the [[Great Hall]], by [[Sir Alfred Gilbert]] (also known as the sculptor of '[[Eros]]' in London's Piccadilly Circus), [[King Alfred]], facing the city with raised sword from the centre of The Broadway, by [[Hamo Thornycroft]] and the modern striking ''[[Horse and Rider (Frink)|Horse and Rider]]'' by [[Dame Elizabeth Frink]] at the entrance to the Law Courts.

The novelist [[Jane Austen]] died in Winchester on 18 July 1817 and is buried in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Austen 'died from arsenic poisoning'|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/14/jane-austen-arsenic-poisoning |accessdate=18 June 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While staying in Winchester from mid-August to October 1819, the Romantic poet [[John Keats]] wrote "Isabella", "St. Agnes' Eve", "[[To Autumn]]", "Lamia" and parts of "Hyperion" and the five-act poetic tragedy "Otho The Great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= John Keats – autumnal idealist or trenchant social commentator? | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/23/john-keats-autumnal-idealist-social-commentator|accessdate=18 June 2014|work=The Guardian| date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, businesses involved in the housing market were reported by a local paper as saying the city's architectural and historical interest, and its fast links to other towns and cities have led Winchester to become one of the most expensive and desirable areas of the country and ranked Winchester as one of the least deprived areas in England and Wales.&lt;ref name=WinchesterGreatest&gt;{{cite news|title=Winchester hits top ten list of places to live in the UK|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/10898665.Winchester_hits_top_ten_list_of_places_to_live_in_the_UK/|accessdate=18 June 2014 |work=Hampshire Chronicle |date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the district's 26 electoral wards, 7 cover the area of the city itself: Olivers Battery &amp; Badger Farm, St John &amp; All Saints, St Barnabas, St Michael, St Bartholomew, St Luke, and St Paul.&lt;ref&gt;http://documents.hants.gov.uk/Maps/WinchesterWardsMapA3pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winchester local elections]] take place in three out of every four years, with one third of the [[councillor]]s elected in each election. From the [[Winchester Council election, 2006|2006 election]] until the 2010 election the council was led by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].&lt;ref name=changes&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/local_council/08/html/24up.stm | title = Winchester | accessdate = 4 February 2010 | publisher = BBC News | date=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 briefly by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] again and since 2011 by the Conservatives.

From 1835 to 1974, Winchester was governed as a [[municipal borough]] of Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp1-9|title=Winchester: Introduction - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1902 the city's affairs were also administered partly by its parishes: St Lawrence, St Mary Kalendar, St Maurice, St Michael, St Peter Colebrook, St Swithin, St Thomas, St John, St Bartholomew Hyde, Milland, St Faith, and St Peter Cheesehill, and its extra-parochial areas: Cathedral Precincts, St Mary's College Precincts, St Cross Hospital Precinct, and Wolvesey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10153347|title=Winchester MB through time|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the south of the city had come under the "[[Liberty]] of the Soke", thereby self-governing to a large extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp19-20|title=Winchester: The soke - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10071770|title=Winchester Soke/Liberty through time|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathedral===
{{Main article|Winchester Cathedral}}
[[File:WinCath30Je6-4836wiki.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Winchester Cathedral.]]
[[Winchester Cathedral]] was originally built in 1079 and remains the longest Gothic cathedral in Europe. It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th century and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]]&lt;ref name="RTGB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] travelling to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]&lt;ref name="RTGB" /&gt;) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, which sing on a regular basis at the cathedral.

Winchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the thirteenth century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid fifteenth-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.

The earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals and so forth.

Entrance to the North garth of the cathedral, for pedestrians is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice′s tower, in the High street.&lt;ref&gt;Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green,Winton Pubs.Ltd.1967. Page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolvesey Castle and Palace===
{{Main article|Wolvesey Castle}}
[[Wolvesey Castle]] was the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] bishop's palace, dating from 1110, but standing on the site of an earlier Saxon structure. It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just prior to their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.

===Castle===
{{Main article|Winchester Castle}}
[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The "Winchester Round Table" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]
Winchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, otherwise known as [[Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).&lt;ref name="Ministry of Defence training"&gt;{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospital of St Cross===
{{Main article|Hospital of St Cross}}
[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]
The [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s. Since at least the 14th century, and still available today, a 'wayfarer's dole' of ale and bread has been handed out there. It was supposedly instigated to aid pilgrims on their way to [[Canterbury]].

===City museum===
The City Museum, located on the corner of Great Minster Street and The Square, contains much information on the history of Winchester. Early examples of [[Winchester measure]]s of standard capacity are on display. The museum was one of the first purpose-built museums to be constructed outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The City Museum, Winchester |url=http://www.cityofwinchester.co.uk/Museums/Local/local.html#City |year= 1998|work= |publisher= City of Winchester |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local items featured include the Roman 'Venta' gallery, and some genuine period shop interiors taken from the nearby High Street. Other places of cultural interest include the [[Westgate Museum]] (which showcases various items of [[weaponry]]), and the Historic Resources Centre, which holds many records related to the history of the city. In 2014 ownership of the City museum was transferred to the [[Hampshire Cultural Trust]] as part of a larger transfer of museums from [[Hampshire County Council]] and [[Winchester City Council]] &lt;ref name=bbc14&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Hampshire and Winchester museums and art leased to trust |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-29862007 |newspaper=BBC News |date=1 November 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in warfare}}
{{Women in society sidebar}}
The role of '''women in ancient warfare''' differed from culture to culture. Warfare throughout written history mainly has been portrayed in modern times as a matter for men, but women also have played a role. Until very recently, little mention of these exploits was included in retellings of history in most countries, aside from the [[Amazons]].

Female deities, whose origins predate historical records, are present in most early cultures. Often they were portrayed as [[warrior]]s, which signals a pervasive presence of women among such activities prior to a profound change in many human cultures after the adoption of agriculture as the typical sustenance (and which enabled protracted warfare with large armies).

Their influences, the roles of women rulers, and those of significant women, were retained in many of these cultures so strongly that no layers of new legends, ideals, and myths were able to obscure them completely.

The following is a list of prominent women who participated in warfare, which was assembled from the fragmentary beginning of written records to approximately 500 AD. [[archaeology|Archaeological research]] provides more details and clues regularly.

===1st century AD===
* 1st century - There were detailed reports of women accompanying their men on Germanic battlefields to provide morale support. [[Tacitus]] mentions them twice; in his Germania and again in his Annals, specifically at the battle near modern Nijmegen when the XV Primigenia and V Alaudae legions were sent packing back to Castra Vetera where they were later besieged during the [[Revolt of the Batavi]]. He writes in detail how the women would gather behind the warhost, and show their breasts to flagging warriors while screaming that their loss that day would mean the enemy gaining these as slaves. Women held an honored position in German tribes, and were seen as holy spirits as shown by their adoration of such as Aurinia and Veleda. Slavery was the fate of cowards and the unlucky - and letting one's women fall into that fate was a hideous deed. Thus the men were encouraged to fight harder. &lt;ref&gt;http://library.flawlesslogic.com/tacitus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yigal Kipnis''' (born October 28, 1949) is an [[Israel]]i historian and author. 
==Biography==
Yigal Kipnis earned a BSc in civil engineering from the [[Technion]] in Haifa (1977), and completed his MA (2003) and PhD (2006) in Land of Israel Studies at [[Haifa University]]. He served as a helicopter pilot in the [[Israeli Air Force]] for 31 years, of which 26 were in the reserves. Kipnis has lived on [[Moshav]] [[Ma'ale Gamla]] since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://justworldbooks.com/authors/yigal-kipnis/|title=Yigal Kipnis|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Just World Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
''The Golan Heights: Political History, Settlement and Geography since 1949'' (Routledge, 2013): The book presents Kipnis’ research on the settlement landscape in the [[Golan Heights]] on the eve of the [[Six-Day War]] and documents the rural Jewish settlement process in the Golan following the war, since 1967. Relations between Israel and Syria throughout this period are analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ההר שהיה כמפלצת: הגולן בין סוריה לישראל|last=Kipnis|first=Yigal|publisher=Magnes Press – The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golan Height: Political History, Settlement and Geography since 1949|last=Kipnis|first=Yigal|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''1973: The Road to War'' (Just World Books, 2013):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=1973 הדרך למלחמה|last=Kipnis|first=Yigal|publisher=כנרת, זמורה ביתן, דביר|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=1973: The Road to War|last=Kipnis|first=Yigal|publisher=Just World Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book deals with the circumstances leading to the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]] and the public discourse about it. In it, Kipnis reveals documentation of secret channels between US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] and the Israeli prime minister, [[Golda Meir]], and between Kissinger and President Sadat of Egypt. Sadat’s peace initiative, supported by President Nixon and Kissinger, was rejected by Israel's prime minister, resulting in the outbreak of war. The documentation affirms the central role of political considerations and reduces the role of the intelligence failure when examining the factors leading to war.
