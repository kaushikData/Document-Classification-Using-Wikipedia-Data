      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6399">'''Alan Stark Geisler''' (September 30, 1931 &amp;ndash; January 6, 2009) was an American [[food chemist]], best known for creating the [[red onion]] [[sauce]] most often used as a [[condiment]] topping on [[hot dog]]s in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=RecordObit&gt;Levin, Jay. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160126222910/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-159801792.html"Alan Geisler, 78; food chemist, hot dog hero"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', January 9, 2009, backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of December 26, 2016. Accessed October 9, 2018. "Alan Geisler of Mahwah, a food chemist who created the tangy red onion sauce that pushcart vendors slather over Sabrett hot dogs, died Tuesday at his winter home in Hernando, Fla. He was 78.... In 1960, Mr. Geisler -- a Tenafly High School graduate who received a bachelor's degree in food technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- founded a company that manufactures emulsifiers, shortenings and other ingredients for the baking industry.... Mr. Geisler, a 45-year resident of Mahwah, was still active in the company he founded a half-century ago, Technical Oil Products Inc. in Boonton, said Glenn Geisler, a partner."&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the sauce, which is marketed as Sabrett's Prepared Onions, is usually served on [[Sabrett]] brand hot dogs sold by New York's many [[Street food|pushcart hot dog vendors]].&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; 

Sabrett [[brand]] hot dogs and the red onion sauce which Geisler created are the [[flagship]] products of [[Marathon Enterprises, Inc.]] The company is headquartered in [[Englewood, New Jersey]].

== Personal life ==
Geisler was a graduate of [[Tenafly High School]] in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; He received his bachelor's degree in [[food technology]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; He served as an officer in the Quartermaster Corps of the US Army during the Korean War.

Geisler resided in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]], for 45 years.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; He was an ardent stamp collector and dealer, and an original member of the Apple Ridge Golf and Country Club of Mahwah, NJ. An avid golfer with a 4 handicap at one time, he won the Club Championship in all four flights, and throughout his career eagled all 18 holes. He played the bagpipes with the Fairleigh Dickinson University Pipe Band and the Kearny Caledonian Pipe Band for several years, even performing in the St. Patrick Day Parade in NYC.

== Career == 
Geisler founded a company that manufactured [[shortening]]s, [[emulsifier]]s and other ingredients for the [[baking]] and [[baked goods]] industry in 1960.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; 

One of his customers was Gregory Papalexis, who manufactured both hot dogs and [[hot dog bun]]s.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; Papalexis's customers included hot dog [[street vendor]]s, who often made a popular homemade, but time laborious, onion sauce as a topping.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; Papalexis asked Geisler to come up with a factory-made onion sauce for the hot dog vendors to sell at their carts in New York City.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

Geisler, with input from Papalexis, created a new, mass-produced onion sauce for hot dogs. The main formula and [[spice blend]]s of the sauce consisted predominantly of [[onion]]s, [[olive oil]] and [[tomato paste]],&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; which gives the sauce its distinctive red coloring.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; The sauce proved to be a hit with both the street vendors, who no longer had to make their own time consuming sauces, and hot dog consumers.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

Geisler and Papalexis partnered to form their own company, called Tremont Foods, to market and make the new red onion sauce.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; The sauce was initially sold to New York City hot dogs vendors under the brand names Tremont Foods or House of Weenies.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; 

Papalexis acquired Sabrett Food Products in 1989.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; As a result of the [[Takeover|acquisition]], Geisler's onion sauce became the only onion sauce served on Sabrett hot dogs by vendors in New York City.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; The red onion condiment also became available for purchase in [[supermarket]]s under the Sabrett's brand.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; It is marketed nationwide as "Sabrett's Prepared Onions."&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |title=Alan S. Geisler, Hot dog sauce maker, 78 |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/20090112_Alan_S__Geisler___Hot_dog_sauce_maker__78.html |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2008-01-12 |accessdate=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115093046/http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/20090112_Alan_S__Geisler___Hot_dog_sauce_maker__78.html |archivedate=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2009, Geisler's red onion sauce enjoys "a couple of million dollars a year in sales," according to Papalexis.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; Geisler's and Papalexis's original company, Tremont Foods, is currently a [[Division (business)|division]] of [[Marathon Enterprises, Inc.]], which owns the Sabrett trademark.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; (Marathon Enterprises is owned by Papalexis.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;) The only product made by Tremont Foods is the popular red onion sauce.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; The sauce is manufactured in [[The Bronx]], but production is scheduled to shift to a new facility, in [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey]], in 2009.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; 

Geisler remained active with the company until his death in 2009.

== Death ==
Geisler died at his winter home in [[Hernando, Florida]], on January 6, 2009, at the age of 78.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; Geisler had been suffering from a [[protein]] [[Disease|disorder]] called [[amyloidosis]].&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt; He was survived by his wife, Jean Geisler, his daughter, Martha Geisler, his son, Glenn Geisler, his brother and a grandson.&lt;ref name=RecordObit/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7678">The '''Aliab Dinka''' are a subdivision of the [[Dinka people]] of [[South Sudan]]. They traditionally lived in an area west of the upper [[White Nile]] river.
The name is also used to refer to a breed of cattle maintained by the Aliab Dinka people and widespread in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Location==

The Aliab Dinka mainly live in the [[Lakes (state)|Lakes State]] of South Sudan, in the [[Awerial County]], to the west of the White Nile.&lt;ref name=UNMIS/&gt;
The Aliab Valley is a low floodplain to the west of the Bahr-el-Gebel (Nile) between [[Tombé]] in the south and [[Lake Papiu]] in the north. The valley is between {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} and {{convert|6|mi|km}} wide and perhaps {{convert|60|km|mi}} in length. The Bahr-el-Gebel flows well above the east side of the valley between high banks.
During the rainy season, usually starting in June, the river overflows its banks and floods the whole valley, which becomes a huge swamp. After the southern half of the valley has drained, between December and April it is suitable for cattle grazing. A report from 1951 said that some Dinka hunted the abundant game during this period, particularly buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==1919 rising==

In 1919 the Aliab Dinka country lay within the [[Mongalla Province]] of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].
There was an uprising of the Aliab Dinka that year.
3,000 Dinka men attacked the police post at Mingkaman ( Guol-yier ), near [[Bor, South Sudan|Bor]], and killed several policemen.
[[Mandari people|Mandari]] tribesmen in the region to the south attacked at the same time and killed some telegraph linesmen and police.
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Finch White took several companies of the Egyptian Army Equatorial Battalion to the area to handle the situation.&lt;ref name=Fecitt/&gt;
The Mongalla province Governor [[Chauncey Hugh Stigand]] went on patrol himself, and on 8 December 1919 was killed at Pap, between the Lau River and the White Nile.&lt;ref name=Hill1967&gt;{{cite book

Two other officers and 24 soldiers and porters were speared to death by 1,000 Dinka warriors.&lt;ref name=Fecitt/&gt;
The rising was put down harshly in 1920.&lt;ref name=Roberts1984&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv

A force under Colonel Robert Henry Darwall led the punitive expedition, which killed over 400 Dinka, [[Atwot people|Atwot]] and Mandari tribesmen, burnt many villages and took about 7,000 cattle.&lt;ref name=Fecitt/&gt;

Stigand's successor [[Vincent Reynolds Woodland]] wrote that "The Government has done nothing for the Aliab. It has not protected them from aggression, has given them no economic benefits ... it has forced them to do a certain amount of labour, to pay taxes and to endure a not negligible amount of extortion by police". However, although he removed the Egyptian ''ma'mur'' at Minkammon who had triggered the Aliab revolt through his abuses, Woodland did not appoint a replacement. The Aliab Dinka were left with no administration at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Conflicts==

The Aliab Dinka have traditionally been primarily pastoral in occupation, although they engage in some agriculture.&lt;ref name=UNMIS/&gt;
In the past, the Aliab Dinka had a close relationship with the [[Mandari people]]. In the dry season, the Mandari would graze the Aliab grasslands beside the Nile. In return, the Aliab Dinka would share the Mandari woodland grazing in the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |ISBN=0-415-32997-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In times of shortage, however, there has been conflict between the Aliab and Bor Dinka and the Mandari. During the period starting in 1972 with the end of the [[First Sudanese Civil War]] the Aliab Dinka used their control of administrative posts to undermine the old agreements on dry season grazing. 
When hostilities resumed in 1983 with the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] there was a violent reaction against the Dinka, with many being killed by the Mundari in [[Juba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Conflict flared up between the Aliab Dinka and the Mandari again in November 2009. About 40 people were killed in a dispute over grazing land on the border of [[Awerial County|Aliap]] and [[Terekeka County|Terekeka]] counties during a period of water shortage. 
Nine of the Dinka were killed and about 31 Mundari men were shot dead by the more heavily armed Dinka.
The Aliap Dinka claimed that the Mandari had been the aggressors, abducting five women and four children and stealing 20 cows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Angelino Garzón Quintero''' (born 29 October 1946) served as [[Vice President of Colombia]], under [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Juan Manuel Santos Calderón]]. He was the [[List of Governors of the Department of Valle del Cauca|69th Governor]] of [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]] from 2004 to 2008, and served as the second [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Minister of Labour and Social Protection]] under the administration of President [[Andrés Pastrana Arango]]. He was [[Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations Office at Geneva]] from 29 January 2009 until his resignation in March 2010, in preparation for his [[Colombian presidential election, 2010|election to the Vice Presidency]].

==Career==

He has been a union leader for many labor union and in many positions among these General Secretary of the [[Central Union of Workers]] ({{lang-es|Central Unitaria de Trabajadores, CUT}}) between 1981 and 1990. He later ran for congressman and was elected to become part of the [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] that created the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]]. He also served as Vice President of the [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)|Patriotic Union Party]].

During the government of President [[Andrés Pastrana]] Garzon was appointed [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Labour and Social Protection]] from 2000 until 2002. He was one of the ministers of Pastrana's administration with a popular positive image. After serving as minister he was proposed running for president but he declined. Garzon then participated as member of the facilitating Commission for the Humanitarian Accord with the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] guerrilla group (FARC).

He then resigned from the commission to postulate his name for [[Governor]] of [[Valle del Cauca Department]]. He was elected in 2003 with 60.69% of the votes and winning over Carlos Holmes Trujillo and Carlos José Holguín, this last candidate son of former senator [[Carlos Holguín Sardi]].

During his administration as Governor of Valle del Cauca in 2006, he was criticized for a conflict that surged between a CISA S.A. Constructing Consortium in charge of widening  and repairing the highway [[Cali]]&amp;ndash;[[Candelaria, Valle del Cauca|Candelaria]] but which was never started and CISA S.A.  sued the Valle del Cauca Department. Garzon and his cabinet called for a hunger strike to press for the courts for an outcome favorable for the department.

In June 2007 Garzon accompanied President [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] as part of the presidential delegation that traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] pursuing the approval by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement]] between Colombia and the United States. Senador Jorge Enrique Robledo of the [[Alternative Democratic Pole]] party and one of the strongest critics of the trade agreement criticized Garzon and mentioned that Garzon had never been part of the Alternative Democratic Pole party nor he had been affiliated to the parties that formed the alliance [[Independent Democratic Pole]] or Democratic Alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polodemocratico.net/Angelino-Garzon-no-ha-sido-nunca POLO Democrático] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212258/http://www.polodemocratico.net/Angelino-Garzon-no-ha-sido-nunca |date=September 27, 2007 }} Angelino Garzón no ha sido nunca del Polo, explicó el Senador Robledo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Garzón was offered the post of [[Ambassador]] to [[Brazil]], but rejected it on the grounds that his [[German Shepherd dog]] would not be able to adapt to the Brazilian climate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26638986 Colombian vice-president rejects Brazil job because 'dog would not adapt'], at [[BBC.com]]; published 18 March 2014; retrieved 20 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancer==

Around October 2012, he was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}

'''Antisthenes''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɪ|s|θ|ᵻ|n|iː|z|}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Roach |editor2-first=Peter James |editor3-last= Hartman | editor3-first=James|editor4-first=Jane |editor4-last=Setter |title=Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary |edition=17th |publisher=Cambridge UP |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-el|Ἀντισθένης}}; c. 445{{snd}}c. 365 BC) was a [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] and a pupil of [[Socrates]]. Antisthenes first learned [[rhetoric]] under [[Gorgias]] before becoming an ardent disciple of [[Socrates]]. He adopted and developed the [[ethical]] side of Socrates' teachings, advocating an [[ascetic]] life lived in accordance with [[virtue]]. Later writers regarded him as the founder of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophy.

==Life==
Antisthenes was born c. 445 BC and was the son of Antisthenes, an [[Athenian]].  His mother was a [[Thracians|Thracian]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Suda]]'', ''Antisthenes''.; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he fought at [[Battle of Tanagra (426 BC)|Tanagra]] (426 BC), and was a disciple first of [[Gorgias]], and then of [[Socrates]]; so eager was he to hear the words of Socrates that he used to walk daily from Peiraeus to Athens, and persuaded his friends to accompany him.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Eventually he was present at Socrates's death.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedo'', 59b.&lt;/ref&gt; He never forgave his master's persecutors, and is said to have been instrumental in procuring their punishment.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 9}} He survived the [[Battle of Leuctra]] (371 BC), as he is reported to have compared the victory of the [[Thebans]] to a set of schoolboys beating their master.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lycurgus'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Eudokia Makrembolitissa]] supposedly tells us that he died at the age of 70,&lt;ref&gt;Eudocia, ''Violarium'', 96&lt;/ref&gt; he was apparently still alive in 366 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, xv. 76.4&lt;/ref&gt; and he must have been nearer to 80 years old when he died at Athens, c. 365 BC. He is said to have lectured at the [[Cynosarges]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 13}} a gymnasium for the use of Athenians born of foreign mothers, near the temple of [[Herakles|Heracles]]. Filled with enthusiasm for the Socratic idea of virtue, he founded a school of his own in the Cynosarges, where he attracted the poorer classes by the simplicity of his life and teaching. He wore a cloak and carried a staff and a wallet, and this costume became the uniform of his followers.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] says that his works filled ten volumes, but of these, only fragments remain.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antisthenes|volume=2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favourite style seems to have been dialogues, some of them being vehement attacks on his contemporaries, as on [[Alcibiades]] in the second of his two works entitled ''Cyrus'', on [[Gorgias]] in his ''Archelaus'' and on [[Plato]] in his ''Satho''.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, v. 220c-e&lt;/ref&gt; His style was pure and elegant, and [[Theopompus]] even said that Plato stole from him many of his thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, xi. 508c-d&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]], after reading some works by Antisthenes, found his works pleasing and called him "a man more intelligent than learned".&lt;ref&gt;"''Κῦρος δ᾽, ε᾽ mihi sic placuit ut cetera Antisthenis, hominis acuti magis quam eruditi''". Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Atticum'', Book XII, Letter 38, section 2. In English translation: "Books four (δ᾽) and five (ε᾽) of ''Cyrus'' I found as pleasing as the others composed by Antisthenes, he is a man who is sharp rather than learned".&lt;/ref&gt; He possessed considerable powers of wit and sarcasm, and was fond of playing upon words; saying, for instance, that he would rather fall among crows (''korakes'') than flatterers (''kolakes''), for the one devour the dead, but the other the living.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 4}} Two declamations have survived, named ''Ajax'' and ''Odysseus'', which are purely rhetorical.

Antisthenes' nickname was ''the (Absolute) Dog'' (ἁπλοκύων, Diog. Laert.6.13) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Prince|first=Susan (Dept. of Classics, University of Colorado, Boulder) |url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2001/2001-06-23.html |title=Review of LE.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Antisthenes BM 1838.jpg|right|thumb|Marble bust of Antisthenes based on the same original ([[British Museum]]) ]]

===According to Diogenes Laertius===
In his "Lives of the Eminent Philosophers," Diogenes Laertius lists the following as the favorite themes of Antisthenes: "He would prove that virtue can be taught; and that nobility belongs to none other than the virtuous. And he held virtue to be sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, since it needed nothing else except the strength of a Socrates. And he maintained that virtue is an affair of deeds and does not need a store of words or learning; that the wise man is self-sufficing, for all the goods of others are his; that ill repute is a good thing and much the same as pain; that the wise man will be guided in his public acts not by the established laws but by the law of virtue; that he will also marry in order to have children from union with the handsomest women; furthermore that he will not disdain to love, for only the wise man knows who are worthy to be loved".{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 10}}

===Ethics===
Antisthenes was a pupil of Socrates, from whom he imbibed the fundamental ethical precept that [[virtue]], not [[pleasure]], is the end of existence.  Everything that the wise person does, Antisthenes said, conforms to perfect virtue,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 11}} and pleasure is not only unnecessary, but a positive evil. He is reported to have held pain&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Oration'', 6.181b&lt;/ref&gt; and even ill-repute ({{lang-el|ἀδοξία}}){{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 3, 7}} to be blessings, and said that "I'd rather be mad than feel pleasure".{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 3}} It is, however, probable that he did not consider all pleasure worthless, but only that which results from the gratification of sensual or artificial desires, for we find him praising the pleasures which spring "from out of one's soul,"&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Symposium'', iv. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and the enjoyments of a wisely chosen friendship.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 12}} The supreme good he placed in a life lived according to [[virtue]]{{mdash}}virtue consisting in action, which when obtained is never lost, and exempts the wise person from error.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 11–12, 104–105}} It is closely connected with reason, but to enable it to develop itself in action, and to be sufficient for happiness, it requires the aid of ''Socratic strength'' ({{lang-el|Σωκρατικὴ ἱσχύς}}).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 11}}

===Physics===
His work on [[Natural Philosophy]] (the ''Physicus'') contained a theory of the nature of the [[gods]], in which he argued that there were many gods believed in by the people, but only one natural [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that God resembles nothing on earth, and therefore could not be understood from any representation.&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', v.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic===
In [[logic]], Antisthenes was troubled by the [[problem of universals]]. As a proper [[nominalist]], he held that definition and predication are either false or [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], since we can only say that every individual is what it is, and can give no more than a description of its qualities, e. g. that silver is like tin in colour.&lt;ref name="aristot1"&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1043b24&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he disbelieved the Platonic system of Ideas. "A horse I can see," said Antisthenes, "but horsehood I cannot see".&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Arist. Cat.'' 208, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Definition is merely a circuitous method of stating an identity: "a tree is a vegetable growth" is logically no more than "a tree is a tree".

===Philosophy of language===
Antisthenes apparently distinguished "a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference." This "suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Susan |title=Antisthenes of Athens: Texts, Translations, and Commentary|publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2015}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s “Comments on [[Aristotle]]'s 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι' ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν … τὸ …&lt;ref&gt;Prince 2015, pp. 518–522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisthenes and the Cynics==
[[Image:Antisthenes Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|right|thumb|Antisthenes, part of a fresco in the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|National University of Athens]]]]
In later times, Antisthenes came to be seen as the founder of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], but it is by no means certain that he would have recognized the term. [[Aristotle]], writing a generation later refers several times to Antisthenes&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1024b26; ''Rhetoric'', 1407a9; ''Topics'', 104b21; ''Politics'', 1284a15&lt;/ref&gt; and his followers "the Antistheneans,"&lt;ref name="aristot1"/&gt; but makes no reference to Cynicism.&lt;ref name="long32"&gt;Long 1996, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; There are many later tales about the infamous Cynic [[Diogenes of Sinope]] dogging Antisthenes' footsteps and becoming his faithful hound,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 6, 18, 21}}; Dio Chrysostom, ''Orations'', viii. 1–4; Aelian, x. 16; Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', 13.19&lt;/ref&gt; but it is similarly uncertain that the two men ever met. Some scholars, drawing on the discovery of defaced coins from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] dating from the period 350–340 BC, believe that Diogenes only moved to Athens after the death of Antisthenes,&lt;ref name="long45"&gt;Long 1996, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been argued that the stories linking Antisthenes to Diogenes were invented by the [[Stoics]] in a later period in order to provide a succession linking Socrates to [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], via Antisthenes, Diogenes, and [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]].&lt;ref&gt;Dudley 1937, pages 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; These tales were important to the Stoics for establishing a chain of teaching that ran from Socrates to Zeno.&lt;ref&gt;Navia, ''Diogenes the Cynic'', page 100&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the evidence from the coins is weak, and thus Diogenes could have moved to Athens well before 340 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Navia, ''Diogenes the Cynic'', pages 34, 112-3&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Diogenes visited Athens and Antisthenes before his exile, and returned to Sinope.&lt;ref name="long45"/&gt;

Antisthenes certainly adopted a rigorous [[ascetic]] lifestyle,&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Symposium'', iv. 34–44.&lt;/ref&gt; and he developed many of the principles of Cynic philosophy which became an inspiration for Diogenes and later Cynics. It was said that he had laid the foundations of the city which they afterwards built.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§  15}}

Major General '''Antonio Cosme Imbert Barrera''' (December 3, 1920&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HEFACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Antonio+Imbert+Barrera+1920&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihn7_UxJPUAhUL3SwKHS5WDmsQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Antonio%20Imbert%20Barrera%201920&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; – May 31, 2016) was a [[Two-star rank|two-star]] [[Major general|army general]] advitam of the [[Dominican Army]] and was [[List of Presidents of the Dominican Republic|President of the Dominican Republic]] from May to August 1965.

Imbert, who plotted to assassinate dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] in 1961, was one of the two rival rulers in the [[Dominican Republic]] from May 7, 1965 until August 30, 1965, amid the [[Dominican Civil War]]. He had succeeded General [[Pedro Bartolomé Benoit|Pedro B. Benoit van der Horst]] who ruled for less than a week. After the civil war ended, both General Imbert and his rival Colonel [[Francisco Caamaño]] resigned and [[Héctor García-Godoy]], a civilian, was sworn as interim president.

==Early life==
Imbert was born into a prominent family&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; of military tradition: his father, Brigadier General Segundo Manuel Imbert Mesnier had a leading role in the [[Cibao|northern region]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]; Brigadier General [[Segundo Imbert|Segundo Francisco Imbert]], Imbert Barrera’s grandfather, was Vice-President of the Dominican Republic and candidate for President, and fought in the [[Dominican Restoration War]]; meanwhile his great-grandfather, Major General [[José María Imbert]], who was a French migrant, achieved important victories against Haiti in the [[Dominican War of Independence]].

Imbert’s first significant position was as governor of [[Puerto Plata province|Puerto Plata]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was removed from the post by then president [[Rafael Trujillo]] for sending him a telegram informing upon the names of the survivors of the failed {{Interlanguage link multi|Luperón invasion|de|3=Invasion bei Luperón}}. This caused, in a personal manner, the beginning of the assassination plan against Trujillo.

His brother Segundo, an army official too, was imprisoned in 1956 by Trujillo’s regime.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Segundo was convicted for murder;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ornes|first1=Germán E.|title=Trujillo: pequeño César del Caribe|year=1960|publisher=Editorial Las Novedades|location=Caracas|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6TUAAAAMAAJ&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tXgaAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Segundo+Manuel+Imbert&amp;dq=Segundo+Manuel+Imbert&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt; implicated in the murder of Domingo Marión in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes |first1=Francisco |title=Acusan hermanos Imbert Barreras crímen en Puerto Plata en 1943 |url=http://www.almomento.net/acusan-hermanos-imbert-barreras-crimen-en-puerto-plata-en-1943/216766 |accessdate=16 June 2016 |publisher=Al Momento |date=16 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616224721/http://www.almomento.net/acusan-hermanos-imbert-barreras-crimen-en-puerto-plata-en-1943/216766 |archivedate=16 June 2016 |location=Santo Domingo |language=Spanish |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination of Trujillo==
On May 30, 1961 Trujillo was shot dead when his car was ambushed on a road outside the Dominican capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13560512 |title='I shot the cruellest dictator in the Americas' |date=27 May 2011 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=13 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/638nXkECg?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13560512 |archivedate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imbert, the driver of the ambushing vehicle, was accompanied by [[Antonio de la Maza]], [[Salvador Estrella Sahdalá]] and [[Amado García Guerrero]] - the active participants who carried out the plot. Most of those involved in the assassination plot were subsequently captured and executed, with the exception of Imbert and [[Luis Amiama Tió]]. Imbert went into hiding until December 2.&lt;ref name=diederich&gt;{{cite book |last=Diederich |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Diederich |title=Trujillo. The Death of the Goat |publisher=Little, Brown, and Co., 1978 |page=253 |isbn=0-316-18440-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|253}}

After [[Joaquín Balaguer]], Trujillo’s figurehead president, was overthrown in 1962 and the Trujillo family was ousted, Imbert was declared a "National Hero" and was promoted to [[Major general|Major General]] with the special grant of it being ''advitam'' or lifelong. In the  [[Dominican Civil War|Civil War in the Dominican Republic]] of 1965 he led one of the factions in the struggle which faced the constitutionalist government led by Colonel [[Francisco Caamaño]], who tried to bring back [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] to the country's presidency.
Imbert's faction, called the [[Government of National Reconstruction]] was endorsed by the U.S. troops inspectors, in addition, he was one of the collaborators with the Americans, finally signing a peace act that put an end to the April war.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Later life==
On March 21, 1967, he was shot in Santo Domingo while traveling with Marino García,&lt;ref name=diederich/&gt;{{rp|256}} in an attempted assassination made by the late dictator Trujillo's supporters. He survived by driving himself to a medical clinic. On February 15, 1970 the [[Dominicana de Aviación]] flight wherein his sister Aída Imbert Barrera, his wife Guarina Tessón Hurtado, and his daughter, sportswoman Leslie Imbert Tessón, were travelling, [[Dominicana DC-9 air disaster|crashed into the Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herrera|first1=Dalton|authorlink1=Dalton Herrera|title=Adiós al último héroe que ajustició a Trujillo|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk//launch.aspx?pbid=d1a2c233-1537-4b0a-993e-57babf45a7b1|accessdate=3 June 2016|newspaper=[[Listín Diario]]|publication-date=1 June 2016|publication-place=Santo Domingo|page=6A|format=aspx|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Adiós a un Héroe Nacional|url=http://www.listindiario.com/editorial/2016/06/01/421433/adios-a-un-heroe-nacional|accessdate=3 June 2016|newspaper=[[Listín Diario]]|publication-date=1 June 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Ministry of Defence|Minister of Defense]] of the Dominican Republic from 1986 to 1988; earlier that decade, his second-cousin [[Mario Imbert McGregor]] was also Minister of Defense. In 1989 he was assigned [[chairman]] of the [[board of directors]] of [[Rosario Dominicana]]. In September 2013, the ''Constitutionalist Soldiers of 25 April 1965 Foundation'' asked the [[National Congress of the Dominican Republic]] to explore the possibility of stripping Imbert his status of national hero as it considered that he went against constitutional precepts when he supported the coup against Bosch and the [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1965–66)|U.S. occupation of the country]], mong other accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apolinar|first1=Bethania|title=Constitucionalistas piden despojar a Imbert Barrera de condición de Héroe Nacional|url=http://www.listindiario.com.do/la-republica/2013/9/3/290753/Constitucionalistas-Piden-despojar-a-Imbert-Barreras-de-condicion-de-Heroe|accessdate=3 June 2016|newspaper=[[Listín Diario]]|date=3 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231439/http://www.listindiario.com/la-republica/2013/9/3/290753/Constitucionalistas-Piden-despojar-a-Imbert-Barreras-de-condicion-de-Heroe|archivedate=4 September 2013|location=Santo Domingo|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media career==

===''The B+ Show'' (March 2011)===
Inspired by the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]], Youssef created his first satirical show in March 2011. Entitled ''The B+ Show'' after his blood type,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gladstone |first=Brooke |title=Egypt Finds Its Own 'Jon Stewart' |work=NPR|date=15 April 2011|access-date=9 January 2014|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=135444956}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program, at 5 minutes per episode, was uploaded to his [[YouTube]] channel in May 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elkayal|first=Heba|title=Comedy show du jour: Bassem Youssef's Al-Bernameg|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2011/09/07/comedy-show-du-jour-bassem-youssefs-al-bernameg/|newspaper=Daily News Egypt|date=7 September 2011|access-date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained more than five million views in the first three months alone.&lt;ref name="cairo360.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairo360.com/article/tvanddvd/1619/cairo-360-presents-the-bassem-youssef-show-b|title=Cairo 360 Presents: The Bassem Youssef Show (B+) - TV &amp; DVD Feature - Cairo 360|work=cairo360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was shot in Youssef's laundry room using a table, a chair, one camera, and a mural of amateur photos from Tahrir Square that cost $100. The show was a collaboration by Youssef with [[Tarek ElKazzaz]], Amr Ismail, Mohamed Khalifa, and Mostafa Al-Halawany. Youssef used social media to showcase his talent and his show gave a voice to the millions of Egyptians who were seething with anger from the traditional media's coverage of the Egyptian Revolution.

===''Al Bernameg'' Season 1 (September 2011)===
After the success of ''The B+ Show'', Egyptian channel [[ONTV (Egypt)|ONTV]], owned by Egyptian billionaire [[Naguib Sawiris]], offered Youssef a deal for ''Al Bernameg'' (literally, "The Program"). With a budget of roughly half a million dollars, the series made him the first Internet to TV conversion in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montasser|first=Farah|title=Revolutionary Satire|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/09/02/165062.html|access-date=2 September 2011|newspaper=Al Arabiya|author2=Deena Adel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, which consisted of 104 episodes, premiered during [[Ramadan]] 1432 (2011) with Egyptian-American engineer Muhammad Radwan as its first guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Mohamed Radwan|url=http://www.syrianrevolution2011.com/videos/player/tabid/68/videoid/2857/---------interview-with-mohamed-radwan-the-program-with-basem-yousef-20110731.aspx|date=31 July 2011|access-date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his show, Youssef has parodied such Egyptian celebrities as show host [[Tawfik Okasha]], composer [[Amr Mostafa]], [[Salafi movement|Salafist]] presidential candidate [[Hazem Salah Abu Ismail]], and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], former head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and onetime presidential candidate. The show became the platform for many writers, artists, and politicians to speak freely about the social and political scene. ''Al-Bernameg'''s success inspired a number of amateur initiatives on various social media channels, who credit ''The B+ Show'' as their inspiration.&lt;ref name="cairo360.com"/&gt;

===''The Daily Show'' 2012===
In June 2012, Jon Stewart invited Youssef to ''The Daily Show'' for an extended interview, "...I do know a little something about the humour business; your show is sharp, you're really good on it, it's smart, it's well executed, I think the world of what you're doing down there," Stewart said to Youssef. The segment was one of the highest in viewership on the ''Daily Show''{{'}}s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/okmooj/exclusive---bassem-youssef-extended-interview-pt--2|title=Exclusive - Bassem Youssef Extended Interview Pt. 2|work=cc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Al Bernameg'' Season 2 (November 2012)===
Following the success of ''The B+ Show'' on YouTube and the first season of ''Al-Bernameg'' on ONTV, [[Tarek ElKazzaz]] convinced an old friend, [[Ahmed Abbas]], to join QSoft as chief operations officer and Project Director for ''Al-Bernameg'' with the mission of developing and upgrading the show into a multifaceted and global brand. This was done with the help of a team that covered many disciplines, including marketing, operations, legal and public relations. This all helped in developing both Bassem Youssef and ''Al-Bernameg'' on all levels and created a global audience. The show ''Al Bernameg'' was renewed for a second season after a contract with a second channel, CBC ([[Capital Broadcast Center]]), which premiered on November 23, 2012. The second season consisted of 29 episodes and has recorded one of the highest viewership ratings on both TV and internet with 40 million viewers on TV and more than 184 million combined views for his show on YouTube alone. Just three episodes into the show, several lawsuits were filed against Bassem Youssef and his show, mainly for "insult and defamation". On the season's premiere, Youssef made the owner and coworkers of his channel the subject of his show, as an assurance that he is granted full freedom of expression, and that no topic was off limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/08/254037.html|title=Egyptian comedy show takes on 'merchants of religion'|publisher=AlArabiya|date=8 December 2012|access-date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Un7YwQtQ1M|title=Egypt satire show sparks media clash |publisher=Al Arabiya|date=November 2012|access-date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBC did not, however, air his second episode, which also featured further criticism of a TV show host who filed a lawsuit against Youssef. The show returned to its regular schedule for the third episode.

The program, which began with a small group working at home with Youssef, moved from ONTV's smallest studio to Radio theater in downtown Cairo, a theatre redesigned in the likeness of [[NBC Radio City Studios|New York's Radio City]], making it the first live audience show in the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The contents of a typical show's broadcast have evolved, which began with a sarcastic take on current political events, and eventually incorporating the hosting of public figures and stars from various fields, as well as various artists' performances.
In November 2012, ''Al-Bernameg''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albernameg.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106125405/http://www.albernameg.com/ |archivedate=2014-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; moved from ONTV's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ontveg.com/|title=ONtv Official Website – الموقع الرسمي لقناة أون تي في - الموقع الرسمي لقناة أون تي في – ONtv Official Website|work=ONtv Official Website - الموقع الرسمي لقناة أون تي في}}&lt;/ref&gt; smallest studio to Radio Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Radio-TheaterDown-Town-Cairo/173511029436584|title=Radio Theater"Down Town Cairo"|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cairo's downtown. Following the move, Youssef succeeded in increasing the show's worth by eight times in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/profile-bassem-youssef-professionalizes-satire|title=Profile: Bassem Youssef professionalizes satire  - Egypt Independent|work=egyptindependent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[ONTV (Egypt)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The second season, which premiered in November 2012 on CBC network, was the first real live audience show in Egypt. The show gained tremendous success through its criticism of former Egyptian President [[Mohammed Morsi|Mohamed Morsi]], representing the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Soon after the show started airing, complaints were filed against Youssef, accusing him of insulting [[Islam]], Morsi and disrupting public order and peace.

===''Al-Shorouk''===
In March 2013, Bassem Youssef started writing a weekly column expressing his views for ''[[Al-Shorouk]]''; one of Egypt's most prominent and independent daily newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/columns/Basem-youssef|title=رأي - باسم يوسف  -          بوابة الشروق|work=shorouknews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youssef also wrote newspaper columns, where he tackled taboo subjects such as atheism and questioning the commonly held view that [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy from Islam]] should be punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youth: Give us a chance|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21580627-lots-young-people-and-few-decent-jobs-are-recipe-trouble-give-us-chance|publisher=Economist|date=11 July 2013|access-date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 18, 2014, he faced plagiarism accusations by his readers, and through Twitter, by the original British writer, [[Ben Judah]], who wrote the article for ''[[Politico]]'' magazine. He later published an apology in ''El Sherouk'' newspaper for initially publishing an article without citing any references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bassem Youssef 'very sorry' after plagiarism accusations|url=http://thecairopost.com/news/102869/news/bassem-youssef-very-sorry-after-plagiarism-accusations|publisher=The Cairo Post|date=19 March 2014|access-date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''America in Arabic''===
As ''Al-Bernameg'' continued with its growing success, Jon Stewart appeared as a guest on the show in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upworthy.com/jon-stewart-of-america-meets-the-jon-stewart-of-egypt-and-hilarity-ensues|title=Jon Stewart Of America Meets The Jon Stewart Of Egypt, And Hilarity Ensues|work=Upworthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBC stops airing===
After a four-month break, Youssef appeared on air in October 2013, with a show that stirred much controversy and criticism.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In response to the popular criticism and discontent the show caused, CBC, the show's broadcaster, distanced itself from the show and its creators, and decided to stop airing it on its channels. Meanwhile, more than 30 complaints against Youssef and the show were filed at the General Prosecutor's office, accusing him of insulting the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] and President [[Adly Mansour]] and describing the June 30 protests as a military coup, in addition to disrupting public order and peace. The General Prosecutor transferred some of the complaints for investigation, which were subject to the prosecutor's decision and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2012/12/02/bassem-youssefs-el-bernameg-in-trouble-on-cbc/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206051735/http://dailynewsegypt.com/2012/12/02/bassem-youssefs-el-bernameg-in-trouble-on-cbc/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 December 2012|title=Bassem Youssef's El-Bernameg in trouble on CBC|date=2 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Al Bernameg'' Season 3 (October 2013)===
After terminating the contract with CBC, the production company behind ''Al Bernameg'' received offers from different TV channels. The third season was scheduled to air during the first quarter of 2014. In February 2014 it was announced that Youssef had signed a deal with the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]] and that they would start broadcasting ''Al Bernameg'' from 7 February on [[MBC MASR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/egyptian-satirist-signs-contract-network-185153886.html |title=Egyptian satirist signs contract with new network |last1=Hyde |first1=Maggie |date=1 February 2014 |website=[[Yahoo! News]] |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the program was suspended by MBC during the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2014|2014 Egyptian presidential election campaign]], and in June 2014 Youssef announced that he was ending ''Al-Bernameg'' as he felt that the political climate in Egypt was too dangerous to continue the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/02/bassem-youssef-closes-egyptian-satire-tv-show-over-safety-fears |title=Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef winds up TV show due to safety fears |last1=Kingsley |first1=Patrick|date=2 June 2014 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a four-month break, ''Al Bernameg'' returned to air for its third series on 25 October 2013. The season premiere marked the first broadcast for the show since the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]] had deposed Mohamed Morsi from the Egyptian presidency. Youssef criticised both the Morsi administration and the people's idolization of the Egyptian Defense Minister [[Abdul Fatah al-Sisi]]. The following day the CBC network issued a statement distancing the channel from the political stance taken by Youssef. The CBC network issued another statement, and decided to stop broadcasting ''Al Bernameg'' because of violations in the contract signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/28/egyptian-satirist-bassem-youssef-returns|title=Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef upsets all sides on return to TV |last1=Kingsley|first1=Patrick|agency=The Guardian|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, and after a six-week break, the ''Al-Bernameg'' team held a press conference where Youssef announced the termination of the show due to pressure on both the show and the airing channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/media/television-and-radio/2014/02/08/Egypt-s-Bassem-Youssef-returns-to-the-air-on-MBC.html|title=Egypt’s Bassem Youssef returns to the air on MBC|website=English.AlArabiya.net|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/06/jon-stewart-farewell-to-egyptian-satire-bassem-youssef-show-cancelled-pressure-video-739390/|title=Jon Stewart Bids Farewell To Egyptian Satire As Pal Bassem Youssef's Show Cancelled (Video) - Deadline|author=Nancy Tartaglione|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jon-stewart-of-egypt-bassem-youssef/|title="The Jon Stewart of Egypt": Bassem Youssef|date=8 June 2014|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response of Egyptian government==
On 1 January 2013, the daily ''[[Al-masry Al-youm]]'' reported that an Egyptian prosecutor was investigating Bassem Youssef on charges of maligning [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Mohammed Morsi]], whose office claimed that Youssef's show was "circulating false news likely to disturb public peace and public security and affect the administration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/01/01/host-of-egyptian-daily-show-investigated-after-being-accused-of-insulting-president-morsi/|title=Host of Egyptian 'Daily Show' investigated after being accused of insulting President Morsi|agency=Associated Press|date=1 January 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all of the controversy it sparks, ''Al Bernameg'' has been a major success.&lt;ref name=alarabiya_blurb&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/authors/Bassem-Youssef.html|title=Bassem Youssef|agency=Al Arabiya|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is constantly topping the regional YouTube charts, making Bassem Youssef's YouTube channel the most subscribed to in Egypt.&lt;ref name=alarabiya_blurb/&gt;

On 30 March 2013, an arrest warrant was issued for Youssef for allegedly insulting [[Islam]] and Morsi. The move was seen by opponents as part of an effort to silence dissent against Morsi's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/85402/Egypt/Politics-/Freedoms-in-Egypt-questioned-after-ElBernamegs-sus.aspx|title=Freedoms in Egypt questioned after El-Bernameg's suspension|agency=Ahram Online|date=2 November 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youssef confirmed the arrest warrant on his [[Twitter]] account and said he would hand himself in to the prosecutor's office, jokingly adding, "Unless they kindly send a police van today and save me the transportation hassle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/30/bassem-youssef-arrest-warrant-egypt-jon-stewart_n_2985235.html|title=Arrest Warrant Issued For Bassem Youssef, TV Satirist Known As 'Egypt's Jon Stewart'|agency=Associated Press|date=30 June 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he was questioned by authorities before being released on bail of 15,000 Egyptian pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/03/20133318332892628.html|title=Egypt satirist questioned for insulting Morsi|agency=Al Jazeera English|date=31 March 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/world/middleeast/bassem-youssef-posts-bail-as-egyptian-authorities-press-case.html|title=Egyptian Satirist Posts Bail as Authorities Press Case|agency=New York Times|date=31 March 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014|work=The New York Times|first1=Kareem|last1=Fahim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event sparked international media attention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/04/02/Worldwide-support-for-Egyptian-satirist-s-fight-for-free-speech.html|title=Worldwide support for Egyptian satirist's fight for free speech|agency=Al Arabiya|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a segment on Jon Stewart's ''The Daily Show'' in which he declared his support for Youssef, calling him a "friend" and "brother".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyDOAQNsTrI|title=The Daily Show: Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, and Bassem Youssef|agency=YouTube|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Al Bernameg'' ended, the Egyptian police raided the offices of the production company, arresting several employees and confiscating their computers. According to Youssef, the police told producer Amr Ismail that they would continue harassing the company if Youssef did not stop speaking publicly at international conferences. The Egyptian courts then levied a E£50 million fine against Youssef in a contract dispute with CBC. In the verdict, the courts condemned satirical television shows and implied that Youssef was disrupting the peace and inciting public unrest. Fearing he would be arrested if he stayed in Egypt, Youssef fled to Dubai in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Youssef|first1=Bassem|title=Revolution for Dummies|date=March 2017|publisher=Dey Street|isbn=0062446894|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertram Orian "Pig Iron" Corbeau''' (February 9, 1894 – September 21, 1942) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman]] who played ten seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] for the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Hamilton Tigers]], [[Toronto St. Pats]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. He was a member of the Canadiens' first [[Stanley Cup]] championship team in 1916. His brother [[Con Corbeau|Con]] also played professional ice hockey.

==Playing career==
Corbeau played junior hockey for the Penetang Hockey Club from 1910 until 1912, when he moved up to the Penetang intermediate team. Corbeau signed as a professional with the [[Halifax Crescents]] in 1913, playing one season before signing with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 1914. Corbeau would be a member of the Canadiens until October 1922 when he was traded to the [[Hamilton Tigers]] for cash. In December 1923, he became a member of the [[Toronto St. Pats]] as part of a trade. He stayed with the Toronto franchise and was one of the original [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] before being waived in October 1927. He then played two seasons in the minor [[Canadian Professional Hockey League]] with Toronto Ravinia and the [[London Panthers]] before retiring as a player. From 1928 to 1929 he coached the Panthers and then for a decade was an NHL referee. Corbeau then returned to coaching with the Atlantic City Sea Gulls of the [[Eastern Hockey League]] from 1939 to 1942.

Corbeau finally left hockey and returned to Penetanguishene, where he lived and worked as a plant superintendent at the Midland Foundry and Machine Company (supporting Canada in [[World War II]]) until his death from a boating accident.

Corbeau was the first player to play for both the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs. In the 1926–27 season, he became the first player to record 100 minutes in penalties in one season. He was posthumously inducted into the Penetanguishene Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Awards and achievements==
* [[1915–16 NHA season|1916]] [[Stanley Cup]] Champion ([[Montreal Canadiens|Montreal]])
* 1940-1941 United States National Championships Finals
* 1987 Inducted into the Penetanguishene Sports Hall of Fame

==Death==
Corbeau died as the result of a boating accident in [[Georgian Bay]]. During a party hosted by Corbeau aboard his boat, the boat struck a sand bar. Portholes on the sides of the boat were open and water entered the boat through them, sinking the boat within a matter of minutes. Of the 42 persons aboard, 25 died, including Corbeau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yathehabsrule.com/2009/09/bert-corbeau-was-tough-but-not-for.html |title=Bert Corbeau was tough, but not for the waters of Georgian Bay |publisher=yatheabsrule.com |accessdate=2009-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718140044/http://www.yathehabsrule.com/2009/09/bert-corbeau-was-tough-but-not-for.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hockey card==
A collectible hockey card featuring Corbeau from the 1923–24 season is one of the rarest cards in existence. Only a handful were made by a company that featured them in a contest. Contestants who collected a complete set of 40 cards were awarded a pair of skates. The Corbeau card was "short printed" in order to limit the number of winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Holy Grail' of hockey cards among ultra-rare collection up for auction |first=Randy |last=Boswell |newspaper=The Montreal Gazette |publisher=Postmedia News |date=October 7, 2013 |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Holy+Grail+hockey+card+collections+heading+auction+block/9007129/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009224452/http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Holy%2BGrail%2Bhockey%2Bcard%2Bcollections%2Bheading%2Bauction%2Bblock/9007129/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertram Charles Percival Park''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]], (1883-1972) was a [[portrait photographer]] whose work included British and European royalty. Engravings of his photographs were widely used on British and British Commonwealth [[postage stamps]], currency, and other official documents in the 1930s. His theatrical portraits were the source for two paintings by [[Walter Sickert]]. With his wife [[Yvonne Gregory]], he also produced a number of photographic books of the female nude. He was an expert in the cultivation of the rose and the editor of ''The Rose Annual''.

==Early life==
Bertram Charles Percival Park was born in [[Minster-in-Thanet|Minster]], Kent, England, in 1883 to Charles Percival Park and Katharine Mary Park.&lt;ref name=club&gt;[http://thecameraclub.co.uk/2012/09/bertram-park/ Bertram Park.] ''[[The Camera Club]]''.

==Photographic career==
In 1910, Bertram Park was one of the founders of the London Salon of Photography. In 1919, with funding from the Egytologist [[Lord Carnarvon]], he established studios at 43 [[Dover Street]], London, with his wife Yvonne and the children's photographer [[Marcus Adams (photographer)|Marcus Adams]].&lt;ref name=npgpark/&gt; They shared darkroom staff and facilities and were known as the "Three Photographers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp04999/marcus-adams?role=art Marcus Adams.] National Portrait Gallery.

Park and Gregory were also noted for their publicity photographs for theatrical productions. In 1924 they photographed the first English production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' starring [[Sybil Thorndike]].&lt;ref name=arena/&gt;

In 1932, [[Walter Sickert]] produced his portrait of the actress ''Miss Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as Isabella of France'', ("''La Louve''"), directly from a Park photograph without taking any sittings with [[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies|Ffrangcon-Davies]], although they were closely acquainted. The source was acknowledged by Sickert in an inscription on the painting.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; Park's photograph was in black and white so Sickert was obliged to add colour to the painting, however, he used a restricted palette causing the critic [[Frank Rutter]] to describe the work as "practically a monochrome".&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rose, Martial.|title=Forever Juliet: The life and letters of Gwen Ffrancon-Davies, 1891-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIOoYGF9LrgC&amp;pg=PA61|year=2003|publisher=Larks Press|location=Guist Bottom, Dereham|isbn=978-1-904006-12-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sickert also greatly enlarged the proportions, resulting in a finished work of 245 x 92 cm.

'''Buyeo Pung''' (扶餘豊, 623 – 668) was a prince of [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. He was son of the last king, [[Uija of Baekje]]. When Baekje fell to the [[Silla-Tang alliance]] in 660, he was a hostage who mortgaged the alliance of Paekche with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Samguk Sagi | language = Korean | url = http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | quote = 王子扶餘豊 嘗質於倭國者 立之爲王 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000151/http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was shortly unofficially proclaimed king.

He came back with a Japanese army and [[Yamato period|Yamato]] general [[Abe no Hirafu]] to revive the country. General [[Boksin]] of the Baekje revival forces gave him the title King Pungjang (풍장왕, 豊璋王). He joined forces with the Baekje resistance led by general [[Boksin]]. In 663, however, the Baekje resistance and Japan lost the [[Battle of Baekgang]] to the army of Tang and Silla, and Baekje collapsed. The prince fled to neighboring [[Goguryeo]]. When Goguryeo collapsed, he was captured by the Tang army and sent to southern [[China]] in exile. His later life is unknown.

One of his brothers, Zenkō (善光 or 禅広), settled in Japan and was given the family name [[Kudara no Konikishi]] (百濟王; king of Baekje) by the emperor of Japan.

'''Charles Gordon Henderson''' (11 July 1900 – 24 September 1933) was a historian and [[antiquarian]] of [[Cornwall]].

==Biography==
His father, Major J. S. Henderson, was half Scottish and half of the Irish family of Newenham: his mother was a Carus-Wilson from [[Westmorland]]. Both, however, were born and bred in Cornwall, and a portion of Cornish ancestry came to him through his mother's mother, one of the Willyamses of [[Carnanton House|Carnanton]] in [[Mawgan-in-Pydar]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Charles (1935) ''Essays in Cornish History''; edited by A. L. Rowse and M. I. Henderson. London: Oxford University Press; [memoir], p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

He was at [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]] for a short time but left on account of ill-health. For this reason he was frequently sent home from school for rest, and spent a large amount of his time walking over Cornwall and studying Cornish monuments and history. He collected a large number of documents from all over the county.

Henderson went to [[New College, Oxford]] and took his degree with first-class honours in [[modern history]] in 1922. He was a lecturer at [[University of Exeter|University College, Exeter]], and afterwards at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he was elected to an official fellowship as tutor in modern history in 1929. He had settled down at Oxford, and was showing great promise as a teacher and lecturer.

In 1928 Henderson published a book on Cornish bridges in collaboration with Henry Coates. Whenever he was able he would return to Cornwall and continue his historical research which in the early years was concerned very largely with the four western [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]] ([[Penwith Hundred|Penwith]], [[Kerrier Hundred|Kerrier]], [[Hundreds of Cornwall#Pydarshire|Pydar]] and [[Hundreds of Cornwall#Powdershire|Powder]]) but finally he planned a parochial history of the whole county on a grand scale.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Charles (1935) ''Essays in Cornish History''; edited by A. L .Rowse and M. I. Henderson. London: Oxford University Press; [memoir], p. xvi–xvii, xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Married life and death===
On 19 June 1933, he married (Mary) Isobel Munro, a fellow of [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] and daughter of [[John Arthur Ruskin Munro|J A R Munro]], the Rector of [[Lincoln College, Oxford]]; at the end of August, he set out with her for southern Italy. He had been troubled for some months with pains in his chest and they attacked him severely at [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|Monte Sant'Angelo]] on the Gargano, where he was visiting the shrine of the Cornish patron [[St Michael]]. He died in Rome eleven days later, on 24 September, of heart-failure following [[pleurisy]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Charles (1935) ''Essays in Cornish History''; edited by A. L. Rowse and M. I. Henderson. London: Oxford University Press; [memoir], p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]], between the [[Porta San Paolo]] and [[Monte Testaccio]], a place that he knew well: also in that cemetery are the graves of [[Keats]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] and [[Edward John Trelawny]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Charles (1935) ''Essays in Cornish History''; edited by A. L. Rowse and M. I. Henderson. London: Oxford University Press; [memoir], p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly work==
Henderson’s publications included ''Cornwall; A Guide'' in collaboration with [[J. C. Tregarthen]], in 1925; three books on Cornish churches; and another on Cornish coasts, moors, and valleys with notes on antiquities. In 1928 he was made a [[Bard]] of the [[Cornish Gorseth]] at [[Boscawen-Un]], taking the [[bardic name]] ''Map Hendra'' ('Son of the Old Farmstead'). His collection of documents is held at the Courtney Library of the [[Royal Institution of Cornwall]] in [[Truro]]. The collection includes 16,000 ancient documents, many hundreds of transcripts in Henderson's hand, and his own writings either in published form or in manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Charles (1935) ''Essays in Cornish History''; edited by A L Rowse and M I Henderson. London: Oxford University Press; [memoir], p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his book on Cornish bridges, Henderson prepared notes for a similar book on the bridges of [[Devon]]. After his death the civil engineer Edwyn Jervoise completed the book and it was published in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henderson |first1=Charles |author1-link=Charles Henderson (historian) |last2=Jervoise |first2=Edwyn |year=1938 |title=Old Devon Bridges |place=Exeter |publisher=A Wheaton &amp; Co |pages=3–5}}

'''Elliot Welles''' (birth name '''Kurt Sauerquell'''; 18 September 1927 – 28 November 2006) was a [[Holocaust]] survivor who for more than two decades until his retirement in 2003, directed the [[B'nai B'rith]] [[Anti-Defamation League]]'s task force on [[Nazi war criminals]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/nyregion/03welles.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Elliot%20Welles&amp;st=cse|title= Elliot Welles Is Dead at 79; Indefatigable Nazi Hunter|last1= Fox|first1= Margalit|last2= |first2= |date= December 3, 2006|work= [[The New York Times]]|publisher= |accessdate= 22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles was a survivor of both the [[Riga Ghetto]] and the [[Stutthof concentration camp]] in German occupied  Poland.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

Welles is known in particular for his work on the case of [[Boļeslavs Maikovskis]], who had been charged with ordering the arrests that led to the mass execution of 200 Latvian villagers during the war. A native of [[Latvia]], Maikovskis was sentenced to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] court in 1965. He continued to live quietly in [[Mineola, New York]], where he had settled after the war, before fleeing to Germany in 1987.&lt;ref name="Robert McG. Thomas 1996"&gt; Thomas, Robert McG.[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/08/nyregion/boleslavs-maikovskis-92-fled-war-crimes-investigation.html "Boleslavs Maikovskis, 92; Fled War-Crimes Investigation".] ''[[The New York Times]]''. 8 May 1996. Retrieved 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of Welles' tireless work on this case, Maikovskis (then 86) was put on trial in Germany in 1990. The trial was suspended in 1994 because of Maikovskis' failing health. Maikovskis died two years later.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert McG. Thomas 1996"/&gt; 

Another well-known case that Welles assisted with was the [[extradition]] of [[Josef Schwammberger]], a Nazi labor camp commander, from Argentina where he had been living for at least 40 years.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

==Early life==

Gao Jianfu was born in 1879 in the city of Canton, located in the [[Guangdong]] Province.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

==Education==

When Gao Jianfu was thirteen, he entered the studio of Chinese artist [[Ju Lian]] in Lishan, and for the next seven years he acted as his apprentice. During his time with Ju Lian, Gao Jianfu painted in a similar style as his master: bright, colorful, and realistic. The subject matter of his paintings were mainly birds, flowers, and landscapes.&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt; At Ju Lian's studio, Gao Jianfu became close friends with Chen Shuren, a fellow artist.

In 1903, Gao Jianfu began working under the painter and collector Wu Deyi. Here he was introduced to works of the Chinese tradition.&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt;

He studied at the Canton Christian College, now known as [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan University]]. Two of his most influential instructors included "a French teacher of painting only known by his Chinese name, Mai La,"&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt; and Yamamoto Baigai, one of the many Japanese teachers then in China. Greatly inspired by his professors, Jianfu felt compelled to leave for [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt;

==Time in Japan==

In the winter of 1906, Gao Jianfu left for Tokyo. After spending some time there and finding himself poor and without much food, he returned to Canton for the summer. In 1907, Jianfu returned to Tokyo with his nineteen-year-old brother, Gao Qifeng.&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt; They met up with their friend Chen Shuren.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

During his time in Japan, the three men were exposed to the [[nationalist]] debates "then ranging in the Japanese art world over the modernizing impact of Western art on [[Japan]]'s local artistic traditions."&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt; Jianfu became interested in the syntheses of Western and traditional approaches, which were parallel to work in the contemporary Japanese art world. Jianfu, along with his peers of the Lingnan School, saw this blend of styles as a model for modern national art. Many of the Lingnan students joined [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s anti-Manchu movement, a revolutionary nationalist movement.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

==Artwork==
Jianfu once wrote: "I think we should not only take in elements of Western painting. If there are good points in Indian painting, Egyptian painting, Persian painting, or masterpieces of other countries, we should embrace all of them too, as nourishment for Chinese painting."&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt;

Although Jianfu was greatly interested in Western art and joined societies that promoted this style, his artwork during his time in Japan shows little influence of Western art. His art mainly reflects the work of nihonga painters like [[Kano Hogai]], [[Hashimoto Gaho]], and [[Takeuchi Seiho]]. Often Jianfu would paint flowers, plants, and grasses. He also took inspiration from traditional Chinese artists [[Tang Yin]] and [[Lan Ying]].&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt;

In the 1920s, Jianfu's paintings showcased elements of "realism derived from Western art," as well as traditional Chinese ink and brushwork. The subject matter of his work strayed away from the themes of traditional art (i.e. flowers, birds, landscapes, etc.) and focused more on contemporary reality.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

In 1927 the connection between his art and political agenda was made clear with the unveiling of a new exhibit in Canton. The series of airplane paintings showcased a banner with Sun Yat-sen's slogan, "Aviation to Save the Country." This propaganda can especially be seen in Jianfu's paintings, "New Battlefield," "Air Defense," and "Flying in the Rain."&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

Throughout his time in Macao during World War II, Jianfu painted ''Skulls Crying over the Nation's Fate.'' It depicted a pile skulls lying in a field of grass.

==Later years==

===Work with Gao Qifeng===
In 1912, after the overthrow of the [[Manchus]], Gao Jianfu and his brother moved to [[Shanghai]]. They began publishing a journal titled ''Zhen xiang huabao'' (''The True Record''). It featured articles on art and politics, as well as published essays promoting a new, modernized national art in China.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt; Although it ran for only a year, the journal was one of the first to bring art to the public.&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt; The brothers advocated government support of the arts.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt; The two also opened the nation's first public galleries for the exhibit and sale of art works, the Aesthetic Bookstore.

Jianfu and Qifeng stayed in Shanghai till 1918. By 1923, the brothers established the Spring Awakening Art Academy in Canton.&lt;ref name=Lingnan /&gt;

===Later life===

In 1929, Jianfu was accused of anti-foreign sentiments during his time as the chief organizer of the government's first National Art Exhibition held in [[Nanjing]]. Because The Lingnan School was featured prominently, there was hostile response for the inclusion of non-Chinese artistic tendencies.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

In 1936, Jianfu began teaching at [[Sun Yat-Sen University]]. He continued to publish articles, where he defended his concept of new national art. He suggested that national painting abandon the "elitism" of traditional art, and engage more directly with the Chinese public.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

In 1938, Gao Jianfu left Japanese-occupied Canton for the island of [[Macao]]. He returned to Canton in 1945. At the time [[Mao Zedong]] came to power in 1949, Jianfu once again fled to Macao.&lt;ref name=McCloskey /&gt;

He died in 1951.

'''George Augustus Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvedere''' (12 October 1738 – 13 May 1814) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] peer and politician.

==Early years==
[[File:Mary Molesworth, Lady Belvedere.jpeg|thumb|Mary Molesworth, Lady Belvedere, George's mother]]
George Augustus Rochfort was born on 12 October 1738, son of [[Robert Rochfort, 1st Earl of Belvedere]] and Hon. Mary Molesworth.{{sfn|Burke|1866|p=457}} The [[Rochfort family]], originally called De Rupe Forti, had settled in Ireland in 1243.{{sfn|Edmondson|1785|p=285}} Sir Maurice de Rochfort was [[Lord Justices (Ireland)|Lord Justice of Ireland]] in 1302. Gerald Rochfort was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1339. 
George's great-grandfather was the prominent lawyer [[Robert Rochfort]], [[Attorney General of Ireland]] and Speaker of the House of Commons in 1695, and [[List of Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer|Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]] in 1707.{{sfn|The Gentleman's Magazine 1814|p=625}} The family estate of Gaulstown lay on the shore of [[Lough Ennell]] in [[County Westmeath]].{{sfn|Cullen|1922|p=167}}{{efn|[[Jonathan Swift]] was a close friend of the Rochforts of Gaulstown. It is thought that his ''Letter to a Very Young Lady on her Marriage'' (1727) was addressed to the wife of John Rochfort.{{sfn|Hornbeak|1944|p=183}}
Swift conceived the idea of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726) on Lough Ennell. The lake has a park named after the author.{{sfn|Davenport|2010|p=529}} }}

George's father, Robert Rochfort, was a favourite courtier of King [[George II of Great Britain]]. He was made an Irish peer as Baron of Bellfield in 1737, and then [[Earl of Belvedere]] in 1756. He was estranged from his mother for his of his childhood, after his father locked her away after an alleged affair with George's uncle, Arthur.{{sfn|Hopkins|2003|p=21}}

==Politician==

From 1756 to 1774 George Rochfort was styled Viscount Belfield.
He was [[List of Irish MPs 1727–60|Member of Parliament]] for [[Philipstown (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Philipstown]] from 1758–61, and [[List of Irish MPs 1761–68|Member of Parliament]] for [[Westmeath (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Westmeath]] from 1761–1774.{{sfn|George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvidere, The Peerage}}
The 1761 parliamentary election in County Westmeath followed the death of King [[George II of Great Britain]].
George Rochfort, the Right Honorable Lord Belfield, won the election. He was supported by The Honorable Captain Richard Rochfort, Esq. and opposed by Mr. George Rochfort and Gustavus Lambert. The election thus seems to have been very much a family affair. Mr. George Rochfort supported the "Patriots", who demanded that parliaments last only seven years before being dissolved, rather than for the lifetime of the king, as was the custom.{{sfn|Woods|1925|p=24}}{{efn|The 1861 Westmeath election illustrates the process followed at that time. Polling took place openly in court over an eight-day period from 11–19 May 1761. George Rochfort first declared his principles, but Lord Belfield and Captain Rochfort declined to do so. A voter could vote for more than one candidate, and could be challenged before being allowed to vote. Lord Belfield and Captain Rochfort had 300 friends in town at their expense, while George Rochfort had no more than forty friends, and not at his expense. 
In the end 606 voters gave 459 votes to Lord Belfield, 343 to his colleague Captain Richard Rochfort, and 259 to their opponent George Rochfort.{{sfn|Woods|1925|p=26}}
272 votes received objections, mostly from Mr. George Rochfort, but most objections were dismissed. Reasons for objection included want of due registry, a technicality, undue influence, insufficiency of freehold or having a papist wife, being a papist or educating his children in the papish religion.{{sfn|Woods|1925|p=27}} }}

In 1762 George Rochfort was Sheriff of County Westmeath, and from 1772 to 1814 he was a Governor of County Westmeath.{{sfn|George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvidere, The Peerage}}
An anonymous writer named "Dymoke" published a ''Review of the House of Commons'' in the ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'' in 1774.
The purpose was to "rouse the electors of Ireland to a due exertion of their lawful powers, and stimulate them to fix 
on proper men to maintain their rights and privileges in parliament."{{sfn|Kelly|Dymoke|2004|p=163}}
He noted that Belfield, who was muster-master-general of Ireland and a Governor of the County of Westmeath, had voted for the stamp act.{{sfn|Kelly|Dymoke|2004|p=173}}
Dykmore declared that "The present members [Lord Belfield; Anthony Malone] for the County of WESTMEATH will never represent it again, if the Electors have either sense, 
honour, or remembrance".{{sfn|Kelly|Dymoke|2004|p=209}}

==Irish peer==
[[File:Jane Rochfort Lady Lanesborough 1737-1828.jpeg|thumb|George's older sister, Jane, Lady Lanesborough]]
On 13 November 1774 Rochfort succeeded to the titles of Baron Belfield, Viscount Belfield and [[Earl of Belvedere]] after his father's death.{{sfn|George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvidere, The Peerage}}
He released his mother.{{sfn|Belvedere House, Co. Westmeath, Ask About Ireland}}
She was prematurely aged, spoke in little more than a whisper but in a harsh, agitated and uneven manner, and was dressed in the style of thirty years earlier.{{sfn|Littell|Littell|1847|p=124}}

From 1775–76 Rochfort was Grand Master of the Freemasons [[Grand Lodge of Ireland]].{{sfn|George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvidere, The Peerage}}
On 20 August 1775 he married Dorothea Bloomfield, daughter of John Bloomfield and Jane Jocelyn.{{sfn|George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvidere, The Peerage}}
George Rochfort took his mother with him when he and his new wife visited the continent, but she found the travel too difficult. 
They left her to recuperate in a convent in France while they visited Italy for a few months, spending the winter in [[Florence]]. 
The next year the couple returned to London, where George's mother stayed with a friend in [[Kensington Palace]] for a year.{{sfn|Littell|Littell|1847|p=124}}
She then returned to Ireland and lived first with George in Dublin and then with his sister, now Countess of Lanesborough, and her young family. 
She died a few years after her husband.{{sfn|Littell|Littell|1847|p=125}}

Rochfort had [[The Belvedere Hotel (Dublin)|Belvedere House]] built on [[Great Denmark Street]], Dublin, at the great sum of £24,000.{{sfn|Hopkins|2003|p=21}}
The site had been owned by Nicholas Archdall.{{sfn|Bennett|1991|p=12}}
The building had been started by the first Earl, with Robert West as architect. Rochfort and his wife apparently did not plan to complete the work, and in 1777 offered it for sale. Later they decided to complete the house for their own use, and gave the job to [[Michael Stapleton]].{{sfn|Casey|2005|p=174}}
It was finally completed and occupied in 1786, and probably stood alone at first, since in 1787 Rochfort was recorded as living in North Great George's Street.{{sfn|Irish Georgian Society|1969|p=57}}
George's mother is thought to have died there.{{sfn|Hopkins|2003|p=21}}{{efn|There are few records of Mary Rochfort's life after 1774, and she may have never seen Belvedere House in Dublin. However, the legend arose that she haunted that house. [[James Joyce]], who grew up nearby, alluded to the story of the adultery, imprisonment and haunting in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.{{sfn|Manglaviti|1999–2000|p=217}} }}

During the struggle over the [[Acts of Union 1800]], Rochfort's position on the union of the crowns of Britain and Ireland was uncertain. A letter of 25 January 1800 from [[John Browne, 1st Marquess of Sligo|Lord Altamont]] to the [[Richard Bingham, 2nd Earl of Lucan|Earl of Lucan]] said "Ld Belvedere has touched Government cash &amp; possibly may not exert all his influence to give value in return for it."{{sfn|Clesham|2002|p=27}}

Rochfort's first wife died on 6 April 1803, and on 10 November 1803 he married Jane Mackay, daughter of Reverend James Mackay.
They had one son, who died in infancy.{{sfn|George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvidere, The Peerage}}
George Augustus Rochfort died in Great Denmark Street, Dublin on 13 May 1814 at the age of 75.{{sfn|The Gentleman's Magazine 1814|p=625}}
He is buried in St Sinian, Clonfad Parish Church, of the [[Church of Ireland]]. His tomb is adorned with a full-scale [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] sculptural group by [[John Bacon (sculptor, 1777–1859)|John Bacon the younger]]. It represents the earl on his death bed, with his young wife weeping at the end. He is supported by Faith and an angelic figure is beckoning him to heaven.{{sfn|Casey|Rowan|1993|p=530}}

Rochfort had no surviving children, and his three peerages became extinct.{{sfn|The Gentleman's Magazine 1814|p=625}}
On his death his sister Jane inherited the whole settled part of his great estate, since his brothers had died without children.{{sfn|Malcomson|2006|p=24}}{{efn|George's siblings were Jane (born 30 October 1737), Richard (2 December 1739 – 26 December 1776) and Robert (1743 – December 1772).{{sfn|Edmondson|1785|p=285}} 
Jane died in Florence, Italy, in July 1828 at the age of 90, leaving her estate to her grandson, the Earl of Lanesborough.{{sfn|Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review 1828|p=82}} }}
He left his entire unsettled estate to his wife. This consisted of at least 2,500 Irish acres, bringing in a large income. 
The fortune was passed down to his wife's children by her second marriage.{{sfn|Malcomson|2006|p=24}}

[[File:Volksschule Haynrode (1940) 2 C.jpg|thumb|First day of school for children in [[Haynrode|Haynrode/Germany]] (1940)]]
'''German Childhood in World War II''' describes how the [[World War II|Second World War]], as well as experiences related to it,&lt;ref name="erster_wk" /&gt; directly or indirectly impacted the life of children born in that era. In Germany, these children  became known as [[Childhood in war|''war children'']], a term that came into use due to a large number of scientific and popular science publications which have appeared increasingly since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="andere_kriege" /&gt; They describe the same phenomena from different perspectives, using diverse methods and various stylistic means. The literature on this subject has not yet been able to produce a universal and binding definition. However, there is consensus that the impact of war on children can be felt decades later,&lt;ref name="spuerbar" /&gt; often increasing with advancing age, and that at times the impact can be passed on  ''mute'' to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="weitergabe" /&gt;

== The Term War Child ==
“War does not stop when the weapons fall silent.” Into this simple formula German author Sabine Bode condensed the impact of war on human health. In 2015, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's capitulation]] and liberation from the Nazis –&amp;nbsp;[[Victory in Europe Day]]&amp;nbsp;– she had been invited by [[Phoenix (German TV station)]] to discuss “how we feel the war to this day”&lt;ref name="phoenix_bode" /&gt; with respect to grandchildren of war. Together with [[Katrin Himmler]], Randi Crott and [[Jens Orback]], Sabine Bode participated in a round table discussion. None of the participants provided a definition of the two main terms, ''children of war'' and ''grand-children of  war''. Katrin Himmler, however, named an important characteristic when she stated that “by far the most” war children in Germany were impacted “not only by the war”, but “also by the pedagogy of the [[Nazism|National Socialists]]”.&lt;ref name="phoenix_himmler" /&gt; Author Matthias Lohre had already attempted a definition as early as 2014: “For those born between 1930 and 1945, the term war children has become understood as youth who were too young for direct participation in the war, but old enough to suffer from hunger, expulsion and bomb attacks, loss of family members, separation and fear of death.”&lt;ref name="lohre_2014" /&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-19000-1661, Berlin, Kinder spielen in Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Children playing in ruins in Berlin (1948)]]
The concept is unquestionably aimed at a generation that spent part of its childhood in Germany during the Second World War, “for whom –&amp;nbsp;without necessarily being threatened by organized annihilation&amp;nbsp;– experiences of violence, separation and loss were, at least to some degree, impacting their life”.&lt;ref name="seegers" /&gt; Not all authors agree which age groups to include. Some writers want to include children born shortly after the war because even in 1950, according to journalist Sabine Bode, “nine million children in West Germany lived in conditions that were inadequate, often unworthy for humans.”&lt;ref name="lohre_2014" /&gt; Years later, war children and their younger siblings still played in ruins left over from bombings. There is also no agreement at the other end of the scale as to what birth years to include. While Matthias Lohre and others include the children born in 1930, Michael Ermann restricts the term in his studies, referring to the “fate of the generation of non-Jewish Germans born in the Second World War”.&lt;ref name="ermann_2004" /&gt; Jewish children, who were neither deported nor murdered, are generally not included in this definition. For them the term ''survivors''&lt;ref name="ueberlebende" /&gt; is used as they were exposed to additional and very specific threats to their lives which necessitated living in hiding. [[Anne Frank]] describes this in her book [[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]] which was published in German in 1950.

|text=It is characteristic for the generation of the so-called ''war children of the Second World War'' that until the beginning of the 1990s they did not receive any attention either in scientific research or in public consciousness. There was not even an awareness by those whose specific developmental background had been impacted.|author=Christa Müller |source=Dissertation 2014&lt;ref name="mueller_1" /&gt;}}

It can not be assumed that the term has comparable meanings in languages of other European countries.&lt;ref name="polen" /&gt; For example, the English term ''war children'', as well as the French term ''enfant de la guerre'', define the concept narrower, as a synonym for [[War children|''Besatzungskind'']] –&amp;nbsp;a child of a native mother and a father who is member of an occupying military force –&amp;nbsp;describing implications associated with that situation.&lt;ref name="besatzungskinder" /&gt;

Additional terms describing the various aspects and experiences of the war child generation, besides ''Besatzungskind'', have been developed in Germany as well. These include, for example, the children of [[Lebensborn]] (an association in Nazi Germany whose goal was to raise the birth rate of racially pure Aryan children), the children of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced laborers]], or the so-called [[Wolf children]] who grew up without parents in the Baltics and had to hide their origins. Additional issues were raised with respect to war [[orphan]]s or [[Wartime sexual violence|children of war-related rape]]. Further, the high number of children of married parents who had lost their father in the war or had never met him &lt;ref name="gabriele_trost" /&gt; represent another group which has specific characteristics,&lt;ref name="radebold" /&gt; as well as those children who had not met their fathers until after the end of the war or after their release from [[Prisoner-of-war camp|prisoner of war camps]].

An extensive amount of literature deals specifically with the fate of Jewish children,&lt;ref name="juedische_kinder" /&gt; like the [[Kindertransport]] which brought Jewish children to the UK, the rescue of Jewish children by [[Youth Aliyah]] Child Rescue, or the support of these children by the ''Swiss charity organization for emigrant children''.

Finally, there is another group of children who are usually not considered ''war children'' because of their special affiliation with [[Heimatvertriebene]], Germans who were foreced to flee after being expelled from areas that became part of other countries during post-war restructuring. These expellees were, in contrast to the war children in general, a “public topic” during the post-war period “in the West of the divided country.”&lt;ref name="bode_26" /&gt; Still another group are the war children of the [[World War I|First World War]]. They are generally not included in the relevant literature, although they should also be considered as such.

After years of efforts to bring together what the ''war children'' have in common, [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] Michael Ermann, in his farewell lecture on the occasion of his retirement in March 2009, came to the following conclusion: “The 'German war children' do not exist. Their fates are much too diverse. [...] All of this requires individual consideration rather than a generalization.”&lt;ref name="ermann_2009" /&gt; But if there is something that “connects the different fates –&amp;nbsp;the ones in the East, the West, the North and the South, the children of the night bombings and the refugee children”&amp;nbsp;– then it would be a striking “lack of fright and consternation about one's own fate!”&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt;

== History ==
In 2003 –&amp;nbsp;almost sixty years after the end of the war&amp;nbsp;–  Ermann, who describes himself as a “typical war child”,&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt; launched ''Project War Childhood'' at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. He was joined by a prominent international scientific advisory board. In 2009 the project was completed with a series of scientific publications.&lt;ref name="forschung" /&gt;

|text=There is an overwhelming number of war children who for decades have been treated with psychotherapy. Nevertheless, while  there is hardly any literature dealing with the traumatization and the identity problems of the war children, the existing literature received very little acceptance. |author= Michael Ermann|source=Lecture at the [[Südwestrundfunk]] radio station in Germany, November 2003&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt;}}

''The Inability to Mourn'', a book published by [[Alexander Mitscherlich (psychologist)|Alexander]] and [[Margarete Mitscherlich-Nielsen|Margarete Mitscherlich]] in 1967 that deals with the consequences of the war experience, found broad public attention among Germans. Even though the authors were primarily focusing on adults, they provided an impetus for later research on ''war children'' where the symptoms described by the Mitscherlichs were also found. The inability to mourn, they wrote, had produced a behaviour based on “denial” which may have led to “self-confidence more uncertain than it could have been.”&lt;ref name="mitscherlich" /&gt;

It was not until the late 1980s, after 20 more years had passed, that the topic of ''childhood of war'' came into the public discourse in Germany. Why so much time had to pass is attributed to various factors. Ermann recalls “feelings of guilt [...] as a result of [[the Holocaust]]”&lt;ref name="ermann_2004" /&gt; and the “refusal to remember during the years of the [[Wirtschaftswunder]]”, the economic miracle after the war. Finally, “trauma-specific defense mechanisms” should be taken into account.&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt; The journalist Hilke Lorenz said that the war children had fallen into a “history gap”.&lt;ref name="lorenz" /&gt; And the author Alexandra Senfft,&lt;ref name="senfft_2008" /&gt; the granddaughter of the war criminal [[Hanns Ludin]], recalled the taboos: “To deal with the crimes of one's own relatives hurts, it makes you afraid and sad.” Even “thinking about the worst was a taboo in my family”.&lt;ref name="senfft_2007" /&gt;

“Politically more volatile” was probably the feared “accusation by Shoa survivors” that “looking at war children” could lead to “relativize the murder of the Jews”. In 2005, at the first interdisciplinary conference in Frankfurt –&amp;nbsp;which had devoted itself to the war children&lt;ref name="vorwurf_relativierung" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the representative of the Jewish congregation “distanced himself” from such a proposal. The answer clarified that “it was not a matter of opening up a ‘victim competition’ but, on the contrary, classifying one's own differentiated experiences into the European memory, as well as identifying the suffering due to the silencing of the ‘deeds’ by the parent generation.”&lt;ref name="seegers" /&gt; It is no coincidence therefore that Sabine Bode –&amp;nbsp;in her book about ''grand-children of war''&amp;nbsp;– addressed the question of “how perpetrators became victims”.&lt;ref name="bode_26" /&gt; in a separate section.

[[Psychological testing]] was absent in the discussion until 1980 when the diagnosis of [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) was included in the DSM III, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].&lt;ref name="bauer_11" /&gt;  Within less than 10&amp;nbsp;years thereafter, the publications on the psychological consequences of war on childhood increased in Germany. Since then, numerous authors have reported very personal accounts about their own childhood, have accepted this subject more generally, or have begun to publish scientific studies.

Bode noted that while 70&amp;nbsp;years after the end of the war an “academic review” had taken place –&amp;nbsp;by representatives of various scientific disciplines&amp;nbsp;– but that only recently an “emotional process” had begun.&lt;ref name="phoenix_bode_2" /&gt; Katrin Himmler is also convinced that “we have not yet processed this within families”.&lt;ref name="phoenix_himmler_2" /&gt; Anyone who tries to do this will sooner or later be confronted with the question of their own identity. Christa Müller drew attention to the fact that the “path to a mature national as well as individual identity [...] requires a self-critical examination of the far-reaching influences of the events in National Socialist Germany, in the Second World War and in the post-war period”.&lt;ref name="mueller_2" /&gt; For [[Raed Saleh (German politician)|Raed Saleh]], a German politician, the discussions about the term revolve around a question that “remains unresolved”: “How does Germany define its national identity”? He suggests that we would have to “redefine” it:

“Politicians of the [[Alternative for Germany]] party are demanding to end memory culture in Germany, and they are not the only ones.” On February 18, 2017, during a radio program titled ''There must be an end to it –&amp;nbsp;Remembrance Culture in Germany''&amp;nbsp;– Ulrich Gineiger published a report about the pros and cons of this issue. In this report, representatives of both positions were heard.&lt;ref name="deutschlandfunk" /&gt; In the foreground were “older people [...] who spoke about their traumatic experiences during the Nazi regime” as well as how they remembered it in later years. In addition, the heads of various cultural institutions and memorial sites talked about their experiences with their visitors. The project [[Stolperstein]]e (Stumbling Blocks) by the artist [[Gunter Demnig]] which is receiving international attention also played a role in the documentation.

== Raising of Children and Youth During the Nazi Era ==
The [[Education in Germany|raising of children and youth]] during the National Socialist era was the lens through which not all, but most war children in Germany experienced the war and its affects. In 1934 one of the most powerful publishing houses of that period released a guidebook by Johanna Haarer –&amp;nbsp;one of the well-known [[Women in Nazi Germany]]&amp;nbsp;– on the topic of infant care. This book, ''The German Mother and her First Child'', was in its tenth edition at the end of the war. It is still on the market, with changes that obscure its origin and ideology, not revealing the year of its first appearance.&lt;ref name="haarer" /&gt; In her critical analysis of this and another book on child-rearing by Haarer, Sigrid Chamberlain concludes that child-raising and education in [[Nazi Germany]] and the early post-war years are characterized by coldness, harshness, and indifference. She views these theories as a “seamless transition into the ideology and the institutions of the Nazi state”, stating that it is “time” to deal with the fact that “the majority of those born during the Third Reich and the post-war years were released into life with early Nazi ideology, without ever realizing this fact and its possible consequences.“&lt;ref name="chamberlain" /&gt; In 1977 the concept of “Black Pedagogy”, introduced by sociologist [[Katharina Rutschky]], was established, summarizing –&amp;nbsp;among other concepts&amp;nbsp;– the child-raising and educational methods of this period.

While Chamberlain had investigated the question of how it was possible to carry the ideology of the time into the nurseries, Hans-Peter de Lorent has been researching the socialization in the educational systems since the 1980s. Already politically active as a student, he recalls that “in 1968, for example, as speaker of the student counsel, I called for participation in the ''Sternmarsch'', a march into [[Bonn]] –&amp;nbsp;then the German capital&amp;nbsp;– to protest against the proposed [[German Emergency Acts]]”. In 1981 as “editor of the Hamburger Lehrerzeitung”, a magazine for teachers, he had begun “to publish a series called ''Schooling under the [[Swastika]]''”&lt;ref name="lorent_ndr" /&gt; that dealt specifically with teachers who “resisted” the Nazi regime. In 1991, in a review of a book by Lutz van Dijk about resistance of teachers during the Nazi era,&lt;ref name="dick_buch" /&gt; the educational scientist Reiner Lehberger stated that, as early as 1936, 97 per cent of teachers belonged to the Nazi Teachers Association and 32 per cent were members of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="lehberger_zeit" /&gt;

{{Quote
|text='The principal guilt of the contamination of youth with a Nazi ideology of violence is borne by the teachers who were paid by the German Republic. History will judge them severely. ... '–&amp;nbsp;as was already documented in May of 1933 in a magazine by social democratic teachers who had emigrated to Czechoslovakia. |author=Reiner Lehberger |source=[[Die Zeit]]&lt;ref name="lehberger_zeit" /&gt; }}

Van Dijk's critical view of the twelve years of the Nazi era shows –&amp;nbsp;according to Lehberger&amp;nbsp;– that in the early years, “expressions of indignation [...] were mostly punished with reprimands", whereas “during the war they were considered as '[[Wehrkraftzersetzung]]'”, subversion of the war effort, and “not rarely endowed with the death penalty.”&lt;ref name="lehberger_zeit" /&gt;

In 2016, after years of research, using the city of Hamburg as an example, de Lorent published an 800-page book&lt;ref name="lorent_buch" /&gt; on the profiles of those teachers who taught war and post-war children in the schools of Germany. As a former school superintendent he was able to draw on earlier contacts who became very helpful in his research. Based on the profiles of 42 teachers, De Lorent not only described generally how “Nazi teachers made a career after the war”, but he also described details, using a Hamburg physical education teacher as an example, who had lit synagogues during the Nazi period and who beat his students after the war&lt;ref name="lorent_ndr_2" /&gt; The fact that pupils were still beaten by their teachers in the post-war years was not an exception, but the rule. “The so-called [[De-nazification]] had largely failed in the school system”, wrote journalist Uwe Bahnsen in his discussion of de Lorent's book.&lt;ref name="lorent_n24" /&gt;

Further information about the socialization of children during the Nazi period can be found in two online portals. In addition to the ''NS Documentation Centre'', the city of Cologne has put the ''Nazi Youth Project'' on the web.&lt;ref name="jugend_koeln_impressum" /&gt; In this way, a vast amount of richly compiled historical material regarding the Second World War is made accessible to the general public. On the page ''Youth in Germany 1918&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1945'', the various efforts to influence the war children –&amp;nbsp;such as in schools, camps, or the [[Evacuations of children in Germany during World War II|deportation of children]]&amp;nbsp;– are brought together, dedicating a chapter to each topic.&lt;ref name="jugend_koeln_ueberblick" /&gt; The collaborative portal ''Lebendiges Museum Online (LeMO)'', Living Museum Online&lt;ref name="lemo_projekt" /&gt; provides, in addition to other topics, thousands of pages, pictures, audio and video files about the Second World War and the post-war years, among them, for example, the poster ''Youth Serves the Leader''.&lt;ref name="lemo_plakat" /&gt; The post-war years, described as ''collapsed society''&lt;ref name="lemo_nachkrieg" /&gt; are documented under the title ''Life in Ruins''.&lt;ref name="lemo_truemmer" /&gt;

== Experiencing the War ==
“What would be the proportion of those who experienced horrible things and those who were lucky”, Bode asked in 2009, four years after the Congress In Frankfurt. According to Bode, the experts had been struggling since then “to come to estimate that one half had a normal childhood and the other half had not”. For the latter group, it was assumed that 25 per cent [experienced] “short-term or isolated [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|trauma]] and that a further 25 per cent were exposed to persistent and multiple traumatizing experiences.”&lt;ref name="bode_27" /&gt;

According to Bauer, “many war children still seem to be striving to explain their war experiences as trivial and normal”.&lt;ref name="bauer" /&gt; This is an almost unanimous conclusion, in the media as well as in science and research. Matthias Lohre collected “typical phrases”, like “that's the way it was” or “everyone experienced that”, used by war children to regularly play down their own experiences.&lt;ref name="lohre_2014" /&gt; Ermann calls it the “speechlessness” of war children, that he sees as “a counterpart to the lack of interest” by the public towards this fate.&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt;

{{Quote
|text=Many Germans compared their own suffering to that of the Jews, prisoners of war, and other victims of German barbarism. If at all, older people reported formulaicly about their experiences: 'Others were worse off than we.'|author=Matthias Lohre |source=Zeit Online&lt;ref name="lohre_2014" /&gt; }}

Ermann refers in this context to a “myth of invulnerability of children”. It was linked to the “ideology of heroism in [[National Socialism]]” which in an “unspoken way resonated in the processing of the Second World War, the Nazi period, and in post-war Germany. 'German' children are born to withstand hardship, and these children are not vulnerable. But if they are harmed, then they are not seen in their pain and suffering, but in their bravery with which they overcome their injuries.”&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt;

The reality was different, as psychoanalyst Luise Reddemann reported in detail in her lecture in Bad Krozingen in 2006.&lt;ref name="reddemann_2006" /&gt; And it was different for each of the war children. They brought with them individual preconditions and lived in different parts of Germany which were not all equally affected by the war. While some cities were laid in ruins and ashes, others were spared. While some children experienced [[hunger]], there was enough food in other places. While some survived [[firestorms]],&lt;ref name="feuersturm" /&gt; others did not know what that was. Not everyone knew about the nights in the bunkers during the air raids, not all were bombed, entombed by debris or lost their physical integrity. Those who were surrounded by family experienced the war differently from those who were left abandoned after the loss of family. Some children witnessed the rape of their mother or sister. And those whose homeland was preserved could not imagine the distress of the expellees. Unknown is the number of children who were not spared the experience of death. “That's the way it was.”&lt;ref name="lohre_2014" /&gt; Close your eyes and get through –&amp;nbsp;was the motto.

== Consequences of Childhood During War ==
When the war was over, the war children were confronted with their growing insight into the culpable entanglement of the parent generation. Emerging questions met denial or reactions of guilt and shame. Through the media they learned about the [[Nuremberg trials]] and were also witnessing societal efforts to restore a kind of normality which looked very different in the two parts of the country after the [[division of Germany]].

In addition to Bode, Ermann considers the war children to be a “generation of the inconspicuous” that has “produced only a small number of significant personalities”.&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt; Beyond such a view on the consequences of war on individual children –&amp;nbsp;a fairly typical one&amp;nbsp;– some authors also look at the possible societal consequences. One of these authors is [[Lloyd deMause]]. As a pioneer and one of the most important representatives of [[Psychohistory]] –&amp;nbsp;a theory which is considered controversial&amp;nbsp;– he connected the individual experience of the war children to the consequences that have broader societal impact. In several publications he analyzed the “expression of childhood trauma in politics” and came to the following daring conclusion:
{{Quote
|text=Restaging as a defense against [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociated trauma]] is the crucial flaw in the evolution of the human mind, [...] tragic in [...] its effects upon society, since it means that early traumas will be magnified onto the historical stage into war, domination and self-destructive social behavior. |author=[[Lloyd deMause]] |source=The Emotional Life of the Nations, 2005&lt;ref name="kurth" /&gt; }}

A vacancy in the literature regarding the war children remains. Neither Ermann nor other authors refer to the fact that the war generation and the generation of the so-called [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] movement have common experiences. [[Rudi Dutschke]], one of their most prominent representatives, was a war child.

== Characteristics of War Children ==
The war children's experiences before the war, and their various experiences during the war are different for each of them. Yet, despite such diversity, there are similarities which characterize them. Age plays an important role in the processing of experiences. Andrea Bauer summarized the results of various studies and concluded that “children between 5 and 9 years of age experience the greatest [[vulnerability]] as they are very aware of the events, but do not yet have sufficient [[coping strategies]]”.&lt;ref name="bauer_12" /&gt; Moreover, Bauer states that children interpret their experience “more through the direct contact with their reference persons” rather than through “the event itself” –&amp;nbsp;and how the reference persons “explain the events to the child, and in turn, how they interpret them for themselves”.&lt;ref name="bauer_12" /&gt;

In addition to the characteristics of war children already described, various features or [[symptoms]] can be identified. However, there are subgroups of war children about whom we still know “nothing”, German psychoanalyst Hartmut Radebold said in an interview in 2010. He mentioned, as an example, “the children who have been sent across Europe to protect them from the war” or those “who were placed into [[orphanage]]s after the war”.&lt;ref name="radebold_2010" /&gt; In 2014, the German TV station [[Südwestrundfunk]] provided little-known details about the childhood of some war children with the publication of two documentaries.&lt;ref name="swr" /&gt; On December 7, 2014, a documentary film by Ina Held,&lt;ref name="ina_held" /&gt; titled ''Journey Into an Intact World: German War Children in Switzerland'' was broadcast. These children were often called “Swiss Children”. Subsequently, Gerd Böhmer&lt;ref name="gerd_boehmer" /&gt; published the film “Escape Routes –&amp;nbsp;When Jewish Refugees Wanted to Go to Switzerland”. He had made this film together with students from [[Lörrach]] in order to “revisit the topic and create cross-generational interest”.&lt;ref name="badische_zeitung" /&gt;

=== Attributes ===
At times Ermann speaks of “quirks” when describing typical experiences or behaviors of war children. When these behaviours do not have symptomatic characteristics, they have long been regarded as personal whims rather than the consequences of war experiences.
{{Quote
|text=If there is anything conspicuous about us, it is most likely the little quirks: hardly any of us feels comfortable throwing away clothes or food. For many, dealing with time shows remarkable relics relating to escape and air attacks: the delay of saying good-bye and of making decisions, waiting to the very last second to use every bit of time, feeling indecisive while traveling, the chaos before departures. Or those strange, often unnoticed, small [[phobias]] when descending into a subway station, for example. And being startled by something banal, like the sirens of fire trucks passing by, or the creeping discomfort when a lonely plane flies over a dark blue sky in September. Yes, moods, the sudden [[Melancholia|melancholy]] in a certain light, feeling touched by open landscapes, the unease during some afternoons or quiet evenings, or specific smells or sounds. |author=Michael Ermann |source=''Wir Kriegskinder''&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt; }}

In addition, a number of “abnormalities” were found –&amp;nbsp;also below the threshold which makes people seek professional help&amp;nbsp;– such as “feelings of unfamiliarity” or “relationship disorders” or even a “feeling of great emptiness”, and the “impression not to live one's own life, standing beside oneself somehow”.&lt;ref name="spiegel_2009" /&gt; “Early [[parentification]]” is occasionally mentioned, as well as an “oppressive sense of responsibility”.&lt;ref name="seegers" /&gt; Often the experiences of the war had “crept into the sense of identity as blind spots”, Sabine Bode noted. In this context, she pointed to [[protective factor]]s: “Most of the war children succeeded in keeping their memories of fright at bay, especially by immersing themselves in work.”&lt;ref name="bode_26" /&gt; Luise Reddemann also recalled factors that protect them: “While it is true that traumatic experiences can cause damage and leave scars, it is also true that [[psychological resilience|resilience]] can prevent people from carrying life-long trauma-induced injuries. These factors should not be overlooked, as has happened for a long time.”&lt;ref name="reddemann_2006" /&gt;

Radebold, who sees himself as a war child, reminds of “the so-called [[Egosyntonic and egodystonic|egosyntonic behavior[s]]] of the war children. These are behaviours we all know: being thrifty, working hard and diligently, planning, organizing, being altruistic, looking after others and not oneself”. But, on the other hand, they “did not learn to take care of their body”.&lt;ref name="radebold_2010" /&gt;

=== Symptoms and Disorders ===
Some war children became ill, some recovered, others did not. Still others experienced first symptoms later, at an advanced age. According to Ermann, war children “as adults are generally more at risk of suffering from psychological disorders than others”.&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt; Even losing the conscious memory does not guarantee protection from illness. ''The Body Does Not Forget'' was the title of an article based on a comment by Erman, published by the German magazine [[Der Spiegel]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="ermann_spiegel_2009" /&gt;

At the Frankfurt Congress in 2005, psychoanalyst and author [[Marianne Leuzinger-Bohleber]] spoke about a long-term study in which several scientists participated, stating that it had shown “a higher than expected” number of patients suffering from consequences of the war: “Long-term physical damage due to poor nutrition, problems with self-care, psychosomatic complaints, loneliness, escape into achievement, empathy disorders, identity, and relationship disorders.”&lt;ref name="kongress_frankfurt" /&gt;
{{Quote
|text=Ermann's research showed that war children today are much more likely to suffer from psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and psychosomatic complaints than the population at large. About a quarter of the war children interviewed by Ermann was severely restricted in their psycho-social quality of life and one in every ten was traumatized or had significant traumatic complaints. ‘These people suffer from recurrent, relentless war memories, anxiety attacks, depression and psychosomatic complaints,’ says Ermann, and very frequently cramping, accelerated pulse rate, and chronic pain. |author=Ulrike Demmer |source=Spiegel Online&lt;ref name="spiegel_2009" /&gt; }}
Besides [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) –&amp;nbsp;which many authors view as a possible consequence of war&amp;nbsp;– Ermann added “latent symptoms” which he had identified in preparation for his research project: “Many still have nightmares of attacks, traps, violence, struggle, escape. Others are torn from sleep with an ancient feeling for which they have a personal formula: 'The Russians are coming'. Others experience depression, low confidence, anxiety, [[Somatization disorder|somatization]] or [[Conversion disorder|conversion]]. There are sometimes strange symptoms: feeling cold or recurring fever, agitation and restlessness or sudden panic, numbness, or the feeling of being out of control. Today we recognize in such symptoms the traces of flight-or-fight responses, recurring memories that express themselves in the body, memories of the incomprehensible.” For decades, before the development of the trauma concept, all of these symptoms have been traditionally described as “[[Hysteria|hysterical desire neurosis]]” or they were traced to “hereditary vulnerability”.&lt;ref name="ermann_2003" /&gt;

One year after the Frankfurt Congress in 2005, psychoanalyst Luise Reddemann addressed her younger colleagues during a lecture regarding therapeutic consequences:
{{Quote
|text=Finally, I would like to ask the younger listeners in this audience to please remember that when you work with people who were born between 1930 and 1945 that these people could have been traumatized as children. It might be that the symptoms of these people have their roots in the  war. [...] Consider, for example, that sleep disturbances, memory disorders, and [[somatization disorder]] can be consequences of war-related experiences. Age-related helplessness, but also 'retirement' –&amp;nbsp;and therefore less distraction due to work issues&amp;nbsp;– can bring the unprocessed trauma back closer to the surface of consciousness and lead to symptoms. In addition, many of the war children have suffered from these symptoms for a long time because they have not taken them seriously due to internalized bravery.|author=Luise Reddemann |source=Bad Krozingen 2006&lt;ref name="reddemann_2006" /&gt; }}

In 2015, Luise Reddemann's book about psychotherapy regarding children of war and grandchildren of war was published. There she addressed the question of how the consequences of a childhood during war can be recognized and dealt with in detail.&lt;ref name="reddemann_2015" /&gt;

=== War Children in Old Age ===
Ermann contributes, among other reasons, the fact that this topic is “researched and debated” 70&amp;nbsp;years later to the age of war children. He states that “neuro-physiological processes” are making memories “that have been hidden for a long time re-appear”. He is stating further that “psychological defences collapse” as a result of age, and “everything that has been protective for decades –&amp;nbsp;a person's family and job&amp;nbsp;– disappears”.&lt;ref name="spiegel_2009" /&gt;

The second interdisciplinary congress about war children took place in Münster in 2013, eight years after the first one. Among the many topics discussed, the age of the war children was addressed as well. If “life experience –&amp;nbsp;beyond all research&amp;nbsp;– teaches that remembering characterizes old age”, Insa Fooken, a German professor focusing on aging, confirmed this general knowledge from the perspective of developmental psychology. “It is often not until old age that the full extent of the consequences becomes visible.”&lt;ref name="vorwurf_relativierung" /&gt;

{{Quote
|text=In summary, the late occurrence or deterioration of an existing post-traumatic symptomatology at a mature age was demonstrated in various research studies. There is, however, the risk that the post-traumatic symptoms are not recognized and misinterpreted as age-related depression or somatic symptoms. |author=Andrea Bauer |source=Dissertation 2009&lt;ref name="bauer_20" /&gt; }}

Radebold, as Ermann, has researched war children and specializes in the psychotherapy of the elderly. He wondered how the war children would cope “when they become older, eventually needing care or support, and thus having to give up their independence”.&lt;ref name="radebold_2010" /&gt; He reminded “professional groups working in psycho-social and old-age related fields” of the urgent need to “provide updated knowledge and information”.

{{Quote
|text=Take, for example, old-age and nursing homes. There you will always experience the following situation: In her room, an old woman is cared for at night by two young men –&amp;nbsp;intimate care, wet panties, etc. The woman bites and screams and lashes about, re-experiencing sexual assault.|author=Hartmut Radebold |source=Interview 2010&lt;ref name="radebold_2010" /&gt; }}

In 2013, German broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] presented a documentary by Dorothe Dörholt about war children in old age.&lt;ref name="doerholt" /&gt; Journalist Thilo Wydra titled this programme in the German newspaper [[Der Tagesspiegel|Tagesspiegel]] ''Unforgettable, Unprocessed: The Fear in One's Head''.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel_2" /&gt; German TV station [[Phoenix (German TV station)|Phönix]] broadcast a rerun in 2015, focusing on the return of traumatizing experiences in old age: “One third of German pensioners was seriously traumatized during the war. Many of them are helplessly exposed to images and memories of war which are reappearing in old age.”&lt;ref name="phoenix" /&gt; War-related traumata and anxiety-provoking memories are now being addressed in old age homes. “Historical knowledge” is necessary and “not leaving old people alone or lonely” –&amp;nbsp;is the belief of one caregiver for the elderly.&lt;ref name="husmann_2015" /&gt; An online platform by the name ''Age and Trauma –&amp;nbsp;Giving Space to the Unheard'' is addressing “elderly people, their relatives, professionals and institutions” by embracing the trauma of old people in general&lt;ref name="trauma-alter_1" /&gt; and the war children of the Second World War specifically,&lt;ref name="trauma-alter_2" /&gt; recognizing that time does not heal all wounds. The project ''Old People and Traumata –&amp;nbsp;Understanding, Testing and Multiplication of Interventions and Training Opportunities'', was funded by the ''Ministry of Health, Emancipation, Care and Old Age'' of the State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, between 2013 and 2016.&lt;ref name="trauma-alter_3" /&gt;

== Children of War Children ==
The shadows of the past are still noticeable in generations following the war children. Some of the descendants now call themselves ''grand-children of war'' for they have long since realized that they are burdened by something, even though they have grown up protected and prosperous.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel" /&gt; According to Matthias Lohre, it is high time that generations of war children and grandchildren “come to talk about the experiences of hardship, death and helplessness” before more of the war children are dying. “Yet, the Germans who survived the Second World War as children seemed almost indestructible.”&lt;ref name="lohre_2014" /&gt;

== Organizations – Groups – Websites ==
The more the ''topic war children'' became public, the more organizations in several locations in Germany have been founded, focusing on this subject. Some have since disappeared, others have been launched.&lt;ref name="kurth_knoch" /&gt; Probably all of them can be found on the Internet, but not every website is an organization. Some of them are [[self-help]] groups with the goal to support, promote contacts, or organize group discussions. Some are directed exclusively to ''war children''&lt;ref name="schoenfeldt" /&gt; or grandchildren of war,&lt;ref name="verein_kriegsenkel" /&gt; while others address both groups.&lt;ref name="baron" /&gt; Typically these organizations consider those born after 1950 to be the grandchildren of war, although many of them are brothers and sisters of the war children and do not belong to the next generation. Other organizations have primarily devoted themselves to the support of scientific research.&lt;ref name="kriegskinder_verein"/&gt;

Although the children of the First World War were also ''war children'', the term in Germany is generally not applied to them because it has become associated with the children of the Second World War and therefore focuses on that generation.

He served as a scout under Colonel [[Jacob Bayley]] (1726-1815). He was injured in the [[Rogers' Rangers]] [[St. Francis Raid|raid on the village]]. He eventually moved to the area of Cowass (today's [[Newbury (town), Vermont|Newbury, Vermont]]). &lt;ref name=nedoba/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;  

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Joe again served under Jacob Bayley and later under [[Moses Hazen]]. After the war, he and Molly&lt;!-- Who is this? --&gt; lived in [[Danville, Vermont]]&lt;ref name=nedoba/&gt; and on an island on what is now called Joe's Pond in Danville.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Joe died on Feb. 19, 1819, after he fell and was injured by the severe cold. His burial was paid for by [[Frye Bayley]], and he was given a military style funeral. &lt;ref name=nedoba/&gt;

'''Jill Robinson''' is the founder of [[Animals Asia Foundation]]. Born and raised in [[England]], Robinson was always interested in the welfare of animals. As a child she volunteered in veterinary offices during her school holidays. In the mid-1980s she moved to [[Hong Kong]], where she began working for the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]], focusing on work in [[China]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=browne&gt;{{citation|title=Sense of release|last=Browne|first=Rachel|date=July 19, 2009|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/sense-of-release-20090718-dp1r.html|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1993, Robinson visited a [[bear bile]] farm in [[China]]. According to Robinson, at the time approximately 10,000 [[moon bear|Asiatic black bears]] were caged at farms similar to this one, in conditions many animal welfare groups consider horrific. At [[bear bile]] farms, [[bile]] is extracted from the bear's gallbladder for use in traditional Chinese medicines.&lt;ref name=browne/&gt; According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], only about 15,000&amp;ndash;20,000 [[Asian black bear|Asiatic black bears]] are alive in the wild in [[China]], which would qualify them for the highest protection described by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]].  Chinese authorities estimate that over 50,000 of the bears live in the wild, which would eliminate the necessity for higher protection.&lt;ref name=browne/&gt;

Professor Peter Li believes that Robinson "single-handedly alerted the world" to the cruel practice of bear farming.&lt;ref name=Levitt2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levitt|first1=Tom|title=Younger generation face long wait for law-change on animal cruelty|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5740-Younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty|accessdate=20 July 2014|agency=chinadialogue|date=26 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next seven years, Robinson researched the way bile was used and negotiated with the [[Government of China|Chinese government]]. In 2000, the [[Sichuan Forestry Department]] signed a pledge with the [[China Wildlife Conservation Association]] to release 500 bears from the bile farms with the worst conditions.

'''Judge Holden''' is purportedly a historical person, a [[murder]]er who partnered with [[John Joel Glanton]] as a professional [[scalping|scalphunter]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/HNS/Scalpin/heads.html|title=John Glanton|website=xroads.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the only source for Holden's existence is [[Samuel Chamberlain]]'s ''My Confession'', an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account. Chamberlain described Holden as well-spoken, intelligent, and physically quite large. He also described Holden as perhaps the most ruthless of the roving band of killers led by Glanton.

==Judge Holden in ''Blood Meridian''==
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}
A fictionalized Holden is a central figure in [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s novel ''[[Blood Meridian]]''. In the novel, he and Glanton are the leaders of a pack of nomadic criminals who rob, [[rape]], torture, and kill across the borderlands between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. Throughout the novel, he brutally murders dozens of people, including children. Finding verification of Holden's existence has been a hobby for some Cormac McCarthy scholars.

In 2002, [[Book Magazine|''Book'' magazine]] rated Holden, as appearing in ''Blood Meridian'', as the 43rd greatest character in fiction since 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html|title=NPR: 100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900|first=Christine|last=Paik|website=www.npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As depicted in ''Blood Meridian'', Holden is a mysterious figure, a cold-blooded killer and an implied [[pedophile]]; aside from the children he openly kills, he is seen enticing children with sweets, and a child often goes missing when he is in the vicinity. Further, at one point in the novel he is seen with a naked 12-year-old girl in his room. Holden displays a preternatural breadth of knowledge and skills&amp;mdash;[[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], [[linguistics]], [[law]], [[technical drawing]], [[geology]], [[chemistry]], [[prestidigitation]], and [[philosophy]], to name a few.

He is described as seven feet tall and [[Alopecia totalis|completely bereft of body hair]], including no eyebrows or eyelashes. He is massive in frame, enormously strong, an excellent musician and dancer, a fine draftsman, exceptionally articulate and persuasive in several languages, and an unerring marksman.  His skin is so pale as to have almost no [[pigment]]. This strange appearance, as well as his keen, extremely fast reflexes, strength, agility, apparent immunity to sleep and aging, and multifarious other abilities point to his being something other than a normal human being.

In the final pages of the novel, McCarthy makes more direct reference to the Judge as a [[supernatural]] entity, or even as a concept, personified.

===Scholarly debate===
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}
In his essay "Gravers False and True: Blood Meridian as [[Gnostic]] Tragedy", literature professor Leo Daugherty argued that McCarthy's Holden is&amp;mdash;or at least embodies&amp;mdash;a [[Archon_(Gnosticism)|gnostic archon]], a kind of [[demon]]. [[Harold Bloom]], who declared McCarthy's Holden to be "the most frightening figure in all of [[American literature]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Hartman|url=https://s-usih.org/2014/01/blood-meridian-and-its-implications/|title=Blood Meridian and Its Implications|website=U.S. Intellectual History Blog|publisher=Society for U.S. Intellectual History|location=Allendale, Michigan|date=January 14, 2014|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has even come to regard The Judge as immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric|last=Hage|title=Cormac McCarthy: A Literary Companion|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date=2010|ISBN=978-0786455591}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Daugherty, Bloom argues that The Judge defies identification as any being under any "system" such as Gnosticism, citing the passage in the book stating that there was no "system by which to divide [The Judge] back into his origins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harold|last=Bloom|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=Novelists and Novels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kw4sGGS0wQcC&amp;pg=PA535&amp;lpg=PA535&amp;dq=Harold+bloom+judge+holden+origins+gnosticism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fD9KOn2bod&amp;sig=j6_9wEeeJdbdsA3pmG5qI3dOATo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIo-q5qtDdAhXF5p8KHdpHChIQ6AEwDnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Harold%20bloom%20judge%20holden%20origins%20gnosticism&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York City|ISBN=978-0791093733|page=535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Bloom "resort[s]" to literary comparison with [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Iago]], a methodical dispenser of strife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Edwin|last=Turner|title=“The Authentic American Apocalyptic Novel” — Harold Bloom on Blood Meridian|website=Biblioklept|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurdish women in the past==
The history of Kurds in the Mesopotamia actually began during ancient times. They consider their ancestors to be the Medes which adopted the Zoroastrian religion. In this religion there is equality between women and men, promoting the equal participation between them in making decisions and also supporting women who can fully exercise their rights. The history of Medes has shown that women fought in the battle beside their men but a few female leaders were mentioned in the history such as Zrena.

Zrena was the first woman who led the army of the [[Medes|Median Empire]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;manuscript: "The Role of Avesta in Median Empire"&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the daughter of one of the most important [[Pir (Zoroastrianism)|Pir]], [[Shailar]]. She studied [[Philosophy]] and [[Geometry]] and practiced with her bow and arrow. She was much more like her father in thinking and fighting. She followed in her father’s footsteps and became a Mariya.&lt;ref name="Jalal Amin Bag page 38"&gt;Jalal Amin Bag: "Avesta", page 38, The Ministry of Education, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; After her father's death, she led the army successfully with the rest of the Mariyas. Her words encouraged the warriors (Sarbaz) in the war, one of the important quotes remaining until this generation to [[Sarbaz]] is "If the light shines behind me I could face the darkness even the light comes from a small candle". She never turned around while she was at the battle to know whether the rest of the army was with her or not. She asked [[Pir (Zoroastrianism)|Piran Congress]] to burn the left breast of the girls in their earlier age while she noticed that the Mariyas were struggling with their bow and arrow, but Piran Congress refused her request because they considered that as an anti-humanitarian act, although they knew from [[Magi]]’s prediction that the Median Empire would collapse one day.

The following of her quote were recorded in the manuscript which advised warriors:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In what do you fear! You are part of the nature whether you alive or die.&lt;br&gt;
Do not let your feet to be proud while your sword defeated the enemies.&lt;br&gt;
Do not fight for your personal benefit as sunlight gave your life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mir Xanzad===
The second woman in Kurdish history is well known and called Mir Xanzad.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammed Tofiq Wardi: "Xanzad and Lashkri", page 31, Baghdad&lt;/ref&gt; She was a sister of Mir Suliman who was a prince of [[Soran Emirate]]. After he was assassinated by Lashkri, who was one of the higher commander in the military, in 1590, Xanzad took over the reins of power and became princess of [[Soran Emirate]]. Lashkri with his army could not face Mir Xanzad and for that reason he went to Shangal. However, both armies could not face and attack their base. Mir Xanzad wrote a letter to him and stated that she could not manage the governor and take all the heritage of Soran Emirate should someone share power with her. She stated also that she could not find someone better than him to marry. When Lashkri received the letter he went to Harir with 100 knights. On the next day, he was handcuffed with his knights and executed.

Mir Xanzad ruled Soran Emirate for seven years and had an active role by building castles and roads and also reinforced the army. One of the most beautiful castles was known by her name. [[Xanzad Castle]],&lt;ref&gt;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2482/3550230426_e1a1bcd4ef.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; located about 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Erbil]], the capital of the Kurdistan region.

===Hapsa Xani-Naqib===
The third woman in Kurdish history was called Hapsa Xani-Naqib. She was a cousin of [[Kingdom of Kurdistan|King Mahmmud]]. She was born in 1891 in Sulimani. She became a politician woman by participating in many activities in the Kurdish revolution and had a role in gaining women's rights. She wrote a letter to the United Nations and asked for Kurdish rights when the Kurds were about to be squeezed by four countries; Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. She supported the Kurdish revolution financially and physically during her life as we could see she supported Qazi Mahammad when established the Republic of Kurdistan on 22 January 1946. She was a great women who died in 12/04/1953 while she had many projects on her mind to serve her nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcdk.org/kurdi/page.php?sid=150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xoshawistan.info/vb/showthread.php?t=589&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fata Resh===
{{main|Fata Resh}}
'''Fata resh''' has commanded [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribal-units in the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Ottoman–Russian wars]] against [[Russian Empire]] to protect the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] front and the [[Crymea]] front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinemilli’li Amazon: Fata Raş|url=http://www.bitlisname.com/2015/12/23/sinemillili-amazon-fata-ras/|accessdate=20 January 2018|language=tr-TR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leyla Qasim and Margret===
The role of Kurdish women in the battle is highlighted from the past to the present as we can see 1960th [[Leyla Qasim]] and Margret&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renesans.nu/articles.php?id=4286&lt;/ref&gt; were participating in the Kurdish revolution to the South of Kurdistan against the Iraqi regime.

From 1978, Kurdish women have been involved in original history. As we can see on a daily basis, many women to the (soils of Turkish Republic) are struggling beside men against the Turkish regime in order to get freedom for the Emperialist Forces. In the last decade, many Kurdish women played a huge role and led PKK militants, without any fear and gave their soul for their militant, human slayer unity Pınarcık Katliamı which opposing civilians including 16 children in Pınarcık province and country, such as Zilan, Shilan, Beritan and Vian.

===Bêrîtan===
[[Gülnaz Karataş]] (Bêrîtan), also known as Beritan. She studied the science of Economics and English. She joined PKK with her fiancé in 1989. Later on, she was arrested by Turkish authorities. After she was released, she went to Guti Mountain to join the PKK army. In 1992 when the fighting started between PDK and PKK, she threw herself over a cliff when her ammunition ran out.

===Vian===
[[Laila Wali]], also known as Vian Jaff, was born in Sulimani in 1981. She studied primary and secondary school in Sulimani and left school in order to join PKK to get women’s rights. She believed the only way to get freedom for humanity and specifically Kurdish rights was through PKK. Soon, she started her education through PKK and became one of the active women in that movement. Later on, she became a member of PCDK. She worked in PCDK's media and started to write about Kurdish women. On the fourth conference of PCDK, she became a member of PJA(The party of Freedom Women). On 2 February 2006, she burnt herself for freedom and gave the message to the world that "There is no life without Ocalan". She gave her soul, body, courage, bravery, words, pens, papers, etc., to Kurdish women.

==Meaning==
*'''[[Zrena]]''' means the first raining in the autumn or the drizzle. People were praying for the first raining for their lands while they cultivated wheat and crops. For that reason the first raining was much sanctified as it mentioned in the Holy Avesta.&lt;ref&gt;Mukriani: "Farhangi Kurdi", 1968&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Sarbaz]]''' is a warrior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*'''[[Mariya]]'''{{dn|date=February 2017}} is a female Sarbaz.&lt;ref name="Jalal Amin Bag page 38"/&gt;
*'''[[Pir (Zoroastrianism)|Pir]]''' is the highest level in the Zoroastrian religion that could legislate, lead and decide for any new outcome.
'''The Role of Avesta in Median Empire/Véjeye Avéstaíya lenau Xaka Madaíya/ ڤێژه‌یا ئاڤێستایا له‌ناو خاکا مادایا''' It is a manuscript of one of the most important manuscript bundles which existed until the British invasion of Iraq after the First World War. This manuscript was of interest by British archaeologies because the history of the Iranian empire of the Medes and Persians were recorded and was passed down through the generations. This manuscript is likely uncovered by Zoroastrian families with the rest of the manuscript bundles and some pictures were taken by a Kurdish historian in 2005 before they disappeared again. Here are some pictures:

*'''Shaliar''' was a title of minister at the time of [[Medes|Median Empire]]. Also during Median Empire, there was a [[Pir (Zoroastrianism)|Pir]] Shaliar who was a Pir and had a position as a minister in Median Empire. At the time of Median Empire there were many women acted as a Pir Shaliar because there was equality between men and women as they adopted the [[Zoroastrism|Zardasht]] religion. All the Pirs could become a Shaliar but not vice versa as we could find in many Shaliars such as [[Zrena]], who was a daughter of Pir Shaliar then became a Shaliar of defence in Median Empire; although she studied Philosophy and the [[Zoroastrism|Zardasht]] religion, she remained as Shaliar, not as a Pir.

'''Leonard Retel Helmrich''' is a Dutch [[cinematographer]] and [[film director]]. He was born the 16th of August 1959 in Tilburg, Netherlands and has lived in Amsterdam since 1982. He received highest honours for international documentaries at the ''Sundance Festival'' and was the first two-time International Documentary winner at the ''[[International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam]] (IDFA)''.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/movies/leonard-retel-helmrichs-documentaries-capture-closed-spaces.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=3 |title=Leonard Retel Helmrich’s Documentaries Capture Closed Spaces - NYTimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 9, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In June 5, 2018 he was rewarded by the Dutch King Willem-Alexander with the title [[Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion]], a very high distinction.

Helmrich is famous for perfecting the 'Single Shot Cinema' filming method and his related technical camera innovations.
''"...you can move inside an event and go with your camera to the right spot, at the right moment,...  That’s what the whole single-shot cinema is about: trying to think of the world as a kind of clockwork, a machinery, with everything interrelated. The bigger and smaller things are just as important. In a clockworks you can’t pull out a little gear because the whole thing jams. The solution is to become one of the clockworks."'', Leonard Retel Helmrich.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==Biography==
After Indonesian independence the Helmrich family repatriated to the Netherlands during the [[Indo people|Indo diaspora]]. His father, Jean Retel Helmrich, was born to a wealthy ''[[totok]]'' family in [[Semarang]], [[Dutch East Indies]], fought against the Japanese invaders during World War II and was interred as a [[POW]] for three years. After the war he married a Javanese woman. “It was forbidden,” Mr. Helmrich’s sister and producer, [[Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich]], explained. “They had to get permission from the Queen, from the Indonesian government, the Dutch government, the Muslim church, and the Catholic Church. It was Romeo and Juliet.” Growing up, the filmmaker “had a lot of problems because of his dyslexia,” she said. “The teachers were always complaining that he was living in his own world, but already when he was a little boy he made very good drawings.” The family’s belief in him extended to financing “Eye of the Day” and getting involved in other ways. Ms. Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich’s production company, Scarabee, produces Mr. Helmrich’s films; her son, Jasper Naaijkens, is his uncle’s editor — which cannot be any easy job, considering Mr. Helmrich can come up with hourlong shots.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Leonard Retel Helmrich graduated from the Dutch Film and Television Academy in 1986 and in 1990 he made his first feature film, The Phoenix Mystery. His first documentary, Moving Objects (1991) was awarded the Special Jury Price for the Best Artist-Profile at the International Golden Gate Film Festival of San Francisco. Retel Helmrich developed his own cinematic style based on a principle which he has developed and calls "Single Shot Cinema". After finishing the film Moving Objects, he decided to travel to Indonesia where his parents were born, with the idea to show people around the world what was happening in this beautiful and very complicated country. He discovered that the authority of President Suharto was declining. In 1995 he made a film about Suharto and his wife in their Jakartan palace. He then went to Solo in central Java to film a demonstration against the Suharto regime. During his activities he was arrested by the police and accused of being a Western spy. With the help of the Dutch Embassy and his brother Anton, who happened to be in Indonesia, he was released after a few days. However, he was expelled from the country with the status "persona non grata" meaning he would no longer be allowed to visit Indonesia.
Leonard Retel Helmrich traveled to Kansas City, Missouri to work with the Institute of Art in developing the principles of Single Shot Cinema.
In 1997 his brother succeeded to convince the Indonesian government to change his "persona non grata" status and Leonard Retel Helmrich was allowed to return to finish his work. Unfortunately a lot of material had been destroyed or was unusable. He decided to change his strategy. Many journalists were reporting the fall of Suharto and Retel Helmrich wanted to focus on the micro-aspects of the changes by following an Indonesian family in one of Jakarta's slums. All the changes in politics, religion, islamization, poverty, social injustice, globalization, criminality, corruption, etc. affected every Indonesian in his daily life. Thus he came up with the idea to film a triptych about the struggle for survival of a family in those trying days in Indonesia. In 2001 he finished Eye of the Day (Stand van de Zon) and in 2004 he made Shape of the Moon (Stand van de Maan) which became a worldwide success.

Since then Retel Helmrich’s films have screened and won acclaim at film festivals worldwide, garnering major awards for both his drama and documentary work. His awards include the inaugural [[World Cinema Jury Prize Documentary]] at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] 2005 and the prestigious [[Joris Ivens Award]] at [[IDFA Amsterdam]] 2004 for his Indonesian feature documentary [[Shape of the Moon]] ([[Stand van de Maan]]). In 2010 he won for the second time the [[Grand VPRO/IDFA Award]] for feature documentary for ''[[Position Among the Stars]]'' (Stand van de Sterren) together with the [[IDFA Award for the best Dutch documentary]]. It was the first time in the IDFA history that a director won this award for the second time. In January 2011 he won again at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] where he received the [[World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Prize]] for ''Position among the Stars''.

Leonard Retel Helmrich has served on the jury of many film festivals, including festivals in Shanghai, Warsaw, Seoul, Sibiu (Romania) and Amsterdam. He has had major retrospectives of his work at Visions du Réel in Nyon, Switzerland,  Rencontres Internationales du Documentaire in Montreal and at ASTRA in Sibiu, Romania. He has also lectured and screened his films at numerous educational institutions including the Flaherty Seminar Program in New York and at Harvard University where he was awarded a Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies. Leonard shoots as well as directs all his own films and is best known for a philosophy and approach he calls ‘Single Shot Cinema’, which involves long takes with a hand-held but smooth camera moving close to the subject. Above all, in his films, it is the framing and movement of the camera that captures and leads the emotions of the audience. He has taught numerous workshops on Single Shot Cinema techniques for film festivals, television broadcasters, independent filmmakers, film schools and universities in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia and in Africa. During his Harvard fellowship, he was editing his latest film Position Among the Stars, the third film of his trilogy on contemporary Indonesia. He is currently writing a book about “Single Shot Cinema”.

==Single Shot Cinema==

Single Shot Cinema is a way of filming that enables one to shoot a scene in one single take using just one camera moving fluidly around the subject recording all the camera angles that express one's personal feeling and perception of that moment. The camera moves steadily and fluidly while constantly changing angles. The idea is to use fast and slow, high and low, close and far camera movements in a single shot within a scene. In this way, the camera movement itself becomes the primary cinematic expression.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"In “Shape of the Moon” (2004) a barefoot man crosses a railroad trestle a thousand feet above an Indonesian valley, stepping briskly along a beam barely wider than his feet. We see him from behind. We see him from above. Most alarming, we see him from the side, by means of a camera that seems mounted in midair. It’s breathtaking, what the subject is doing. But a man with a camera is doing it too."'' John Anderson, The New York Times.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was inspired by the French film critic André Bazin whose ideas helped create the Nouvelle Vague films of Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. According to Bazin, a moving camera is the essence of filmmaking: “It should not cut up reality, but rather it should show reality in its temporal continuity.” Single Shot Cinema in documentary means catching real life moments while they are happening in one continuous shot with a camera that is moving around the subject. As a result, shots are not edited from one still moment to the next, but rather from one camera movement to the next. In practice this means that the camera movement must have a dramatic purpose. Ideally all footage shot should be usable for editing. In order to accomplish this, the filmmaker should always keep the center of attention within the camera frame.
Bazin goes on to say that the camera must be equally prepared to move as to remain still. He describes camera movement in Italian Neorealism as having a human quality, as a projection of the hand and the eye, almost like a living part of the operator flowing directly from his awareness.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“His camera glides through spaces in a way that just seems impossible... Sometimes you stop looking at the movie and look at the shot. But I think it’s delightful."'' Robb Moss, film lecturer at Harvard.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Leopold Fabius Dietegen Fane de Salis''', (26 April 1816 &amp;ndash; 20 November 1898) was a Tuscan-born Australian pastoralist and politician.&lt;ref&gt;''A genealogical and heraldic History of the Colonial Gentry'', by [[Burke's Peerage|Sir (John) Bernard Burke]], CB, LLD, vol. 2, London, 1895/1899 (pages 574–77).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Burke's Peerage'', Foreign Noblemen / Foreign Titles sections: 1851, 1936, 1956, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LeopoldDeSalis.jpg|thumb|Count ''Leo'' in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;He came to England in 1893, particularly to settle his affairs in Middlesex.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Charlotte MacDonald (d.1878), wife to Leopold F. D. Fane De Salis (1816-1898).jpg|thumbnail|left|Charlotte MacDonald (d.1878).]]
Born in [[Florence]] to [[Jerome, 4th Count de Salis-Soglio]] and Henrietta Foster,&lt;ref&gt;Daughter of [[William Foster (bishop)|Lord Bishop of Clogher, William Foster]].&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[Eton College]] and studied sheep farming at [[Jedburgh]] in Scotland. In 1840 he migrated to [[Sydney]], where he formed a partnership to run a station at [[Junee, New South Wales|Junee]]. In the same decade, in 1842, 1844 and 1848, his highly capable next elder brother [[William Andrew Salius Fane de Salis|William]] also sailed to Australia. They did much business together.

In 1844 he married Charlotte Macdonald, with whom he had four children, two of whom ([[George De Salis|George]] and [[Leopold William De Salis|Leopold]]) would later become politicians themselves. In 1855 he sold out and bought the [[Cuppacumbalong Homestead|Cuppacumbalong station]] at [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]], later purchasing further property on the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. In 1864 he was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for [[Electoral district of Queanbeyan|Queanbeyan]], but he did not re-contest in 1869. In 1872 he was appointed to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. Around this time he also acquired property in [[Queensland]], all of which he lost in the 1890s depression. His daughter Nina married [[William Farrer]] in 1882 and they lived at [[Lambrigg, Tharwa]], a property given them by De Salis. In 1898 he left the Council bankrupt with significant debts. He died at Tharwa later that year.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web

In [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhist]] thought, a '''[[bodhisattva]]''' ({{cjkv|c=菩薩|p=púsà|r=bosatsu|rr=bosal|Vietnamese pronunciation= bồ tát}}) is a being who is dedicated to achieving complete [[Buddhahood]]. That is their reason for "being". They made their goal to attain 'swarga'. Conventionally, the term is applied to beings with a high degree of enlightenment. Bodhisattva literally means a "[[bodhi]] (enlightenment) being" in [[Sanskrit]]. Mahayana practitioners have historically lived in many other countries that are now predominantly Hindu, Muslim or [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]]; remnants of reverence for bodhisattvas has continued in some of these regions.

The following is a partial list of bodhisattvas primarily respected in Indian, [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[East Asian Buddhism]].

== Bodhisattvas ==

* '''[[Ākāśagarbha]]'''

{{CJKV|c=虛空藏|p=Xūkōngzàng|k=허공장|r=Kokūzō}}, {{bo|t=ནམ་མཁའི་སྙིང་པོ།|s=Namkha'i Nyingpo}}) is a [[bodhisattva]] who is associated with the great element (''[[mahābhūta]]'') of space (''ākāśa'').

* '''[[Avalokiteśvara]]'''
({{cjkv|c=觀音|p=[[Guanyin]]|k=관음|r=Kannon|v=Quán Thế Âm}}, {{bo|t=སྤྱན་རས་གཟིགས་|s=Chenrézik}})

The bodhisattva of compassion, the listener of the world's cries who uses skillful means to come to their aid; the most universally acknowledged bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism and appears unofficially in Theravada Buddhism in Cambodia under the name Lokeśvara. This bodhisattva gradually became identified predominantly as female in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and its name may originally have been Avalokitāśvara.

* '''[[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]]'''

({{cjkv|c=地藏|p=Dìzáng|k=지장|r=Jizō|v=Địa Tạng}}, {{bo|t=ས་ཡི་སྙིང་པོ|s=Sayi Nyingpo}}).

Kṣitigarbha is a bodhisattva primarily revered in East Asian Buddhism and usually depicted as a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]. His name may be translated as "Earth Treasury", "Earth Store", "Earth Matrix", or "Earth Womb". Kṣitigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[desire realm|six worlds]] between the death of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the rise of [[Maitreya]], as well as his vow not to achieve [[Buddhahood]] until all [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]s are emptied. He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture.

* '''[[Mahasthamaprapta|Mahāsthāmaprāpta]]'''

({{cjkv|c=大勢至|p=Dàshìzhì|k=대세지|r=Daiseishi|v=Đại Thế Chí}})

Mahāsthāmaprāpta (Korean: Daeseji) is a [[mahāsattva]] representing the power of wisdom, often depicted in a trinity with [[Amitābha]] and Avalokiteśvara, especially in [[Pure Land Buddhism]]. His name literally means "arrival of the great strength".

* '''[[Maitreya]]''', [[Pali]] '''Metteyya'''

In some [[Buddhist texts]] such as the ''[[Amitabha Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', he is referred to as '''Ajita'''.
{{cjkv|c=彌勒|p=Mílè|r=Miroku|k=미륵|v=Di-lặc}}, {{bo|t=བྱམས་པ་|s=Jampa}}).

According to both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, Maitreya is regarded as the future buddha. Buddhist tradition, Maitreya is a bodhisattva who will appear on Earth in the future, achieve complete [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and teach the pure ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]]''. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor to the present Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name=Horner97&gt;[[#refHorner1975|Horner (1975)]], ''The minor anthologies of the Pali canon'', p. 97. Regarding Metteyya, Bv XXVII, 19: "I [Gautama Buddha] at the present time am the Self-Awakened One, and there will be Metteyya...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BDEA&gt;{{cite web|author=Buddha Dharma Education Association|title=Suttanta Pitaka: Khuddaka Nikāya: 14.Buddhavamsa-History of the Buddhas|work=Guide to Tipiṭaka|publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association|location=Tullera, NSW, Australia|year=2014|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/budvamsa.htm|accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya refers to a time in the future when the dharma will have been forgotten by most on the terrestrial world. This prophecy is found in the canonical literature of all major [[schools of Buddhism]]. Maitreya has also been adopted for his millenarian role by many non-Buddhist religions in the past such as the [[White Lotus]] as well as by modern [[new religious movement]]s such as [[Yiguandao]].

* '''[[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]]'''

({{cjkv|c=文殊|p=Wénshū|k=문수|r=Monju|v=Văn Thù}}, {{bo|t=འཇམ་དཔལ་དབྱངས།|s=Jampelyang}})

Mañjuśrī is a bodhisattva associated with [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] (transcendent wisdom) in Mahayana Buddhism. In Tibetan Buddhism, he is also a [[yidam]]. His name means "Gentle Glory".&lt;ref&gt;Lopez Jr., Donald S. (2001). ''The Story of Buddhism: A Concise Guide to its History and Teachings.'' New York, USA: HarperSanFrancisco. {{ISBN|0-06-069976-0}} (cloth) P.260.&lt;/ref&gt; Mañjuśrī is also known by the fuller Sanskrit name of Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta,&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2003 p.172"&gt;Keown, Damien (editor) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}} p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; literally "Mañjuśrī, Still a Youth" or, less literally, "Prince Mañjuśrī".

* '''[[Nio|Niō]]'''

The {{nihongo|Niō|仁王|}} are two wrath-filled and muscular guardians of the Buddha standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples in [[East Asian Buddhism]] in the form of frightening wrestler-like statues. They are dharmapala manifestations of the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi. According to Japanese tradition, they travelled with Gautama Buddha to protect him and there are references to this in the [[Pāli Canon]] as well as the ''Ambaṭṭha Sutta''. Within the [[ahimsa|generally pacifist tradition]] of Buddhism, stories of dharmapalas justified the use of physical force to protect cherished values and beliefs against evil. The Niō are also seen as a manifestation of Mahasthamaprapta in Pure Land Buddhism and as Vajrasattva in Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;The illustrated encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism  By Helen Josephine Baroni, Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Padmasambhava|Padmasambhāva]]'''

{{bo|t=པདྨ་འབྱུང་གནས།|s=Pemajungné}}, {{lang-mn|ловон Бадмажунай}}, {{cjkv|c=莲花生大士|p=Liánhuāshēng}}

Padmasambhāva "Lotus-Born", also known as '''Guru Rinpoche''', is a literary character of [[Terma (religion)|terma]],&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 34-5, 96-8.&lt;/ref&gt; an emanation of Amitābha that is said to appear to [[tertön]]s in visionary encounters and a focus of Tibetan Buddhist practice, particularly in the [[Nyingma]] school.

* '''[[Samantabhadra]]'''

{{cjkv| c   = 普賢菩薩 | p   = Pǔxián | r = Fugen | k = 보현 | | v = Phổ Hiền}}, {{bo|| t= ཀུན་ཏུ་བཟང་པོ | s=Küntu Zangpo}}, {{lang-mn|Хамгаар Сайн}}}

Samantabhadra ''Universal Worthy'' is associated with practice and meditation. Together with the Buddha and Mañjuśrī, he forms the ''Shakyamuni trinity'' in [[Buddhism]]. He is the patron of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' and, according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'', made the ten great vows which are the basis of a bodhisattva. In [[China]], Samantabhadra is associated with action, whereas Mañjuśrī is associated with prajñā. In Japan, Samantabharda is often venerated by the [[Tendai]] and in [[Shingon Buddhism]], and as the protector of the ''Lotus Sutra'' by [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. In the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, Samantabhadra is also the name of the [[Adi-Buddha]] - in indivisible [[Yab-Yum]] union with his consort, [[Samantabhadrī (tutelary)|Samantabhadrī]].

* '''[[Sangharama]]'''
({{cjkv|c=伽藍|p=Qiélán|v = Già Lam}})

Only revered in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], Sangharama refer to a group of devas who guard [[vihara]]s and the faith, but the title is usually referring to the legendary Chinese military general '''[[Guan Yu]]''', who became a dharmapala through becoming a Buddhist and making vows.

*'''[[Sitatapatra|Sitātapatrā]]'''
({{cjkv|c=白傘蓋佛頂| p = Bái Sǎngài Fúdǐng|r=Byakusangai Butchō |k = 시타타파트라}}), {{bo| t = གདུགས་དཀར།|s=}}, {{lang-mn|Цагаан шүхэрт}})

Sitātapatrā "the White Parasol"&lt;ref&gt;The Cult of Tara: Magic and Ritual in Tibet (Hermeneutics: Studies in the History of Religions) by Stephan Beyer (1978) p.154&lt;/ref&gt; is a protector against supernatural danger. She is venerated in both Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions. She is also known as ''Uṣṇīṣa Sitatapatra''. Sitātapatrā is a powerful independent deity as she was emanated by Gautama Buddha from his [[ushnisha|uṣṇīṣa]]. Whoever practices her mantra will be reborn in Amitābha's [[pure land]] as well as gaining protection against supernatural danger and black magic.

* '''[[Skanda (Buddhism)|Skanda]]'''

{{cjkv|c=韋馱|p=Wéituó|r=Idaten|k=위타천|v=Vi Đà}}, {{bo|t=གདོང་དྲུག་|s=Dongdruk}}, {{lang-mn|Арван Хоёр Нууд}})
'''Skanda''' is regarded as a devoted guardian of viharas and the Buddhist teachings. He is the leader of the twenty-four celestial guardian deities mentioned in the ''[[Golden Light Sutra]]''. In Chinese temples, Skanda faces the statue of the Buddha in the main shrine. In others, he is on the far right of the main shrine, whereas on the left is his counterpart, Sangharama, personified as the historical general Guan Yu. In Chinese sutras, his image is found at the end of the sutra, a reminder of his vow to protect and preserve the teachings.

* '''[[Supushpachandra]]'''
Mentioned in Shantideva's ''[[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]]''.

*'''[[Suryaprabha]]'''
(Ch: 日光, ''Riguang'', Kr. ''Il Guang'', Jp: ''Nikkō'') One of two attendants of [[Bhaisajyaguru]].

* '''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]'''
(Ch. 度母, ''Du Mu'') Female bodhisattva, or set of bodhisattvas, in Tibetan Buddhism. She represents the virtues of success in work and achievements. Also a manifestation of [[Avalokiteśvara]].

* '''[[Vajrapani|Vajrapāṇi]]'''

({{cjkv|c=金剛手|r=Kongōshu|k=금강수|p=Jīngāngshǒu|v=Kim cương thủ}}, {{bo|t=ཕྱག་ན་རྡོ་རྗེ་|s=Chakna Dorjé}})

'''{{IAST|Vajrapāṇi}}''' ([[Sanskrit]], "[[Vajra]]  in [his] hand") is one of the earliest-appearing bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism. He is the protector and guide of Gautama Buddha and rose to symbolize the Buddha's power.

Vajrapani is extensively represented in Buddhist iconography as one of the three protective deities surrounding the Buddha. Each of them symbolizes one of the Buddha's virtues: [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]] manifests all the Buddhas' wisdom, [[Avalokiteśvara]] manifests all the Buddhas' compassion and Vajrapāṇi manifests all the Buddhas' power as well as the power of all five [[tathāgata]]s. Vajrapāṇi is one of the earliest [[dharmapala]]s and the only Buddhist deity to be mentioned in the [[Pāli Canon]] as well as be worshiped in the [[Shaolin Monastery]], in Tibetan Buddhism and in Pure Land Buddhism, where he is known as Mahasthamaprapta and forms a triad with Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara. Manifestations of Vajrapāṇi can also be found in many Buddhist temples in Japan as dharma protectors called the [[Nio|Niō]] or "Two Kings". Vajrapani is also associated with [[Acala]], who is venerated as ''Fudo-Myō'' in Japan, where he is serenaded as the holder of the [[vajra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The gods of northern Buddhism|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/the-gods-of-northern-buddhism/d/doc4713.html|publisher=Wisdom Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Vasudhara|Vasudhārā]]'''

'''Vasudhārā''' whose name means "stream of gems" in Sanskrit, is the bodhisattva of wealth, prosperity, and abundance. She is popular in many Buddhist countries and is a subject in Buddhist legends and art. Originally an Indian bodhisattva, her popularity has spread to Theravadin countries. Her popularity, however, peaks in [[Nepal]], where she has a strong following among the Buddhist [[Newars]] of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and is thus a central figure in [[Newar Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pratapaditya, Pal. (1985) Art of Nepal. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She is named Shiskar Apa in [[Lahaul and Spiti district|Lahul and Spiti]].

'''Liu Junning''' ({{zh|s=刘军宁|t=劉軍寧|p=Liú Jūnníng}}; born 1961) is a [[China|Chinese]] [[political science|political scientist]] and one of the most prominent [[liberalism|liberal]] voices inside Chinese academia. He was known for his studies on modern European [[classical liberalism]] as well as [[conservatism]]. He is currently a researcher of Institute of Chinese Culture, a subsidiary of China's [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chineseculture.com.cn/zgwh/xrjj.html# |title=Institute of Chinese Culture |access-date=2010-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707014545/http://www.chineseculture.com.cn/zgwh/xrjj.html# |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu is an opponent of what are called [[Asian values]], including the view that Asia should take a different route of political development outside of the tradition of [[liberal democracy]], seen as a Western principle. Liu believes liberalism is not simply a Western value, but should be something universal.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Junning, "What are Asian Values" in ''The Chinese human rights reader: documents and commentary, 1900-2000'' (M.E. Sharpe, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an admirer of American philosopher [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiuding.org/Article/Class1/200711/604.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531215658/http://www.jiuding.org/Article/Class1/200711/604.html |archivedate=2009-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not support [[direct democracy]], and views [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as its primary proponent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hougaige.com/w_view.asp?id=11184{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, Liu penned an article calling for reform in China and was expelled from [[Chinese Academy of Social Science]] and prohibited from travelling abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Broder, David S. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53700-2004Jun18.html Democracy's Vital Voices]. ''Washington Post''. June 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the authority of [[Communist Party of China]] gave warnings to Liu along with two other intellectuals for their political advocacy contrary to the current regime and their signature on ''[[Charter 08]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120730115612/http://www.dwnews.com/gb/BackStage/2009-05/2009-05-21-09-11-02-0159.html Three Top Chinese Intellectual Warned by Authorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon L. Gallet''' (1832–1899), watchmaker, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and past family patriarch of the [[Gallet &amp; Co.|Gallet Watch Company]] of Switzerland,&lt;ref name=GGhist&gt;"Gallet Watch Company History" [http://www.galletwatch.com/new_yesterday.html Gallet-hist]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered as one of the primary architects and founders of the 19th century industrialization of the Swiss watchmaking industry.

==Life==
The son of Julien Gallet (1806–1849), who moved the family watchmaking business from Geneva, Switzerland, to the manufacturing district of La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1826, Léon L. Gallet was responsible for the creation of numerous Swiss and American watch brands.&lt;ref&gt;Jewelers' Circular Keystone, May 17, 1899, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the prestigious Fabrique Electa, which became the upscale line of the jewelry department at Macy’s Department store in New York City during the first quarter of the 20th century. Léon L. Gallet also established the brands National Park, Continental Watch Company, Jerome Park, Bridgeport, Eureka, Commodore, Union Square, and Lady Racine.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen H. Pritchard, Swiss Timepiece Makers 1775-1975, (2 Bände), West Kennebunk 1997&lt;/ref&gt; While the appearance and function of many of Gallet’s timepieces were tailored to the tastes of the American consumers, all of the movements in these watches were manufactured in Switzerland.

Léon Gallet played a philanthropic role in the business, cultural, and social life of his native home. As well as his prominent position as a member of both the legislature of Neuchâtel and the Council of La Chaux-de-Fonds, he was for many years, the president of the Société des Amis des Arts (Fine Arts Society) and Grand Master of the Free Masons. Together with Louis &amp; Jules Courvoisier, Ernest Francillon of Longines, and Constant Girard-Perregaux, Léon Gallet founded the Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society for the Industries of the Jura Area) in 1876. The purpose of this organization was to assist in the promotion and distribution of products from Switzerland's Watch Valley while addressing the growing threat of competition in European markets from American watch manufacturers.

Upon his death in 1899, Léon Gallet bequeathed a sum of 43,000 Swiss Francs (today equivalent to 1,000,000 Swiss Francs or approx. 1,000,000 US dollars) to his hometown of La Chaux-de-Fonds, of which 25,000 Swiss Francs were earmarked to build the [[Musée International d'Horlogerie]] (International Watch Making Museum).&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, Catherine; Piquet, Jean-Michel (2002), Musée International d'Horlogerie, Catalogue of Selected Pieces, Switzerland: Institut l'homme et le temps, {{ISBN|2-940088-10-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Donated by Léon Gallet’s son Georges, the museum’s collection was started with a body of over 100 of Gallet's most complicated and valuable timepieces, including the world's first wristwatch produced for mass consumption in 1892. The balance of the bequeathed funds was used to construct the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds), designed by renowned painter [[Charles l’Eplattenier]] and architect René Chapallaz, [[Le Corbusier]]'s architecture teacher.

Prior to his passing, Léon Gallet commissioned René Chapallaz, to design "Villa Gallet". Situated in "Parc Gallet" in the southern part of La Chaux-de-Fonds, "Villa Gallet" still retains its original name and is considered as an important historic contribution to the Swiss [[Art Nouveau]] movement of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;L'Inventaire Suisse d'Architecture: 1850-1920, Volume 3, Bienne, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Coire, Davos.

== Léon L. Gallet &amp; The Industrialization of the Swiss Watch Industry ==

Any study of the 19th century industrialization of [[Switzerland]]’s “Watch Valley” is not complete without mentioning the role of watchmaker and entrepreneur, Léon L. Gallet.

In the years following [[American Civil War|America’s Civil War]], a powerful shift of that country’s concentration moved from agriculture to industry. With this shift came great advancements in manufacturing as centrally located factories replaced small workshops, and large scale production of items with interchangeable parts quickly displaced less efficient hand-crafting. An immediate beneficiary of this progress was America’s watch and clock industry, as northern coal powered factories began turning out hundreds of high quality timepieces per day. On the horizon for these newly empowered companies was the inevitable expansion beyond domestic borders to embark in direct competition with the Swiss watchmaking industry.

Léon L. Gallet and [[Ernest Francillon]] of [[Longines]], two Swiss watchmakers who were actively selling their wares in North America, saw the writing on the wall. Recognizing the only way that the small workshops of Switzerland’s “[[Watch Valley]]” could compete against the growing threat posed by larger American manufacturers was to unite. At the prompting of Gallet and Francillon, a new organization was created. The Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society of the [[Jura Mountains|Jura Industries]]) was formed to bring together the individual strengths of the region’s numerous independent watchmaking houses as a powerful cooperative entity.

Yet, in spite of the formation of this new organization, the warnings of Gallet and Francillon were met with skepticism by the other members of the group. Decades of success as the world’s primary supplier of fine timepieces had resulted in a self-assured complacency within [[Switzerland]]’s watchmaking industry.

Then on the 10th of May, 1876, the great [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia International Exhibition]], created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of [[United States Declaration of Independence|America’s Declaration of Independence]], opened to the public. Among the many displays was the indisputable evidence of the manufacturing superiority of such American companies as [[Waltham Watch Company|Waltham]] and [[Elgin National Watch Company|Elgin]], each capable of finishing many hundred watches per day.

Jacques David, Swiss watchmaker and machine designer, was dispatched to America by Ernest Francillon to witness the exhibitions first-hand, and report his findings back to the Intercanonal Society. Léon L. Gallet followed shortly behind, arriving in [[Philadelphia]] the next month. What both men witnessed at the exhibition further confirmed the concerns of Gallet and Francillon.

On his return to Switzerland in November, Jacques David wrote a long detailed report on the mens' findings to the Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries. While David’s report helped to wake the Swiss watchmaking industry from its comfortable complacency, increased revenues were needed for the Society’s members to initiate the developments required to meet these new challenges.

By the time that the Philadelphia Exposition opened to the public in 1876, Léon L. Gallet had already established sales offices in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], going back over ten years. He had personally suffered a number of long ocean voyages to deliver his wares and to conduct business. Besides his acute knowledge of the growing threat posed by worldwide competition from US manufactures, Gallet understood the tastes of the American consumer and the opportunities the new world also held for the Jura watchmakers.

With the now available joint resources from fellow manufacturing members of the Intercantonal Society, Gallet decided to take the competitive battle directly to the enemy. Not only could the rapidly expanding base of American consumers provide opportunities for increased sales of Swiss watches, these sales could provide the needed revenues to meet the expected competitive challenges in Europe.

Utilizing his own movements, as well as components by such friends as Auguste [[Agassiz family|Agassiz]], Ernest Francillon, Constant [[Girard-Perregaux]], Jules Jeanneret, and Louis and Jules Courvoisier, Gallet began production of 30 new watch brands, most designed specifically to appeal to the taste of the America consumer.

Within a short period, exports of Swiss watches to America rapidly increased, greatly expanding the reach of watchmakers whose previous market was limited only to the local economies. As a result, Leon L. Gallet’s American marketing activities helped to provide the needed capital for the watchmakers of the Jura region to industrialize, and successfully meet one of the greatest challenges in Swiss timekeeping’s history.

'''Manoug Manougian''' is an Armenian scientist, professor, and considered the father of the [[Lebanese space program]].

== Personal life and education ==

Manougian grew up in [[Jerusalem]] and was educated at [[St. George's School, Jerusalem]]. He studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Texas]].

== Career ==

Manougian married in 1960 and went to Lebanon to become a teacher at [[Haigazian College]].

=== Lebanese Space Program ===

He founded the Haigazian College Rocket Society in November 1960.  With a very limited budget, the society launched a series of rockets to increasing altitudes.  It received funding from the Lebanese government and became the [[Lebanese Rocket Society]].  He and his students finally launched a [[suborbital rocket]] in 1963. The [[Cedar rocket|Cedar IV rocket]], launched on Lebanese independence day, 21 November 1963 from [[Dbayeh]] north of Beirut, reached {{convert|90|mi}} and was featured on Lebanese stamps.

=== Teaching ===

He returned to the United States in 1966.  Manougian completed a master's degree and doctorate at the University of Texas and continued his academic career in the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of South Florida]]. He is currently still a professor in the University's Department of Mathematics at the University. He also acts as an adviser for the University's Society of Aeronautics and Rocketry student society.

== Views and politics ==
As a member of the Armenian diaspora, he has been known to write editorials advocating awareness about the [[Armenian Genocide]]. He is also a co-author and associate producer of a 4-hour documentary called "The Genocide Factor: The Human Tragedy," that aired on PBS. In addition, he vehemently believes that rocketry and science should be pursued for solely peaceful means. Consequentially, he turned down multiple lucrative offers during his time in the Lebanese Rocket Society rather than let his work be used for military purposes.

'''Marcus Bartley''' (1917 - 14 March 1993) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcusbartley.info/marcusindex.html Bio] retrieved 14 August 2010  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219000828/http://www.marcusbartley.info/marcusindex.html |date=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Anglo-Indian [[cinematographer]] who played a key role in the success of many Indian films. While at school, Bartley was an amateur photographer. He joined the ''Times of India'' in 1935 as press photographer, and then became a newsreel cameraman for British Movietone under the auspices of the ''Times of India''. He was the cinematographer of all time classics like ''[[Maya Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Chemmeen]]''.

==Film industry==
Bartley arrived in Madras and joined Pragati Studios. His maiden film was [[Swarga Seema]] in 1945. This film showed his genius at Black and White photography. The movie strengthened the friendship between him and the BN Reddy, KV Reddy, and Nagi Reddy. Successively, Bartley worked in many studios such as National Studios, Newtone Studios and  Vauhini Productions. He wielded camera for all the forty odd Vauhini movies including such great hits as ''Yogi Vemana'', ''Guna Sundari Katha'', as well as Vijaya's productions ''Shavukaru'', ''Patala Bhairavi'', ''Pellichesi Chudu'', ''Chandraharam'', ''Missamma'', ''Maya Bazaar'', ''Appuchesi Pappukudu'', ''Gundamma Katha'', ''Shri Rajeswari Vilas Coffee Club'', etc. Most of the superhits of those times were made with his photographic hand at the camera. His specialty was the shots under the moonlight.

==Maya Bazar==
*In [[Maya Bazar]] film, a few magic moments that mesmerised several generations of filmgoers and continue to do so. The evergreen song ''Lahiri, lahiri lo'' was shot at Ennore near Madras at noon. The outdoor shooting lasted only for 10 to 15 seconds. Bartley created the illusion of [[moonlight]] and Mayabazar is the first Indian film to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/04/14/stories/2006041409190200.htm Ace lensman recalls magic moments in the Hindu]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The other wonder was the creation of Dwaraka. Some 300 miniature houses, no two alike, were created in about 50 x 60&amp;nbsp;ft. space and electrified. The ace photographer credited this to art director [[Madhavapeddi Gokhale]].
* In Maya Bazar, during "Vivaha Bhojanambu" song, the visual effects created to show Ghatotkacha eating laddus is memorable, and still awe viewers of different generations.

==Awards==
*Recipient of the gold medal at the [[International Film Festival]] held at [[Cannes]] for the movie ''[[Chemmeen]]'' in Malayalam in the year 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2006/08/11/stories/2006081101690200.htm Fifty and still refreshing in the Hindu.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*He won the [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography]] in India in 1970 for ''[[Shanti Nilayam]]''.
*He also won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Cinematographer]] for [[Shanti Nilayam]] in 1970.

==Life==
Mario Capecchi was born in [[Verona]], Italy, as the only child of Luciano Capecchi, an Italian airman who would be later reported as missing in action while manning an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]] in the [[Western Desert Campaign]],&lt;ref name="RepubblicaItalia2007-10"/&gt;&lt;!-- was it in Libya or in Ethiopia? the sources cite the "African front" but there were actually two --&gt; and Lucy Ramberg, an American-born&lt;ref name="DeseretNews2007_10_08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695216829,00.html|title=U. scientist Capecchi wins Nobel Prize|author=Lois M. Collins|date=2007-10-08|publisher=[[Deseret Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Impressionist]] painter Lucy Dodd Ramberg and German archaeologist Walter Ramberg. During [[World War II]], his mother was sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]&lt;ref name="DeseretNews2007_10_08"/&gt;&lt;!--this link is dead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=3701508|title=US, UK Scientists Win Nobel in Medicine|publisher=[[ABC News]]|author1=Karl Ritter |author2=Matt Moore |date=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; as punishment for pamphleteering and belonging to an anti-[[Fascist]] group.&lt;ref name="SaltLakeTribune2001_09_16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_7118310|author=Troy Goodman|title=U. scientist Mario Cappechi scores a 'knockout'|publisher=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=2001-09-16|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her arrest&lt;ref name="SusanSample"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/features/capecchi/ |title=Scientist Profile: Mario Capecchi |year=2007 |author=Susan Sample |publisher=[[University of Utah]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011012649/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/features/capecchi/ |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she had made contingency plans by selling her belongings and giving the proceeds to a peasant family near [[Bolzano]]&lt;ref name="RepubblicaItalia2007-10"/&gt; to provide housing for her only child. However, after one year,&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost2007_10_10"/&gt; the money was exhausted and the family was unable to care for him. At four-and-a-half years old he was left to fend for himself, living as a [[street child]] on the streets of [[northern Italy]] for the next four years,&lt;ref name="RepubblicaItalia2007-10"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ero un ragazzo di strada mia madre mi ha salvato|author=Vittorio Zucconi|language=Italian|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/scienza_e_tecnologia/nobel-medicina-2007/storia-capecchi/storia-capecchi.html|publisher=[[La Repubblica]]|date=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; living in various orphanages and roving through towns with groups of other homeless children.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost2007_10_10"/&gt;

He almost died of malnutrition. His mother, meanwhile, had been freed from Dachau and began a year-long search for him. She finally found him in a hospital bed in [[Reggio Emilia]],&lt;ref name="RepubblicaItalia2007-10"/&gt; ill with a fever and subsisting on a daily bowl of [[chicory]] coffee and bread crust. She took him to Rome, where he had his first bath in six years.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost2007_10_10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/08/AR2007100800252_pf.html|title=From Child on Street to Nobel Laureate|author=Christopher Lee|date=2007-10-10|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 his uncle, [[Edward Ramberg]], an American physicist at [[RCA]], sent his sister money to return to the United States. He and his mother moved to [[Pennsylvania]] to live at an "intentionally cooperative community" called [[Bryn Gweled]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/r/ramberg.htm|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|title=Edward G. Ramberg Papers|author=American Philosophical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been co-founded by his uncle.  (Capecchi's other maternal uncle, Walter Ramberg, was also an American physicist who served as the tenth president of the Society for Experimental Stress Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sem.org/SEM-HISTORY/sem_history23_5.htm|title=A tribute to Walter Ramberg|author=C.E.

Mario Capecchi received his [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] in 1961 from [[Antioch College]] in [[Ohio]]. Capecchi came to [[MIT]] as a graduate student intending to study physics and mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article3041565.ece|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|title=Mario Capecchi: The man who changed our world|author=Andrew Gumbel|date=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but during the course of his studies, he became interested in molecular biology.  He subsequently transferred to Harvard to join the lab of [[James D. Watson]], co-discoverer of the structure of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N46/nobel.html|title=Two Nobel Prize Winners MIT-Affiliated|author=Arkajit Dey|date=2007-10-16|publisher=''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capecchi received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[biophysics]] in 1967&lt;ref name="capecchiphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Mario|last=Capecchi |title=On the Mechanism of Suppression and Polypeptide Chain Initiation |publisher=Harvard University |date=1967 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302261581|authorlink=Mario Capecchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Harvard University]], with his doctoral thesis completed under the tutelage of Watson.

Capecchi was a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University from 1967 to 1969. In 1969 he became an Assistant Professor in the Department of [[Biochemistry]] at [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971. In 1973 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah. Since 1988 Capecchi has also been an investigator of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]. He is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. He has given a talk for [[Duke University]]'s Program in Genetics and Genomics as part of their Distinguished Lecturer Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upg.duke.edu/seminars/distinguished.html|title=Distinguished Lecture Series|publisher=[[Duke University]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908162503/http://upg.duke.edu/seminars/distinguished.html|archivedate=2007-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the speaker for the 2010 Racker Lectures in Biology &amp; Medicine and Cornell Distinguished Lecture in Cell and Molecular Biology at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.cornell.edu/event/mbg_annual_racker_lecture|title=MBG Annual Racker Lecture|publisher=[[Cornell University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Nobel committee publicly announced that Capecchi had won the Nobel prize, an [[Austria]]n woman named Marlene Bonelli claimed that Capecchi was her long-lost half-brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article3073785.ece|title=Reunion beckons for Nobel winner and his long lost step-sister|author=Peter Popham|date=2007-10-18|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2008, Capecchi met with Bonelli, 69, in northern Italy, and confirmed that she was his sister.&lt;ref&gt;"'Looking at the pictures, it was obviously my sister,' Capecchi said, noting her resemblance to their mother."{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=5018719|title=Nobel Winner Reunited With Sister Lost in WWII|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=2008-06-06|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knockout mice==

Capecchi won the Nobel prize for creating a [[knockout mouse]]. This is a mouse, created by genetic engineering and in vitro fertilization, in which a particular gene has been turned off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/science/transgenic/ University of Utah], Transgenic Mice&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, Capecchi won the 2007 Nobel prize for medicine or physiology, along with [[Martin Evans]] and [[Oliver Smithies]], who also contributed.

Capecchi has also pursued a systematic analysis of the mouse [[Hox gene]] family. This gene family plays a key role in the control of [[embryonic development]] in all [[multicellular animal]]s.  They determine the placement of cellular development in the proper order along the axis of the body from head to toe.

She was known for her work in [[feminist epistemology]] and [[standpoint theory]], especially the [[essay]] "''The Feminist Standpoint''",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hartsock | first = Nancy | contribution = The feminist standpoint: developing the ground for a specifically feminist historical materialism | editor-last1 = Harding | editor-first1 = Sandra | editor-link1 = Sandra Harding | title = The feminist standpoint theory reader: intellectual and political controversies | pages = 35–54 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780415945011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Available [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/0-306-48017-4_15 online].&lt;/ref&gt; which also integrated [[Melanie Klein]]'s theories on [[psychoanalysis]] and the [[Oedipal]] crisis.  Her standpoint theory derived from [[Marxism]], which claims that the [[proletariat]] has a distinctive perspective on [[social relations]] and that only this perspective reveals the truth. She drew an analogy between the industrial labor of the proletariat and the domestic labor of women to show that women can also have a distinctive standpoint.

Hartsock was professor of [[political science]] at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name=Wash&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty: Nancy Hartsock, Professor Emeritus|url=http://www.polisci.washington.edu/Directory/Faculty/Faculty/faculty_hartsock.html|publisher=Political Science Department, University of Washington|accessdate=15 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116063522/http://www.polisci.washington.edu/Directory/Faculty/Faculty/faculty_hartsock.html|archivedate=16 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5747">'''Natalie Irish''' (born 8 October 1982) is a Houston-based visual artist.  Her mediums include metal, paint, clay, fabric, and charcoal, but she has gained attention for portraits created using lipstick. She gained media attention in 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odditycentral.com/videos/incredibly-talented-artist-paints-with-her-lips.html ''Oddity Central'' “Incredibly Talented Artist Paints with Her Lips” Published on 6 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; for her lip print portraits of pop icons such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[Roy Rogers]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to parents Denise and Sherman Irish, Irish has lived in [[Manvel, Texas]] since elementary school. Irish married Dennis Bateman at a drive-thru chapel in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonpress.com/2011-08-04/culture/lips-first/ ''Houston Press'' "Lips First" 3 August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; They live together with four cats and a dog. Irish also has two brothers.

Irish was diagnosed with [[type I diabetes]] in 2000 during her senior year in high school. She uses an insulin pump to manage her disease. She attended the [[University of North Texas]] for their metalsmithing program, but left school after three semesters. She returned to Houston and has since become active in the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] and [[American Diabetes Association]], donating both time and art to raise awareness of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanprofile.com/articles/texas-artist-shares-celebrity-kisses/ ''American Profile'' "Texas Artist Shares Celebrity Kisses" 15 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixuntilme.com/blog2/2013/01/natalie_irish_artist_with_diab.html ''Six Until Me'' "Natalie Irish: Artist with Diabetes" 23 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diabetesmine.com/2013/01/a-diabetic-artists-lipstick-creations.html ''Diabetes Mine'' "A Diabetic Artist’s Lipstick Creations" 14 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of wearing a medical alert bracelet, Irish had “Diabetic” tattooed on to the inside of the right wrist.

== Art ==
Irish was interested in art from a young age.  The first pieces of art she recalls creating are a pitcher, two cups, and a bird - all made from clay she dug up in her backyard and dried in the sun while in elementary school. She still has the pitcher and cups in her home.

In 2011, Irish gained media attention when website Oddity Central linked to a [[YouTube]] video of her creating one of her “lip print” pieces, a technique that Irish pioneered in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houstonpress.com/2011-08-04/culture/lips-first/&lt;/ref&gt; Irish’s lip prints are created using lipstick and kissing the canvas. A 2011 Houston Press article details her method, including a video of her creating a self-portrait.

[[Jermaine Rogers]], a celebrated Houston-born poster artist known for his work with rock and roll bands, met Irish during a promotional tour for Vans. Irish’s first commission was a lip print of Jimi Hendrix for Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2011/08/cover_story_natalie_irish.php ''Houston Press Blogs'' "Cover Story: Natalie Irish Paints With Her Lips (With Video Of Her Painting This Week's Cover)" 3 August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Her lipstick portrait of Princess Catherine hangs in Ripley’s Believe it or Not in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/artist-natalie-irish-make_n_1783062.html ''Huffington Post'' "Artist Natalie Irish Creates Portrait Of Dutchess Kate Middleton With Kisses (PHOTOS)" 15 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her signature lip prints, Irish creates fashion accessories including clothing, purses and jewelry, as well as sculptures, charcoal drawings, pencil sketches and oil paintings.  She has been featured in ABC News,&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/video/luscious-lips-paint-brush-16334668 ''ABC News'' "Luscious Lips: the New Paint Brush?" 12 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Bored Panda,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boredpanda.com/natalie-irish-paints-with-her-lips/ ''Bored Panda'' "Natalie Irish Paints With Her Lips" 9 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Glam.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glam.com/meet-natalie-irish-the-kisser-of-the-canvas/ ''Glam.com'' "MEET NATALIE IRISH, THE KISSER OF THE CANVAS" 8 October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Conan O’Brien Show'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://teamcoco.com/video/lipstick-artist-natalie-irish-unveils-her-conan-portrait ''The Conan O’Brien Show'' "Lipstick Artist Natalie Irish Unveils Her Conan Portrait" 20 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Huffington Post'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/natalie-irish ''The Huffington Post'' "Natalie Irish Creates Amazing Portraits Using Only Her Lips (PHOTOS, VIDEO)" 9 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Mail'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2012431/Kiss-colour-Young-Houston-artist-Natalie-Irish-paints-LIPS.html ''The Daily Mail'' "Kiss of colour: The amazing portraits of a young artist who paints only with her LIPS" 8 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/07/the-art-of-a-kiss-woman-paints-portraits-by-puckering-up/ ''Time.com'' "The Art of a Kiss: Woman Paints Portraits By Puckering Up" 7 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and Yahoo News.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/photos/art-by-kiss-1313000637-slideshow/ ''Yahoo News'' "Art by Kiss" 17 August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Her art has also been featured at the Scottsdale Art Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desertlivingtoday.com/2012/03/07/120-seconds-artist-natalie-irish/ ''Desert Living Today'' "120 Seconds: Artist Natalie Irish"]. 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Okinawan names''' today have only two components, the [[family name]]s ([[surname]]s or last names) first and the [[given name]]s last. Okinawan family names represent the distinct historical and cultural background of the islands which now comprise [[Okinawa Prefecture]] in Japan. Expatriates originally from [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] also have these names.

== Modern names ==
As Japanese citizens, Okinawans today comply with the Japanese [[family register]] (''[[koseki]]'') system. Accordingly, an Okinawan name has only two components, a family name and a given name. A family name is called ''myōji'' (苗字 or 名字), ''uji'' (氏) or ''sei'' (姓), and a given name is called the "front name" (名前, ''namae'') or "lower name" (下の名前, ''shita no namae''). The family name precedes the given name. The given name may be referred to as the "lower name" because, in vertically-written Japanese, the given name appears under the family name.

Japanese family names generally show regional variation, but Okinawan family names are known for its distinctiveness. In contrast it becomes increasingly difficult to find unique Okinawan given names.&lt;ref name="ueno2002"&gt;Ueno Kazuo 上野和男, ''Okinawa no namae to shakai'' 沖縄の名前と社会, ''Ryūkyū Ajia no minzoku to rekishi'' 琉球・アジアの民俗と歴史, pp. 41–60, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Top 10 popular Okinawan family names ===
This top 10 list&lt;ref&gt;Morioka Hiroshi 森岡浩, ''Zenkoku Myōji Jiten'' 全国名字辞典, p.333,&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the name as written in [[kanji]] (Chinese characters). Since the [[Japanese language]] allows for multiple possible "readings (pronunciations)" for each character, the reading of Okinawan family names written with the same characters varies. In addition, the [[Okinawan language]] has its own means of reading Japanese kanji.

As in mainland Japan, historical names in Okinawa are more complicated. People with different social statuses bore different kinds of names, maintained several names to use in different occasions, and sometimes changed them in their lifetime. Okinawan names underwent great changes after the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] fell under the Satsuma Domain's control.

=== ''Warabi-naa'' ===
''Warabi-naa'' (warabe-na/''warabi-naa'', 童名) were personal names. For example, the ''warabi-naa'' of [[Tamagusuku Chōkun]] was Umi-guraa (思五良). ''Warabi-naa'' were most prevalent among Okinawans, from the king to commoners, both male and female. They were the oldest component of Okinawan names as, like people in mainland Japan, the inhabitants of Ryukyu islands did not originally have names for families, clans or lineages. They were used as the official names during the early era of the Ryukyu Kingdom. They appeared even in appointment letters by the king, written mostly in [[hiragana]]. It was during the 17th century that other name components prevailed among the pechin class.&lt;ref name="dana-hoi"&gt;Dana Masayuki 田名真之, ''Ryūkyū jinmei kō hoi'' 琉球人名考補遺, Okinawa kinsei shi no shosō 沖縄近世史の諸相, pp. 213–232, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''warabi-naa'' was given soon after birth. Although literally meaning ''childhood name'', it was used by commoners for their entire life. While it was overshadowed by other name components, even adult male members of the pechin class used ''warabi-naa'' at home and when referring to their friends.&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"&gt;Higashionna Kanjun 東恩納寛惇, ''Ryūkyū jinmei kō'' 琉球人名考, ''Higashionna Kanjun zenshū'' 6 東恩納寛惇全集 6, pp.357–478, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in history, stylized use of prefixes and suffixes differentiated social statuses. A commoner used neither a prefix nor suffix, a samurai used either a prefix or suffix, and an aristocrat used both a prefix and a suffix. For example, Tukū (徳) was a name for commoners, Umi-tukū (思徳) for samurai, and Umi-tuku-gani (思徳金) for aristocrats.&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

A set of ''warabi-naa'' appeared in the very beginning of recorded history and has not been changed since then. The number of ''warabi-naa'' pooled in society was extremely small. It was not uncommon for a ''warabi-naa'' to be shared by more than one person in a household. The first male child was usually named after his paternal grandfather.&lt;ref name="ueno2002"/&gt; For example, the last king [[Shō Tai]] had the ''warabi-naa'' Umi-jiraa-gani (思次良金), which was also the name of his grandfather [[Shō Kō]].

=== ''Kamei'' ===
Even in the Old Ryukyu era, social development led Okinawans to acquire names other than ''warabi-naa'' for disambiguation. ''Kamei'' (家名) or ''Yaa-n-naa'' (家の名), both meaning "family name," were often attached to ''warabi-naa''. ''Kamei'' were toponyms, either the domains they ruled or the places of their origin. For example, an inscription of the Old Ryukyu era contains a personal name, ''Mafuto-kane &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ufusato no Ufu-yakumoi'' (まふとかね 大さとの大やくもい), where ''Mafuto-kane'' (Mafutu-gani) was a ''warabi-naa'', ''Ufusato'' (Ufusatu) was a place associated with him, and ''Ufu-yakumoi'' (Ufu-yakumui) was the title he was given.&lt;ref name="kanjun-uji"&gt;Higashionna Kanjun 東恩納寛惇, ''Shisei kō'' 氏姓考, ''Higashionna Kanjun zenshū'' 6 東恩納寛惇全集 6, pp.574–589, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the naming conventions after the separation of the Peichin class from peasants, only the Pechin class was allowed to have ''kamei''. Because the vast majority of the Pechin families lacked domains to rule, they inherited fixed ''kamei''. In contrast, an upper class member used the name of the fief he was given by the king. This means that his ''kamei'' was changed every time a different land was allotted. For example, [[Makishi Chōchū]] (1818–1862) originally had the ''kamei'' Itarashiki (板良敷) but was then given a fief of Ōwan (大湾) before being finally renamed to Makishi (牧志).&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

In early times, ''kamei'' were written predominantly in hiragana. After the [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invasion]] of the Ryūkyū Kingdom by Japan's [[Satsuma Domain]] in 1609, the Japanese-style use of Chinese characters ([[kanji]]) was adopted. The [[Keichō Land Surveys]] of 1609-1611 probably conventionalized to some degree the choice of kanji for place names, and thus surnames based on them. In 1625 the Satsuma Domain instituted a {{nihongo|ban on the use of Japanese-looking family names|大和めきたる名字の禁止|Yamato-mekitaru myōji no kinshi}}. As a result, the kanji used to write ''kamei'' changed from characters that were common in Japan to new, unique character combinations. For example, the name 東 (Higashi) was often changed to 比嘉 (Figa) or 比謝 (Fija), the name 前田 (Maeda) to 真栄田 (the same reading), 福山 (Fukuyama) to 譜久山 (the same reading), etc.&lt;ref name="higa-surname"&gt;Shuncho Higa, ''On Okinawan Surnames'', Shunzo Sakamaki ed., Ryukyuan Names, pp. 31–50, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, ''kamei'' represented a group who shared the founder of a relatively recent past. When it was necessary to distinguish branch families, the main family attached the prefix ''ufu'' (大, great) to its ''kamei'' while the suffix ''gwa'' (少, small), for example, was used for a branch family.&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

Officially, commoners did not have ''kamei''. At some point in history, commoners in the capital region, [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] and [[Naha]], started to assume ''kamei''. However, ''kamei'' of commoners were differentiated verbally and in writing. The last syllable of a commoner's ''kamei'' was lengthened (e.g. Arakachii) while that of a Pechin was not (e.g. Arakachi). For commoners, his ''warabi-naa'' is written first and is followed by his ''kamei''. For example, Taraa (''warabi-naa'') from Yamagushiku was written as たら山城 (Taraa Yamagushiku).&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

Commoners in rural areas unofficially used names for households, which were also called ''Yaa-n-naa'' (屋の名). They were similar to ''yagō'', private family names used by commoners in Japan.&lt;ref name="ueno2002"/&gt;

=== Rank ===
Like in Japan, a rank (位階) was also part of the addressing system. The following was the list of ranks after they were fixed:
* ''Wōji'' (王子)
* ''Anji or Aji'' (按司)
* ''Uwekata'' (親方)
* ''Peekumi'' (親雲上)
* ''Satunushi-peechin'' (里之子親雲上)
* ''Satunushi'' (里之子)
* ''Chukudun-peechin'' (筑登之親雲上)
* ''Chukudun'' (筑登之)&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;
Young male members of the [[Pechin]] class who had no rank were addressed with honorific suffixes: ''shii'' (子) for the upper class and ''nyaa'' (仁屋) for the lower class. Commoners had no rank.&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

=== ''Nanui'' ===
Male members of the Pechin class adopted ''nanui'' (nanori/''nanui'', 名乗), or Japanese-style personal names, when they reached adulthood. Each ''nanui'' consists of two [[kanji]] characters, e.g. 朝薫 ([[Tamagusuku Chōkun|Chōkun]]). The first character of a ''nanui'', called ''nanui-gasira'' (nanori-gashira/''nanui-gasira'', 名乗頭), was shared by a lineage or ''munchū''. For example, the character 朝 (''chō'') was used by branch families of the royal family including [[Tamagusuku Chōkun|Chōkun]] (玉城朝薫), his father Chōchi (朝致) and his son Chōki (朝喜).

The direct reference to a ''nanui'' verbally and in writing was usually avoided because it was considered rude. In domestic documents, a Pechin was usually addressed by the combination of a ''kamei'' and a rank (e.g. Kyan Peekumi (喜屋武親雲上)). This was similar to the convention of Japan, e.g. Andō Tsushima-no-kami (安藤対馬守, Andō, Governor of Tsushima Province) for [[Andō Nobumasa]].&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt; This combination can be found in as early as the first half of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="dana-hoi"/&gt; When necessary, a ''nanui'' was attached to the combination of a ''kamei'' and a rank. It is only a convention of historiography that people of the Ryūkyū Kingdom are referred to by the combination of a ''kamei'' and a ''nanui'', e.g. Tamagusuku Chōkun (玉城朝薫).

''Nanui'' came into use during the 17th century with obvious influence from Satsuma.&lt;ref name="dana-hoi"/&gt; The use of ''nanui-gashira'' is similar to that of ''tsūji'' (通字) in Japan. However, while ''tsūji'' was usually assumed only by the successor of a household, the first son in most cases, each ''nanui-gashira'' was shared by all the male member of a lineage.&lt;ref name="ueno2002"/&gt;

=== ''Kara-naa'' ===
From 1689 male members of the Pechin class also had ''kara-naa'' (唐名) or Chinese names. Each ''kara-naa'' consists of a one-character name for a lineage called ''shii'' or ''uji'' (sei/''shii'', 姓 or uji/''uji'', 氏) and a personal name called ''imina'' (諱). For example, [[Tamagusuku Chōkun]] had the ''kara-naa'' Shō Juyū (向受祐). ''Kara-naa'' appeared neither officially nor privately in domestic affairs, but were used for diplomatic correspondence with [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]]. Thus a lower-class Pechin who had no post in the court had virtually no chance to use his ''kara-naa''.&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

Names for Okinawan officials were recorded in early diplomatic documents written in Classical Chinese. They were actually corrupt forms of ''warabi-naa'' and ''kamei''. For example, ''a-fu-sat-to'' 阿布薩都 and ''ō-sat-to'' 王察度 both referred to the ''kamei'' Ufuzatu (大里). Similarly, ''go-ratsu'' 呉剌 and ''tatsu-ro-ka-ne'' 達魯加禰 derived from ''warabi-naa'' Guraa (五良) and Taru-gani (樽金) respectively.&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt; It is during the 16th century that some officials used names that could be analyzed as Chinese surnames and given names. It seems that at first these names were coined each time they were needed for a diplomatic trip to China. Some families from which diplomats came for generations began to succeed the first character of their ancestors' transcribed names as ''shii''. For instance, descendants of Mafutu-gani, who appeared as ''ma-botsu-to'' (麻勃都) in diplomatic records, adopted the ''shii'' Ma (麻) after him.&lt;ref name="dana-hoi"/&gt;

=== ''Munchū'' or lineages ===
The development of Okinawan naming conventions was closely related with that of ''munchū'' (monchū/''munchū'', 門中), or patrilineages. In 1689 ''Keizu-za'' or the Board of Genealogies (系図座) was established and all the Pechin lineages were ordered to compile genealogical records. In 1690 the royal court assigned one-character ''shii'' or Chinese surnames to all registered lineages. Since commoners were forbidden to compile genealogical records, this effectively separated the Pechin class from commoners. Genealogical records became a status symbol of the Pechin class. The Pechin class came to be referred to as ''keimochi'' (系持), lit. possessing genealogy, while commoners were called ''mukei'' (無系), lit. without genealogy.&lt;ref name="dana-kafu"&gt;Dana Masayuki 田名真之, ''Ryūkyū kafu no seiritsu to sono igi'' 琉球家譜の成立とその意義, Okinawa kinsei shi no shosō 沖縄近世史の諸相, pp. 95–131, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Pechin class, lineages were identified by the combination of the Chinese-style ''shii'' and the Japanese-style ''nanui-gashira''. A lineage with the ''shii'' Mō (毛) shared the ''nanui-gashira'' Sei (盛), but this ''nanui-gashira'' was also used by a lineage named Ō (翁). Also, there was another lineage whose ''shii'' was Mō, but its ''nanui-gashira'' was An (安). It should be noted that ''kamei'' cannot be a designator of lineages. The Mō lineage with the ''nanui-gashira'' Sei had was headed by the family with the ''kamei''  Tomigusuku (豊見城), but its branch families had various ''kamei'' including Kunigami (国頭) and Tomikawa (富川).&lt;ref name="sakamaki-name"&gt;Shunzo Sakamaki, ''On Early Ryukyuan Names'', Shunzo Sakamaki ed., Ryukyuan Names, pp. 11–30, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal house===
The title ''Ō'' (王) or king was of foreign origin. In Okinawan, the king styled himself ''anji-osoi-jyanashi'' or later ''Shui-tin-jyanashi'' (首里天加那志). The king was referred to as ''ushu-jyanashi-me'' by his people and as ''myuumee-jyanashi'' or ''nuumee-jyanshi'' by his family members.&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

Close relatives of the king were given the ranks of ''wōji'' (王子) and ''anji'' (按司). Although ''wōji'' literally means the king's son, its conferrers were not limited to the king's son. A ''wōji'' or ''anji'' was referred to by his domain plus the suffix ''udun'' (御殿). The crown prince was traditionally given the domain Nakagusuku (中城) and therefore referred to as Nakagusuku-udun (中城御殿).&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

Many early kings, up to [[Shō Hō]], had divine names (神号) in addition to ''warabi-naa''. For example, [[Shō Gen]]'s divine name was ''tida-hajimi-aji-sui'' (日始按司添). It seems that divine names were assumed after accession to the throne.&lt;ref name="dana-hoi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kanjun-name"/&gt;

The king had a ''kara-naa'' and used it in diplomatic correspondence with China. The royal ''shii'' Shō (尚) was, according to Ryukyuan records, given to [[Shō Hashi]] by the [[Xuande Emperor]] of Ming China. This statement is highly questionable because no such record is found in Chinese documents and Shō Hashi used the ''shii'' even earlier.&lt;ref name="kanjun-uji"/&gt; In 1692, the branch families of the royal house were given the ''shii'' Shō (向, note the different kanji) and the ''nanui-gashira'' Chō (朝) no matter how distant from the king.&lt;ref name="dana-hoi"/&gt;

===Kumemura===
A district near the capital named [[Kumemura]] is said to have been founded by immigrants from Fujian, China. Its raison d'être was to manage diplomatic contacts with China although some were later engaged in domestic affairs. The members of the community had ''kara-naa'' or Chinese names from the very beginning. It is known that they also had ''warabi-naa'' as early as the first half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="dana-hoi"/&gt;

Today historical figures from Kumemura are often known by ''kara-naa'', e.g. [[Sai On]]. He appeared in domestic documents as Gushichan Uwekata after his ''kamei'' Gushichan (具志頭) and his rank Uwekata (親方). He had a ''nanui'' Bunjaku (文若), and therefore is sometimes known as Gushichan Bunjaku.

=== Modernization ===
The Ryūkyū Kingdom was forced to become a Japanese [[Ryukyu Domain|feudal domain]] by the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] government in 1872, and it was formally annexed by Japan in 1879. Ryūkyūans were then entered into the Japanese [[family register]] (''[[koseki]]'') system and, as in Japan, surnames were extended to all citizens, no longer being the province of the aristocratic classes alone. A large number of the names created at this time were taken from geographical names or places of residence. Direct descendants of [[Tamagusuku Chōkun]], who by the time assumed the ''kamei'' Hentona (辺土名), adopted Hentona as their new surname.&lt;ref name="dana-tamagusuku"&gt;Dana Masayuki 田名真之, ''Tamagusuku Chōkun bo (Hentona ke bo) no hitobito'' 玉城朝薫墓 (辺土名家墓) の人々, Okinawa kinsei shi no shosō 沖縄近世史の諸相, pp. 233–256, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the nobles had assumed new names when they reached adulthood, the new system forced them to adopt lifetime personal names soon after birth. At first, Japanese given names were often given when they entered school. For this reason, given names were informally called "school names" (学校名). ''Warabi-naa'' continued to be used unofficially until the early [[Shōwa period]].&lt;ref name="ueno2002"/&gt;

With increasing contacts with Japan, many Okinawans felt it inconvenient to use their alien-looking surnames. Since the law made it extremely difficult to change surnames, they often changed the ''reading'' of surnames while leaving their written forms unmodified. For example, Naagusuku (宮城) was usually changed to Miyagi (宮城). It is reported that, during the American military occupation after World War II, many managed to change their surname relatively easily. The family registers were completely destroyed by American attacks and reconstructed on individual declarations.&lt;ref name="higa-surname"/&gt;

'''Peter Paul Mauser''', after 1912 '''von Mauser''', (June 27, 1838 – May 29, 1914) was a German weapon designer and manufacturer/[[industrialist]].&lt;ref name=bar&gt;{{cite book|title=Bolt Action Rifles |first=Frank |last=De Haas|editor= Wayne Zwoll|edition= 4|publisher =Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|year= 2003 |chapter=Mauser Models 71 &amp;71/84|page=123|ISBN =978-0-87349-660-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mauser was born in [[Oberndorf am Neckar]], in what was then the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. His father and his four older brothers were gunsmiths.&lt;ref name=bar /&gt;

Together with his brother [[Wilhelm Mauser]], Peter Paul Mauser designed the [[Mauser Model 1871]] rifle, the first of a successful line of [[Mauser]] rifles and pistols. The rifle was adopted as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71 and was the first metal cartridge weapon of the [[German Empire]]. While Wilhelm handled this business side of the factory, Paul proved to be the more technically capable engineer.&lt;ref name=bar /&gt;

Peter Paul Mauser made significant contributions to [[bolt action rifle]] design and successfully combined and improved various bolt action engineering concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/04/13/five-supposed-mauser-firsts-werent/ Five Supposed Mauser Firsts … That Weren’t]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauser company bolt action development resulted in the [[Gewehr 98]] and [[Karabiner 98k]] rifle series that were the latest in a line of Mauser bolt action rifles that started with the [[Mauser Model 1889]] and were adapted in 1889 and the 1890s as service rifles by several countries. The bolt action design used for the Gewehr 98 was patented by Paul Mauser on 9 September 1895.

Peter Paul Mauser also designed the [[7.65×53mm Mauser]] (1889) and [[7×57mm Mauser]] (1892) rifle cartridges. These cartridges were high-performance service cartridge designs compared to other contemporary [[smokeless powder]] service cartridges such as the [[8mm Lebel]] (1886), [[8×50mmR Mannlicher]] (1890) and [[.303 British]] (1891).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsmansvintagepress.com/read-free/mauser-rifles-pistols-table-of-contents/historical-forward/ Mauser Rifles and Pistols by W.

[[Image:Shawn Decker.jpg|thumb|195px|right|Shawn Decker]]'''Shawn Decker''' was born in [[Waynesboro, Virginia]] on July 16, 1975.  He was diagnosed with [[HIV]] at age 11, through the use of tainted blood products used to treat [[hemophilia]], a bleeding disorder that he was born with.  In 1996, he posted a web site called "My Pet Virus", writing humorous articles about himself and blogging about life with HIV.  He befriended fellow "poz blogger" [[Steve Schalchlin]], as well as [[POZ (magazine)|POZ magazine]], who turned his [[blog]] into a regular column the following year, called "Positoid", a word that Decker made up to describe himself as [[HIV positive people|someone living with HIV]].

His memoir, ''My Pet Virus, The True Story of a Rebel Without a Cure'' was published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= What's so funny? |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/09/28/NSGIBJI95P1.DTL&amp;type=printable |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2006-09-28 |accessdate=2008-03-21 | first=Ragnar | last=Carlson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stevan Petrović''', [[Military Order of Maria Theresa|KCMT]] ({{lang-sr-cyr|Стеван Петровић}}), known as '''Stevan Knićanin''' (Стеван Книћанин, '''''Stevan of Knić'''''; 1807-1855) was a [[Serbia]]n ''[[voivode]]'' (commander) of the Serbian volunteer squads in [[Serbian Vojvodina]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolution]].

==Life==

Stevan Petrović was born on February 15, 1807 in [[Knić]] near [[Kragujevac]] (hence his nickname), during the [[Serbian Revolution]], the region at the time being part of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (today [[Serbia]]). During the rule of Prince [[Miloš Obrenović]], Knićanin's political career began as a commissioner of the [[Jasenica (Valjevo)|Jasenica]] municipality in 1835, and in 1839 as a commissioner of the [[Smederevo]] district, but he eventually joined the opposition as a Constitutionalist and supporter of the rival Prince [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]] of the [[Karađorđević dynasty]]. Since he supported "[[ustavobranitelji]]" (the defenders of the constitution), he was expelled from the [[Principality of Serbia]] in 1840-1841. He returned in 1842, after Aleksandar Karađorđević had acceded to the throne on September 14, after being elected the [[Prince of Serbia]] at the National Assembly in [[Vračar]].

===1848 revolution===
[[File:Battle of Vilovo, Katzler.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Vilovo]], 1849.]]
During the 1848 Revolution, the Hungarians demanded national rights and autonomy within the Austrian Empire. However, they did not recognize the national rights of other nationalities which lived in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in that time.

As part of the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the Serbs under Austria-Hungary demanded what they had in the previous century; recognition of Serbian as official language, equality of the Orthodox church as with Catholics, and annual church assembly gatherings.&lt;ref name=Jelavich316&gt;Jelavich, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; They met at [[Sremski Karlovci]] and [[Novi Sad]].&lt;ref name=Jelavich316/&gt; Several thousand Serbs met at the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] on May 1, 1848.&lt;ref name=Jelavich316/&gt; The delegates chose prominent Austrian-Serb general [[Stevan Šupljikac]] as ''voivode'', the civil and military commander (Duke).&lt;ref name=Jelavich316/&gt; [[Josif Rajačić]] was elected the patriarch of the Serbs.&lt;ref name=Jelavich316/&gt; The Serbs demanded a national unit consisting of [[Banat]], [[Bačka]], [[Baranja]] and part of [[Srem]], known collectively as ''[[Vojvodina]]''.&lt;ref name=Jelavich316/&gt; This was completely against the Hungarian authorities visions.

From May 1848 onward, [[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbs of Vojvodina]] directly sought aid from [[Principality of Serbia|the Serbian Principality]], and on May 10, general Stratimirović, head of the main committee, appealed to Prince Aleksandar for assistance and urged Knićanin to intercede.&lt;ref&gt;David MacKenzie, ''Ilija Garašanin, Balkan Bismarck'', 1985, p. 97, {{ISBN|0-88033-073-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88033-073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knicanin was elected military commander.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Jelavich, ''South Slav nationalisms'', p. 192, {{ISBN|0-8142-0500-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had no prior experience in war, nor went to military school.

In June and July a large wave of volunteers from the Principality entered Vojvodina. Knićanin arrived on July 25. Among others who arrived were: the brother and nephew of [[Hajduk Veljko]], council member [[Milutin Petrović]], major [[Stanojlo Petrović]], captain [[Sava Petrović]] and ''voivode'' [[Mateja Nenadović|prota Nenadović]].

From August 1848, Knićanin was a commander of the Serbian volunteer squads in the [[Serbian Vojvodina]], in which unit also [[Golub Babić]] fought in. The size of his army exceeded 8,000&lt;ref&gt;Rice University, 1967, ''Austrian history yearbook
, Volume 3, Issue 2'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; or 10,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;''South Slav nationalisms'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; His military knowledge was expressed in more occasions, especially in the battles near [[Pančevo]] and [[Vršac]] during the 1848 Revolution in what was then the Austrian Empire.

After his return to Serbia in May 1849, Knićanin was awarded with the title of [[voivode]] by Aleksandar Karađorđević, at that time it had only been given to [[Toma Vučić Perišić]].&lt;ref name=HristicKosta&gt;Kosta N. Hristić: „Zapisi starog Beograđanina“, Nolit, Beograd 1989, str. 516-517, {{ISBN|86-19-01637-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a "[[Military Order of Maria Theresa|Knight of Maria Therese]]", the highest order of the Austrian army.&lt;ref name=HristicKosta/&gt;

===Later years and death===
As a result of a stroke in 1854, he died on May 14, 1855, in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;„Pisma Mine Karadžić Vukomanović“, izd. Rad, Beograd, 1997. godine; pismo bratu Dimitriju od 9. jula 1854: „Ovo ti više stavljam na srce, jer je nedavno jednog od najznačajnijih ljudi naše otadžbine pogodila teška nesreća, čiji je uzrok, prema izjavi lekara, u velikoj neumerenosti u jelu: Knićanina je udarila kap. Doduše nije umro, ali, što je još žalosnije, oduzeta mu je leva strana od temena do pete. Preneli su ga u unutrašnjost zemlje, u banju, ali se više ne može misliti na ozdravljenje.“&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1850, Louis Kossuth wrote: "Bold Knicanin did wonders of bravery on the Lower Danube,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=828IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA297 p. 297]&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of [[Knićanin]] in the Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]] was named after him.

== Origins ==
The trio is made up of Dr. Rameck Hunt, Dr. Sampson Davis, and Dr. George Jenkins. All three grew up in [[Newark, New Jersey]] without a father and first met as schoolmates at [[University High School (New Jersey)|University High School]].&lt;ref name="wbts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper|first=Sharon|author2=Dr. Sampson Davis |author3=Dr. Rameck Hunt |author4=Dr. George Jenkins |title=We Beat the Street|publisher=Puffin|date=April 20, 2006|isbn=978-0-14-240627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three grew up in [[public housing]] and came from low-income families.&lt;ref name="wbts" /&gt; During high school, the three made a pact to get through high school, [[college]], and [[medical school]] successfully&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-10-02-three-doctors_N.htm|title=Authors and 'Three Doctors' bond with fathers|last=Minzesheimer|first=Bob|date=10/03/2007|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and credit school counselor Carla Dickson with guiding them through their tumultuous teenage years.&lt;ref name="akb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.com/news/cardwell/34316449.html|title=The Three Doctors find safety in numbers |last=Cardwell|first=Jewell|date=2008-11-12|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal/Ohio.com|accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attended the pre-medicine/pre-dental course at [[Seton Hall University]] on a scholarship program.&lt;ref name="wbts" /&gt;

=== Rameck Hunt ===
Hunt's mother was a drug addict and he was mostly raised by his grandmother. He struggled through school, frequently getting into trouble and had anger management issues. While in high school he befriended Davis and Jenkins and resolved to turn his life around. After completing premedical studies at [[Seton Hall University]], he attended [[Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]] (RWJMS), then part of the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]], and completed his residency in [[internal medicine]] at [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]]. He is currently a board-certified internist at [[University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro|University Medical Center of Princeton]] and an Assistant Professor at RWJMS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://threedoctors.com/dr-rameck-hunt-md/ Rameck Hunt]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sampson Davis ===
Davis, the fifth of six children, grew up in a neighborhood notorious for crime and drugs. He excelled in school and has said that education "saved his life". Like Hunt, he completed medical school at RWJMS. He then completed his residency in [[emergency medicine]] at [[Newark Beth Israel Medical Center]], where he is now an attending physician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://threedoctors.com/sampson-davis/ Sampson David]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== George Jenkins ===
Jenkins was born on February 6, 1973 in Newark. He was inspired to become a dentist after a visit to the dentist's office for braces when he was a teenager. After undergraduate studies at Seton Hall, he completed his [[Dental degree|D.M.D.]] at [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]]. He is an Assistant Professor of clinical dentistry at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://threedoctors.com/georgejenkins/ George Jenkins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TC Launches Harlem Schools Partnership|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/news.htm?articleId=6956|publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University|tc.columbia.edu]]|date=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speaking ==
The members of the group rarely speak individually; they usually speak as a group.&lt;ref name="os" /&gt; They speak throughout the United States at different venues and times of the year.  They also accept requests to speak at private venues, such as schools.&lt;ref name="os" /&gt;

"The Energitic Brain: Understanding and Managing ADHD", 2011; 'ADHD and You.&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[Model (person)|model]] and [[actor]].

His rise to prominence began with his role as carpenter on the [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] home improvement reality show ''[[Trading Spaces]]'' (2000–2003), and most notably for his work as host of the critically acclaimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hfpla.com/extreme-makeover-home-edition/page/4|title=Hoosick Falls Productions » Extreme Makeover: Home Edition|website=hfpla.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] reality series ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' (2003–2012), for which he earned international recognition as an advocate for volunteerism and helping others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guaranteedrate.com/news/guaranteed-rate-welcomes-ty-pennington-as-spokesperson|title=Guaranteed Rate Welcomes Ty Pennington As Spokesperson- GuaranteedRate.com|website=Guaranteed Rate|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the show's conclusion in 2012, Pennington has focused on numerous other projects, including host of ABC's short lived talk show ''[[The Revolution (TV series)|The Revolution]]'' in 2012, TNT's ''[[On the Menu]]'' opposite [[Emeril Lagasse]] in 2014 and [[The Food Network]]'s ''[[American Diner Revival]]'' opposite [[Amanda Freitag]] from 2015 to 2016. On September 13, 2017, it was announced that Pennington had signed on to join his former cast members for the reboot of ''Trading Spaces'', which is scheduled to air on TLC in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ty-pennington-carter-oosterhouse-return-to-trading-spaces-w503108|title=Ty Pennington, Carter Oosterhouse Return to ‘Trading Spaces’|date=14 September 2017|website=Usmagazine.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pennington was born in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] as Gary Tygert Burton, the second son of school psychologist Yvonne Burton. Yvonne separated from Ty's father when he and his older brother Wynn were very young, and spent several years as a single parent before she remarried. Her new husband adopted both boys, giving them his surname Pennington. Ty is of partial [[Cherokee]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://typennington.com/tys-take-my-turquoise-necklaces/|title=Ty’s Take: My Turquoise Necklaces ‹ Ty Pennington|website=typennington.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
A self-described "Jack of all trades",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Latoya|url=http://realitytv.about.com/od/abc/a/typennington.htm|title=Ty Pennington Biodata|website=Realitytv.about.com|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennington learned woodworking early in life and began teaching himself about carpentry and home improvement. After attending [[Sprayberry High School]] in [[Marietta, Georgia]], he first attended [[Kennesaw State University]], where he majored in art and history. He paid his way through college by taking night classes and working during the day, first working in landscaping before moving into construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2015/01/15/qa-home-design-expert-ty-pennington/21816311/|title=Q&amp;A with home design expert Ty Pennington|website=Indystar.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his skills in carpentry, Pennington initially decided that carpentry wasn't something he wanted to do professionally, noting his main interests were in becoming an artist, specializing in Graphic Design.&lt;ref name="notablebiographies.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-La-Pr/Pennington-Ty.html|title=Ty Pennington Biography - life, family, parents, story, history, mother, young, book, old, born, college - Newsmakers Cumulation|website=Notablebiographies.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of one of his professors, he transferred to the [[Art Institute of Atlanta]], from where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design.&lt;ref name="notablebiographies.com"/&gt;

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2017}}

===Modeling===
During his final semester, Pennington was approached by a modeling scout, and soon began a lucrative career in that field. He landed print jobs for [[J.Crew]], [[Swatch]] and [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]], and appeared in television spots for [[Diet Coke]], [[Levi's]], [[Macy's]] and [[Bayer]], among others. His job as a model took him to places all over the world, as he went on to reside in [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], and [[Germany]].

===Television===
Pennington parlayed his hands-on skills and design acumen into a career in the entertainment industry, becoming a set designer, including for ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'' in 1995. However, his professional breakthrough came through [[The Learning Channel]]'s (now known as simply TLC) innovative hit show ''[[Trading Spaces]]''. In 2003, he acted in the independent film, ''The Adventures of Ociee Nash'' (as "Wilbur Wright").

In 2003, when ABC began developing a show that would transform the homes of deserving families in seven days or less, Pennington was chosen as the leader of the eight-person design team. ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', which was originally planned to be a 13-part special, became a huge hit, and catapulted Pennington to stardom. This led to an endorsement deal with [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], a sponsor of the show. Pennington was extremely dedicated to the show, spending on average 240 days of the year working, and was known to have fought off anything from pulled muscles to heatstroke to food poisoning to keep doing his job. He stated that his career on the show resulted in the channel commissioning ''[[Ty's Great British Adventure]]'', in which he worked with communities including [[Portreath]], [[Cornwall]] (UK) to restore a run-down town park in a week and [[Portishead, North Somerset]] (UK) to renovate the town's derelict outdoor pool into a community run Lido. The series was shown from September 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uktv.co.uk/home/dgiped/kw/172|title=About Home|publisher=UKTV|date=2015-08-11|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Extreme Makeover Home Edition'' ended in 2011 with its ninth season, Pennington had helped rebuild more than 200 homes for the show. Afterwards, Pennington relocated from Los Angeles to New York City, where he was cast to take part in the lifestyle-based talk show ''The Revolution'', which aired on ABC in January 2012. On one episode he appeared with Dr [[Edward Hallowell (psychiatrist)|Edward Hallowell]]. Both men talked about ADHD and stimulant drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/137066/adhd-sold|title=How ADHD Was Sold|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cancelled after six months, after which Ty began pursuing other goals.

===Other work===
Prior to his partnership with Sears, Pennington was the owner and designer of his company, Furniture Unlimited, which is based in Atlanta and Los Angeles. He also lends his name to Sears, with their design team guiding the design of every item in the Ty Pennington Style line of bedding, tabletop items, bath accessories, furniture, patio furniture, and other miscellaneous home decor.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Pennington published ''Ty's Tricks: Home Repair Secrets Plus Cheap and Easy Projects to Transform Any Room'' (2003), a [[do-it-yourself]] guide on home improvement. On May 15, 2007, he released the first issue of his quarterly magazine ''Ty Pennington at Home'', which ran until 2009. 

On July 25, 2008, he announced a 3-year partnership with Marketplace Events, the largest organizer of consumer remodeling, home decor and gardening shows in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketplaceevents.com|title=Market Leading Consumer Events|publisher=Marketplace Events|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Pennington became the spokesperson for [[Abbott Nutrition]] and their [[baby formula]] packaging innovation called ''Similac SimplePac''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abbottnutrition.com/news_and_media/press_releases/pressReleaseDetail.aspx?ContentTitle=Abbott-Innovates-Inside-and-Out-with-New-Similac-Infant-Formula-and-Packaging&amp;year=2008|title=Abbott Nutrition - Abbott-Innovates-Inside-and-Out-with-New-Similac-Infant-Formula-and-Packaging|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2017-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926124818/http://abbottnutrition.com/news_and_media/press_releases/pressReleaseDetail.aspx?ContentTitle=Abbott-Innovates-Inside-and-Out-with-New-Similac-Infant-Formula-and-Packaging&amp;year=2008|archivedate=2008-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with the ''Similac Custom Nursery Design Contest'' and ''Ty's Nursery Guide'' that were part of the new product marketing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In September 2011, Pennington was on one showing of Disney's ''[[Take Two With Phineas and Ferb]]''. On October 3, 2011, it was announced that Pennington was to join the upcoming series ''[[The Revolution (TV series)|The Revolution]]''. The show premiered on Monday, January 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/10/03/ty-pennington-joins-new-abc-daytime-show-the-revolution/105777/ |title=Ty Pennington Joins New ABC Daytime Show ''The Revolution'' – Page 105777|website=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com|date=2011-10-03|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Pennington became the spokesperson for [[Guaranteed Rate]] and has been featured in a series of commercials and ads for the Chicago-based mortgage lender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guaranteedrate.com/news/commercials-launch|title=Guaranteed Rate National Television Commercials with Ty Pennington Debut This Week- GuaranteedRate.com|website=Guaranteed Rate|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ADHD===
As a child, Pennington was plagued with behavioral problems until he was diagnosed with [[ADHD]] at the age of 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edgefoundation.org/2017/04/15/ty-penningtons-extreme-adhd-makeover/|title=Ty Pennington’s Extreme ADHD Makeover|date=15 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKdfSqy4NOs|title=Celebrities with ADHD: Ty Pennington|first=|last=ADHD ADD|date=27 February 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed his ADHD with [[Glenn Beck]].&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/196/12741/|title=Glenn interviews Ty Pennington|date=22 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ty has partnered with [[Shire Plc]] to raise awareness of ADHD in adults and promote the use of [[Vyvanse]] for the treatment of adult ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addadult.com/celebrity-designer-and-adhd-spokesperson-ty-pennington-partners-with-shire-to-announce-the-launch-of-vyvansetm-lisdexamfetamine-dimesylate-for-the-treatment-of-adhd-in-adults/|title=Loading site please wait...|website=www.addadult.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been criticized for promoting the use of ADHD medications such as [[Adderall]] without disclosing his sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/health/the-selling-of-attention-deficit-disorder.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Selling of Attention Deficit Disorder|first=Alan|last=Schwarz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared on TV with [[Russell Barkley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B66nengrhZo&amp;t=661s|title=ADHD Live - Overview of Adult ADHD / Dr. Russell Barkley &amp; Ty Pennington|first=|last=Dr. Theresa Cerulli|date=9 January 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Winifred Carney''', also known as '''Winnie Carney''', (4 December 1887&amp;nbsp;– 21 November 1943) was a [[Suffrage|suffragist]], trade unionist and Irish independence activist.&lt;ref name="New Ulster Biography"&gt;[http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/225 New Ulster Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Born into a lower-middle class Catholic family in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]], County Down,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai001428769/ Carney Family's 1911 Census Form]&lt;/ref&gt; her six siblings and mother moved to [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]] in Belfast when she was a child, where her mother ran a small sweet shop. Her father was a Protestant who left the family, leaving her mother to support them. Carney was educated at the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers School]] in Donegall Street in the city, later teaching at the school. She enrolled at Hughes Commercial Academy around 1910, where she qualified as a secretary and shorthand typist, one of the first women in Belfast to do so. However, from the start she was looking towards doing more than just secretarial work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Early career==
In 1912 Carney was in charge of the women's section of the [[Northern Ireland Textile Workers' Union|Irish Textile Workers' Union]] in Belfast, which she founded with [[Delia Larkin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During this period she met [[James Connolly]] and became his personal secretary.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rLrsi3hpXIQC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=%22Winnie+Carney%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Winnie%20Carney%22&amp;f=false ''Irish Political Prisoners, 1848–1922: Theatres of War'' By Seán McConville]&lt;/ref&gt; Carney became Connolly's friend and confidant as they worked together to improve the conditions for female labourers in Belfast.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = James Connolly 'A Full Life'|last = Nevin|first = Donal|publisher = Gill &amp; Macmillan|year = 2006|isbn = 978 07171 2962 1|location = Dublin|pages = 408–412, 657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carney and Connolly worked together to try a better women's rights and suffrage among the female factory labourers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to her biographer Helga Woggon, Carney was the person best acquainted with Connolly's politics. Carney then joined [[Cumann na mBan]], the women's auxiliary of the [[Irish Volunteers]], and attended its first meeting in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/unity/003war.html ''Irish women and the First World War'', part 3 – ''Women and the 1916 Rising'', by Lynda Walker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Easter Rising==
She was present with Connolly in the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|Dublin General Post Office]] during the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916. Carney was the only woman present during the initial occupation of the building,&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.udayton.edu/MarybethCarlson/santucci4.htm ''Women's Involvement in the Irish Easter Uprising of 1916'', Dr. Marybeth Carlson – University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; which she entered armed with a [[typewriter]] and a [[Webley &amp; Scott|Webley]] revolver. While not a combatant, she was given the rank of [[adjutant]] and was among the final group (including Connolly and [[Patrick Pearse]]) to leave the GPO. After Connolly became wounded, she refused to leave his side.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/16/opinion/eight-women-of-irelands-1916-easter-rising.html Eight Women of the Easter Rising] ''The New York Times'', 16 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite direct orders from [[Patrick Pearse|Pearse]] and Connolly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She had earlier taken the wounded Connolly's final dictated orders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=48ufAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Winifred+Carney%22&amp;dq=%22Winifred+Carney%22&amp;lr= ''The rising: The Complete Story of Easter Week'', Desmond Ryan]&lt;/ref&gt; Carney, alongside [[Elizabeth O'Farrell]] and [[Julia Grenan]] left the GPO with the rest of the rebels after their surrender.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Renegades, Irish Republican Women 1900–1922|last = Matthews|first = Ann|publisher = Mercier History|year = 2010|isbn = 978 1 85635 684 8|location = Dublin|pages = 124–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dublin General Post Office.jpeg|left|thumb|265x265px|The Dublin General Post Office, 
wherein Carney was with Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising.]]
After her capture, she was held in [[Kilmainham Gaol]] and was then moved to [[Mountjoy Prison]]. Carney, alongside [[Helena Molony]], Maria Perolz, [[Brigid Foley]] and Ellen O'Ryan and others were moved to an English prison. 69 women were released from prison one week after the execution of the Rising's leaders. By August 1916 Carney was imprisoned in [[Aylesbury (HM Prison)|Aylesbury]] prison alongside [[Nell Ryan]] and [[Helena Molony]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The three requested that their [[Internment|internee]] status, and the privileges it brought, be revoked so that they would be held as normal prisoners with [[Constance Markievicz|Countess Markievicz]]. Their request was denied, however Carney and Molony were released two days before Christmas 1916.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/internment/intern6.htm ''Internment'' by John McGuffin]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and the formation of the [[Irish Free State]], Carney sided with the Anti-Treaty forces and was arrested several times.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

Despite her own time of imprisonment, Carney was not opposed to visiting her political friends during their times in prison. It was recorded that she visited [[Austin Stack]] in December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Political Imprisonment and the Irish, 1912–1921|last = Murphy|first = William|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978 0 19 956907 6|location = |pages = 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
She was one of the first Irish women to be qualified as a secretary and a short hand typist from Hughes' Commercial Academy. She worked as a clerk and became involved in the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] in the Suffragist movement and in socialist activities. She met James Connolly in 1912 and consequently became the secretary for the Textile Workers' Union. In 1913 she was heavily involved in the fundraising for the locked-out Dublin labourers. As a result of her deep involvement with the trade union, she met and eventually became Connolly's typist, typing his articles for publication. Aside from being his typist, she became a friend and confidant. According to her biographer, Helga Woggon, she had become the person most closely acquainted with Connolly's beliefs, ideals, and plans.

When the [[World War I|Great War]] commenced in 1914, Carney concurred with Connolly that it was the perfect time to stage a rebellion, even if it was only of a symbolic value.

While she was in [[Cumann na mBan]], she taught first aid and developed a proficiency for handling a rifle. On 14 April 1916, she was summoned by Connolly to join him in the insurgents in the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] where they were garrisoned. Initially, Carney was the only woman at the headquarters of the General Post Office and one of the three remaining women when the garrison had to evacuate the building when it was burned and had to relocate to Moore Street. After Connolly became wounded, she stayed with him. Afterwards, Carney was arrested and held in [[Kilmainham Gaol|Kilmainham]], [[Mountjoy Prison|Mountjoy]], and Aylesbury Jails until the Christmas of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Labour Party|url = https://www.labour.ie/|website = The Labour Party|accessdate = 23 November 2015|first = The Labour|last = Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1917 Belfast [[Cumann na mBan]] convention, she was the delegate.

She stood for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a [[Sinn Féin]] candidate for [[Belfast Victoria (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Victoria]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 General Election]]. She polled 4.05% of the vote, gaining 539 votes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |title = Irish Women and The Vote: Becoming Citizens|last = Ryan|first = Louise|publisher = Irish Academic Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7165-3393-1|location = Wales|pages = 195–200, 202–205|last2 = Ward|first2 = Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carney lost to the [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]]. Having lost, she decided instead to continue her work at the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union until 1928. By 1924 she had become a member of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="New Ulster Biography" /&gt; In the 1930s she joined the [[Socialist Party of Northern Ireland|Belfast Socialist Party]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dictionary of Ulster Biography|url = http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/225|website = ''newulsterbiography.co.uk''|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Civil War, Carney became a lot more disillusioned with politics. She was very critical and outspoken of Éamon de Valera and his governments.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

==Later life and death==

In 1928 she married George McBride, a Protestant [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] and former member of the [[Ulster Volunteers]]. Ironically, the formation of the Ulster Volunteers prompted the formation of the Irish Volunteers, of which Carney was a member. Carney alienated anyone in her life that did not support her marriage to George McBride. McBride was however a fellow socialist. She continued to be involved in the trade union movement, working for the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=637&amp;cmd=print Culture Northern Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of serious health problems limited her political activities in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labour.ie/download/pdf/seven_women_of_the_labour_movement1916.pdf ''Seven Women of the Labour Movement 1916'', by Sinéad McCoole]&lt;/ref&gt; Carney died in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 21 November 1943, and is buried in [[Milltown Cemetery]]. Her resting place was found years later and a headstone was erected by the [[National Graves Association, Belfast]]. An oration was done then by Belfast Republican, [[Liam Rice|Liam]] [[Liam Rice|Rice]]. Because Carney married a Protestant and former [[Orange Order|Orangeman]], she was not allowed to have his name (McBride) on her gravestone due to the religious differences. They were married for fifteen years and George McBride never remarried after Carney's early death.

In 2013, the Seventieth Anniversary of Carney's death was remembered by the Socialist Republican Party. Almost one hundred people attended as a short parade followed, marking an commemorating the work Carney did for the cause. She was placed in high esteem among the other hundreds of radical women, who stood up for what they believed in, regardless of the consequences they faced.
