==Synopsis==
''Against Medical Advice'' begins with a seventeen-year-old Cory arriving at the Dressler Psychiatric Hospital for alcohol abuse, with him detailing the various medications he is on and how he feels that they do nothing for him. Cory expresses frustration over giving the appearance of being insane, despite his not feeling as if he was. The book shows how Cory began exhibiting uncontrollable urges to perform body tics and say various things at the age of five years. As he grew up, he was put through several different treatments, which contributed to his feelings of helplessness. Since he is unable to control his actions due to having [[OCD]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and an anxiety disorder, Cory experienced ridicule in his life and had troubles living the everyday life of a child, which is exacerbated by ill medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CONNELLY|first=SHERRYL|title=More book reviews: Sister Souljah's fiction, James Patterson's truth|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-11-09/entertainment/17911050_1_sister-souljah-cory-james-patterson|accessdate=20 November 2012|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=November 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rear Admiral]] '''Ali S. Khan''' is an American practicing physician and former Director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (PHPR) at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Since July 2014, he has served as Dean of the College of Public Health and Retired Assistant Surgeon General at the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]] in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="CDC_bio"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121223033141/http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/leadership.htm | url = https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/leadership.htm | title = CDC PHPR Leadership | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | archivedate = 2012-12-23 | accessdate = 2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ali-s-khan/36/757/104 | title = Ali S. Khan | publisher = LinkedIn | accessdate = 2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Ali Khan received his [[Doctor of Medicine]] from the [[State University of New York Downstate Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], NY, and completed a joint residency in [[Med-Peds|internal medicine and pediatrics]] at the [[University of Michigan]].  He later went on to pursue a [[Professional degrees of public health|Masters of Public Health]] (MPH) from [[Emory University]].&lt;ref name="CDC_bio" /&gt;

==Career==
Khan’s federal career began in 1991 when he joined CDC and the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] Commissioned Corps as an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] (EIS) officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Meet the Scientists: Ali S. Khan | url = http://archives.microbeworld.org/scientists/interviews/interview1.aspx | publisher = Microbe World | accessdate = August 30, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210135339/http://archives.microbeworld.org/scientists/interviews/interview1.aspx | archive-date = 2015-12-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Khan has focused his career on [[bioterrorism]], [[global health]], and [[emerging infectious diseases]].  While serving as the interim Director for CDC’s global infectious disease activities, he designed CDC’s joint global field [[epidemiology]] and [[laboratory]] training program.  Dr. Khan helped design and implement the [[President's Malaria Initiative]],&lt;ref name="business_insider"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/author/ali-s-khan | title = Ali S. Khan | publisher = Business Insider | accessdate = August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a $1.2 billion, five-year project to reduce the burden of [[malaria]] and relieve poverty in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fightingmalaria.gov/about/results.html | title = The President's Malaria Initiative: PMI Results | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130213212855/http://www.fightingmalaria.gov/about/results.html | archivedate = February 13, 2013 | publisher = [[President's Malaria Initiative]] | accessdate = August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been engaged in [[polio]] and [[guinea worm eradication]]. Additionally, Khan proposed the BioPHusion program as a new [[public health]] initiative to improve knowledge exchange for all public health practitioners. BioPHusion was used during the [[H1n1|H1N1 pandemic]] to identify emerging cases and plan response actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albop.com/BioPHusion%20Swine%20Flu%20Special%20Report%2004_26_2009_Final.pdf |title=BioPHusion Swine Flu Special Report 04-26-2009 |publisher=Alabama Board of Pharmacy |date=April 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707103609/http://www.albop.com/BioPHusion%20Swine%20Flu%20Special%20Report%2004_26_2009_Final.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan’s initial work in [[emergency preparedness]] started in 1999 when he helped establish CDC’s [[bioterrorism]] program, which upgraded local, state, and national public health systems to detect and rapidly respond to bioterrorism. As deputy director of the bioterrorism program, Khan created the [[Select agent|Critical Agent]] list, which has remained the basis for all biological terrorism preparedness.  Dr. Khan also published the first national public health preparedness plan, initiated [[clinical surveillance|syndrome based surveillance]], and designed key focus areas to improve local and State capacities to respond to emergencies. Khan used these preparedness efforts during the first [[anthrax attack]] in 2001, during which he directed the CDC operational response in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Prior to becoming Director of PHPR in August 2010, Dr. Khan served as Deputy Director of CDC’s National Center for Emerging and [[Zoonotic]] [[Infectious Diseases]] (NCEZID).  He has responded to and led numerous domestic and international public health emergencies, including [[hantavirus]] pulmonary syndrome, [[Ebola]] hemorrhagic fever, [[monkeypox]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[avian influenza]], [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS), the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami]], and the initial public health response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.onehealthcommission.org/news/summit-bios/Ali-Khan.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727144508/http://www.onehealthcommission.org/news/summit-bios/Ali-Khan.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Khan published ''The Next Pandemic'' (with William Patrick). In it he recounts some of his experiences responding to outbreaks all over the world, including many of those mentioned above. Besides his personal experiences, he also provides a great deal of background information for readers interested in public health and emerging diseases.&lt;ref name=Khan2016&gt;Khan, Ali S. &amp; Patrick, William.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2325">'''Chillcuring''' is a [[grain]] [[ventilating]] process, especially of fresh-harvested shelled [[maize|corn]].

==Process==
As described in inventions of Sylvester L. Steffen,&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|4800653}}; {{patent|US|4247989}}; {{patent|US|4175418}}; {{patent|US|4148147}}; {{patent|US|4077134}}; {{patent|US|4053991}}; {{patent|US|4045878}}; {{patent|US|3408747}}; {{patent|WO|1090562}} and {{patent|WO|1086052}}&lt;/ref&gt; chillcuring is an electrical ventilating process that facilitates the [[photoelectric]] after-ripening of bulk stored [[seeds]]. The [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] process is controlled by monitoring the [[wet-bulb temperature]] of [[air]] around the grain (as measured by [[evaporative cooling]]), by which the grain is brought to equilibrium moisture and temperature with atmospheric air. [[Seed dormancy]] is better maintained at cooler (chill) atmospheric temperatures, and grain weight and seed vigor are better preserved. The after-ripening of seeds is a biochemical process of [[carbohydrate]]/[[protein]] stabilization associated with the chemical release of [[water]] (H:OH), a reverse process of [[hydrolysis]]. The triatomic molecules of water and carbon dioxide are especially reactive in attenuating infrared light-spectrum waves, which provides energy necessary in photosynthesis and (curing) after-ripening. Infrared electrical heat is supplied by “grainlamps” so as to energize water vapor in the air under high humidity conditions.

==History==
The Steffen Patents were at issue in federal lawsuits in Minnesota, Indiana and Iowa. The validity of the Steffen Process Patents was upheld. The chillcuring process was marketed from the 1960s into the late 1990s by Harvestall Industries, Inc., an agribusiness of the former and now deceased Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, Vincent B. Steffen.

'''Cobb syndrome''' is a rare [[congenital]] disorder characterized by visible skin lesions with underlying spinal [[angioma]]s or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s (AVMs).&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rapini | first1 = Ronald P. | last2 = Bolognia | first2 = Jean L. | last3 = Jorizzo | first3 = Joseph L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skin lesions of Cobb syndrome typically are present as [[port wine stain]]s or angiomas, but reports exist of [[angiokeratoma]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clinton TS, Cooke LM, Graham BS | title = Cobb syndrome associated with a verrucous (angiokeratomalike) vascular malformation | journal = Cutis | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–7 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12729091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[angiolipoma]]s, and [[lymphangioma circumscriptum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shim JH, Lee DW, Cho BK | title = A case of Cobb syndrome associated with lymphangioma circumscriptum | journal = Dermatology | volume = 193 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–7 | date = 1996 | pmid = 8864618 | doi = 10.1159/000246199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intraspinal lesions may be angiomas or AVMs and occur at levels of the [[spinal cord]] corresponding to the affected skin [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]]s. They may in turn produce spinal cord dysfunction and weakness or paralysis.

The disorder was first described by Berenbruch in 1890, but became widely known only after Cobb's report in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cobb S | title = HAEMANGIOMA OF THE SPINAL CORD: ASSOCIATED WITH SKIN NAEVI OF THE SAME METAMERE | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 641–9 | date = December 1915 | pmid = 17863459 | pmc = 1406820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb syndrome is thought to have no sex predilection, but there have been less than 100 cases reported in the literature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/11892/cobb-syndrome|title=Cobb syndrome | work = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program  |access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be due to a sporadic mutation, since parents of affected children usually have no evidence of the disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
The disease is present at birth, but clinical manifestations are often not seen until later in life. Patients typically experience the sudden onset of pain, numbness, or weakness in their extremities as children or young adults. These symptoms may remit or remain stable and often can be localized below a specific dermatome. Symptoms tend to worsen over time either by discrete steps or continuously. Early development of weakness may portend a more aggressive course. Less commonly, weakness or bowel and bladder dysfunction may be presenting symptoms.

The major debility from Cobb syndrome is the onset of weakness, paresis, sensory loss, and loss of bowel and bladder control. A possible complication if treatment is delayed is [[Foix–Alajouanine syndrome|Foix-Alajouanine]] syndrome&lt;ref&gt;Wirth FP, Post KD, Di Chiro G. ''Foix-Alajouanine disease. Spontaneous thrombosis of a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation: a case report.'' Neurology. 1970;20:1114–18.&lt;/ref&gt; or subacute necrotic myelopathy due to thrombosis in the spinal angioma.

Cutaneous lesions may be distributed anywhere in the dermatome, from midline back to abdomen. Midline back lesions may be associated with [[spina bifida]]. The cutaneous lesion may be very faint and may be more pronounced when the patient performs a [[Valsalva maneuver]] which increases abdominal pressure and causes preferential filling of the cutaneous angioma. Neurological examination will reveal weakness or paralysis and numbness or decreased sensation with a sharp upper cutoff.
==Diagnosis==
Cobb Syndrome is diagnosed by [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], supplemented by medullary [[angiography]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Convoc16-9.jpg|thumb|A Doctor of Public Health at [[Boston University]] in his full [[academic regalia]]. Note that the color of the hood, salmon pink, is the academic color of [[Public Health]], which differs from the PhD (blue) ]]
The '''Doctor of Public Health''' (abbr. '''DrPH''' or '''DPH'''; [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Publica Sanitas Doctor}}'') is a [[doctoral degree]] awarded in the field of [[Public Health]]. DrPH is the highest, and terminal, professional degree in the field of public health. It prepares its recipients for a leadership career in advanced public health practice and administration. Some of the DrPH holders also pursue academia including teaching and research. DrPH holders often occupy executive leadership roles in private and public sectors along with, non-profit and international health entities such as the WHO. 

== Comparison with Ph.D.==
A DrPH is a leadership-centered, interdisciplinary degree that equips its holders with the skill set necessary for public health practice as opposed to a Ph.D. which is purely a research-based degree only focusing on one topic within a certain field. The DrPH degree is categorized as a terminal professional degree on a par with, a Ph.D., doctor of education, doctor of social work, doctor of medicine, doctor of business administration, and doctor of psychology degrees. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|pmc=2602921 |title=A REVIEW OF THE STATUS OF THE DOCTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEGREE AND IDENTIFICATION OF FUTURE ISSUES |publisher=Public Health Rep. |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission Requirements Difference===
Admission into a DrPH program usually requires a master of public health degree as a prerequisite. Furthermore, a DrPH requires several years of public health leadership and practice experience (generally, 5 years or more) for an admission. In contrast, one may enter a Ph.D. or ScD program after completing a bachelor (undergrad) degree with no experience or advanced academic training.

===Career Outcomes Training Difference===
'''DrPH:''' Leadership and public health practice, applied research, and academia to a lesser extent.
'''Ph.D.:''' Research and academia.

== Typical Program Structure==
===Advanced Integrative Coursework===
A typical accredited DrPH program requires roughly a two-year long intensive multidisciplinary coursework in advanced research methodology - similar to a Ph.D. Additionally, as a distinction and addition to a Ph.D., DrPH students also take advanced courses to gain analytical skills in leadership, management, systems thinking, communications, and health policy.

===Public Health Residency (Public Health Leadership Practice Experience)===
DrPH students are also required to complete a public health practice experience as a critical part of their DrPH program. Students apply the skills learned in public health practice to gain leadership experience and hone their skills through hands-on experience.

===Exams: Comprehensive and Qualifying Exams===
Most universities require a rigorous comprehensive exam at the end of first two-years of coursework and public health residency before a candidate may be advanced to the dissertation phase. Some DrPH programs, such as the Tufts University, require a Qualifying Exam - taken at the end of the first year -, along with the comprehensive exam, taken at the end of the second year.  

===Dissertation===
DrPH students are required to complete and defend an applied public health practice-related dissertation during their candidacy phase, usually after the comprehensive exams, in order to complete the program. 

===DrPH Completion Time===
The average time to complete a DrPH is roughly 4-7 years.

==Impact on disease==

===Impact on vascular disease===
[[File:Erythromelalgia.jpg|[[Erythromelalgia]] in a 77-year-old woman |thumb]]
A good example of the impact of global warming on health can be seen in the disease [[erythromelalgia]].&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=T |last2=Zhang |first2=Y |last3=Lin |first3=H |last4=Lv |first4=X |last5=Xiao |first5=J |last6=Zeng |first6=W |last7=Gu |first7=Y |last8=Rutherford |first8=S |last9=Tong |first9=S|last10=Ma|first10=W |display-authors=3 |title=A large temperature fluctuation may trigger an epidemic erythromelalgia outbreak in China |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |date=30 March 2015 |volume=5 |id=Article Number 9525 |pmid=25820221 |doi=10.1038/srep09525 |pmc=4377627 |pages=9525}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a vascular disease that is commonly triggered by the involvement of change in temperature, which leads to syndromes including (first and second degree) burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling, of mainly the hands and feet that are affected.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;

In a Chinese study, epidemic Erythromelalgia appears quite common in southern China, most likely due to a sharp decline in temperature following by a rapid increase of temperature and the effects this has on the body.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;  The acral small superficial arteries intensely constrict and dilate during the sharp decline of temperature, whereas a sharp increase of temperature, the intense expansion of [[capillaries]] irritate the nerve endings around, and thus lead to symptoms including burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;
As climate change proceeds, more Erythromelalgia outbreaks may occur because of the extreme weather events that are projected to increase in coming decades.&lt;ref name="Lui - 2015" /&gt;

===Impact on infectious diseases===
Warming oceans and a changing climate are resulting in extreme weather patterns which have brought about an increase of [[infectious diseases]]—both new and re-emerging.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA29 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |chapter=The Mosquito's Bite |pp=29–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emerging Infections" /&gt;  These extreme weather patterns are creating extended [[rainy seasons]] in some areas,&lt;ref name="Sobering Predictions"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA62 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |chapter=Sobering Predictions |pp=62–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended periods of [[drought]] in others,&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meehl |first1=Gerald A. |first2=Thomas F. |last2=Stocker |first3=W.D. |last3=Collins |first4=P. |last4=Friedlingstein |first5=A.T. |last5=Gaye |first6=J.M. |last6=Gregory |first7=A. |last7=Kitoh |first8=R. |last8=Knutti |first9=J.M. |last9=Murphy |first10=A. |last10=Noda |first11=S.C.B. |last11=Raper |first12=I.G. |last12=Watterson |first13=A.J. |last13=Weaver |first14=Z.-C. |last14=Zhao |display-authors=3 |chapter=Global Climate Projections |editor-last1=Solomon |editor-first1=S. |editor-first2=D. |editor-last2=Qin |editor-first3=M. |editor-last3=Manning |editor-first4=Z. |editor-last4=Chen |editor-first5=M. |editor-last5=Marquis |editor-first6=K.B. |editor-last6=Averyt |editor-first7=M. |editor-last7=Tignor |editor-first8=H.L. |editor-last8=Miller |display-editors=3 |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

==== Impact of warmer and wetter climates ====

Mosquito-borne diseases are probably the greatest threat to humans as they include [[malaria]], [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[dengue fever]].&lt;ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reiter |first=Paul |title=Climate Change and Mosquito-Borne Disease |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |year=2001 |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=141–161 |url=http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.01109s1141 |pmid=11250812 |pmc=1240549 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824222504/http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elephantiasis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=P.R. |title=Climate change and waterborne and vector-borne disease |journal=[[Journal of Applied Microbiology]] |year=2003 |volume=94 |pages=37S–46S |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.94.s1.5.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt; Studies are showing higher prevalence of these diseases in areas that have experienced extreme flooding and drought.&lt;ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease" /&gt;&lt;ref name=elephantiasis /&gt;   Flooding creates more standing water for mosquitoes to breed; as well,  shown that these vectors are able to feed more and grow faster in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; As the climate warms over the oceans and coastal regions, warmer temperatures are also creeping up to higher elevations allowing mosquitoes to survive in areas they had never been able to before.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; As the climate continues to warm there is a risk that malaria will make a return to the developed world.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;

[[Ticks]] are also thriving in the warmer temperatures allowing them to feed and grow at a faster rate.&lt;ref name=Ticks&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Süss |first1=J. |last2=Klaus |first2=C. |last3=Gerstengarbe |first3=F.W. |last4=Werner |first4=P.C. |title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

Another impact that the warming global temperature has had is on the frequency and severity of heat waves. In addition to dehydration and heat stroke, these heat waves have also resulted in epidemics of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Recent studies have shown that prolonged heat exposure, physical exertion, and dehydration are sufficient factors to developing CKD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Climate Change and the Emergent Epidemic of CKD from Heat Stress in Rural Communities: the Case for Heat Stress Nephropathy|last=Glaser et al | pmid=27151892 | doi=10.2215/CJN.13841215|volume=11|issue=8 |pmc=4974898|year=2016|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|pages=1472–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cases are occurring across the world congruently with heat stress nephropathy.

Projected increases in temperature would make parts of southwest Asia uninhabitable, when temperature combined with high humidity reaches a [[wet-bulb temperature]] of 35&amp;nbsp;°C, the threshold for a fit human to survive in well-ventilated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2833.html |title=Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability |journal=Nature |year=2015 |first1=Jeremy S. |last1=Pal |first2=Elfatih A.

==== Impact of warmer oceans ====

The warming oceans are becoming a breeding ground for toxic algae blooms (also known as [[red tides]]) and [[cholera]].&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change &amp; health" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt; As the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the oceans increase, the cholera bacteria that lives within [[zooplankton]] emerge from their dormant state.&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt;  The changing winds and changing ocean currents push the zooplankton toward the coastline, carrying the cholera bacteria, which then contaminate drinking water, causing [[cholera outbreaks]].&lt;ref name=Mozambique&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=6–28 |chapter=Mozambique}}&lt;/ref&gt; As flooding increases there is also an increase in cholera epidemics as the flood waters that are carrying the bacteria are infiltrating the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="Global Health"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=St. Louis |first1=Michael E. |last2=Hess |first2=Jeremy J. |title=Climate Change Impacts on and Implications for Global Health |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=527–538 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.023|pmid=18929979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   El Nino has also been linked with cholera outbreaks because this weather pattern warms the shoreline waters, causing the cholera bacteria to multiply rapidly.&lt;ref name=Mozambique /&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Health" /&gt;

====Malaria====

[[Malaria]] is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that infects humans and other animals caused by microorganisms in the [[Plasmodium]] family. It begins with a bite from an infected female mosquito, which introduces the parasite through its saliva and into the infected host's circulatory system. It then travels through the bloodstream into the liver where it can mature and reproduce.&lt;ref name=Lancet&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Brian M. |last1=Greenwood |first2=Kalifa |last2=Bojang |first3=Christopher J.M. |last3=Whitty |first4=Geoffrey A.T. |last4=Targett |title=Malaria |journal=The Lancet |date=23 April 2005 |volume=365 |pages=1487–1498 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66420-3 |pmid=15850634 |issue=9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease causes symptoms that typically include fever, headache, shaking chills, anemia, and in severe cases can progress to coma or death.

'About 3.2 billion people – nearly half of the world's population – are at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were roughly 214 million malaria cases and an estimated 438,000 malaria deaths.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/|title=10 facts on malaria|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is an influential driving force of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Malaria is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change because mosquitoes lack the mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature. This implies that there is a limited range of climatic conditions within which the pathogen (malaria) and vector (a mosquito) can survive, reproduce and infect hosts.&lt;ref name=infectious/&gt; Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, have distinctive characteristics that determine [[pathogenicity]]. These include the survival and reproduction rate of the vector, the level of vector activity (i.e. the biting or feeding rate), and the development and reproduction rate of the pathogen within the vector or host.&lt;ref name=infectious&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=S. |last1=Mia |first2=Rawshan A. |last2=Begum |first3=Ah-Choy |last3=Er |first4=Raja D.Z.R. Zainal |last4=Abidin |first5=Joy J. |last5=Pereira |title=Malaria and Climate Change: Discussion on Economic Impacts |journal=[[American Journal of Environmental Sciences]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=65–74 |doi=10.3844/ajessp.2011.73.82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in climate factors substantially affect reproduction, development, distribution and seasonal transmissions of malaria.

Mosquitoes have a small window for preferential conditions for breeding and maturation. The ultimate breeding and maturing temperature for mosquitoes range from sixteen to eighteen degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name= commonwealth&gt;{{cite report |last=Githeko |first=Andrew K. |title=Malaria and climate change |work=Commonwealth Health Ministers’ Update 2009/2010 |url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/44031/1/130440.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the temperature is decreased by two degrees, most of the insects will succumb to death. This is why malaria is unsustainable in places with cool winters. If a climate with an average of approximately 16 degrees Celsius experiences an increase of about two degrees, the mature bugs and the larvae flourish.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Female mosquitoes will need more food (human/animal blood) to sustain life and to stimulate production of eggs. This increases the chance of spread of malaria due to more human contact and a higher number of the blood sucking insects surviving and living longer. Mosquitoes are also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and humidity. Increased precipitation can increase mosquito population indirectly by expanding larval habitat and food supply.&lt;ref name=infectious2&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Helen |last1=Pates |first2=Christopher |last2=Curtis |title=Mosquito Behaviour and Vector Control |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |year=2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130439 |pmid=15355233}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prime temperatures are creating large breeding grounds for the insects and places for the larvae to mature. Increased temperature is causing snow to melt and stagnant pools of water to become more common.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Bugs that are already carrying the disease are more likely to multiply and infect other mosquitoes causing a dangerous spread of the deadly disease.

Climate change has a direct impact on people's health in places where Malaria is not prevalent. In communities of higher altitudes in [[Africa]] and [[South America]], people are at higher risk for developing malaria in recent years because of an increase temperature. Mosquitos are sensitive to temperature changes and the warming of their environment will boost their rates of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Paul R|date=2005|title=Climate Change and Human Health|url=|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 353| issue =  14|pages=1433–1436|via=|doi=10.1056/nejmp058079|pmid=16207843|pmc=2636266}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fluctuation of two or three degrees is creating exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, for larvae to grow and mature mosquitoes carrying the virus to infect people that have never been exposed before.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; This is a severe problem because people in these communities have never been exposed to this disease causing an increased risk for complications from malaria such as cerebral malaria (a type of malaria that causes mental disability, paralysis and has a high mortality rate) and death by the disease.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; Residents of these communities are being hit hard by malaria because they are unfamiliar with it; they do not know the signs and symptoms and have little to no immunity.

The population at risk of malaria in the absence of climate change is projected to double between 1990 and 2080 to 8820 million, however; unmitigated climate change would, by the 2080s, further increase the population at risk of malaria by another 257 to 323 million.&lt;ref name=Goklany&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Indur M. |last1=Goklany |first2=Sir David A. |last2=King |title=Climate Change and Malaria |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2004 |volume=306 |issue=5693 |pages=55–57 |doi=10.1126/science.306.5693.55|pmid=15459370 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231205 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change in the present would reduce the total by about 3.5%, saving tens of thousands of lives worldwide.

If there is a slight discrepancy in the normal temperature, the perfect conditions for the insects to multiply are created. People that have never been infected before are unknowingly at risk for this deadly disease and do not have the immunity to combat it.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt; An increase in temperature has the potential to cause a widespread [[epidemic]] of the disease that has the capacity to wipe out entire populations of people. It is important to track the prevalence, species and number of insects carrying the disease as well as the number of humans infected in countries and places that have never seen malaria before. It is simple for the slightest of fluctuation in temperature to cause a catastrophic epidemic that has the possibility to end the lives of many innocent and unsuspecting people.&lt;ref name= commonwealth/&gt;

====Dengue fever====

[[Dengue fever]] is an infectious disease caused by [[dengue virus]]es known to be in the tropical regions.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dengue and Severe Dengue, Fact Sheet |work=Media Centre |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is transmitted by the mosquito [[Aedes]], or A. aegypti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simmon |first=Cameron |last2=Farrar |first2=Jeremy J. |last3=Chau |first3=Nguyen van Vinh |last4=Wills |first4=Bridget |title=Dengue |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=12 April 2012 |volume=366 |issue=15 |pages=1423–1432 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1110265 |pmid=22494122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases of dengue fever have increased dramatically since the 1970s and it continues to become more prevalent.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue" /&gt; The greater incidence of this disease is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gubler |first=DJ |title=Human and Medical Virology: Dengue Viruses |editor-last1=Mahy |editor-first1=Brian W.J. |editor-last2=van Regenmortel |editor-first2=Marc H.V. |work=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsh48WKIbhQC&amp;pg=PA372 |year=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-378559-6 |pages=372–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of [[dengue hemorrhagic fever]]. There are four different types of viruses in dengue fever. If someone is infected with one type of dengue virus, he or she will have permanent immunity to that type of dengue virus, but will have short term immunity to the other type of dengue fever.&lt;ref name="Dengue and Sever Dengue" /&gt; Some of the symptoms of dengue fever are fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and skin rash.&lt;ref name=denguefever&gt;{{cite web |title=Dengue Fever |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002350/ |publisher=National Institutes of Health |access-date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no vaccine for dengue fever right now and there is no true treatment to get rid of it, but there are treatments to assist with some of the work of dengue, such as the use of oral or intravenous fluids for rehydration.&lt;ref name=denguefever/&gt;

Dengue fever used to be considered a [[tropical disease]], but [[climate change]] is causing dengue fever to spread. Dengue fever is transmitted by certain types of [[mosquitoes]], which have been spreading further and further north. This is because some of the climate changes that are occurring are increased heat, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] which create prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA69 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotter and wetter a climate is, the faster the mosquitoes can mature and the faster the disease can develop. Another influence is the changing [[El Nino]] effects that are affecting the climate to change in different areas of the world, causing dengue fever to be able to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hopp |first=Marianne J. |last2=Foley |first2=Jonathan A. |title=Global-Scale Relationships Between Climate and the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes Aegypti |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |date=February 2001 |volume=48 |issue=2/3 |pages=441–463 |doi=10.1023/a:1010717502442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many things that can be done, both on a governmental level and on an individual basis. One improvement would be having a better system of detecting when dengue outbreaks may happen. This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive to these types of mosquitoes and help them to flourish. Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitoes (no standing water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves), and wear insect repellent.

==== Tick Borne Disease ====
A high humidity of greater than 85% is the best condition for a tick to start and finish its life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Süss|first=Jochen|last2=Klaus|first2=Christine|last3=Gerstengarbe|first3=Friedrich‐Wilhelm|last4=Werner|first4=Peter C.|date=2008-01-01|title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

More specifically, maximum temperature has been found to play the most influential variable in sustaining tick populations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Brownstein|last2=Holford|first2=Theodore|last3=Fish|first3=Durland|date=February 12, 2003|title=A Climate-Based Model Predicts the Spatial Distribution of the Lyme Disease Vector Ixodes scapularis in the United States|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241567/pdf/ehp0111-001152.pdf|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=11|pages=1152-1157|via=NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher temperatures augment both hatching and developmental rates while hindering overall survival. Temperature is so important to overall survival that an average monthly minimum temperature of below -7°C in the winter can prevent an area from maintaining established populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The effect of climate on the tick life cycle is one of the more difficult projections to make in relation to climate and vector-borne disease. Unlike other vectors, tick life cycles span multiple seasons as they mature from larva to nymph to adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health2016.globalchange.gov/climate-and-health-assessment/vectorborne-diseases/boxes/life-cycle-blacklegged-ticks-ixodes|title=Life Cycle of Blacklegged Ticks, Ixodes scapularis {{!}} Climate and Health Assessment|last=USGCRP|website=health2016.globalchange.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, infection and spread of diseases such as Lyme disease happens across the multiple stages adding additional variables to consider. Infection of ticks happen in the larval/nymph stage (after the first blood meal) when they are exposed to borrelia burgdorferi (the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease), but transmission to humans doesn’t occur until the adult stages. 

The expansion of tick populations are concurrent with global climatic change. Species distribution models of recent years indicate that the deer tick, known as ''I. scapularis,'' is pushing its distribution to higher latitudes of the Northeastern United States and Canada, as well as pushing and maintaining populations in the South Central and Northern Midwest regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esteve-Gassent|first=Maria D.|last2=Castro-Arellano|first2=Ivan|last3=Feria-Arroyo|first3=Teresa P.|last4=Patino|first4=Ramiro|last5=Li|first5=Andrew Y.|last6=Medina|first6=Raul F.|last7=Pérez de León|first7=Adalberto A.|last8=Rodríguez-Vivas|first8=Roger Iván|date=May 2016|title=Translating ecology, physiology, biochemistry and population genetics research to meet the challenge of tick and tick-borne diseases in North America|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844827/|journal=Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=38–64|doi=10.1002/arch.21327|issn=0739-4462|pmc=4844827|pmid=27062414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate models project further expansion of tick habit north into Canada as progressing Northwest from the Northeastern United States. Additionally, however, tick populations are expected to retreat from the Southeastern coast of the U.S., but this has not yet been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=U0E1CAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=luber+lemry+climate+health&amp;ots=LYkXOXqGsM&amp;sig=HkcVlGJ-LX7ew2gGK9AMfmNK1xY#v=onepage&amp;q=luber%20lemry%20climate%20health&amp;f=false|title=Global Climate Change and Human Health: From Science to Practice|last=Luber|first=George|last2=Lemery|first2=Jay|date=2015-11-02|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118505571|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's estimated that coinciding with this expansion, increased average temperatures may double tick populations by 2020 as well as bring an earlier start to the tick exposure season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-07-01|title=Climate change influences on the annual onset of Lyme disease in the United States|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877959X15000874|journal=Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases|language=en|volume=6|issue=5|pages=615–622|doi=10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.05.005|issn=1877-959X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esteve-Gassent|first=Maria D.|last2=Castro-Arellano|first2=Ivan|last3=Feria-Arroyo|first3=Teresa P.|last4=Patino|first4=Ramiro|last5=Li|first5=Andrew Y.|last6=Medina|first6=Raul F.|last7=Pérez de León|first7=Adalberto A.|last8=Rodríguez-Vivas|first8=Roger Iván|date=May 2016|title=Translating ecology, physiology, biochemistry and population genetics research to meet the challenge of tick and tick-borne diseases in North America|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844827/|journal=Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=38–64|doi=10.1002/arch.21327|issn=0739-4462|pmc=4844827|pmid=27062414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tick populations are not only spreading wider, but moving to higher elevations. In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain wood tick known as ''D. andersoni'' is found along the front range and is want to feed, and consequently infect, human populations with tularemia (''Francisella tularensis''), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (''Rickettsia rickettsii''), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus). A case study testing climatic interaction affecting tick vector (''D. andersoni'') populations in Larimer County, Colorado indicated that an estimated increase of 1.2–2.0 °C in summer temperatures would increase tick populations moving 100m upwards in elevation, increasing the range and susceptibility of tick-borne illnesses along the front range.

Initial symptoms of tick-borne infections are generally quite similar to that of other viral illnesses. This includes fever, headache, fatigue, and general malaise. This group of diseases can further be difficult to distinguish early on in the disease process due to these general symptoms in addition to most people (reported around 75%) not realizing they have been bitten or exposed to the tick vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadelman|first=Robert B.|last2=Nowakowski|first2=John|last3=Forseter|first3=Gilda|last4=Goldberg|first4=Neil S.|last5=Bittker|first5=Susan|last6=Cooper|first6=Denise|last7=Aguero-Rosenfeld|first7=Maria|last8=Wormser|first8=Gary P.|date=May 1996|title=The clinical spectrum of early lyme borreliosis in patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans|url=https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(95)99915-9/pdf|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|language=English|volume=100|issue=5|pages=502–508|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(95)99915-9|issn=0002-9343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to early Lyme disease is the development of the classic erythema migrans skin rash, also known as the “bull’s eye” or “target” rash, which occurs in about 80% of people diagnosed with Lyme disease.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steere|first=Allen C.|last2=Sikand|first2=Vijay K.|date=2003-06-12|title=The Presenting Manifestations of Lyme Disease and the Outcomes of Treatment|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM200306123482423?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=348|issue=24|pages=2472–2474|doi=10.1056/nejm200306123482423|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symptom can be an important distinguishing factor helping to make the diagnosis early. If Lyme disease is unrecognized, misdiagnosed, or improperly treated it can lead to much more severe and serious consequences with the spread of the spirochete to joints, heart, and nervous system causing arthritis, carditis, cranial nerve palsies or encephalopathy and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Regardless of the specific diagnosis (Lyme, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Colorado Tick Fever, Babesiosis etc.) the key to management and prevention of sequelae is early identification of disease and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. With regard to the effects of a warming world and the expansion of tick populations to previously unexposed areas, adaptive keys to prevention will include expansion of health care infrastructure and pharmacologic availability, as well as education of people and providers as to the risks of disease and preventative measures they can take.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap15_FINAL.pdf|title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts,Adaptation, and Vulnerability|last=Mimura|first=Nobuo|last2=Pulwarty|first2=Roger|last3=Duc|first3=Do Minh|last4=Elshinnawy|first4=Ibrahim|last5=Redsteer|first5=Margaret|last6=Huang|first6=He-Qing|last7=Nkem|first7=Johnson|last8=Sanchez Rodriguez|first8=Roberto|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA|pages=869-898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of these expanding threats, strong collaboration between government officials and environmental scientists is necessary for advancing preventative and reactive response measures. Without acknowledging the climate changes that make environments more habitable for disease carriers, policy and infrastructure will lag behind vector borne disease spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/08/06/21999/disease-bearing-ticks-head-north-weak-government-response-threatens-public-health|title=As disease-bearing ticks head north, weak government response threatens public health|work=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human cost associated with denying climate change science is one that concerns many governments. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting a grant program called Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) which details a 5 step process for combating climate effects like tick borne disease spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/BRACE.htm|title=CDC - Climate and Health - CDC's Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) Framework|last=Health|first=National Center for Environmental|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case when responding to other vectors and effects of climate change, vulnerable populations including children and the elderly will need to be prioritized by any intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrcm.org/maine-environmental-news/tick-threat-explodes-states-reluctance-address-climate-link-threaten-public-health/|title=State's Reluctance to Address Climate and Tick Link May Threaten Public Health|date=2018-08-12|work=Natural Resources Council of Maine|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Productive policies in the U.S. and the world need to accurately model changes in vector populations as well as the burden of disease, educate the public on ways to mitigate infection, and prepare health systems for the increasing disease load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angela|first=Cheng|last2=Chen|first2=Dongmei|last3=Woodstock|first3=Katherine|last4=Ogden|first4=Nicholas|last5=Wu|first5=Xiaotian|last6=Wu|first6=Jianhong|date=June 2017|title=Analyzing the Potential Risk of Climate Change on Lyme Disease in Eastern Ontario, Canada Using Time Series Remotely Sensed Temperature Data and Tick Population Modelling|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/6/609/pdf|journal=Remote Sensing|volume=609|pages=|doi=10.3390/rs9060609|via=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on mental health{{anchor|Mental_health}}===
While the physical health impacts of [[climate change]] are well known, the impact on [[mental health]] has only begun to be recognized in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chand |first1=Prabhat Kumar |last2=Murthy |first2=Pratima |title=Climate change and mental health |journal=Regional Health Forum |year=2008 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pp=43–48 |url=http://www.uncclearn.org/sites/default/files/inventory/who44.pdf#page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2011 in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Clayton &amp; Doherty, concluded that global climate change is bound to have substantial negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing, effects which will primarily be felt by vulnerable [[populations]] and those with pre-existing serious [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name=clayton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doherty |first1=Susan |last2=Clayton |first2=Thomas J |title=The psychological impacts of global climate change |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |year=2011 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1037/a0023141 |pmid=21553952 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/66/4/265/|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research done by Berry, Bowen, and Kjellstrom in 2008 found that climate change exposes populations to [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], which negatively impacts mental health in very serious ways.&lt;ref name=berry&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=Helen|last2=Kathryn|first2=Bowen|last3=Kjellstrom|first3=Tord|title=Climate change and mental health: a causal pathways framework|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=55|issue=2|pages=123–132|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00038-009-0112-0.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-0112-0|pmid=20033251|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the Clayton study and the Berry study identify three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change: direct, indirect, and psychosocial.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; The Clayton study claims that in order to appreciate these impacts on psychological wellbeing, a basic understanding of certain aspects is required. One must recognize the multiple meanings and cultural narratives associated with climate change, as well as how climate change, global phenomena like increased population, are interrelated. Climate change does not impact everyone equally; those of lower [[economic]] and social status are at greater risk and experience more devastating impacts.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; A 2018 study of CDC data connected temperature rise to increased numbers of suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/817731002|publisher=USA Today|year=2018|title=Global warming risk: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study revealed that hotter days could increase suicide rates and could cause approximately 26,000 more suicides in the U.S. by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/high-temperatures-cause-suicide-rates-to-increase/565826/|title=Climate Change May Cause 26,000 More U.S. Suicides by 2050|website=The Atlantic|date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct impacts====
Direct impacts on mental health happen when a [[community]] experiences [[extreme weather]] and changed [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; 
Direct impacts like landscape changes, impaired [[place attachment]], and [[psychological trauma]] are all immediate and localized problems resulting from extreme weather events and environmental changes.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Extreme weather events cause negative changes to landscape and [[agriculture]]. This leads to communities facing economic aspects, especially for communities that use agriculture as a main source of income. After economic fall, communities face loss of livelihoods and [[poverty]]. Many communities will also face isolation, alienation, [[grief]], bereavement, and displacement from these effects.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;&lt;ref name=portier&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health and Stress-Related Disorders |url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |work=National Institute of Environment Health Services |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |date=1 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421191355/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals will have an increased rate of [[anxiety]] and emotional stress. The rate of effects on mental health increases in already-vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Clayton reinforces that the more powerful the extreme weather event, and the more frequent these weather events are, the more damage is done to the mental health of the community.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;
Some of the extreme weather events responsible for these mental health changes include wildfires,&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods,&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; and extreme heat.&lt;ref name=worldhealth&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Health Organization|title=Climate change and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indirect impacts====
Indirect impacts on mental health occur via impacts on physical health and community wellbeing. Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainly about future risks.&lt;ref name="clayton"/&gt; They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event effects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;
[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.&lt;ref name=worldhealth/&gt; Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;

As extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions. Many suffering from loss of family and friends will internalize their emotions, feel extreme guilt and helplessness, and become paranoid. Others will develop fear of future loss and have an overall displacement of feelings that could last for years.&lt;ref name=bowlby&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lorna|first1=Bowlby-West|title=The impact of death on the family system|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|volume=5|issue=3|pages=279–294|doi=10.1046/j..1983.00623.x|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson published research in the American Psychological Association that shows the increase in murders in the United States directly correlates with the temperature increase. For every one-degree [[Fahrenheit]], there will be nine more murders in the country, which leads to an additional 24,000 murders or assaults per year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2000-2004/01A.pdf|title=Heat and Violence|last=Anderson|first=C|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2001|isbn=|location=Iowa|pages=33–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increased risk in [[suicide]] in communities that suffer from extreme weather events. Studies show that suicide rates increase after extreme weather events. This is evidence for the decline in mental health.&lt;ref name=epstein&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased suicide risk has been demonstrated in [[Australia]], where [[drought]] has resulted in [[crop]] failures and despair to the Australian countryside. After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt;

Some impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;

The effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt;

====Psychological impacts====
Psychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.&lt;ref name=portier/&gt; Agriculture and aquaculture are severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of kids from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt; The loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt; Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government. A loss in trust can be the beginning of oncoming mental health problems.&lt;ref name=bowlby/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Abbott |first=Chris |title=An Uncertain Future: Law Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change |publisher=Oxford Research Group |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/uncertainfuture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disruption of a community when they are forced to relocate results in the deterioration of geographic and social connections. This leads to grief, anxiety, and an overall sense of loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Donald R. |last2=West |first2=Colin Thor |last3=Finan |first3=Timothy J. |title=Introduction to "In focus: Global change and adaptation in local places." |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |date=September 2009 |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=271–274 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01131.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change and permafrost==
[[Permafrost]] is an important part of our environment and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of many ecosystems around the world.  
===Soil sustainability===
Permafrost is integral to soil stability in arctic regions.&lt;ref name="Task Force"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinkel |first=Kenneth M |first2=Frederick E. |last2=Nelson |first3=Walter |last3=Parker |first4=Vladimir |last4=Romanovsky |first5=Orson |last5=Smith |first6=Walter |last6=Tucker |first7=Ted |last7=Vinson |first8=Lawson W. |last8=Brigham |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change, Permafrost, and Impacts on Civil Infrastructure |journal=U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force |year=2003 |pages=1–61 |url=http://www.arctic.gov/publications/other/permafrost.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112164129/http://www.arctic.gov/publications/other/permafrost.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting permafrost causes the surrounding soil to become unstable and settle.&lt;ref name="Task Force" /&gt; Settlement of surface soil associated with melting permafrost leads to significant infrastructure instability and damage to roads, bridges, buildings, homes, pipelines and airstrips in affected areas.&lt;ref name="Task Force" /&gt;

==Impact on natural resources==

===Drinking water===
In rural Africa and the Middle East, when droughts dry up the regular water supply, rural and impoverished families are forced to resort to drinking the dirty, sediment-and-parasite-laden water that sits in puddles and small pools on the surface of the earth. Many are aware of the presence of contamination, but will drink from these sources nonetheless in order to avoid dying of dehydration. It has been estimated that up to 80% of human illness in the world can be attributed to contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalwater.org/background.htm |title=Water Shortage, Drinking Water Crisis Solutions |work=globalwater.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124043427/http://globalwater.org/background.htm |archivedate=2012-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is an adequate amount of drinking water, humans drink from different sources than their livestock. However, when drought occurs and drinking water slowly disappears, catchment areas such as streams and depressions in the ground where water gathers are often shared between people and the livestock they depend on for financial and nutritional support, and this is when humans can fall seriously ill. Although some diseases that are transferred to humans can be prevented by boiling the water, many people, living on just a litre or two of water per day, refuse to boil, as it loses a certain percentage of the water to steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reports: Drought-Stricken Somalis Dying From Contaminated Water |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=31 October 2009 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2006-03-22-voa28/324586.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sharing of water between livestock and humans is one of the most common factors in the transmission of non-tuberulosis mycobacteria (NTM). NTM is carried in cattle and pig feces, and if this contaminates the drinking water supply, it can result in pulmonary disease, disseminated disease or localized lesions in humans with both compromised and competent immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clovice |last1=Kankya |first2=Adrian |last2=Muwonge |first3=Berit |last3=Djønne |first4=Musso |last4=Munyeme |first5=John |last5=Opuda-Asibo |first6=Eystein |last6=Skjerve |first7=James |last7=Oloya |first8=Vigdis |last8=Edvardsen |first9=Tone B |last9=Johansen |display-authors=3 |title=Isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria from pastoral ecosystems of Uganda: Public Health significance |journal=BMC Public Health |date=16 May 2011 |volume=11 |issue=320 |pp=1–9 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-320 |pmid=21575226 |pmc=3123205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During drought, water supplies are even more susceptible to harmful algal blooms and microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/health/climate/drought.asp |title=NRDC: Climate Change Threatens Health: Drought |work=nrdc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Algal blooms increase water turbidity, suffocating aquatic plants, and can deplete oxygen, killing fish. Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the “wet season” in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water. As drought begins and these bodies gradually dry up, the nutrients are concentrated, providing the perfect opportunity for algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hans W. |last1=Paerl |first2=Jef |last2=Huisman |title=Blooms Like It Hot |journal=Science |date=4 April 2008 |volume=320 |issue=5872 |pages=57–58 |doi=10.1126/science.1155398 |pmid=18388279 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5872/57|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.6826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) Blooms |work=California Department of Public Health |date=18 September 2013 |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/environhealth/water/pages/bluegreenalgae.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Faces Era Of Water Scarcity |work=WaterNews |publisher=Circle of Blue |date=9 July 2008 |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2008/world/us-faces-era-of-water-scarcity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fresh water===
As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. [[Freshwater]] resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability.  In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on livestock==
Climate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.

===Greenhouse gas effects===
Our agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strategies&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016–2025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%. More specifically, emissions from farms, such as [[nitrous oxide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]], are the main culprits, and can be held accountable for up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of all emissions just within agriculture.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

The types of farm animals, as well as the food they supply can be put into two categories: [[monogastric]] and [[ruminant]]. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions. This is due to the fact that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

As lower-income countries begin, and continue, to develop, the necessity for a consistent meat supply will increase.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=P.K. |last1=Thornton |first2=J. |last2=van de Steeg |first3=A. |last3=Notenbaert |first4=M. |last4=Herrero |title=The impacts of climate change on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries: A review of what we know and what we need to know |journal=Agricultural Systems |year=2009 |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2009.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the cattle population will be required to grow in order to keep up with the demand, producing the highest possible rate of greenhouse-gas emissions.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

There are many strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse-gas emissions. Some of these strategies include a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals' eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in both the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kurukulasuriya |first2=Shane |last2=Rosenthal |title=Climate Change and Agriculture: A Review of Impacts and Adaptions |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~c-ciarn/documents/World_Bank_Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite report |first1=A.J. |last1=McMichael |first2=D.H. |last2=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=C.F. |last3=Corvalán |first4=K.L. |last4=Ebi |first5=A.K. |last5=Githeko |first6=J.D. |last6=Scheraga |first7=A. |last7=Woodward |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2003 |isbn=92 4 156248 X |url=http://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/climchange.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat stress===
[[Heat stress]] on livestock has a devastating effect on not only their growth and reproduction, but their food intake and production of dairy and meat. Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&amp;nbsp;°C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.

==Impact on plant based food==
[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops—from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels—all of which directly affect [[human health]]. Part of this variability in possible outcomes is from the various [[climate change model]]s used to project potential impacts; each model takes into account different factors and so come out with a slightly different result.&lt;ref name=Hertel&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hertel |first=Thomas W. |last2=Rosch |first2=Stephanie D. |title=Climate Change, Agriculture, and Poverty |journal=[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]] |date=June 2010 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=355–385 |doi=10.1093/aepp/ppq016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second problem comes from the fact that projections are made based on historical data which is not necessarily helpful in accurate forecasting as changes are occurring exponentially.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kul&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kulshreshtha |first=Surendra N. |title=Climate Change, Prairie Agriculture and Prairie Economy: The new normal |journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=March 2011 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=19–44 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.2010.01211.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there are many different possible impacts—both positive and negative—that may result from climate change affecting global regions in different ways.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite report |editor-first1=Donald S. |editor-last1=Lemmen |editor-first2=Fiona J. |editor-last2=Warren |title=Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2004 |isbn= 0-662-33123-0 |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/27428.pdf}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food scarcity===
Food scarcity is a major key for many populations and is one of the prominent concerns with the changing climate. Currently, 1/6 of the [[global population]] are without adequate food supply.&lt;ref name=Beddington&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beddington |first=John R. |last2=Asaduzzaman |first2=Mohammed |last3=Clark |first3=Megan E. |last4=Bremauntz |first4=Adrian Fernández |last5=Guillou |first5=Marion D |last6=Jahn |first6=Molly M. |last7=Lin |first7=Erda |last8=Mamo |first8=Tekalign |last9=Negra |first9=Christine |last10=Nobre |first10=Carlos A. |last11=Scholes |first11=Robert J. |last12=Sharma |first12=Rita |last13=Van Bo |first13=Nguyen |last14=Wakhungu |first14=Judi |display-authors=3 |title=The role for scientists in tackling food insecurity and climate change |journal=Agriculture &amp; Food Security |year=2012 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=10 |doi=10.1186/2048-7010-1-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, the global population is projected to reach 9 billion requiring global food productions to increase by 50% to meet population demand.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chakraborty |first=S. |last2=Newton |first2=A. C. |title=Climate change, plant diseases and food security: an overview |journal=Plant Pathology |date=10 January 2011 |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=2–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02411.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, food scarcity is a growing concern that, according to many researchers, is projected to worsen with climate change because of a number of factors including [[extreme weather]] events and an increase in [[pest (organism)|pests]] and [[pathogens]].

===Extreme weather===

====Rising temperatures====
As the [[temperature]] changes and weather patterns become more extreme, areas which were historically good for farmland will no longer be as amicable.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connor |first=Jeffery D. |last2=Schwabe |first2=Kurt |last3=King |first3=Darran |last4=Knapp |first4=Keith |title=Irrigated agriculture and climate change: The influence of water supply variability and salinity on adaptation |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=May 2012 |volume=77 |pages=149–157 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sindhu |first=J.S. |title=Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture |journal=Indian Journal of Science and Technology |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=348–353 |issn=0974-6846 |url=http://www.indjst.org/index.php/indjst/article/view/29998/25953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current prediction is for temperature increase and precipitation decrease for major [[arid]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions ([[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Southwest United States]], and [[Southern Europe]]).&lt;ref name=Connor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tubiello&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tubiello |first=Francesco N. |last2=Rosenzweig |first2=Cynthia |title=Developing climate change impact metrics for agriculture |journal=The Integrated Assessment Journal |year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pp=165–184 |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/int_assess/index.php/iaj/article/viewFile/276/240}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, crop yields in [[tropical regions]] will be negatively affected by the projected moderate increase in temperature (1-2&amp;nbsp;°C) expected to occur during the first half of the century.&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tubiello |first=Francesco N. |last2=Soussana |first2=Jean-François |first3= S.

There are, however, some positive possible aspects to climate change as well. The projected increase in temperature during the first half of the century (1-3&amp;nbsp;°C) is expected to benefit crop and pasture yields in the [[temperate region]]s.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Van der Velde"&gt;{{cite report |last=Tubiello |first=F.N. |last2=van der Velde |first2=M. |title=Land and water use options for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture |work=SOLAW Background Thematic Report - TR04A |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/solaw/files/thematic_reports/TR_04a_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will lead to higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in these regions; resulting in a longer [[growing season]], increased thermal resources and accelerated maturation.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; If the climate scenario results in mild and wet weather, some areas and crops will suffer, but many may benefit from this.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;

====Drought and flood====
Extreme weather conditions continue to decrease crop yields in the form of [[droughts]] and [[floods]]. While these weather events are becoming more common, there is still uncertainty and therefore a lack of preparedness as to when and where they will take place.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kristjanson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristjanson |first=Patti |last2=Neufeldt |first2=Henry |last3=Gassner |first3=Anja |last4=Mango |first4=Joash |last5=Kyazze |first5=Florence B. |last6=Desta |first6=Solomon |last7=Sayula |first7=George |last8=Thiede |first8=Brian |last9=Förch |first9=Wiebke |last10=Thornton |first10=Pphilip K. |last11=Coe |first11=Richard |display-authors=3 |title=Are food insecure smallholder households making changes in their farming practices? Evidence from East Africa |journal=Food Security |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=381–397 |doi=10.1007/s12571-012-0194-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, floods destroy crops, disrupting agricultural activities and rendering workers jobless and eliminating food supply. On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;

Droughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.&lt;ref name=Connor/&gt; The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of “blue water” currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a [[water crisis]].&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;  In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], water is used to flood [[rice fields]] to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this [[historical method]] of weed control will no longer be possible.&lt;ref name=Rod10&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=Jonne |last2=Riches |first2=Charles R. |last3=Kayeke |first3=Juma M. |title=Addressing current and future problems of parasitic weeds in rice |journal=Crop Protection |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=210–221 |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2009.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. [[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt; Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;

===Financial===
Some research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt; However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave that passed through Europe in 2003]] cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"/&gt; In addition, during [[El Nino]] weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer's income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country's [[GDP]].&lt;ref name="Tubiello &amp; Soussana"/&gt; The agriculture industry in [[India]] makes up 52% of their employment and the [[Canadian Prairies]] supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the [[economy]].&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt; This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.

===Pests and pathogens===
Currently, {{CO2}} levels are 40% higher than they were in [[pre-industrial agriculture|pre-industrial]] times.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species’ defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;

Currently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt; Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.&lt;ref name=Rod11&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D. E. |title=Challenges for weed management in African rice systems in a changing climate |journal=[[The Journal of Agricultural Science]] |date=August 2011 |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=427–435 |doi=10.1017/S0021859611000207|url=http://ecite.utas.edu.au/69596 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite end of the spectrum, drought conditions favour different kinds of pests like [[aphids]], [[whiteflies]] and [[locusts]].&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt;

The competitive balance between plants and pests has been relatively stable for the past century, but with the rapidly shifting climate, there is a change in this balance which often favours the more biologically diverse [[weed]]s over the [[monocropping|monocrops]] most farms consist of.&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt; Currently, weeds claim about one tenth of global crop yields annually as there are about eight to ten weed species in a field competing with crops.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; Characteristics of weeds such as their [[genetic diversity]], cross-breeding ability, and fast-growth rates put them at an advantage in changing climates as these characteristics allow them to adapt readily in comparison to most farm's uniform crops, and give them a biological advantage.&lt;ref name="Ferber &amp; Epstein"/&gt; There is also a shift in the distribution of pests as the altered climate makes areas previously uninhabitable more uninviting.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; Finally, with the increased {{CO2}} levels, [[herbicides]] will lose their efficiency which in turn increases the tolerance of weeds to herbicides.&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt;

==Impact on nutrition==
	Another area of concern is the effect of climate change on the nutritional content of food for human consumption. Studies show that increasing atmospheric levels of {{CO2}} have an unfavourable effect on the nutrients in plants. As the [[carbon]] concentration in the plant's tissues increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the concentration of [[Chemical element|elements]] such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]]. Of significant concern is the [[protein]] content of plants, which also decreases in relation to elevating carbon content.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of CO2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taub |first=Daniel R. |last2=Miller |first2=Brian |last3=Allen |first3=Holly |title=Effects of elevated {{CO2}} on the protein concentration of food crops: a meta-analysis |journal=[[Global Change Biology]] |date=March 2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=565–575 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01511.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Irakli Loladze explains that the lack of [[essential nutrients]] in crops contributes the problem of [[micronutrient malnutrition]] in society, commonly known as “hidden hunger”; despite adequate caloric intake, the body still is not nutritionally satisfied and therefore continues to be “hungry”.&lt;ref name=Loladze&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loladze |first=Irakli |title=Rising atmospheric {{CO2}} and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry? |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=1 October 2002 |volume=17 |pages=457–461 |issue=10 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02587-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is aggravated by the rising cost of food, resulting in a global shift towards diets which are less expensive, but high in [[calories]], [[fat]]s, and animal products. This results in [[undernutrition]] and an increase in [[obesity]] and diet-related [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loladze/&gt;
	
Countries worldwide are already impacted by deficiencies in micronutrients and are seeing the effects in the health of their populations. [[Iron deficiency]] affects more than 3.5 billion people; increasing [[maternal mortality]] and hindering [[cognitive development]] in children, leading to education losses. [[Iodine deficiency]] leads to ailments like [[goitre]], [[brain damage]] and [[cretinism]] and is a problem in at least 130 different countries.&lt;ref name=Loladze/&gt; Even though these deficiencies are invisible, they have great potential to impact human health on a global scale.
	
It must also be noted that small increases in {{CO2}} levels can cause a {{CO2}} fertilization effect where the growth and reproduction abilities of [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] plants such as soybeans and [[rice]] are actually enhanced by 10-20% in laboratory experiments. This does not take into account, however, the additional burden of pests, pathogens, nutrients and water affecting the crop yield.&lt;ref name="Effects of CO2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Peter J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Scott N. |last3=Newton |first3=Adrian C. |last4=Ingram |first4=John S.I. |title=Integrating pests and pathogens into the climate change/food security debate |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |year=2009 |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=2827–2838 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp080|pmid=19380424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation and mitigation strategies==
While researchers acknowledge there are possible [[benefits of global warming]], most agree that the negative consequences of climate change will outweigh any potential benefits and instead the shifting climate will result in more benefits to developed countries and more detriments to developing countries; exacerbating the discrepancy between wealthy and impoverished nations.&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer &amp; Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;  By thoughtful and proactive efforts, climate change can be mitigated by addressing these issues with a [[multidisciplinary approach]] that works on a [[Earth|global]], [[nation]]al and [[community]] basis that recognizes the uniqueness of each country's situation.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt; 
	
According to a study of [[East Africa]]’s smallholder farms, impacts of climate change on agriculture are already being seen there resulting in changes to farming practices such as [[intercropping]], crop, soil, land, water and livestock management systems, and introduction of new technologies and seed varieties by some of the farmers.&lt;ref name="Kristjanson"/&gt; Some other suggestions such as eliminating [[supply chain]] and household food waste, encouraging diverse and vegetable-rich diets, and providing global access to foods ([[food aid]] programs) have been suggested as ways to adapt.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt; Many researchers agree that agricultural innovation is essential to addressing the potential issues of climate change. This includes better management of soil, water-saving technology, matching crops to environments, introducing different crop varieties, crop rotations, appropriate [[fertilization]] use, and supporting community-based adaptation strategies.&lt;ref name=Kul/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rod11/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFPRI&gt;{{cite report |last=Nelson |first=Gerald C. |first2=Mark W. |last2=Rosegrant |first3=Jawoo |last3=Koo |first4=Richard |last4=Robertson |first5=Timothy |last5=Sulser |first6=Tingju |last6=Zhu |first7=Claudia |last7=Ringler |first8=Siwa |last8=Msangi |first9=Amanda |last9=Palazzo |first10=Miroslav |last10=Batka |first11=Marilia |last11=Magalhaes |first12=Rowena |last12=Valmonte-Santos |first13=Mandy |last13=Ewing |first14=David |last14=Lee |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation |publisher=[[International Food Policy Research Institute]] |date= October 2009 |location=Washington, DC |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/16557/filename/16558.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a government and global level, research and investments into [[agricultural productivity]] and [[infrastructure]] must be done to get a better picture of the issues involved and the best methods to address them. [[Government policies]] and programs must provide environmentally sensitive government [[subsidies]], educational campaigns and economic incentives as well as funds, [[insurance]] and safety nets for vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name=Hertel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sindhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFPRI/&gt;  In addition, providing [[early warning systems]], and accurate [[weather forecasts]] to poor or remote areas will allow for better preparation; by using and sharing the available technology, the global issue of climate change can be addressed and mitigated by the global community.&lt;ref name=Beddington/&gt;

==Oceans and human health==

===Overview===
Perhaps one of the most recent adverse [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] to be explored is that of [[ocean acidification]]. Our [[oceans]] cover approximately 71 percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and support a diverse range of [[ecosystems]], which are home to over 50 percent of all the [[species]] on the planet.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web |title=Oceans &amp; Coasts |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.noaa.gov/oceans-coasts |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans regulate [[climate]] and [[weather]] as well as providing [[nutrition]] for a vast variety of species, humans included.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; Covering such an extensive part of the planet has allowed the oceans to absorb a large portion of the [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] from the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=raven99&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Raven |first=J.A. |last2=Falkowski |first2=P.G. |date=June 1999 |title=Oceanic sinks for atmospheric {{co2}} |journal=[[Plant, Cell &amp; Environment]] | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=741–755 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is part of the [[carbon cycle]] in which the fluxes of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in Earth's [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]] and [[lithosphere]] are described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon Cycle |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=29 Nov 2012 |url=http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9020247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have drastically added to the amount of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in the atmosphere through the burning of [[fossil fuels]] and the process of [[deforestation]]. Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].

With degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.&lt;ref name="atoll"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88–89|pages=76–84|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="child"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328–1332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands. These islands possess limited freshwater supplies, namely ground water lenses and rain fall. When the protective coral reefs surrounding them erodes due to higher temperatures and acidic water chemistry, salt water is able to infiltrate the lens and contaminate the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="atoll" /&gt; In coastal Bangladesh it has been demonstrated that seasonal hypertension in pregnant women is connected with such phenomenon due to high sodium intake from drinking water.&lt;ref name="child" /&gt; Reef erosion, coupled with sea level rise, tends to flood low-lying areas more frequently during storm surges and weather events. Warming ocean waters generate larger and more devastating weather events that can decimate coastal populations especially without the protection of coral reefs.

===Human health===
The health of our oceans has a direct effect on the health humans. According to Small and Nicholls, they estimated that 1.2 billion people worldwide, lived in the near-coastal region (within 100&amp;nbsp;km and 100m of the shoreline).&lt;ref name=settle&gt;{{cite journal |last=Small |first=Christopher |last2=Nicholls |first2=Robert J. |title=A Global Analysis of Human Settlement in Coastal Zones |journal=Journal of Coastal Research |date=Summer 2003 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=584–599 |jstor=4299200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data was collected in 1990 and therefore is a conservative estimate in modern terms. In the U.S. alone 53% of the population lives within 50 miles of the coastal shoreline.&lt;ref name=grass&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delorenzo |first=Marie E. |last2=Wallace |first2=Sarah C. |last3=Danese |first3=Loren E. |last4=Baird |first4=Thomas D. |title=Temperature and Salinity effects on the toxicity of common pesticides to the grass shrimp, ''Palaemonetes pugio'' |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health |year=2008 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=455–460 |doi=10.1080/03601230902935121|pmid=20183050 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234438 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans rely heavily on oceans for food, employment, recreation, weather patterns and transportation.&lt;ref name=guest&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sandifer |first=Paul A. |first2=A.

===Food safety===
Our insatiable appetite for seafood of all types has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks to the point of collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called [[domoic acid]] which is responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].&lt;ref name=pseudo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tatters |first=Avery O. |first2=Fei-Xue |last2=Fu |first3=David A. |last3=Hutchins |title=High {{CO2}} and Silicate Limitation Synergistically Increase the Toxicity of ''Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta'' |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032116 |pmid=22363805 |pmc=3283721 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732116T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater {{CO2}} concentrations associated with ocean acidification.&lt;ref name=pseudo/&gt;  Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; [[Ciguatera fish poisoning]], [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, [[diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.&lt;ref name=pseudo/&gt;

==Extreme weather events==
Infectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Niño cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

===Drought===
Arguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.
A number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.
During times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110–118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S–181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]]. With the increase in temperatures worldwide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vigran |first=Anna |title=With Climate Change Comes Floods |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=14 January 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18022014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Floods]] have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well being. Short term implications include [[Death|mortalities]], [[injuries]] and [[diseases]], while long term implications include [[non-communicable diseases]] and [[psychosocial]] health aspects.&lt;ref name=alderman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alderman |first=Katarzyna |first2=Lyle R. |last2=Turner |first3=Shilu |last3=Tong |title=Floods and human health: A systematic review |journal=Environment International |date=June 2012 |volume=47 |pages=37–47 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.003|pmid=22750033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt; Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.&lt;ref&gt;thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

Non-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.&lt;ref name=alderman/&gt;

=== Hurricanes ===
Another result of the warming oceans are stronger [[hurricanes]], which will wreak more havoc on land, and in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Storms and Sickness"&gt;{{cite book|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5|pp=161–178|chapter=Storms and Sickness|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sobering Predictions" /&gt; [[Extreme weather]] also means stronger winds. These winds can carry vectors tens of thousands of kilometers, resulting in an introduction of new infectious agents to regions that have never seen them before, making the humans in these regions even more susceptible.&lt;ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /&gt;

===Glacial melting===
A [[glacier]] is a mass of ice that has originated from snow that has been compacted via pressure and have definite lateral limits and movements in definite directions.&lt;ref name="Chinn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chinn|first=T.J.|date=2001|title=Distribution of the glacial water resources of New Zealand|url=http://hydrologynz.co.nz/downloads/20071015-094857-JoHNZ_2001_v40_2_Chinn.pdf|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=139–187}}&lt;!-- removed from ref, these point to a different article: {{|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90093-3 |bibcode=1979JHyd...40..139C}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in areas where the temperatures do not get warm enough to melt annual snow accumulation, thus resulting in many layers of snow piling up over many years, creating the pressure needed to make a glacier.  [[Global climate change]] and fluctuation is causing an increasingly exponential melting of Earth's glaciers.  These melting glaciers have many [[social]] and [[ecological]] consequences that directly or indirectly impact the health and well-being of humans.&lt;ref name=Orlove&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orlove |first=Ben |title=Glacier Retreat: Reviewing the Limits of Human Adaptation to Climate Change |journal=Environment |year=2009 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=22–34 |doi=10.3200/envt.51.3.22-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recession of glaciers change [[sea salt]], [[sediment]], and temperature ratios in the ocean which changes currents, weather patterns, and marine life.&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite book |title=Changing Planet, changing health |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles, California |isbn=978-0520269095 |author1=Epstein, P. |author2=Ferber, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The melt also [[ocean levels|increases ocean levels]] and decreases the [[Water resources|availability of water]] for human consumption, agriculture, and hydroelectricity.  This aggravates and increases the likelihood of issues such as sanitation,  [[world hunger]], population shifts, and [[Extreme weather|catastrophic weather]] such as flooding, drought, and worldwide temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

Glacial retreat first gained the attention of alpinists and the tourist industry shortly after 1940 – when the globe warmed ~0.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; Even with 62 years of awareness, [[climate change]] is just becoming an issue for some parts of society. Over this time period the [[alpine glaciers|cirque and steep alpine glaciers]] were able to [[acclimatize]] to the new temperatures posed by climate change; large [[valley glacier]]s have not yet made this adjustment. This means the large valley glaciers are rapidly retreating, as their mass is attempting to achieve equilibrium with the current climate.  If regional [[snow line]]s stay constant, then the glaciers remain constant.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; Today this is clearly not the case as global warming is causing mountain snow lines to rapidly retreat.  Even the United States’ famous [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] is receding.  More than two-thirds of its glaciers have disappeared and it is expected for them to be nonexistent in the park by the year 2030.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Myrna H.P. |last2=Fagre |first2=Daniel B. |title=Modeled Climate Change in Glacier National Park, 1850-2100 |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=131 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0131:mcigci]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glacial melt will affect [[Coastal wetland|low-lying coastal wetlands]] via [[sea level rise]], change key drivers of [[fresh-water ecosystem]]s, shift the timing of snow packs, and alter the unique character of associated fresh water streams off of snow pack.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K.M. |last1=Jenkins |last2=Kingsford |first2=R.T. |last3=Closs |first3=G.P. |last4=Wolfenden |first4=B.J. |last5=Matthaei |first5=C.D. |last6=Hay |first6=S.E. |display-authors=3 |title=Climate change and freshwater ecosystems in Oceania: an assessment of vulnerability and adaption opportunities |journal=[[Pacific Conservation Biology]] |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=201–219 |doi=10.1071/PC110201 |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=PC110201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been stated that the sea level will rise 28–43&amp;nbsp;cm by 2100;&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt; if all the ice on Earth melts, it is predicted that the ocean level will increase 75 meters, destroying many coastal cities.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  In addition, the freshwater swaps in northern areas are already affected by the intrusion of salt water. “Sea level rise will cause a change of state from freshwater to marine or [[Estuarine|estuarine ecosystems]], radically altering the composition of [[Biotic community|biotic communities]]".&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

Not only are glaciers causing a rise in sea level, they are causing an increase in [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ESNO) and global temperature itself.&lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt;  Glacier loss adds to global heat rise through a decrease in what is called [[ice-albedo feedback]].  As more ice melts, there is less [[Solar reflectance|solar reflectivity]] and less heat is reflected away from the Earth, causing more heat to be absorbed, and retained in the atmosphere and soil &lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; In addition to the El Niño events, glacial melt is contributing to the rapid turnover of [[sea surface temperatures]] &lt;ref name=Chinn/&gt; and ocean salt content by diluting the ocean water and slowing the [[Atlantic conveyor belt|Atlantic conveyor belt's]] usually swift dive because of a top layer of buoyant, cold, fresh water that slows the flow of warm water to the north.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

Fifty percent of the world's fresh water consumption is dependent glacial runoff.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;  Earth's glaciers are expected to melt within the next forty years, greatly decreasing fresh water flow in the hotter times of the year, causing everyone to depend on rainwater, resulting in large shortages and fluctuations in fresh water availability which largely effects agriculture, power supply, and human health and well-being.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;  Many power sources and a large portion of agriculture rely on glacial runoff in the late summer.  “In many parts of the world, disappearing [[mountain glacier]]s and droughts will make fresh, clean water for drinking, bathing, and other necessary human (and livestock) uses scarce" and a valuable commodity.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

=== Heat stress ===
The upper limit for [[heat stress]] humans can adapt to is called into question with a 7&amp;nbsp;°C temperature rise, quantified by the [[wet-bulb temperature]], regions of Earth would lose their habitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Steven C. |last1=Sherwood |first2=Matthew |last2=Huber |date=19 November 2009 |title=An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=107 |issue=21 |pages=9552–9555 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0913352107 |bibcode=2010PNAS..107.9552S |pmid=20439769 |pmc=2906879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deforestation==
===Effects of deforestation in the African Highlands===
 [[Image:Ethiopian highlands 01 mod.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Ethiopian Highlands]]]]

Environmental changes such as deforestation could increase local temperatures in the highlands thus could enhance the vectorial capacity of the [[anopheles]].&lt;ref name=Afrane&gt;{{cite journal |last=Afrane |first=Y.

Environmental changes, [[climate variability]], and climate change are such factors that could affect biology and ecology of Anophelse [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] and their [[disease transmission]] potential.&lt;ref name=Afrane/&gt; Climate change is expected to lead to latitudinal and altitudinal temperature increases. Global warming projections indicate that the best estimate of surface air warming for a “high scenario” is 4 C, with a likely range of 2.4-6.4 C by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |location=Cambridge |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_wg2_report_impacts_adaptation_and_vulnerability.htm |author=IPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temperature increase of this size would alter the biology and the ecology of many mosquito vectors and the dynamics of the diseases they transmit such as malaria. Anopheles mosquitoes in highland areas are to experience a larger shift in their metabolic rate due to the climate change. This climate change is due to the deforestation in the highland areas where these mosquitoes dwell. When temperature rises, the [[larvae]] take a shorter time to mature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Munga, S. |author2=Minakawa, N. |author3=Zhou, G. |author4=Githenko, A.K. |author5=Yan, G. |title=Survivorship of Immature Stages of Anopheles gambiae s.l.

In turn this could potentially lead to an increase in malaria transmission when infected humans are available.[[Image:Forest fruits from Barro Colorado.png|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Biodiversity]]]]

===Biodiversity===
[[Deforestation]] is directly linked with a decrease in plant [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=muhammad&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muhammad |first=Ashraf |author2=Hussain, M. |author3=Ahmad, M.S.A |author4=Al-Quariny, F. |author5=Hameed, M. |title=Strategies for conservation of endangered ecosystems |journal=Pakistan Journal of Botany |date=May 2012 |volume=44 |issue=Special Issue |pages=1–6 |url=http://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/PDFs/44(SI2)/01.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This decrease in biodiversity has several implications for human health.

===Mountain pine beetle, forest ecosystems and forest fires===
[[Image:Dendroctonus ponderosae.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Adult mountain pine beetle]]

Climate change and the associated changing weather patterns occurring worldwide have a direct effect on biology, population ecology, and the population of eruptive insects, such as the [[mountain pine beetle]] (MPB). This is because temperature is a factor which determines insect development and population success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sambaraju |first=Kishan R. |last2=Carroll |first2=Allan L. |last3=Zhu |first3=Jun |last4=Stahl |first4=Kerstin |last5=Moore |first5=R.

It is a simple relationship between a [[host (biology)|host]] (the forest), an [[Biological agent|agent]] (the beetle) and the [[Natural environment|environment]] (the weather &amp; temperature).&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; However, as climate change causes mountain areas to become warmer and drier, pine beetles have more power to infest and destroy the forest ecosystems, such as the whitebark pine forests of the Rockies.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; This is a forest so important to forest ecosystems that it is called the “rooftop of the rockies”. Climate change has led to a threatening pine beetle [[pandemic]], causing them to spread far beyond their native habitat. This leads to [[ecosystem]] changes, [[forest fires]], [[floods]] and hazards to human [[health]].&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

The whitebark pine ecosystem in these high elevations plays many essential roles, providing support to plant and animal life.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;  They provide food for [[grizzly bears]] and [[squirrels]], as well as shelter and breeding grounds for [[elk]] and [[deer]]; protects [[Drainage divide|watersheds]] by sending water to parched foothills and plains; serves as a reservoir by dispensing supplies of water from melted snowpacks that are trapped beneath the shaded areas; and creates new soil which allows for growth of other trees and plant species.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Without these pines, animals do not have adequate food, water, or shelter, and the reproductive life cycle, as well as quality of life, is affected as a consequence.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Normally, the pine beetle cannot survive in these frigid temperatures and high elevation of the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; However, warmer temperatures means that the pine beetle can now survive and attack these forests, as it no longer is cold enough to freeze and kill the beetle at such elevations.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Increased temperatures also allow the pine beetle to increase their life cycle by 100%: it only takes a single year instead of two for the pine beetle to develop. As the Rockies have not adapted to deal with pine beetle [[infestations]], they lack the defenses to fight the beetles.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Warmer [[weather patterns]], [[drought]], and beetle defense mechanisms together dries out [[sap]] in [[pine trees]], which is the main mechanism of defense that trees have against the beetle, as it drowns the beetles and their eggs.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; This makes it easier for the beetle to infest and release chemicals into the tree, luring other beetles in an attempt to overcome the weakened defense system of the pine tree. As a consequence, the host (forest) becomes more vulnerable to the disease-causing agent (the beetle).&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

The whitebark forests of the Rockies are not the only forests that have been affected by the mountain pine beetle. Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the [[Continental Divide]] of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile [[boreal forest]]s of [[Alberta]], known as the “lungs of the Earth”.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; These forests are imperative for producing [[oxygen]] through [[photosynthesis]] and removing [[carbon]] in the [[atmosphere]]. But as the forests become infested and die, [[carbon dioxide]] is released into the environment, and contributes even more to a warming climate. Ecosystems and humans rely on the supply of oxygen in the environment, and threats to this boreal forest results in severe consequences to our planet and human health.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; In a forest ravaged by pine beetle, the dead logs and kindle which can easily be ignited by [[lightning]]. [[Forest fires]] present dangers to the environment, human health and the [[economy]].&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;  They are detrimental to [[air quality]] and [[vegetation]], releasing [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]] compounds as they burn.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt; Due to human induced [[deforestation]] and climate change, along with the pine beetle pandemic, the strength of forest ecosystems decrease. The infestations and resulting [[diseases]] can indirectly, but seriously, effect human health. As droughts and temperature increases continue, so does the frequency of devastating forest fires, [[insect]] infestations, forest diebacks, [[acid rain]], habitat loss, animal endangerment and threats to safe drinking water.&lt;ref name=pinebeetle/&gt;

===Smoke from wildfires===
[[File:Wildfire near Cedar Fort, Utah.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|alt=Flat expanse of brown grasses and some green trees with black and some gray smoke and visible flames in the distance.|A surface fire in the western desert of [[Utah]], U.S.]]

Warming [[spring (season)|spring]] and [[summer]] temperatures increase [[flammability]] of materials that make up the forest floors.&lt;ref name=westerling/&gt; Warmer temperatures cause dehydration of these materials, which prevents [[rain]] from soaking up and dampening fires.  Furthermore, [[pollution]] from wildfires can exacerbate climate change by releasing atmospheric [[aerosol]]s, which modify [[cloud]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] patterns.

Wood smoke from wildfires produces [[particulate matter]] that has damaging effects to human health.&lt;ref name=naeher&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naeher |first=Luke P. |last2=Brauer |first2=Mmichael |last3=Lipsett |first3=Michael |last4=Zelikoff |first4=Judith T. |last5=Simpson |first5=Christopher D. |last6=Koenig |first6=Jane Q. |last7=Smith |first7=Kirk R. |display-authors=3 |title=Woodsmoke health effects: A review |journal=Inhalation Toxicology |date=January 2007 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=67–106 |doi=10.1080/08958370600985875 |pmid=17127644 |citeseerx=10.1.1.511.1424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary pollutants in wood smoke are [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitric oxide]].&lt;ref name=westerling/&gt;  Through the destruction of [[forests]] and human-designed [[infrastructure]], [[wildfire]] smoke releases other toxic and carcinogenic compounds, such as [[formaldehyde]] and [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name=epstein2&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Brian |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens our Health and What We Can Do About It |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |isbn=9780520272637 |pages=138–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These pollutants damage human health by evading the [[mucociliary clearance]] system and depositing in the [[upper respiratory tract]], where they exert toxic effects.&lt;ref name=westerling/&gt; Research by Naeher and colleagues.&lt;ref name=naeher/&gt; found that physician visits for respiratory diseases increased by 45-80% during wildfire activity in urban British Columbia.

==Displacement/migration==
{{See also|Environmental migrant}}
Climate change causes displacement of people in several ways, the most obvious—and dramatic—being through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats causing people to seek shelter or livelihoods elsewhere. Slow onset phenomena, including effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihoods and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888 |title=Environment a Growing Driver in Displacement of People |work=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme environmental events are increasingly recognized as a key driver of migration across the world. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.&lt;ref name=bogumil&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Bogumil |last=Terminski |title=Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges |publisher=Centre d'Etude de l'Ethnicité et des Migrations, Université de Liège |date=2012 |url=http://labos.ulg.ac.be/cedem/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. It is highly exposed to climate impacts, and is home to highly vulnerable population groups, who are disproportionately poor and marginalized. A recent Asian Development Bank report highlights “environmental hot spots” that are particular risk of flooding, [[cyclones]], [[typhoons]], and water stress.&lt;ref name="beta"&gt;{{cite report|title=Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Asian Development Bank |date=2012 |url=http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-06 |isbn=978-92-9092-611-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure
development, and disaster risk management. Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves. However, migrants&amp;nbsp;– particularly low-skilled ones&amp;nbsp;– are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.&lt;ref name="beta" /&gt;

The links between the gradual environmental degradation of climate change and displacement are complex: as the decision to migrate is taken at the household level, it is difficult to measure the respective influence of climate change in these decisions with regard to other influencing factors, such as [[poverty]], [[population growth]] or [[employment]] options.&lt;ref name=bogumil/&gt; This situates the debate on [[environmental migrant|environmental migration]] in a highly contested field: the use of the term 'environmental refugee', although commonly used in some contexts, is disrecommended by agencies such as the [[UNHCR]] who argue that the term 'refugee' has a strict legal definition which does not apply to environmental migrants.&lt;ref name="UNHCR on environmental migration terminology"&gt;{{cite report |last=Black |first=Richard |title=Environmental refugees: myth or reality? |series=New Issues in Refugee Research |id=Working Paper No. 34 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0d00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] nor the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement on climate change, includes any provisions concerning specific assistance or protection for those who will be directly affected by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Sense of Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Displacement: A Work in Progress |first=Elizabeth |last=Ferris |date=14 December 2007 |work=[[The Brookings Institution]] |url=http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095750/http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electronic health record]] medical healthcare systems are developing widely. Things are being moved from the manual ways to automation and the [[Medical record|patient records]] and health records are also being recorded electronically. One important aspect of any health record system is to ensure the [[Medical confidentiality|confidentiality]] of the patient information because of its importance in the medical field.

==Definition of electronic health record==
In the recent times, the individual patient’s and population’s health information is recorded in form of electronically accessible files known as electronic health records (EHR). These are digital records which can be easily transferred across the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, C. (2004). Nursing BC/Registered Nurses Association of British Columbia, 36(5), 25. Retrieved from http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Issue%20Brief/2012/Jul&lt;/ref&gt;
A multitude of information is contained within the electronic health including billing information, patient’s weight, age, vital signs, [[radiology]] images, [[Blood test|laboratory test]] results, [[immunization]] status, [[allergies]], [[medication]], [[medical history]] and demographics etc.

==Purpose and use==
Regardless of being in a paper form or electronic form, a medical health record is a tool of communication which helps in making clinical decisions, designing regulatory processes, accreditation, education, legal protection, research purposes, service coordination and evaluation of the efficacy and quality of healthcare provided.&lt;ref name=given&gt;Given, LM (ed.) 2008, The SAGE encyclopaedia of qualitative research methods, SAGE Publications, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, viewed 1 June 2013, {{DOI|10.4135/9781412963909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act==
In order to ensure the safe and secure usage of the Electronic Health Records, the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] introduced the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act in 2012. The act provides information regarding the rights of patients, obligatory information protection steps by the medical staff and organizations and the steps of registration with reference to the usage of patient’s [[Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government Law. (2012). "Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act 2012". N.p. Retrieved from http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00063&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protecting electronic health records==
Since Electronic Health Records have more of a virtual existence than a physical one, protecting them also requires usage of appropriate technological tools and techniques. The following measures regarding the protection of Electronic Health Records are worth highlighting:

Ensuring the prevention of confidentiality breakage requires the provision of authorized access to the patient’s healthcare information. In order to do so, the following steps could be taken:
*Installation of a Protective Layer Software or Authorization Management Software.
*Provision of Username and Passwords for access to users dependent upon their individual needs.
*Execution of Security Protocols and Password Protection measures including:
**Password Changing after periodic intervals.
**Setting rules for minimum number of characters in passwords.
**Barring from the re-usage of passwords.
*Installation of Second Tier Verification Systems such as [[Face recognition|Face Recognition]], Bio-metrics Identifier Scan including [[retina]], finger or palm scanning etcetera.&lt;ref&gt;Internet protection tips. (1996). Credit World, 85(1), 29-29. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/220748487&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrity and security, and consequences of information leakage==
[[Data theft]] and alteration has been a major problem in the recent times. Moreover, as far as patient health records are concerned, there are always potential threats of information leakages, [[Data erasure|data hacking]], information destruction, manipulation or even blackmailing of patients by the external or internal users. Since the consequences of Information leaks are comparatively high in contrast to information alterations, one possible way to have information regarding the user of information is to audit information trails.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, L. &amp; Bond, K. (2012). "Electronic Health Records: Privacy, Confidentiality and Security". N.p. Retrieved from http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2012/09/stas1-1209.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Audit trails refer to keeping information about who had recently used or accessed patient records. Through the usage of [[Audit trail|audit trails]] and the above-mentioned security steps, Electronic Health Records could most probably be made the best way of collecting, storing, retaining and using patient health information.

'''''Emergency''''' is an [[Australian]] [[television]] series produced by [[GTV (Australia)|GTV-9]] in 1959.

The series was set in the busy casualty department of a major Melbourne hospital, and is notable for being one of the first-ever dramas shown on Australian television.&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;Albert Moran, ''Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series'', AFTRS 1993 p 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;

Made by Melbourne's GTV-9 in co-operation with the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]], and based on Britain's ''[[Emergency Ward 10]]'', ''Emergency'' starred Brian James as Dr. Geoffrey Thompson, Syd Conabere as orderly George Rogers, and Judith Godden as Nurse Jill Adamson. Moira Carleton also featured as  Matron Evans.

The series was produced primarily in the GTV-9 studio, with brief (usually pre-credit) exterior sequences shot on 35mm film by newsreel cameramen. The episodes were not broadcast live, but were [[kinescope]]d to meet programming requirements, and facilitate later screening in [[Sydney]].

The series' premise was simple: a basic dramatic exploration of cases passing through the Casualty ward. Scripts were written by GTV staffers Roland Strong (series producer) and Denzil Howson (series director) under pseudonyms.

Sponsorship came from [[BP|British Petroleum]], and a contract was signed for 52 half-hour episodes. The series debuted on GTV-9 on 16 February 1959, and on Sydney's ATN-7 a week later. Critics initially appeared fairly neutral, however a highly negative article on the series in a Sydney newspaper caused BP to withdraw sponsorship 16 weeks into the series run. Faced with having to carry the production expenses alone, GTV-9 discontinued production, with the final episode airing in Melbourne on 1 June 1959.

Following the series demise, Brian James went on to lead roles in the ABC serial ''[[Stormy Petrel (TV series)|Stormy Petrel]]'' in 1960, and [[ATN]]-7's period drama ''[[Jonah (TV series)|Jonah]]'' in 1962, later appearing as George Tippit in the drama serial "Skyways" (1979–81).

Conabere and Carleton appeared in guest roles in most of the Australian TV dramas on the 1960s and 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11127">'''Environmental health ethics''' is a field of study that combines environmental health policies and ethical consideration towards a mutually acceptable goal. Given the myriad of environmental issues facing society today a sound ethical background can be applied in an attempt to reach a compromise between conflicting interests, like [[anthropocentrism]], global stewardship, religious values, economic development, and public health. A small sample of the scientific disciplines involved in environmental health ethics include: [[ecology]], [[toxicology]], [[epidemiology]], and [[exposure biology]].

==Ethical approaches==

===[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] theories===

===[[Christian]] ethics===

===Natural rights===

===[[Kantianism]]===

===John Stuart Mill's [[Utilitarianism]]===

===Richard Brandt's [[Richard Brandt|Utilitarianism]]===

===W. D. Ross's [[W. D. Ross|view]]===

==Environmental health topics==

Environmental health embodies a wide range of topics with which there are many ethical issues. Many of these issues can be traced back to a moral obligation towards to life forms and other units of biological organization, like ecosystems, and the nature of that obligation. Humanity's place within any given ecosystem must be weighed against the importance of regional, and global health of the environment as a whole. Human and animal rights, property use, and other freedoms can be combined with other factors like to form an ethical dilemma [[social justice]], equality, sustainability, and [[globalism]] to form ethical dilemmas. In response to difficulties with using moral theories to resolve ethical dilemmas various approaches can be used. A case-by-case approach may be too slow when considering the volume of issues at present, so an alternative may be better suited to the task. Taking into account commonly accepted moral virtues can guide conduct and address conflicts between values, rules, and obligations. Most, if not all, of these generally held principles can be found in the ethical approaches listed above, an example of which may be 'respect human rights'. This Principle-Based Method for ethical decision making can be viewed below.

# State the question or problem.
# Gather the relevant information.
# Explore different opinions.
# Apply ethical principles to the different options.
# Resolve any conflicts among ethical principles.
# Take action.&lt;ref&gt;Fox and DeMarco 2000; Beauchamp and Childress 2008; Shamoo and Resnik 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling on a methodology for analyzing different ethical situations we can turn to a broad survey of some of the most relevant issues which face humanity today.

==Pest control==
[[Pesticide]]s are used throughout the world in an attempt to control, repel, or kill pest species. Though many species of insect can be commonly identified throughout the world, others may harm human health and well-being while providing a benefit to the overall environment of an area. One example of the phenomenon is a bee's ability to sting an individual who may have a serious allergic reaction, though they also play a crucial role in the pollination of an ecosystem. A further example would be various species of bat, which though they can transmit rabies, also help to control mosquito populations.
 
Perhaps the biggest event in the history of pesticide use is the widespread use of [[DDT]] to control various pests, including mosquitoes and lice. Its long-term effects had not been sufficiently documented and thus it was assumed to be of low toxicity. Over time the widespread use of DDT began to have serious environmental and human health consequences. Organisms further up the food chain showed significant amounts of DDT in their tissues and this presence had adverse health effects, for example, the weakening of predatory bird eggshells and fish kills. Adverse effects among humans included endocrine system disruption which can lead to reproductive complications.

Among the most disruptive pesticides are those dubbed [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) which do not break down easily in the environment, or if they do they become something equally harmful. Because POPs represent such a threat to organisms within an environment, especially those higher on a food chain, specific international legislation referred to as the Stockholm Convention banned several of them being used. Some of these pollutants are DDT, [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[heptachlor]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[toxaphene]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With these considerations in place it falls onto lawmakers to regulate responsible use of pesticides, and ethics can provide a starting point to consider the best option. Extensive use of pesticides would improve life in the short-term but be harmful in the long-term, and completely banning their use would likewise be detrimental to overall environmental and human health. One strategy to encourage is called Integrated Pest Management (IPM), in which pesticides are responsibly used to limit agricultural loss but also watched for growing resistance and environmental toxicity. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also taken measured to educate clinicians and the public about relevant issues and the best ways to manage pesticide use.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic engineering, food, and nutrition==
[[Genetic engineering]] concerns the application of scientific alteration of plant and animal DNA in order to combat pests, disease, drought, and other factors which can adversely harm the organism. Objections to [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) include theological (playing God) and economic (GMOs can be costly) viewpoints. Genetic engineering of both plants and animals must pass through FDA legislation, which may include public labeling of the product or otherwise marking it as genetically modified.

Food and nutrition also fall under the category of things regulated by the FDA, however, the ethics of this regulation are not always clear. Health consequences of unsafe food, eating in overlarge quantities, are well documented yet in all societies there is no legislation against over-consumption. Ethical properties of utilitarianism and [[social justice]] conflict with humanity's freedom of choice in the determining of access to healthy, safe food.

==Pollution and waste==
Air, water, and solid waste pollution are environmental health issues which can adversely affect people, plants, and animals. From an ethical standpoint many things about pollutants can be studied, like questions of disposal, storage, recycling, and responsibility. A few examples of air pollutants include particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, and [[toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). Perhaps the largest ethical debate concerning [[air pollution]] is how to balance economic development against the interests of the [[public health]], safety, and cleanliness. With both sides offering benefits and drawbacks it can be difficult to establish an acceptable compromise. Legislation enacted to prevent widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons, which cause significant environmental damage, can be seen as one instance of economic development taking a lower priority to public health.

Water pollution is another type of widespread contaminant which has ethical implications in mitigating the source and balancing conflicting priorities. The two types of water contaminants are anthropogenic compounds (generally referred to as pollutants, such as disinfection products, metals, municipal and agricultural waste, and petroleum and coal hydrocarbons) and natural contaminants (such as microorganisms or chemicals like arsenic and nitrogen, which are naturally present in the soil). the common misconception is that chemicals leaking into the soil will be diluted over time and rendered harmless. This theory does not take into account persistent organic pollutants, which do not break down easily, and sometimes break down into more harmful constituents. Most industrialized nations have legislation in place to protect the public from impure drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established maximum levels of pollutants in public drinking water, however its power to regulate private sources of bottled water or wells is severely limited. An additional issue regarding water pollution is the relative scarcity of clean fresh water on the earth, an issue which acutely presents itself in areas prone to drought. Agriculture uses a great deal of water, so much so that shortages in drought-prone areas can significantly affect crop yield. The main ethical issues with water pollution is whether growth should be restricted in order to preserve public health. An additional issue is the regulation of private corporations, whose activities may put populations of citizens at risk for groundwater contamination.

Solid waste pollution includes pollutants like agricultural waste, construction waste, [[electronic waste]], hazardous waste, medical, and mining waste. The two prevailing strategies for solid waste management are prevention and treatment/disposal. Waste prevention is the preferable, both economically and environmentally, as it does not necessitate costly removal and storage. Many of the same ethical issues related above manifest themselves with the handling and storage of solid waste, as well as an additional social justice issue of exactly where the storage area for solid waste should be located.

==Chemical regulation==
[[Chemical regulation]], including carbon particles and nanotubes and nanotechnology, are very new technologies whose long-term effects have not been satisfactorily studied. This lack of research argues that cautionary use of these products is warranted, especially when short-term effects include harmful symptoms. In opposition to this caution is the nanotechnology industry which is growing very rapidly and may be able to alleviate many of the problems facing society today, like selective cancer treatment and the energy crisis. Perhaps the largest obstacle to testing occurs with the sheer diversity of nanoparticles, of which the only unifying factor is their minuscule size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9599">[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|A model poses wearing sportswear that is revealing and aderent.]]
While [[Physical fitness|fitness]] is defined as {{Quote|''the condition of being physically fit and healthy'',&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fitness&lt;/ref&gt;}} and fashion is a {{Quote|''form of imitation and so of social equalization'',&lt;ref&gt;George Simmel, The american journal of Sociology, vol. 62, No. 6 (May, 1957), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}} strictly correlated with the wish of appearing as a well-accepted member of contemporary society,
'''fitness fashion''' is the result of a trend that consists in combining physical activities and health lifestyles with the interest and use of [[sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] [[fashion]].

==The ritual (dress code)==
There is a connection between sportswear and self-affirmation, that exists because of the care for fashion. The action of buying sportswear is led to the feel of being part of a community, assessing its rules and culture. People get involved in a process in which the major aim is to appear.
With regard to fitness fashion, the [[ritual]] is a [[ceremony]] which consists in the activities that take place in a [[fitness centre]] or in a gym and which are the acts of undressing, dressing, exercising, undressing, showering, grooming and dressing again. {{Quote|''The act of undressing, as much as that of dressing, places the individual in a delicate ceremonial position''.&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;Roberta Sassatelli, Fitness culture, gyms and the commercialisation of discipline and fun, Milan University, 2010, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}} This ritual also implies a psychological dimension in which the individual is involved in a process of self-affirmation. What people want to wear is limited by a pre-existing, yet always evolving, ideal, which is the image of fashion itself.

Changing rooms, usually situated in the most internal part of the gym, represent the connection between the outside world and the world of fitness, because {{Quote|''In the changing room, individuals must negotiate, both symbolically and practically, their entrance into the world of fitness training and their return to the outside world''.&lt;ref name=culture /&gt;}} While the exercise places are usually filled with information such as posters and images of fit bodies, changing rooms are always unadorned, since they represent {{Quote|''A moment of concentration before switching into the fitness mood''.&lt;ref name=culture /&gt;}}

Also sportswear has become part of the ritual. Being fit is not just exercising and eating well but also wearing fashionable clothes and showing it also through [[social media]]. Clothing comfort is defined by [[Lauren Slater]] (1985) as {{Quote|''a pleasant state of physiological, psychological and physical harmony between a human being and the environment''.&lt;ref name=behav&gt;Ziynet Öndoğan, Arzu Şen Kılıç, Serkan Boz, Derya Tama, Berna Cüreklibatır Encan, Özlem Kurtoğlu Necef, Research on sportswear buying behavior of university students, SHS Web of Conferences 26, 2016, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Symbolic meanings==
As a matter of fact, fitness fashion requires people to identify with a model. People start buying the same sportswear of the chosen icon they want to imitate, and then chose to act like him/her.
Sportswear is strictly correlated with fashion not only because of a trend, but also for the so-called social learning theory, which {{Quote|''hypothesizes that almost all behavioral and cognitive learning is a result of direct experiences that are acquired through vicariously observing behaviors and the subsequent repercussions of such actions''.&lt;ref name=durke&gt;A. H. Durke, Stereotypes of athletic women using framing and social learning theories: muscles vs. manicures, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
It is also for this reason that [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and other retailers specialized in sportswear are experiencing an increase in profits (Nike saw an increase of 8 million dollars capital in just three months, that is a 15% more than 2014’s revenue, when the [[soccer World Cup]] took place).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilpost.it/2014/09/27/dati-trimestrali-nike/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|''Athletic identity is a central dimension that influences social relationships, types of chosen activities, and perceptions of life experiences, allowing an individual to benefit from a salient sense of self''.&lt;ref name=durke /&gt;}} {{Quote|''It is accepted that [[sport]]s prepare individuals psychologically for daily life together with cultural activities.''&lt;ref name=behav /&gt;}} In this view, fit people are sexier and happier than non-fit people, they are well-accepted from society as successful persons and in this way they are taken as models, influencing a large part of the social media audience.
Since {{Quote|''clothing comfort is related to raising standards of life'',&lt;ref name=behav /&gt;}} fitness fashion icons wear expensive and colorful sportswear (which represents the most visible part of the message, acting as the main instrument of the symbolic meaning delivering), and also show how happy and self-confident they are in it. Furthermore, fitness influencers are showing lifestyles that involve health-care and appearance-care as well, especially through social media.

===Social Media===
Even the most important sportswear companies are involved in social media campaigns, first of all Nike, that give the possibility to their Nike+ app users to share on [[Instagram]] their fitness achievements and progress. In fact, the app has been downloaded over 17 millions of times from all over the world users.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mediablazegroup.com/fighting-fit-social-networks/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|''With media, women are exposed to the symbols, with the muted expectation of achieving such image''.&lt;ref name=durke /&gt;}}
Social learning theory suggests that females learn stereotypes and expectations through observing images through the media. Since social media are the most used instrument for [[information]] resources and connection among people, everyone can easily find a new inspiration through them. Every fitness [[influencer]] uses social media because of the direct contact with fans that the web offers. Sharing fitness goals and motivation is now a spread phenomenon that people begin to appreciate and concur. It follows that a simple photo on a social media becomes easily a form of [[advertisement]], because who posted it wanted to promote his/her lifestyle, that is represented in a direct way from the sportswear he/she is wearing.&lt;ref&gt;Heather J. Warchocki, Depiction of female beauty in fashion versus fitness magazines: implications for the development of body dissatisfaction, thesis, Washington D.C. university, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
{{Quote|''Female athletes and sports that adhere to the feminine ideal receive increased benefits, including positive media attention, fan adoration, sponsorships, and reduced heterosexist discrimination''.&lt;ref name=durke /&gt;}} 
{{Quote|''Women must present a body and appearance that conforms to heterosexist social norms''.&lt;ref&gt;Kayoung Kim, Michael Sagas, Athletic or sexy? A comparison of female athletes and fashion models in Sports illustrated swimsuit issues, Springer Science+Business Media, issue 2014 (29 march)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Fitman.jpg|thumb|Men usually prefer to underline their strength through a visual way, using yoga pants and not wearing shirts.]]
On the other hand, {{Quote|''boys are taught that masculinity in sports is defined in terms of "toughness and dominance and to express disdain for females and any boy seen as weak or unwilling to take risks on or off the playing field".''&lt;ref name=durke /&gt;&gt;}}
[[Society]] and media emphasize athletic women's physical appearance and sexual attractiveness, through representing them as women first and [[athlete]]s second. Thus, the feminine athletic ideal consists of an attractive appearance, thin body, and sexual appeal, which is conveyed also through clothing: women sportswear must fit snugly, but, most important must be sheath, exaggerating the female shape. In health/fitness magazines are included four stereotypes for masculinity: physical action, power, stance, and muscles. While for female it included three stereotypes: thin ideal, glistening/”wet” look, and feminine face. Thus, the health/fitness magazines tended to used the masculine and feminine ideals through stereotypes more than fashion magazines. Thus, who practice health-fitness tend to be less dressed or used close-fitting with the intention to emphasize the appeal.

The '''''Flexner Report'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Flexner, Abraham | year=1910 | title=Medical Education in the United States and Canada: A Report to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | series=Bulletin No. 4. | publisher=The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | location=New York City | pages=346 | oclc=9795002 | url=http://archive.carnegiefoundation.org/pdfs/elibrary/Carnegie_Flexner_Report.pdf | accessdate=June 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book-length study of medical education in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], written by [[Abraham Flexner]] and published in 1910 under the aegis of the [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]]. Many aspects of the present-day American medical profession stem from the ''Flexner Report'' and its aftermath.

The ''Report'' (also called Carnegie Foundation Bulletin Number Four) called on [[Medical school in the United States|American medical schools]] to enact higher admission and graduation standards, and to adhere strictly to the protocols of mainstream [[science]] in their teaching and research. The report talked about the need for revamping and centralizing medical institutions. Many American medical schools fell short of the standard advocated in the ''Flexner Report'' and, subsequent to its publication, nearly half of such schools merged or were closed outright. Colleges in [[electrotherapy]] were closed.

Homeopathy and natural medicines were derided; some doctors were jailed.

The Report also concluded that there were too many medical schools in the United States, and that too many doctors were being trained. A repercussion of the ''Flexner Report'', resulting from the closure or consolidation of university training, was reversion of American universities to male-only admittance programs to accommodate a smaller admission pool. Universities had begun opening and expanding female admissions as part of women's and co-educational facilities only in the mid-to-latter part of the 19th century with the founding of [[co-education]]al [[Oberlin College]] in 1833 and private colleges such as [[Vassar College]] and [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]].

==Background to the report==
[[File:Picture of Abraham Flexner.jpg|thumb|Abraham Flexner]]
In 1904 the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) created the Council on Medical Education (CME)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/about-council-medical-education | title=About the Council on Medical Education | website=American Medical Association |access-date=February 20, 2017 | quote=Founded in 1904, the Council on Medical Education recommends educational policies to the AMA House of Delegates.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose objective was to restructure American medical education. At its first annual meeting, the CME adopted two standards: one laid down the minimum prior education required for admission to a medical school, the other defined a medical education as consisting of two years training in human [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] followed by two years of clinical work in a [[teaching hospital]]. Generally speaking, the council strove to improve the quality of medical students, looking to draw from the society of upperclass, educated students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rockefeller Medicine Men:  Medicine and Capitalism in America|last=Brown|first=E.  Richard|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|year=1979|isbn=0-520-04269-7|location=United States of America|pages=150|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1908, the CME asked the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] to survey American medical education, so as to promote the CME's reformist agenda and hasten the elimination of medical schools that failed to meet the CME's standards. The president of the Carnegie Foundation, [[Henry Pritchett]], a staunch advocate of medical school reform, chose [[Abraham Flexner]] to conduct the survey. Flexner was not a physician, scientist, or a medical educator, although he held a [[bachelor of arts]] degree and operated a for-profit school in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Goodman_143&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=John C.|last2=Musgrave|first2=Gerald L.|title=Patient power: Solving America's Health Care Crisis|year=1992|publisher=Cato Inst.|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-932790-92-5|url=http://www.ncpa.org/pdfs/sp_pp_Part_II.pdf|pp=142–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the 155 medical schools in North America differed greatly in their curricula, methods of assessment, and requirements for admission and graduation. Flexner visited all 155 schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=Malcolm|author2=Irby, David M. |author3=Cooke, Molly |author4=Irby, David M. |author5=Sullivan, William |author6= Ludmerer, Kenneth M. |title=American Medical Education 100 Years after the Flexner Report|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=September 28, 2006|volume=355|issue=13|pages=1339–1344|doi=10.1056/NEJMra055445|pmid=17005951}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generalized about them as follows: "Each day students were subjected to interminable lectures and recitations. After a long morning of dissection or a series of quiz sections, they might sit wearily in the afternoon through three or four or even five lectures delivered in methodical fashion by part-time teachers. Evenings were given over to reading and preparation for recitations. If fortunate enough to gain entrance to a hospital, they observed more than participated." The Report became notorious for its harsh description of certain establishments, for example describing Chicago's 14 medical schools as "a disgrace to the State whose laws permit its existence... indescribably foul... the plague spot of the nation."

Nevertheless, several schools received praise for excellent performance, including [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine|Western Reserve]] (now Case Western Reserve), [[University of Michigan Health System|Michigan]], [[Wake Forest School of Medicine|Wake Forest]], [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine|McGill]], [[University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine|Toronto]], and especially [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins]], which was described as the 'model for medical education'.&lt;ref&gt;Raffel MN, Raffel NK. The US Health System: origins and functions. 4th ed. Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers; 1994:11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommended changes==
To help with the transition and change the minds of other doctors and scientists, [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] gave more than $100 million to colleges, hospitals and founded a philanthropic front group called "General Education Board" (GEB).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

When Flexner researched his report, many American medical schools were small "proprietary" trade schools owned by one or more doctors, unaffiliated with a college or university, and [[For-profit education|run to make a profit]]. A degree was typically awarded after only two years of study.  Laboratory work and dissection were not necessarily required. Many of the instructors were local doctors teaching part-time, whose own training left something to be desired.  The regulation of the medical profession by state governments was minimal or nonexistent.  American doctors varied enormously in their scientific understanding of [[human physiology]], and the word "quack" flourished.

Flexner carefully examined the situation.  Using the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] as the ideal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmc.edu/Community/ruralmeded/flexner.htm UNMC's ''Flexner's Impact on American Medicine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514010030/http://www.unmc.edu/Community/ruralmeded/flexner.htm |date=2007-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he issued the following recommendations:&lt;ref name=Barzansky1992 /&gt;
# Reduce the number of medical schools (from 155 to 31) and poorly trained physicians;
# Increase the [[Pre-medical|prerequisites to enter medical training]];
# Train physicians to practice in a [[scientific method|scientific manner]] and engage medical faculty in research;
# Give medical schools control of clinical instruction in hospitals
# Strengthen state regulation of medical licensure

Flexner even expressed that he found Hopkins to be a "small but ideal medical school, embodying in a novel way, adapted to American conditions, the best features of medical education in England, France, and Germany." In his efforts to ensure that Hopkins was the standard to which all other medical schools in United States were compared, Flexner went on to claim that all the other medical schools were subordinate in relation to this "one bright spot."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soilandhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/0303critic/030312brown/brown4.htm|title=Brown: Chapter 4 - Reforming Medical Education: Who Will Rule Medicine?|last=Bonner|first=Thomas|date=February 1998|website=soilandhealth.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexner believed that admission to a medical school should require, at minimum, a [[high school]] [[diploma]] and at least two years of college or university study, primarily devoted to basic science.  When Flexner researched his report, only 16 out of 155 medical schools in the United States and Canada required applicants to have completed two or more years of university education.&lt;ref name=Flexner_28&gt;{{Harvnb|Flexner|Pritchet|1910|pp=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, 92 percent of U.S. medical schools required this of applicants.&lt;ref name=FlexnerImpactOnUSmedSchools&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiatt|first=Mark D.|author2=Christopher Stockton|title=The Impact of the Flexner Report on the Fate of Medical Schools in North America After 1909|journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons|year=2003|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://www.jpands.org/vol8no2/hiatt.pdf|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexner also argued that the length of medical education should be four years, and its content should be what the CME agreed to in 1905.  Flexner recommended that the proprietary medical schools should either close or be incorporated into existing universities.  Medical schools should be part of a larger university, because a proper stand-alone medical school would have to charge too much in order to break even financially.

Less known is Flexner's recommendation that medical schools appoint full-time clinical professors. Holders of these appointments would become "true university teachers, barred from all but charity practice, in the interest of teaching." Flexner pursued this objective for years, despite widespread opposition from existing medical faculty.

Flexner was the child of German immigrants, and had studied and traveled in Europe. He was well aware that one could not practice medicine in continental Europe without having undergone an extensive specialized university education. In effect, Flexner demanded that American medical education conform to prevailing practice in continental Europe.

By and large, medical schools in Canada and the United States have followed Flexner's recommendations down to the present day. Recently, however, schools have increased their emphasis on [[public health]] matters.

==Consequences of the report==
To a remarkable extent, the following present-day aspects of the medical profession in North America are consequences of the ''Flexner Report'':
* In a very short time, medical colleges were all streamlined and homogenized (all the students were learning the same thing){{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
* A physician receives at least six,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and preferably eight, years of post-secondary formal instruction, nearly always in a university setting;
* Medical training adheres closely to the scientific method and is thoroughly grounded in human physiology and [[biochemistry]]. Medical research adheres fully to the protocols of scientific research;&lt;ref name=Beck2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Andrew H.|title=The Flexner report and the standardization of American medical education.|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=5 May 2004|volume=291|issue=17|pages=2139–40|doi=10.1001/jama.291.17.2139|pmid=15126445|url=http://www.cosbyig.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Flexner-report.pdf|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Average physician quality has increased significantly;&lt;ref name=Barzansky1992&gt;{{cite book|last=Barzansky|first=Barbara|title=Beyond Flexner: Medical Education in the Twentieth Century|year=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0313259845|edition=1. publ.|author2=Gevitz, Norman |authorlink2=Norman Gevitz }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* No medical school can be created without the permission of the state government. Likewise, the size of existing medical schools is subject to state regulation;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
* Each state branch of the [[American Medical Association]] has oversight over the conventional medical schools located within the state;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} 
* Medicine in the US and Canada has become a highly paid and well-respected profession.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The Report is now remembered because it succeeded in creating a single model of medical education, characterized by a philosophy that has largely survived to the present day. "An education in medicine," wrote Flexner, "involves both learning and learning how; the student cannot effectively know, unless he knows how." Although the report is over 100 years old, many of its recommendations are still relevant—particularly those concerning the physician as a "social instrument... whose function is fast becoming social and preventive, rather than individual and curative."

===Medical school closings===
Flexner sought to reduce the number of medical schools in the U.S. to 31, and to cut the annual number of medical graduates from 4,400 to 2,000.&lt;ref name=FlexnerImpactOnUSmedSchools /&gt;  A majority of American institutions granting [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] degrees as of the date of the Report (1910) closed within two to three decades. (In Canada, only the medical school at Western University was deemed inadequate, but none were closed or merged subsequent to the Report.) In 1904, there were 160 M.D. granting institutions with more than 28,000 students. By 1920, there were only 85 M.D. granting institutions, educating only 13,800 students. By 1935, there were only 66 medical schools operating in the USA.

Between 1910 and 1935, more than half of all American medical schools merged or closed. This dramatic decline was in some part due to the implementation of the Report's recommendation that all "proprietary" schools be closed, and that medical schools should henceforth all be connected to universities. Of the 66 surviving MD-granting institutions in 1935, 57 were part of a university. An important factor driving the mergers and closures of medical schools was that all state medical boards gradually adopted and enforced the Report's recommendations. In response to the Report, some schools fired senior faculty members as part of a process of reform and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAlister|first=Vivian|author2=Claydon, Emily|title=The Life of John Wishart (1850–1926): Study of an Academic Surgical Career Prior to the Flexner Report|journal=World Journal of Surgery|year=2012|pages=684–8|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/32172|doi=10.1007/s00268-011-1407-x|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on African-American doctors and patients===
Flexner viewed blacks as inferior and advocated closing all but two of the [[Historically Black colleges and universities|historically black]] medical schools.  His opinions were followed and only [[Howard University College of Medicine|Howard]] and [[Meharry Medical College|Meharry]] were left open, while five other schools were closed. His perspective was that black doctors should only treat black patients and should serve roles subservient to white physicians. The closure of these schools and the fact that black students were not admitted to many medical schools in the US for 50 years after Flexner has contributed to the low numbers of American born physicians of color and the ramifications are still felt more than a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Louis W.|last2=Suez Mittman|first2=Ilana|title=The State of Diversity in the Health Professions a Century After Flexner|journal=Academic Medicine|date=February 2010|volume=85|issue=2|pages=246–253|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181c88145|url=http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/abstract/2010/02000/the_state_of_diversity_in_the_health_professions_a.21.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, given his adherence to [[germ theory]], he argued that, if not properly trained and treated, African-Americans posed a health threat to middle/upper class whites.&lt;ref name="medicine.missouri.edu"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Physicians and Black Hospitals|url=http://medicine.missouri.edu/ophthalmology/uploads/ch06.pdf|page=24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002104238/http://medicine.missouri.edu/ophthalmology/uploads/ch06.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote = "The practice of the Negro doctor will be limited to his own race, which in its turn will be cared for better by good Negro physicians than by poor white ones. But the physical well-being of the Negro is not only of moment to the Negro himself. Ten million of them live in close contact with sixty million whites. Not only does the Negro himself suffer from hookworm and tuberculosis; he communicates them to his white neighbors, precisely as the ignorant and unfortunate white contaminates him. Self-protection not less than humanity offers weighty counsel in this matter; ''self- interest seconds philanthropy''. The Negro must be educated not only for his sake, but for ours. He is, as far as the human eye can see, a permanent factor in the nation."&lt;ref name="medicine.missouri.edu"/&gt;}}

===Impact on alternative medicine===
When Flexner researched his report, "modern" medicine faced vigorous competition from several quarters, including [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]], chiropractic medicine, electrotherapy, [[eclectic medicine]], [[naturopathy]] and [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stahnisch|first=Frank W.|author2=Verhoef, Marja|title=The Flexner Report of 1910 and Its Impact on Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Psychiatry in North America in the 20th Century|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=2012|pages=1–10|doi=10.1155/2012/647896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexner clearly doubted the scientific validity of all forms of medicine other than that based on scientific research, deeming any approach to medicine that did not advocate the use of treatments such as vaccines to prevent and cure illness as tantamount to quackery and charlatanism.  Medical schools that offered training in various disciplines including electromagnetic field therapy, phototherapy, eclectic medicine, physiomedicalism, naturopathy, and homeopathy, were told either to drop these courses from their curriculum or lose their accreditation and underwriting support. A few schools resisted for a time, but eventually all either complied with the Report or shut their doors.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Oschman PhD, in Energy Medicine (Second Edition), 2016 http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/flexner-report&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on osteopathic medicine===
Although almost all the alternative medical schools listed in Flexner's report were closed, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) was able to bring a number of osteopathic medical schools into compliance with Flexner's recommendations and produce an evidence-based practice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}  [[Comparison of MD and DO in the United States|The curricula of DO and MD awarding medical schools are now nearly identical]], the chief difference being the additional instruction in osteopathic schools of [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]][citation needed].

'''Fumigatory boxes''' were described in the 19th century as prophylactic or curative medical devices designed to use smoke or vapor to restore health or help prevent the spread of infectious or contagious diseases.

==Prophylactic use==
Fumigatory boxes were sometimes used to combat the spread of infectious diseases such as the [[plague (disease)|plague]]. One version used in 1837 in Turkey was described as a wooden box approximately 8 feet tall by 3 feet wide (about 2.4 m by 1 m).  At the bottom was a one-foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) tall chamber in which the ingredients of the prophylactic were burned in a dish. Before entering a residence or public building, the clothed subject was to stand inside the box with his or her face protruding through an opening to avoid suffocation, while the rest of his or her body and clothing were engulfed in the smoke produced by the burning disinfectant.  Its purpose was to inhibit the spread of the virulent epidemic then decimating [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and its environs.  Although the government ordered such devices installed outside all government buildings, they were often ignored by the populace.&lt;ref&gt;"The Plague at Constantinople", ''[[The Knickerbocker|The Knickerbocker, or New-York Monthly Magazine]]'', Vol. XXIII, No. 6, June 1844 (Kindle edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curative use==
Another version was designed by Dr. Gales, an [[apothecary]] at the [[Hôpital Saint-Louis|Hospital St. Louis]] in Paris, in 1812 or shortly thereafter. It had the naked subject seated on a chair in a wooden box, with the patient's entire head exposed through an opening at the box's top. The opening around the patient's neck was sealed so fumes could not escape. There were three chambers at the bottom of this box, the top one containing [[sulfur]] which was heated by a fire in a chamber below. A bottom chamber caught the ashes.  The sulfurous fumes rose through many small holes drilled through the floor of the patient compartment. If necessary, fumes could be applied directly to the head or face by means of a flexible hose attached to the main compartment. The purpose of this type of fumigatory box was curative or palliative rather than prophylactic, used as a treatment for ailments including [[rheumatism]] and [[psoriasis]], not to prevent the spread of disease.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Gunn.

==Botanical use==
A third type of fumigatory box was described at the turn of the 20th century as being used to fumigate imported plants on their arrival in Jamaica, to prevent the importation of plant diseases or pests. Plants were placed in the box for one hour and one vial of [[cyanide]] was released per 300 cubic feet (8.5 cubic meters) of space inside the fumigatory box. For delicate plants, one half the dose for one half-hour was recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VJIxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22fumigatory+box%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5hL6WE8J5U&amp;sig=bNxR_i4aKFq6mXSTNiHFkxQwbAE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjtuju4-jLAhUmmoMKHSkOAekQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fumigatory%20box%22&amp;f=false ''Bulletin of the Botanical Department, Jamaica''], Vol. IX, Jan.-Feb. 1902, William Fawcett, ed., p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Similar devices, often called fumigation chambers, are still sometimes used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3551">'''Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Online Network''' ('''GIDEON''') is a web-based program for decision support and [[Health informatics|informatics]] in the fields of [[disease|Infectious Diseases]] and [[Geographic Medicine]].  As of 2005, more than 300 generic infectious diseases occur haphazardly in time and space and are challenged by over 250 drugs and vaccines. 1,500 species of pathogenic [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[parasitism|parasites]] and [[fungi]] have been described. Printed media can no longer follow the dynamics of diseases, outbreaks and epidemics in "real time".

==Organization==

GIDEON consists of four modules.  The first [[Diagnosis]] module generates a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] ranked differential diagnosis based on signs, symptoms, laboratory tests, country of origin and incubation period – and can be used for diagnosis support and simulation of all infectious diseases in all countries. Since the program is web-based, this module can also be adapted to disease and [[bioterror]] surveillance.

The second module follows the [[epidemiology]] of individual diseases, including their global background and status in each of 205 countries and regions. All past and current outbreaks of all diseases, in all countries, are described in detail. The user may also access a list of diseases compatible with any combination of agent, vector, vehicle, reservoir and country (for example, one could list all the mosquito-borne flaviviruses of Brazil which have an avian reservoir). Over 30,000 graphs display all the data, and are updated in "real time". These graphs can be used for preparation of PowerPoint displays, pamphlets, lecture notes, etc. Several thousand high-quality images are also available, including clinical [[lesions]], [[roentgenograms]], [[Photomicrograph]]s and disease [[biological life cycle|life cycles]].

The third module is an interactive encyclopedia which incorporates the [[pharmacology]], usage, testing standards and global trade names of all antiinfective drugs and vaccines.

The fourth module is designed to identify or characterize all species of bacteria, [[mycobacteria]] and yeasts. The database includes 50 to 100 [[taxa]] which may not appear in standard texts and laboratory databases for several months.

Additional options allow users to add data (in their own font / language) relevant to their own institution, electronic patient charts, material from the internet, important telephone numbers, drug prices, antimicrobial resistance patterns, etc. This form of custom data is particularly useful when running GIDEON on institutional networks. The data in GIDEON are derived from:

*all peer-reviewed journals in the fields of Infectious Diseases, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Tropical Medicine, Travel Medicine, Antimicrobial Pharmacology and Clinical Microbiology
*a monthly electronic literature search based on all relevant keywords
*all available health ministry reports (both printed and electronic)
*standard texts
*abstracts of major meetings

'''Hamlagrøvatnet''' is a [[lake]] on the border of the municipalities of [[Voss]] and [[Kvam]] in [[Hordaland]] county, [[Norway]].  The {{convert|10.3|km2|adj=on}} lake is the largest lake in all of Hordaland county.  The lake is located about {{convert|17|km}} southeast of the village of [[Dalekvam]] and about {{convert|10|km}} south of the village of [[Evanger (village)|Evanger]].

The lake sits at the eastern end of the [[Bergsdalen]] valley and it is regulated at elevation of {{convert|588|to|560|m}} above sea level.  The lake is a reservoir on the river Bergsdalselvi which has four [[hydroelectric]] power stations on it.  The lake is surrounded by many [[holiday cottage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hordaland.no/om-hordaland/Fakta-om-Hordaland/|title=Fakta om Hordaland|publisher=Hordaland.no|accessdate=2013-04-04|language=Norwegian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914180434/http://www.hordaland.no/om-hordaland/Fakta-om-Hordaland/|archivedate=2013-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Hamlagr%C3%B8vatnet|title=Hamlagrøvatnet|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==
There are five physicians per 100,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/events/symposiums/2008-aids-iac/concerns/shortage.cfm|title=Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) IAC Satellite|publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières Doctors without borders|accessdate=4 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024200538/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/events/symposiums/2008-aids-iac/concerns/shortage.cfm|archivedate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in [[Maseru]], the main secondary care centre, was closed in 2011 and replaced by a newly built hospital, the [[Queen Mamohato Memorial Hospital]], with 425 beds, constructed on a [[public–private partnership]] basis. This has produced considerably better health outcomes and more advanced medical technologies than were previously available. It has also attracted patients who could have been dealt with in primary care. More than 27,000 inpatients and nearly 350,000 outpatients were treated in 2015. The scheme absorbed an average of 34.8% of the total government recurrent budget for the health sector for 2012-15.  All invasive cardiac care and cancer treatment is referred to public hospitals in [[Bloemfontein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lesotho Health Network Public-Private Partnership (PPP) |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/lesotho/brief/lesotho-health-network-ppp |accessdate=19 November 2018 |publisher=World Bank |date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Lesotho}}
Lesotho is severely afflicted by HIV/AIDS and has one of the highest infection rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html?countryName=Lesotho&amp;countryCode=LT&amp;regionCode=af#LT "The World Factbook"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727024745/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html?countryName=Lesotho&amp;countryCode=LT&amp;regionCode=af#LT#LT |date=27 July 2009 }}. cia.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The rate has hovered around 25 percent since 2005, although recent trends show new infections decreasing. In 2005 there were 30,000 new infections compared to 21,000 new infections in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/lesotho|title=HIV and AIDS in Lesotho|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002003817/https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/lesotho#|archive-date=2 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In urban areas, about 50 percent of women under 40 have HIV. 

The country regards HIV as one of its most important development issues, and the government is addressing the pandemic through its HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan. Coverage of some key HIV/AIDS interventions has improved, including prevention of mother to child transmission and antiretroviral therapy. Prevention of mother to child transmission coverage increased from about 5 percent in 2005, to 31 percent in 2007. The roll-out of antiretroviral therapy has made good progress, with 38,586 people receiving treatment by 2008.&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/LESOTHOEXTN/0,,menuPK:356039~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:356029,00.html |title=World bank Lesotho: Country Brief |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331100012/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/LESOTHOEXTN/0%2C%2CmenuPK%3A356039~pagePK%3A141132~piPK%3A141107~theSitePK%3A356029%2C00.html |archivedate=31 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Know Your Status" campaign boosted the number of people being tested for HIV to 229,092 by the end of 2007, 12 percent of the population and three times the number tested in 2005. The program is funded by the [[Clinton Foundation]] and started in June 2006. [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Microsoft]] chairman [[Bill Gates]] visited Lesotho in July 2006 to assess its fight against AIDS.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times of South Africa"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lesotho praised for fight against Aids |author=Julian Rademeyer |url=http://www.aegis.org/news/suntimes/2006/ST060708.html |newspaper=Sunday Times of South Africa |date=16 July 2006 |accessdate=27 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308032708/http://www.aegis.org/news/suntimes/2006/ST060708.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the annual rate at which adults in the population who are HIV-negative become HIV-positive declined from 2.9 percent in 2005 to 2.3 percent in 2007, lowering the estimated annual number of new infections from 26,000 to 21,560. 
These are the first signs of a decline in the HIV epidemic.&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt;

The Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS is an industry-wide program providing prevention and treatment, including ARVs when these are necessary, for the 46,000 mainly women workers in the Lesotho apparel industry. It was launched in May 2006. The program is helping to combat two of the key drivers of the HIV/AIDS epidemic: poverty and gender inequality. Surveys within the industry by ALAFA show that 43 percent of employees have HIV.&lt;ref name="alafa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alafa.info/Pages/Default.asp |title=Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS (ALAFA) |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225072316/http://www.alafa.info/Pages/Default.asp |archivedate=25 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health visitors''' are professional individuals engaged in [[public health]] work within the domestic setting, predominantly found in countries with state-funded health systems. They are distinct from [[district nurse]]s, who provide clinical healthcare, domestically. 

== Responsibilities ==
Health visitors are mainly concerned with helping to ensure that people's domestic behaviour is [[sanitation|sanitary]], [[hygiene|hygienic]], and beneficial to the welfare of themselves and their families, particularly to their children. As their name suggests, they fulfill their role in the community, by visiting family homes, to give advice and support to all age groups. 

They have a key role with regard to safeguarding vulnerable people, as they are often the first experts to enter the homes of individuals at risk of abuse and neglect, especially children.

A check at two years of age is now a major part of the standard provision. If the health visitor suspects that matters were serious enough to warrant child protection measures, it is their responsibility to initiate the process of intervention. The dual role of advice and inspection has made some families wary of health visitors, despite being appreciative of their potential for assistance.

In addition to their early years work, health visitors have now started to run health promotion schemes such as stop-smoking services, and to deliver certain vaccination programmes.

Many health visitors are represented professionally by the [[Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association]], which is part of [[Unite the Union]]. 

== History ==
At the time the health visiting profession began, living conditions for the urban poor were often cramped and extremely insanitary, leading to many business owners sending women around to workers' homes to educate their wives about sanitation and nutrition. The initial focus of health visiting was on families with young children. Visits would cover topics such as sanitation, feeding, nutrition, care, and support to both infants and parents. Typically there would be regular visits throughout a child's early years, to provide routine child development checks. Issues of hygiene, malnutrition, or disease, would be corrected with suitable advice, and reported to the relevant authorities where appropriate

The role of Health visitors was formalised with the establishment of the ''Ladies Sanitary Reform Association'' in 1862. By 1890 some local councils were paying the salaries of Health Visitors. 

=== Early twentieth century ===
The role of Health Visitors was given greater weight following the [[Notification of Births Acts 1907]] and 1915 and the [[Maternity and Child Welfare Act 1918]] which empowered local authorities to establish maternal and child welfare services and led to the first training courses for health visitors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C93|title=Records of the Council for the Training of Health Visitors, and of the Council for the Education and Training of Health Visitors|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, health visitors began to be employed by local councils on a [[statute|statutory basis]] and since 1974 they have been employed by the [[National Health Service]].

=== Post-war ===
Beginning in 1945, health visitors operating in the UK were required to be Registered Nurses or Midwives who had undertaken further training to work as part of a [[primary health care]] team.

In the 1950s, their interventions were made more extensive to ensure they could provide a cradle-to-grave service, working also with the elderly and chronically ill.

In 1962, the Health Visiting and Social Work (Training) Act established the Council for the Training of Health Visitors (CTHV) and the Council for Training in Social Work (CTSW). The CTHV comprised 31 members of whom 14 were appointed by the Minister of Health. In 1970 the title of the CTHV was changed to the Council for the Education and Training of Health Visitors (CETHV).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Post-1997 ===
Under the [[Blair Ministry]], rising case-loads were considered to be affecting the potential quality of interventions in young families. As a result, their work was refocused back to young families; the reduced intervention in [[elderly care]] has been accompanied by a commensurate rise in admissions of elderly patients to [[Accident and emergency departments|A+E departments]] and care homes.

After [[Sure Start]] was introduced, to provide general early years support to families, the refocusing on young families lead many health visitors to use Sure Start centres as their base. The Healthy Child Programme, published in October 2009, influences the core service available to families, breaking it down into two age groups : firstly the first 5 years, and secondly 5-19 year olds. The latter age group are traditionally dealt with by ''[[School nursing#United Kingdom|school nurses]]'' - a public health nurse embedded within, or frequenting a school - with health visitors handing over responsibility to them, for a child's development and welfare, once the child starts to attend school.

The 2010 [[Coalition Government 2010-2015|Coalition Government]] sought to reverse the move towards reducing the scope of health visitors by giving a commitment to recruit more health visitors, to ensure that their caseloads were not negatively impacted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213759/dh_124208.pdf Health Visitor implementation plan 2011 to 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government's reorganisation of the NHS returned responsibility for public health, at a local level, to local councils once again, with national issues and oversight being provided by [[Public Health England]]. Health visitor services will therefore now be commissioned by local councils, in partnership with [[clinical commissioning groups]].

== Numbers of health visitors ==
In 1977 there were 10,623 health visitors in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-13/|title=Royal Commission on the NHS 1979|website=Socialist Health Association|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 there were 12,292 in England and Wales, an increase from 10,046 in 2000. 

In 2000 there were 297 children under 5 per health visitor, a figure which rose to 419 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitetheunion.org/how-we-help/list-of-sectors/healthsector/healthsectoryourprofession/cphva/cphva---facts-and-figures/|title=#HVFactsandFigures|website=CPHVA|publisher=Unite|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK training==
In the early days of statutory health visiting, training in the UK was overseen by the Royal Sanitory Institute, who later evolved into the Royal Society of Public Health. This was later taken over by the government's [[Ministry of Health]], and they are now regulated by the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]].

Post-qualification, a 1-year full-time (or equivalent part-time) degree or masters level course.

== Sources of further information ==
The [[Journal of Health Visiting]], launched in January 2013, is a monthly peer-reviewed journal for health visitors.

Researchers interested in the history of health visitors may be interested in consulting the [[Wellcome Trust|Welcome Trust's]] ''London's Pulse'' collection, which provides a digital archive of London's [[Medical Officer of Health for London|Medical Officer of Health]] reports, for the period 1848-1972. These reports often referred to the activities of health visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wellcomelibrary.org/moh/|title=London's Pulse: Medical Officer of Health reports 1848-1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal is disseminated internationally and encourages submissions from around the world.

The Journal publishes the following types of manuscripts:

1. Peer-reviewed Original Articles (research studies, systematic/analytical reviews, theoretical papers) that focus on interprofessional education and/or practice, and add to the conceptual, empirical or theoretical knowledge of the interprofessional field.

2. Peer-reviewed Short Reports that describe research plans, studies in progress or recently completed, or an interprofessional innovation.

3. Peer-reviewed Interprofessional Education and Practice (IPEP) Guides that offer practical advice on successfully undertaking various interprofessional activities.

4. Guest Editorials that discuss a salient issue related to interprofessional education and practice.

5. Book and Report Reviews that offer summaries of recently published books and reports (published on the Journal’s Blog - see below).

The Journal was established in 1986 and is published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].

The '''Kayhausen Boy''' is a [[mummy]], naturally preserved in a [[sphagnum]] bog in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany. He is one of the few recorded bog children discovered.

==Discovery and examination==
The body, of a boy believed to have been approximately seven to ten years of age at the time of his death, was found in 1922. The boy is estimated to have died between 300 and 400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/kterms/g/kayhausen.htm Archaeology.about.com]. Archaeology.about.com (4 August 2010). Retrieved on 15 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His arms and feet were bound together with cloth torn from clothing and a fur [[cape]]. Examination concluded that he had been [[stabbed]] three to four centimeters deep, three times in the neck and once on his left arm. It is thought that the wound on the boy's arm had happened when the boy may have raised his arm in an act of [[self-defense]] towards his attacker. A recent examination of the body shows that the weapon used to kill the child was a dagger with a four centimeter blade.&lt;ref name= "Mummies of the World"&gt;Madea, Burkhard, Johanna Preuss, and Frank Musshoff. "From Flourishing Life to Dust-The Natural Cycle." Mummies of the World. Ed. Alfried Wieczorek and Wilfried Rosendahl. First ed. 2010. 28. Print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archaeology.org"&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/bog/violence2.html Archaeology.org]. Archaeology.org. Retrieved on 15 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible reason for the boy's demise is that he had suffered from an infected socket at the top of his [[femur]], and hence would not have been able to walk without assistance. Because of the high incidence of deformities among bog bodies, such as the [[Yde Girl]], [[anthropologist]]s have suggested that the disabled were sacrificed because they were considered to be unfavored by their gods.&lt;ref name="WAC6.org"&gt;[http://www.wac6.org/livesite/precirculated/2800_precirculated.pdf WAC6.org]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy's body is preserved in a formalin solution and is not displayed.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal of LIVERight was not only to raise money for [[outreach]] efforts, but more importantly to educate and increase awareness of this pressing [[public health]] issue. Educational displays, informational booths and of course signs were unique and significant components to the event. The education allowed participants to learn more about hepatitis B prevention and treatment, as well as hear the real stories about the lives lost and won to liver cancer.

==About LIVERight==
The LIVERight concept began at the 2nd annual Youth Leadership Conference on Asian and Pacific Islander Health in 2004, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] funded event organized by the [http://liver.stanford.edu Asian Liver Center] at [[Stanford University]]. High school students were given a Team Challenge to create a campaign/event for raising awareness about hepatitis B, and LIVERight was born. The words "Liver" and "Right" together emphasize the importance of liver health. From this concept, LIVERight bracelets and the LIVERight 5K run/walk emerged.

Adrian Elkins inspired the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University to start LIVERight, a 5K Run/Walk to raise awareness about hepatitis B and liver cancer in the [[Asian-Pacific American|Asian Pacific Islander]] community.

On 30 April 2005 in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]], the Asian Liver Center and the Answer to Cancer Foundation hosted LIVERight.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.sfstation.com/liveright-5k-run-walk-e314741 SF Station]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2006, the 2nd annual LIVERight on the go! was held at Stanford's Sand Hill Fields. The community event had 700 registered participants and 100 volunteers, and raised over $135,000.

LIVERight '09 was held on Saturday, May 2, 2009 at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. Over 400 runners registered and raised over $100,000 to fight liver cancer and hepatitis B.

In November 2010, LIVERight returns to Stanford University with the hottest new dance fitness craze that's taking over the world. Fusing hypnotic Latin rhythms with easy to follow dance moves, Zumba Fitness is a Latin-inspired cardio dance fitness workout. The LIVERight Zumbathon at Stanford will be held on Saturday, November 13, 2010 in partnership with the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University, Answer to Cancer, Be Well @ Stanford and the Stanford Department of Physical Education. Zumba is all about having fun and no experience is necessary. This family-friendly event is open to the public and all of the Stanford community. As in the past, donations benefit the Jade Ribbon Campaign and the fight against liver cancer. Enthusiastic Zumba Fitness Instructors, prizes and games, and two hours of Latin rhythms will keep participants sweating and having fun.

==Answer to Cancer==
The Answer to Cancer (A2C) run was founded by Adrian Elkins, a 20-year-old student at [[Southern Oregon University]] who was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hepb.org/patients/personal_stories_adrian.htm Hepatitis B Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Had he known during his childhood that his ethnicity and chronic hepatitis B infection increased his chance of developing liver cancer by 100%, he would have been regularly monitored for liver damage. He had no idea that hepatitis B&amp;mdash;a disease he contracted at birth in Calcutta, India&amp;mdash;causes 80% of the world's liver cancer cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/ World Health Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian battled his disease for ten months, working tirelessly to organize an event to raise money for liver cancer research. Adrian saw the first-ever A2C run take place on 8 August 2003. Thanks to the generous support of friends, families and numerous companies, the 2003 Answer to Cancer Race was able to raise more than $20,000 for three charities and reach out to more than 240 participants. Adrian died only eight days after this first race.

{{Tort law}}

'''''Landeros v. Flood''''' was a 1976 court case in the state of [[California]] involving child abuse and alleged medical malpractice.

In 1971, Gita Landeros, a minor, was seen in the emergency room by Dr. Flood for injuries inflicted by her mother and the mother's common law husband.   Dr. Flood failed to diagnose "battered child syndrome" and also did not report the injuries to proper civil authorities in violation of California law.  The child was released to the custody of her mother and the mother's common law husband, where she experienced further injury at their hands.  The parents fled the state, but were apprehended and convicted of criminal child abuse.  Gita Landeros brought a civil suit in [[tort]] for damages against Dr. Flood.  The trial court dismissed her case as a matter of law. The case was appealed and decided in 1976 by the California Supreme Court.

==Overview==
GITA LANDEROS,  Appellant, a minor, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which sustained general demurrers and dismissed her medical malpractice action against appellees, a physician and a hospital, for injuries sustained when they failed to properly diagnose and treat the condition from which she was suffering.

Appellant minor argued trial court error in sustaining the demurrer of appellees, doctor and hospital, to her malpractice suit against them, because issues existed as to whether they had a duty to recognize a case of battered child syndrome that was to be reported to authorities, and whether their conduct proximately caused appellant's injuries. The court agreed, noting first that appellant was returned to parental custody after having been treated for injuries not appearing to be accidental, and that she then was traumatically abused. Because it was unclear whether treating physicians should have recognized the syndrome for treatment purposes, appellant was entitled to prove by expert testimony the standard of care against which appellees were to be held. And as appellees could not escape liability if it was foreseeable that appellant would suffer further injury, appellant was entitled to prove that appellees' conduct proximately caused her injuries, even if the parent's intervening act was the actual cause. Finally, appellant was entitled to show that appellees failed to exercise due care in not reporting her injuries to authorities who would have shielded her from further harm.

==Issues==
#Is there a duty for a physician to recognize a case of [[battered child syndrome]] (child abuse) and report it to the appropriate authorities?
#Does medical standard of care dictate recognition of [[child abuse]]?
#Should  the appellant (Landeros) have been allowed to introduce expert testimony concerning standard of care in her malpractice action?
#Was further injury from child abuse foreseeable?
#Did the appellant's actions of allowing Landeros to return to the care of her abusive parents proximately cause her subsequent injuries, even if the parent's intervening actions in harming her were the actual cause of her injuries?
#Did the appellants fail to show due care by not reporting Landeros' injuries to authorities who could have prevented further injury?

==Holdings==
#It is established [[standard of care]] for physicians to suspect, work-up  and diagnose child abuse when such a case presents in the emergency room or physician's office.
#California statutory requirements obligate the physician to report suspected cases of child abuse to the proper civil authorities.  Failure to do so is a violation of law.
#The [[summary dismissal]] of the complaint and allegation that the failure to diagnose child abuse and report it alleging this to be the [[proximate cause]] of the plaintiff's subsequent injuries was [[reversible error]] by the trial court.
#The failure to allow the plaintiff to introduce [[expert testimony]] was reversible error.
#The issue of foreseeability in [[negligence]] cases is a question for the jury under California law, and this applies to the actions of third parties.

==Facts and background==
Plaintiff brought the action by her guardian ad litem against A. J. Flood, a physician, and The San Jose Hospitals &amp; Health Center, Inc. (hereinafter called the San Jose Hospital). The amended complaint purports to allege four "causes of action." of recovery alleged in support of a single cause of action for compensatory damages for personal injuries caused by defendants' negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat the condition from which plaintiff was suffering; the fourth "cause of action" merely adds a claim for punitive damages on allegations that defendants' conduct in this respect was wilful and wanton. Defendants filed general [[demurrer]]s. The court sustained the demurrers as to the first and second "causes of action" with leave to amend, and as to the third and fourth "causes of action" without leave to amend. Plaintiff elected to stand on her complaint as previously amended, and a judgment dismissing the entire action was therefore entered.  On this appeal plaintiff has expressly abandoned her claim of punitive damages.

The material factual allegations of the amended complaint are as follows. Plaintiff was born on May 14, 1970.  On repeated occasions during the first year of her life she was severely beaten by her mother and the latter's common law husband, one Reyes.  On April 26, 1971, when the plaintiff was eleven months old, her mother took her to the San Jose Hospital for examination, diagnosis, and treatment.  The attending physician was defendant Dr. Flood, acting on his own behalf and as agent of the defendant San Jose Hospital.  At the time, the plaintiff was suffering from a comminuted spiral fracture of the right tibia and fibula, which gave the appearance of having been caused by a twisting force.  Plaintiff's mother had no explanation for this injury.  Plaintiff had bruises over her entire body.  In addition, she had a non-depressed linear skull fracture  which was then in the process of healing.  Plaintiff demonstrated fear and apprehension when approached. Inasmuch as all plaintiff's injuries gave the appearance of having been intentionally inflicted by other persons, she exhibited the medical condition known as the battered child syndrome.

[[Image:Tibial Fracture.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Landeros presented to the emergency room with a spiral fracture of the tibia, among other injuries.]]

It is alleged that proper diagnosis of plaintiff's condition would have included taking X-rays of her entire skeletal structure, and that such procedure would have revealed the fracture of her skull. Defendants negligently failed to take such X-rays, and thereby negligently failed to diagnose her true condition. It is further alleged that proper medical treatment of plaintiff's battered child syndrome would have included reporting her injuries to local law enforcement authorities or juvenile probation department. Such a report would have resulted in an investigation by the concerned agencies, followed by a placement of plaintiff in protective custody until her safety was assured. Defendants negligently failed to make such report.

The complaint avers that as a proximate result of the foregoing negligence plaintiff was released from the San Jose Hospital without proper diagnosis and treatment of her [[battered child syndrome]], and was returned to the custody of her mother and Reyes who resumed physically abusing her until she sustained traumatic blows to her right eye and back, puncture wounds over her left lower leg and across her back, severe bites on her face, and second and third degree burns on her left hand.

On July 1, 1971, [[plaintiff]] was again brought in for medical care, but to a different doctor and hospital. Her battered child syndrome was immediately diagnosed and reported to local police and juvenile probation authorities, and she was taken into [[protective custody]]. Following hospitalization and surgery she was placed with foster parents, and the latter subsequently undertook proceedings to adopt her. Plaintiff's mother and Reyes fled the state, but were apprehended, returned for trial, and convicted of the crime of child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Pen. Code, § 273a.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to damages the complaint alleges that as a proximate result of defendants' negligence plaintiff suffered painful permanent physical injuries and great mental distress, including the probable loss of use or amputation of her left hand.

The second and third "causes of action" are predicated on defendants' failure to comply with three related sections of the Penal Code. Section 11160 provides in relevant part that every hospital to which any person is brought who is suffering from any injuries inflicted "in violation of any penal law of this State" must report that fact immediately, by telephone and in writing, to the local law enforcement authorities. Section 11161 imposes the identical duty on every physician who has under his care any person suffering from any such injuries. Section 11161.5 deals specifically with child abuse, and declares in pertinent part that in any case in which a minor is under a physician's care or is brought to him for diagnosis, examination or treatment, and "it appears to the physician" from observation of the minor that the latter has any physical injuries "which appear to have been inflicted upon him by other than accidental means by any person," he must report that fact by telephone and in writing to the local law enforcement authorities and the juvenile probation department.  All three sections require the report to state the name of the victim, if known, together with his whereabouts and the character and extent of his injuries; and a violation of any of the sections is a misdemeanor (§ 11162).

Among such laws are the statutes penalizing child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Pen. Code, § 273a, 273d&lt;/ref&gt;
The statute imposes the same duty on certain other health care professionals, school officials and teachers, child care supervisors, and social workers.

The trial court did not allow Gita Landeros to present [[expert testimony]] supporting her allegations of negligence against Dr. Flood.  The trial court also dismissed the complaint of Gita Landeros as a matter of law.  The decision is appealed to the [[California Supreme Court]].

==Opinion==
Opinion written by Chief Judge Mosk:  By means of allegations phrased largely in the statutory language plaintiff undertakes to charge defendants with a duty to comply with section 11161.5 (second "cause of action") and sections 11160 and 11161 (third "cause of action"), and avers that they failed to make the reports thus required by law. Her allegations of proximate cause and damages on these counts are essentially identical to those of the first count.

We have found no case directly in point, but the issues may be decided by reference to well settled principles. Succinctly stated, the rules governing our consideration of this appeal are "that a general demurrer admits the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint [citation]; that the question of plaintiff's ability to prove these allegations, or the possible difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court [citations here omitted]; and that plaintiff need only plead facts showing that [may be shown to be relevant during the trial.]

The [[standard of care]] in [[malpractice]] cases is also well known. With unimportant variations in phrasing, we have consistently held that a physician is required to possess and exercise, in both diagnosis and treatment, etc.  In this medical malpractice action plaintiff Gita Landeros, a minor, appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered upon an order sustaining general demurrers to her amended complaint. As will appear, we have concluded that the complaint states a cause of action and hence that the judgment must be reversed.

Plaintiff brought the action by her [[guardian ad litem]] against A. J. Flood, a physician, and The San Jose Hospitals &amp; Health Center, Inc. (hereinafter called the San Jose Hospital). The amended complaint purports to allege four "causes of action." of recovery alleged in support of a single cause of action for compensatory damages for personal injuries caused by defendants' negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat the condition from which plaintiff was suffering; the fourth "[[cause of action]]" merely adds a claim for [[punitive damages]] on allegations that defendants' conduct in this respect was wilful and wanton. Defendants filed general demurrers. The court sustained the demurrers as to the first and second "causes of action" with leave to amend, and as to the third and fourth "causes of action" without leave to amend. Plaintiff elected to stand on her complaint as previously amended, and a judgment dismissing the entire action was therefore entered.

On this appeal plaintiff has expressly abandoned her claim of [[punitive damages]].  It is alleged that proper diagnosis of plaintiff's condition would have included taking X-rays of her entire skeletal structure, and that such procedure would have revealed the fracture of her skull. Defendants negligently failed to take such X-rays, and thereby negligently failed to diagnose her true condition. It is further alleged that proper medical treatment of plaintiff's battered child syndrome would have included reporting her injuries to local law enforcement authorities or juvenile probation department. Such a report would have resulted in an investigation by the concerned agencies, followed by a placement of plaintiff in protective custody until her safety was assured. Defendants negligently failed to make such report.
The complaint avers that as a proximate result of the foregoing negligence plaintiff was released from the San Jose Hospital without proper diagnosis and treatment of her battered child syndrome, and was returned to the custody of her mother and Reyes who resumed physically abusing her until she sustained traumatic blows to her right eye and back, puncture wounds over her left lower leg and across her back, severe bites on her face, and second and third degree burns on her left hand.

On July 1, 1971, plaintiff was again brought in for medical care, but to a different doctor and hospital. Her battered child syndrome was immediately diagnosed and reported to local police and juvenile probation authorities, and she was taken into protective custody. Following hospitalization and surgery she was placed with foster parents, and the latter subsequently undertook proceedings to adopt her. Plaintiff's mother and Reyes fled the state, but were apprehended, returned for trial, and convicted of the crime of child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Pen. Code, § 273a.&lt;/ref&gt;

We have found no case directly in point, but the issues may be decided by reference to well settled principles. Succinctly stated, the rules governing our consideration of this appeal are "that a general demurrer admits the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint; that the question of plaintiff's ability to prove these allegations, or the possible difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court; and that plaintiff need only plead facts showing that he may be.

The standard of care in malpractice cases is also well known. With unimportant variations in phrasing, we have consistently held that a physician is required to possess and exercise, in both diagnosis and treatment. The first question presented, accordingly, is whether the foregoing standard of care includes a requirement that the physician know how to diagnose and treat the battered child syndrome.

It appears from the literature that the battered child syndrome was first tentatively identified and reported to the medical profession in the early 1950s. Further surveys and analyses of the syndrome followed, culminating in a landmark article published in 1962 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;ref&gt;Kempe et al., The [[Battered-Child Syndrome]] (1962) 181 A.M.A.J. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that date numerous additional studies of the condition have been undertaken, and their results and recommendations publicized in the medical journals.  A typical article in the field recites case histories of child abuse, points out the distinguishing signs and symptoms of the battered child syndrome, and advises the practicing physician how to detect and treat the condition. For a detailed survey of the medical literature on the topic from its beginning until 1965,&lt;ref&gt;McCoid, The Battered Child and Other Assaults Upon the Family: Part One (1965) 50 Minn.L.Rev. 1, 3-19&lt;/ref&gt;  A selection of the later articles is cited in Grumet, The Plaintive Plaintiffs: Victims of the Battered Child Syndrome &lt;ref&gt;(1970) 4 Family L.Q. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

While helpful, the foregoing general history of the battered child syndrome is not conclusive on the precise question in the case at bar. The question is whether a reasonably prudent physician examining this plaintiff in 1971 would have been led to suspect she was a victim of the battered child syndrome from the particular injuries and circumstances presented to him, would have confirmed that diagnosis by ordering X-rays of her entire skeleton, and would have promptly reported his findings to appropriate authorities to prevent a recurrence of the injuries. There are numerous recommendations to follow each of these diagnostic and treatment procedures in the medical literature cited above.

For example, the leading article by Kempe et al., op. cit., supra,&lt;ref&gt;181 A.M.A.J. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  states that "A physician needs to have a high initial level of suspicion of the diagnosis of the battered-child syndrome in instances of subdural hematoma, multiple unexplained fractures at different stages of healing, failure to thrive, when soft tissue swelling or skin bruising are present, or in any other situation where the degree and type of injury is at variance with the history given regarding its occurrence . . . ." (Id., at p.&amp;nbsp;20.) Of the different types of fractures exhibited, an arm or leg fracture caused by a twisting force is particularly significant because "The extremities are the 'handles' for rough handling" of the child by adults. (Id., at p.&amp;nbsp;22.) The article also contains numerous recommendations to conduct a "radiologic examination of the entire skeleton" for the purpose of confirming the diagnosis, explaining that "To the informed physician, the bones tell a story the child is too young or too frightened to tell." (Id., at p.&amp;nbsp;18.) Finally, on the subject of management of the case it is repeatedly emphasized that the physician "should report possible willful trauma to the police department or any special children's protective service that operates in his community" (id., at p.&amp;nbsp;23) in order to forestall further injury to the child: "All too often, despite the apparent cooperativeness of the parents and their apparent desire to have the child with them, the child returns to his home only to be assaulted again and suffer permanent brain damage or death." (Id., at p.&amp;nbsp;24.)

Inasmuch as the "common knowledge" exception to the foregoing rule does not apply on the facts here alleged, the trial court could not properly conclude as a matter of law that defendants' standard of professional care did not include the diagnostic and treatment procedures outlined in the complaint. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to the opportunity to prove by way of expert testimony that in the circumstances of this case a reasonably prudent physician would have followed those procedures.  Whether the physician would have followed the procedure of reporting plaintiff's injuries to the authorities, however, is not solely a question of good medical practice. The above-cited reporting statutes (Pen. Code, § 11160- 11161.5) were in force in 1971. They evidence a determination by the Legislature that in the event a physician does diagnose a battered child syndrome, due care includes a duty to report that fact to the authorities. In other words, since the enactment of these statutes a physician who diagnoses a battered child syndrome will not be heard to say that other members of his profession would not have made such a report. The same is true of each of the persons and entities covered by this legislation. Accordingly, although expert testimony on the issue of a duty to report is admissible, it is not mandatory.

The statute also lays to rest defendant Flood's concern that if he were required to report his findings to the authorities he might be held liable for violation of the physician-patient privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Evid. Code, § 992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 11161.5 specifically exempts the physician from any civil or criminal liability for making a report pursuant to its terms.

[[Image:Multiple Rib Fractures.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Multiple rib fractures in an infant. Red are old and healed.  Green are newer.]]

Defendants complain that the first "[[cause of action]]" is nevertheless fatally defective because it assertedly fails to allege certain specific facts, i.e., that Dr. Flood negligently treated plaintiff's leg fracture, that proper treatment of that fracture or the bruises on plaintiff's back included taking an X-ray of her skull, and that Dr. Flood negligently failed to ask plaintiff's mother for an explanation of the cause of the fracture. None of these allegations is necessary, however, because they are irrelevant to the gist of the complaint. Plaintiff's theory is that in the circumstances of this case the fracture, the bruises, and the lack of an explanation offered by her mother are themselves indicia of the underlying battered child syndrome of which plaintiff was the victim, and it was that condition which defendants negligently failed to diagnose and treat. For the reasons stated, the complaint adequately alleges the facts necessary to support such a theory. A third person may act in a particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby." &lt;ref&gt;See Vesely v. Sager, supra, at p. 164 of 5 Cal.3d, and cases cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

As we recently observed with respect to a determination of duty, however, "foreseeability is a [[question of fact]] for the jury." &lt;ref&gt;Weirum v. RKO General, Inc. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 40, 46 [123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539 P.2d 36]&lt;/ref&gt;  The same rule applies when the issue is whether the intervening act of a third person was foreseeable and therefore did not constitute a superseding cause: in such circumstances "The foreseeability of the risk generally frames a question for the trier of fact" &lt;ref&gt;Weaver v. Bank of America (1963) 59 Cal.2d 428, 434 [30 Cal.Rptr. 4, 380 P.2d 644]; accord, Rest.2d Torts, § 453, com. b)&lt;/ref&gt;  Restatement the fact that the risk eventuates does not relieve him of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kempe et al., The Battered-Child Syndrome (1962) 181 A.M.A.J. 17, 24, quoted in footnote 7, ante;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, A Project to Rescue Children from Inflicted Injuries (1962) 7 Soc. Work 43, 49 ("Experiences with the repetitive nature of injuries indicate that an adult who has once injured a child is likely to repeat. . . . [The] child must be considered to be in grave danger unless his environment can be proved to be safe")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fontana et al., The "Maltreatment Syndrome" in Children (1963) 269 New England J. Med. 1389, 1393 ("over 50 per cent of these children are liable to secondary injuries or death if appropriate steps are not taken to remove them from their environment")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, The Need for Intensive Follow-Up of Abused Children, in Helping the Battered Child and his Family (Kempe &amp; Helfer eds. 1972) chapter 6, page 79 ("it would appear from our investigations that the severe permanent damage associated with the 'battered child syndrome' usually does not occur with the initial incident.  Identification of abuse at this time thus offers an opportunity for intervention with the goal of preventing subsequent trauma and irreversible injury to the child").&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the trial court in the case at bar could not properly rule as a matter of law that the defendants' negligence was not the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. Plaintiff is entitled to prove by expert testimony that defendants should reasonably have foreseen that her caretakers were likely to resume their physical abuse and inflict further injuries on her if she were returned directly to their custody.  Again defendant Flood presses only a technical point of pleading, claiming the allegation of proximate cause is fatally defective because the foreseeability of the intervening conduct of plaintiff's mother and Reyes is not specifically set forth. It is asserted that under the case law such an allegation is mandatory if the foreseeability of the intervening act does not clearly appear from the pleaded facts of negligence and injury.&lt;ref&gt;(See, e.g., Frace v. Long Beach etc. Sch. Dist. (1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 566 [137 P.2d 60].)&lt;/ref&gt;  As shown above, however, here the occurrence of the intervening act is the precise hazard to which defendants' conduct is alleged to have negligently exposed plaintiff, and the injuries pleaded are those which a reasonably prudent physician would have foreseen as likely to ensue from that negligence. In these circumstances "The allegations of the complaint are sufficient to present the issue" of proximate cause.&lt;ref&gt;Custodio v. Bauer (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 303, 316-317 [59 Cal.Rptr. 463, 27 A.L.R.3d 884].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to our duty to liberally construe pleadings with a view to achieving substantial justice &lt;ref&gt;(Code Civ. Proc., § 452)&lt;/ref&gt;  we therefore treat the second and third "causes of action" as alternative counts setting forth plaintiff's theory of statutory liability. The purpose of that theory is manifestly to raise a presumption that by omitting to report plaintiff's injuries to the authorities as required by law, defendants failed to exercise due care—a presumption now codified in Evidence Code section 669. Defendant Flood correctly concedes that the complaint alleges facts showing compliance with the first, third and fourth of the conditions specified of rebutting that presumption.

Insofar as relevant here, section 669 provides:
"(a) The failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if:
"(1) He violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity;
"(2) The violation proximately caused death or injury to person or property;
"(3) The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the nature which the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to prevent; and
"(4) The person suffering the death or the injury to his person or property was one of the class of persons for whose protection the statute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.
"(b) This presumption may be rebutted by proof that:
"(1) The person violating the statute, ordinance, or regulation did what might reasonably be expected of a person of ordinary prudence, acting under similar circumstances, who desired to comply with the law; . . ."
A number of recent commentators support this theory of liability.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Isaacson, Child Abuse Reporting Statutes: The Case for Holding Physicians Civilly Liable for Failing to Report (1975) 12 San Diego L.Rev. 743, 756-762&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey &amp; Lawler, The Battered Child Syndrome (1974) 1 Pepperdine L.Rev. 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, A Pragmatic Alternative to Current Legislative Approaches to Child Abuse (1974) 12 Am.Crim.L.Rev. 103, 115 &amp; fn. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulsen, Child Abuse Reporting Laws: The Shape of the Legislation (1967) 67 Colum.L.Rev. 1, 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for a published recommendation to the same effect by one of plaintiff's counsel in the case at bar, see Kohlman, Malpractice Liability for Failing to Report Child Abuse (1974) 49 State Bar J. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, defendants raise two questions of statutory interpretation. They contend that even if plaintiff may rely on Penal Code section 11161.5 in this case, she cannot invoke sections 11160 and 11161 because the latter are "general" statutes which have assertedly been superseded by the former as a "special" statute on the same topic. But such supersession occurs only when the provisions are "inconsistent" &lt;ref&gt;Code Civ. Proc., § 1859&lt;/ref&gt;  which is not here the case. Sections 11160 and 11161.5 are directed to different classes of persons, and hence are not inconsistent but complementary. Sections 11161 and 11161.5, on the other hand, are duplicative of each other to the extent that the former deals with physical injuries unlawfully inflicted on minors and the latter deals with the observation of such injuries by a physician.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Note, The California Legislative Approach to Problems of Willful Child Abuse (1966) 54 Cal.L.Rev. 1805, 1814-1815&lt;/ref&gt;  But inasmuch as the same penalty is provided for a violation of each section &lt;ref&gt;Pen. Code, § 11162&lt;/ref&gt;  they do not present an irreconcilable conflict requiring one to give way to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Compare People v. Gilbert (1969)   and cases cited.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is nothing to prevent the Legislature from imposing a reporting requirement on physicians in two separate statutes, even if their coverage apparently overlaps.

Defendants next contend that plaintiff can rely on section 11161.5 only if she can prove that Dr. Flood in fact observed her various injuries and in fact formed the opinion they were caused by other than accidental means and by another person—in other words, that his failure to comply with the reporting requirement of the statute was intentional rather than negligent. We first note that the complaint in effect so alleges, thereby mooting the issue at this pleading stage. For the guidance of the court at the trial, however, we briefly address the point of proof. The provision of section 11161.5 is ambiguous with respect to the required state of mind of the physician. It has been suggested that for the purposes of a criminal prosecution "the more reasonable interpretation of the statutory language is that no physician can be convicted unless it is shown that it actually appeared to him that the injuries were inflicted injuries and formed the opinion they were intentionally inflicted on her.

By parity of reasoning, the same rule will apply if plaintiff elects to rely at trial on sections 11160 and 11161 as well.
This does not mean, of course, that plaintiff can meet her burden only by extracting damaging admissions from defendant Flood. "The knowledge a person may have when material to an issue in a judicial proceeding is a fact to be proven as any other fact. It differs from physical objects and phenomena in that it is a state of mind like belief or consciousness and cannot be seen, heard or otherwise directly observed by other persons. It may be evidenced by the affirmative statement or admission of the possessor of it. If he is silent or says he did not have such knowledge, it may be evidenced in other ways," i.e., by circumstantial evidence and the inferences which the trier of fact may draw therefrom.&lt;ref&gt;Oil Workers Intl. Union v. Superior Court (1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 512, 532-533 [230 P.2d 71]&lt;/ref&gt;  Plaintiff will therefore be entitled to introduce proof of facts alleged in her complaint as circumstantial evidence that defendant Flood possessed the requisite state of mind, and any conflict between such evidence and direct testimony of defendant Flood will be for the trier of fact to resolve.

The judgment is reversed.

Judges Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Sullivan, J., Clark, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.

==Discussion==
A diagnosis of battered child syndrome essentially means that serious injuries inflicted on a child were done by another person, by other than accidental means, and it had become an accepted medical diagnosis by the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;2 Am Jur Proof of Facts 2d 365, "Child Abuse - The Battered Child Syndrome."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;97 ALR 3d 338&lt;/ref&gt;   Many states have enacted penal statutes prohibiting child abuse, and many have enacted statutes of a general nature, or specifically applicable to cases of child abuse, imposing reporting requirements on physicians, and others in a professional position to recognize abuse.&lt;ref&gt;2 Am Jur Proof of Facts 2d 365, section 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fractured ribs.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Fractured ribs in various stages of healing, typically seen from squeezing injury. Red shows old healed fractures.  Green is newer fracture.]]

The decision in Landeros v. Flood was the first time that a cause of action was established to exist in favor of a battered child against a physician who negligently failed to diagnose the battered child syndrome or to comply with an applicable reporting statute.  Such failure was found to be the cause of further similar injury to the child.  The causal chain was not broken by the fact that the subsequent injury was inflicted by the same third persons, namely the child's mother and her common-law husband who were responsible for the original injuries.&lt;ref&gt;97 ALR 3d 339&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that no physician could be convicted for failure to make the necessary reports to the civil authorities as required by California statute, unless it was shown that it actually appeared to him that the injuries were inflicted on the child, so that his failure to report was intentional and not merely negligent.  If the child wished to satisfy the requirements of the statute, it would be necessary to persuade the trier of fact that the physician actually observed her injuries and formed the requisite opinion that they were intentionally inflicted on her.  The court also held that even if the trial court found the child experienced further beatings at the hands of her mother and the latter's husband, it constituted an "intervening act" and not a "superseding cause", thereby relieving the defendants of liability.  This was predicated on the finding (at the trial court level) that the foreseeability arose directly from the risk created by the original negligence.  This would be the risk created by the original failure of the physician to diagnose and report the injuries.  This was a question of fact for the jury, and could not be dismissed by the trial court as a matter of law.&lt;ref&gt;97 ALR 3d 339-340&lt;/ref&gt;

Child abuse, or battered child syndrome was first reported in the medical literature in 1946 by Caffey.&lt;ref&gt;Caffey, 56 Am J Roentgen 163, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;   By the 1960s, the medical literature was rife with reports and discussions of both the syndrome, and the need for health care professionals to report it when diagnosed or suspected.&lt;ref&gt;Adelson, 264 New England J Med 1345, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bain, 31 Pediatrics 895, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakwin 49 J Pediat. 7, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barmeyer, Alderson and Cox, 38 J.

Similarly, there was copious discussion of the problem of child abuse in the sociological literature of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Felder, "A Lawyer's View of Child Abuse," 29 Pub Welfare, 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, "A Registry on Child Abuse," 13 Children 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, et al, "Toward Prevention of Child Abuse," 11 Children 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulsen, 'Legal Protections Against Child Abuse," 13 Children, 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, "Role of the Police in the Protection of Children from Neglect and Abuse," 25 Fed Prob 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, "The Abused Parent of the Abused Child," 14 Children 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.

It became apparent that before social and legal institutions can improve the home environment of a physically abused child, or remove the child from the harmful environment where necessary, the child must be identified.  It is generally recognized that the physician is the primary means of identifying the abused child.&lt;ref&gt;Kempe et al ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite existing legislation requiring, as a matter of law, the reporting of suspicious cases, many physicians remained reluctant to report cases to civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Paulsen 67 Colum L Rev 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note, 18 U Fla L Rev 507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note, 7 Colum J L &amp; Soc Prob 55&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians reluctance to report has been traced to these factors :&lt;ref&gt;2 Proof of Facts 2d, section 6, pp. 393 et seq&lt;/ref&gt;

#The lack of standard definition, especially in the reporting statutes, as to what constitutes child abuse.
#Uncertainty that the diagnosis of "battered child syndrome" is correct or appropriate in individual cases.

#Fear that reporting will cause parents not to bring injured children for medical attention.
#Fear of criminal or civil penalties for incorrect diagnoses.
#General eschewing of legal and social welfare agencies.
#Lack of knowledge of procedures involved with reporting.

Landeros v. Flood was a landmark case in which [[tort]] law was used to purposely change the behavior of physicians and encourage them to report suspected child abuse.  Otherwise, they would face the threat of civil action for damages in tort proximately flowing from the failure to report the suspected injuries.

'''Marcos Aguinis''' (born 13 January 1935) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer. Trained in medical studies, music and psychoanalysis, his work and his thoughts are focused on the notions of independence, democracy and rejection of authoritarianism. He is a proponent of political liberalism, and participates in seminars and conferences from the Freedom Foundation organized by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]].

== Background ==
Aguinis was born in Cruz del Eje, [[Córdoba, Argentina]] on January 13, 1935. He is an author with extensive international training in literature, neurosurgery, psychoanalysis, the arts and history. “I have traveled the world, but I have also traveled across different professions.”  The son of Jewish immigrants, he was seven years old when the news came that the Nazis had killed his grandfather and the rest of his family that had remained in Europe. He describes this as the foundational moment of his life, and one that ultimately drove him to write in an effort to close that wound, to repair the “broken mechanism of humanity”.

He published his first book in 1963, and since then he has written fourteen novels, seventeen essay collections, four short story collections, and two biographies. Most of them have become bestsellers and have generated enthusiasm and controversy. Mr. Aguinis was the first author outside of Spain to receive the prestigious Planeta Award for his book “La Cruz Invertida” and his bestselling novel “[[Against the Inquisition (La Gesta del Marrano)]]” has been translated to several languages and praised by Nobel Prize Laureate [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] as a “stirring song of freedom”.  He has written articles on a wide variety of topics for Latin American, U.S. and European newspapers and magazines.  Marcos Aguinis has given hundreds of lectures and seminars at educational, artistic, scientific and political organizations in Germany, Spain, the U.S., Israel, Russia, Italy and practically every Latin American country.

When democracy was reinstated in Argentina in December 1983, Marcos Aguinis was designated Vice-secretary and, eventually, Secretary of Culture; in this capacity, he sponsored the renowned “cultural renaissance” that inspired the country at the time. He created the National Program for Democratization of Culture (PRONDEC), sponsored by [[UNESCO]] and the United Nations. Mr. Aguinis promoted strong actions towards participation activities aimed at raising individual awareness of the rights, duties and potentialities that a true democracy fosters. His work was recognized with two nominations for the [[UNESCO]] Education for Peace Award.

In the field of human rights, he risked his life by courageously addressing controversial issues. During the last dictatorship, the circulation of his books was restricted, but some of them were successfully smuggled. Many of his readers admire his prophetic vision of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the internal struggles within the Catholic Church, the authoritarian political trends, and the resurgence of ethnic and religious fundamentalism.

Marcos Aguinis, has received, among others, the [[Premio Planeta]] (Spain),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.premioplaneta.es/edicion/ganador1970.html&lt;/ref&gt; Fernando Jeno Award (Mexico), Meritorious Award for Culture of the Academy of Arts and Communication Sciences, National Award for Sociology, Hispanic Literature and Culture Institute of California Award (USA), National Book Award, Argentina Society of Writers Honor Award, Pranavananda Swami Award, the Annual Silver Plaque [[EFE Agency]]  for his contribution to the strengthening of Latin American culture and language, Esteban Echeverría Award (Free People), J. Award B. Alberdi ([[Hispanic American Center for Economic Research]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hacer.org/alberdi6.php&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed by France [[Chevalier of Arts and Letters]]. He was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of [[Tel Aviv University]] (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://embajada-israel.es/site/es/politica_ola2_6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304212802/http://embajada-israel.es/site/es/politica_ola2_6 |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huji.org.ar/aguinis_pres_senkman.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426084456/http://www.huji.org.ar/aguinis_pres_senkman.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was named a Distinguished Writer in Residence at the American University in Washington, D.C. and Public Policy Scholar by the Wilson Center (Washington, USA). In 1995 Argentina's Writers Society conferred on him the Grand Prize of Honor for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creadoresargentinos.com/literatura/sade.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426084443/http://www.creadoresargentinos.com/literatura/sade.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Martha Nibley was born in [[Provo, Utah]], in 1962, the seventh of eight children of [[Hugh Nibley]] and Phyllis Nibley, and raised LDS in a prominent Utah family. Her father was a professor at Brigham Young University. She received a  [[bachelor of arts|BA]] degree in [[East Asian studies]], along with an [[Master's degree|MA]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[sociology]] from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Leaving"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-307-33599-9|publisher=Three Rivers Press|title=Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith|year=2006|last=Beck|first=Martha N}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2013}}

===Career===
During her academic career, Beck worked as a research associate at [[Harvard Business School]], studying career paths and life-course changes. Before becoming a life coach, she taught sociology, [[social psychology]], [[organizational behavior]], and [[business management]] at Harvard and the [[American Graduate School of International Management]]. She has published academic books and articles on a variety of social science and business topics.Her non-academic books include the ''New York Times'' bestsellers ''Expecting Adam'' and ''Leaving the Saints'', as well as ''Finding Your Own North Star: Claiming the Life You Were Meant to Live'', ''Steering by Starlight'', and ''Finding Your Way in a Wild New World: Reclaiming Your True Nature''.

Beck has also been a contributing editor for popular magazines, including ''[[Real Simple]]'' and ''[[Redbook]]'', and has been a columnist for ''O, the Oprah Magazine'' since July 2001. Her latest book, ''The Martha Beck Collection: Essays on Creating Your Right Life, Volume 1'', includes essays from her ''O, the Oprah Magazine'' column. Beck is president of Martha Beck, Inc., which offers a life coach training and certification program based on Beck's books and experience for individuals looking to acquire life coaching skills and tools. In addition to life coach training, Martha Beck, Inc., offers live events, products, and resources related to life coaching strategies.

===Personal life===
Beck met John Christen Beck, a fellow Mormon from [[Utah]], during her undergraduate studies at Harvard.  They married in the LDS [[Salt Lake Temple]] on June 21, 1983, in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and they eventually had three children together.&lt;ref name="Divorce"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Martha Nibley Beck v. John Christen Beck|vol=FC 2003-006435|reporter=SUPERIOR COURT OF ARIZONA MARICOPA COUNTY|date=2003|url=http://www.courtminutes.maricopa.gov/docs/Family%20Court/112004/m1601998.pdf|accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the birth of their second child, Adam, who had been diagnosed with [[Down Syndrome]] prior to his birth, Beck returned with her husband and children to Utah to be closer to family and support. ''Expecting Adam: A True Story of Birth, Rebirth and Everyday Magic'' is Beck's story about her decision to give birth to and raise Adam.&lt;ref name="Adam"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expecting Adam|last=Beck|first=Martha N|publisher=Platkus Books|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7499-2190-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, soon after the birth of her third child, Beck, as a part-time faculty member at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) in Provo, Utah, taught a course on the sociology of gender in the Department of Social Science. During her time as part-time faculty member at BYU, five faculty members were excommunicated from the [[LDS Church]] as a consequence of public writings that were deemed critical of the church; the group became known as the [[September Six]]. She and husband John Beck also made critical public statements about both the excommunications and other church and BYU matters, which led to first John, then Martha herself, leaving the LDS Church in 1993.&lt;ref name="Leaving"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= MORMON INQUISITION?

Since leaving the LDS Church, both Martha Beck and her now ex-husband subsequently came out publicly as [[gay]]. In 2003, Beck separated from her husband, divorcing him in 2004.&lt;ref name="Divorce"/&gt;  She now lives with her partner Karen Gerdes, a social worker and professor, and her son, Adam, on her North Star Ranch in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://marthabeck.com/bio/|title = Bio - Martha Beck|website = Martha Beck|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===''Breaking the Cycle of Compulsive Behavior''===
Beck's first book, coauthored with her husband, John Beck, ''Breaking the Cycle of Compulsive Behavior,'' treated homosexuality as one of several "compulsive behaviors," like bulimia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Breaking the Cycle of Compulsive Behavior|last=Beck|first=Martha Nibley|author2=Beck, John C|year=1990|publisher=Deseret Book Company|isbn=978-0-87579-290-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wyatt"/&gt; However, both Martha Beck and her now-ex-husband subsequently came out publicly as [[gay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Beck |first=Martha |url= http://www.leavingthesaints.com/whatnext.html |title= Discussions with Martha Beck: What Comes Next |website=Leaving the Saints Book Website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050702010439/http://www.leavingthesaints.com/whatnext.html | archive-date=2 July 2005 |dead-url=yes |accessdate= 7 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have stated that they no longer consider homosexuality a form of compulsive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.affirmation.org/news/2005_08.shtml |title= LDS Couple Who Dubbed Homosexuality "Addiction" Come Out |date= 27 February 2005 |last= Clark |first= Jason |publisher= [[Affirmation: Gay &amp; Lesbian Mormons]] |accessdate= 2007-04-24 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120724211141/http://www.affirmation.org/news_2005/2005_08.shtml |archivedate= 2012-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Leaving the Saints''===
In 2005, she received national attention for her bestselling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/bestseller/0327besthardnonfiction.html |title=The New York Times Books Best-Seller Lists—Hardcover Nonfiction|date=March 27, 2005 |work= |accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; book, ''Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith''.&lt;ref name="Leaving"/&gt; According to [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone magazine]],&lt;ref name="Lyon"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/136-62-68.pdf |title= An Exhaustive Memoir of Reading "Leaving the Saints" |last= Lyon |first= Tania R |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone Magazine]] |pages= 70–75 |accessdate= 2013-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the book may have originally been conceived as a [[novel]], loosely based on her life (with a male main character), but was changed to recount her personal experiences, with the encouragement of her publishers. Ultimately released in March 2005, the book is a narrative in which Beck describes [[Repressed memory|recovered memories]] of alleged [[sexual abuse]] by her father,&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/24/books/a-mormon-daughters-book-stirs-a-storm.html |title=A Mormon Daughter's Book Stirs a Storm |work=New York Times |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |date=24 February 2005 |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; prominent [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] academician [[Hugh Nibley]]; her experiences teaching at [[Brigham Young University]]; [[cultural dissonance]] and anomalies in [[Utah]]; her spiritual journey leaving the LDS Church.&lt;ref name="Leaving"/&gt;

Articles were published in response to the book, including a critical essay by the Mormon author, [[Boyd Jay Petersen]]. Petersen, Beck's brother-in-law and Nibley's biographer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=Boyd Jay |authorlink=Boyd Jay Petersen |title=Hugh Nibley: A Consecrated Life |publisher=Greg Kofford Books |location= |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=1-58958-020-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated: "Throughout this book, as with her other books, it is obvious that she distorts the record as much as or more than she reports it, jumps to conclusions more than provides evidence leading to conclusions, and blurs fact and fantasy."&lt;ref name="BoydResponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairlds.org/Reviews/Rvw200504.html|title=Response to "Leaving the Saints"|last=Peterson |first=Boyd Jay |authorlink=Boyd Jay Petersen |year=2005|publisher=FAIR: Defending Mormonism|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318112810/http://www.fairlds.org/Reviews/Rvw200504.html |archive-date=18 March 2005 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck responded to some of these criticisms by stating that she began having memories of her traumatic events prior to the use of any therapy (including hypnosis), that her vagina had scarring that may have been the result of sexual abuse, and that her memories were vivid and intrusive.&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;{{cite web |title=Setting the Record Straight: Physical Evidence &amp; Memories From My Childhood |url=http://leavingthesaints.com/settingrecord.htm |last=Beck |first=Martha |year=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050702004513/http://www.leavingthesaints.com/settingrecord.htm |archive-date=2 July 2005 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of Nibley's surviving family also challenge Beck's allegations by pointing out inconsistencies in her descriptions of events to various media sources&lt;ref name="BoydResponse"/&gt; and her use of self-hypnosis to intentionally recover the memories.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BoydResponse"/&gt; Rebecca Nibley, Beck's sister, reported that Marsha Beck encouraged her to attempt to recover her own memories of abuse, without success.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"/&gt; Beck acknowledged consulting [[recovered-memory therapy|recovered-memory therapist]] and [[self-hypnosis]] advocate [[Lynne Finney]], although only after recovering her memories of abuse.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"/&gt; Hugh Nibley's family claimed that Beck's experiences of sexual abuse recounted in her book were false&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nibley |first1=Paul |last2=Mincek |first2=Christina Nibley |last3=Nibley |first3=Tom |last4=Nibley |first4=Michael |last5=Nibley |first5=Alex | last6=Nibley |first6=Rebecca |last7=Petersen |first7=Zina Nibley |title=Nibley family response to Martha Beck's Leaving the Saints |date=22 February 2005 |url=http://www.hughnibleydefense.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301080425/http://www.hughnibleydefense.com/ |archive-date=1 March 2005 |dead-url=yes |access-date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Kent P. |title=Leaving the Facts and the Faith |work=FARMS Review |volume=17 |issue=1 |date=2005 |p=107–121 |issn=1550-3194 |url=http://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/review/17/1/S00007-5176abed7fd465Jackson.pdf |access-date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wyatt"/&gt; and expressed "outrage" after the book's publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600109810/Nibley-siblings-outraged-over-sisters-book.html |title=Nibley siblings outraged over sister's book |first=Dennis |last=Lythgoe |publisher=Deseret News |date=2005-02-05| accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; They furthermore expressed their dismay that Martha Beck has refused to speak with them, while claiming the reverse was true.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="As Things Stand"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/archive/publications/as-things-stand-at-the-moment-responding-to-martha-becks-leaving-the-saints|title=As Things Stand at the Moment: Responding to Martha Beck's Leaving the Saints|last=Peterson|first=Boyd Jay|authorlink=Boyd Jay Petersen|date=6 August 2005|website=FairMormon|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;!-- presented at FAIR Conference 6-7 August 2005 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the criticism from LDS church members in support of Nibley centered around Beck's allegations of sexual abuse, a substantial portion of the book involves a discussion of the LDS Church and its policies. BYU professor [[Robert L. Millet]] criticized Beck's portrayals of Nibley as "nonsense," "ludicrous," and "paranoia," saying that she "seems to be a magnet for improbable happenings" and "equate[s] weird anomalies in Mormon culture with the norm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Millet |first=Robert L. | authorlink=Robert L. Millet | title=They Leave It, But They Can't Leave It Alone: The memoir of a disaffected Mormon | journal=Books &amp; Culture | publisher=[[Christianity Today]] | date=July 1, 2005 | url=http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2005/julaug/12.33.html | accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent P. Jackson describes her description of Mormon culture as "outlandish", saying "Beck's depictions of the church and BYU are so far removed from reality that it is clear that from the start she ruled out BYU faculty, other academics, and informed Latter-day Saints as potential readers. There was obviously no attempt made to establish credibility with those groups. ... this book was written for those who like stories about people victimized by powerful men and powerful institutions. Yet those who really know what she has written about will have a very hard time believing anything in the book."&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; He proceeds to list a number of claims Beck made in the book which he asserts can be verified as false with readily available public information.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; Dan Wotherspoon, editor of the independent Mormon magazine [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]], similarly states "She says a lot of things in there that anyone who lives in Utah will just know is wrong."&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/07/AR2005050700981.html |title=Daughter's Denunciation of Historian Roils Mormon Church |last=Reid |first=T.

The '''maxillary lateral incisors''' are a pair of upper ([[maxilla]]ry) [[tooth|teeth]] that are located laterally (away from the midline of the [[face]]) from both [[maxillary central incisor]]s of the [[mouth]] and medially (toward the midline of the face) from both [[maxillary canine]]s.  As with all [[incisor]]s, their function is for [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] or cutting food during [[mastication]], commonly known as chewing.  There are generally no [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s on the teeth, but the rare condition known as [[talon cusp]]s are most prevalent on the maxillary lateral incisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.hindawi.com/archive/2014/595189/ |title=Journal of Oral Diseases |last=Sharma |first=Gaurav |last2=Nagpal |first2=Archna |date=2014 |volume=2014 |pages=1–6 |language=en |doi=10.1155/2014/595189 |issn=2356-7538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface area of the tooth used in eating is called an incisal ridge or incisal edge.  Though relatively the same, there are some minor differences between the [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] (baby) maxillary lateral incisor and that of the [[permanent teeth|permanent]] maxillary lateral incisor. The maxillary lateral incisors [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlude]] in opposition to the [[mandibular lateral incisor]]s.

==Notation==

In the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal system of notation]], the deciduous maxillary lateral incisors are designated by a letter written in uppercase.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=5}} The right deciduous maxillary lateral incisor is known as "D", and the left one is known as "G".{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=5}} The [[FDI World Dental Federation notation|international notation]] has a different system of notation.  Thus, the right deciduous maxillary lateral incisor known as "52", and the left one is known as "62".{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=4}}
[[File:Maxillary lateral incisors01-01-06.png|right|thumb|220px|Maxillary lateral incisors of permanent and primary teeth are marked in red.]]
In the universal system of notation, the permanent maxillary lateral incisors are designated by a number.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=5}} The right permanent maxillary lateral incisor is known as "7", and the left one is known as "10".{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=5}}{{sfn|Levin-Goldstein|Short|2013}} In the [[Palmer notation]], a number is used in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=5}} For this tooth, the left and right lateral incisors would have the same number, "2", but the right one would have the symbol, "┘", underneath it, while the left one would have, "└".{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=5}} The [[FDI World Dental Federation notation|FDI notation]] has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent maxillary lateral incisor is known as "12", and the left one is known as "22".{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=5}}

==Development==

The primary tooth will begin to show signs of development between 14 {{frac|2|3}} weeks and 16 {{frac|1|2}} weeks in utero, at an average of 16 weeks.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=36}}

The permanent tooth typically will erupt between when the child is 8 or 9 years old, while the root will continue to mineralize until around 11 years old.{{sfn|Levin-Goldstein|Short|2013}}. The tooth's crown will conclude its development around the age of 4 or 5.{{sfn|Levin-Goldstein|Short|2013}}

==Deciduous dentition==

There are two maxillary lateral incisors in the deciduous dentition.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=43}} The teeth have a more curved distoincisal angle than the primary maxillary central incisor.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=51}} The tooth is longer cervicoincisally than it is mesiodistally.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=51}} The average length of the primary lateral incisor is 15.8 mm, with the average crown length being 5.6 mm and the root length average being 11.4 mm.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=50}}

All primary teeth have several characteristics that are different when compared to the permanent dentition.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=44-5}} The primary lateral incisor crown is wider mesiodistally than the permanent tooth and the roots of the primary lateral incisors are longer than the permanent tooth.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=44-5}} The cervical ridges in all of anterior teeth are more prominent than in the 

==Permanent dentition==

There are two maxillary lateral incisors in the permanent dentition,{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=43}} which begin to show signs of development at 10 to 12 months after birth.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=36}} The maxillary lateral incisor resembles the [[maxillary central incisor]], but is smaller in every dimension aside from root length.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=104}} The root of the lateral incisor is around 1.5 times the length of the crown.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=106}} The tooth has the most variability in crown shape in the mouth except the [[maxillary third molar]].{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=104}} The two lateral incisors can also be congenitally missing.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=105}} The teeth are less pigmented and are whiter in appearance than the permanent teeth.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=44-5}}

===Labial aspect===

Compared to the maxillary central incisor, the maxillary lateral incisor has more rounded mesial and distal incisal angles.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=106}} The distal outline is always more rounded.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=106}} The root is often tapered distally, often with a sharp curve distally and to an apex; however, the curve can be absent.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=106}} The mesial and distal contacts are more cervical than the central incisor.{{sfn|Levin-Goldstein|Short|2013}} The surface is smooth.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=107}} The labial view of the lateral incisor fits into the geometric shape of a trapezoid.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=72-3}}

===Lingual aspect===

The distal and mesial marginal ridges are evident and the cingulum is prominent.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=107}} The lingual fossa is more concave than the central incisor.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=107}} The cingulum will often have a deep developmental groove on the distal side that can continue well into the root.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=107}} The lingual view of the lateral incisor fits into the geometric shape of a trapezoid.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=72-3}}

===Mesial aspect===

The curvature of the [[cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ) sharply inclines towards the incisal ridge.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=107-9}} The mesial view of the lateral incisor fits into the geometric shape of a triangle.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=72-3}}

===Distal aspect===

Compared to the tooth's mesial view of the cervical line, the distal cervical line is slightly more cervical by close to a millimeter.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=107-9}} There may be a developmental groove present for all or most of the length.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=109}} The distal view of the lateral incisor fits into the geometric shape of a triangle.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=72-3}}

The "Joint Principles" that popularly define a PCMH were established through the efforts of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP), [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP), [[American College of Physicians]] (ACP), and [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) in 2007.&lt;ref name="PCPCC-Principles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Principles of the Patient Centered Medical Home|url=http://www.pcpcc.net/content/joint-principles-patient-centered-medical-home|accessdate=2 February 2012|author=Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care coordination is an essential component of the PCMH. Care coordination requires additional resources such as health information technology and appropriately-trained staff to provide coordinated care through team-based models. Additionally, payment models that compensate PCMHs for their functions devoted to care coordination activities and patient-centered care management that fall outside the face-to-face patient encounter may help encourage further coordination.&lt;ref name="PCPCC-Principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAS-1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Primary Care: America's Health in a New Era|date=1996|location=Washington, DC|author=Committee on the Future of Primary Care, Institute of Medicine|editor1-first=Molla S. |editor1-last=Donaldson| editor2-first=Karl D.| editor2-last=Yordy| editor3-first=Kathleen N. |editor3-last=Lohr| editor4-first=Neal A. |editor4-last=Vanselow  | isbn=978-0-309-05399-0| publisher=National Academies Press|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/5152/primary-care-americas-health-in-a-new-era}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}}

==History==
The concept of the "medical home" has evolved since the first introduction of the term by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] in 1967.  At the time, it was envisioned as a central source for all the medical information about a child, especially those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GZuVbzss5WoC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Palfrey+medical+home+1970s#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Child health in America: Making a difference through advocacy | isbn = 978-0-8018-8453-5 | author1 = Palfrey | first1 = Judith | date = 31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Pediatr Clin North Am |date=August 2009 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=953–64 |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2009.05.021 |title=The medical home--improving quality of primary care for children |vauthors=Wegner SE, Antonelli RC, Turchi RM |pmid=19660637 |url=http://facm.unjbg.edu.pe/revistaspediatria/Clinical%20Pediatrics/2009/August/16%20The%20Medical%20Home-Improving%20Quality%20of%20Primary%20Care%20for%20Children.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts by [[Calvin C.J.

In 2002, seven U.S. national [[family medicine]] organizations created the ''Future of Family Medicine'' project to "transform and renew the specialty of family medicine."&lt;ref name=FFM&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin JC |title=The Future of Family Medicine: A Collaborative Project of the Family Medicine Community |journal=[[Annals of Family Medicine]] |volume=2 Suppl 1 |issue= Suppl 1|pages=S3–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15080220 |pmc=1466763 |doi=10.1370/afm.130 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Avant RF |author3=Bowman MA |display-authors=3 |last4=Bucholtz |first4=JR |last5=Dickinson |first5=JR |last6=Evans |first6=KL |last7=Green |first7=LA |last8=Henley |first8=DE |last9=Jones |first9=WA }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the recommendations of the project was that every American should have a "personal medical home" through which they could receive [[Acute (medicine)|acute]], [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], and [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] health services.&lt;ref name=FFM/&gt; These services should be "accessible, accountable, comprehensive, integrated, patient-centered, safe, scientifically valid, and satisfying to both patients and their physicians."&lt;ref name=FFM/&gt;

As of 2004, one study estimated that if the ''Future of Family Medicine'' recommendations were followed (including implementation of personal medical homes), "health care costs would likely decrease by 5.6 percent, resulting in national savings of 67 billion dollars per year, with an improvement in the quality of the health care provided."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spann SJ |author2=Task Force 6 and the Executive Editorial Team |title=Report on Financing the New Model of Family Medicine |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=2 Suppl 3 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=S1–21 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15654084 |pmc=1466777 |doi=10.1370/afm.237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of this assertion, published later the same year, determined that medical homes are "associated with better health,... with lower overall costs of care and with reductions in disparities in health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Starfield B, Shi L |title=The medical home, access to care, and insurance: a review of evidence |journal=Pediatrics |volume=113 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=1493–8 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15121917 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15121917 |last2=Shi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IBM]] and other organizations started the [[Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative]] in 2006 to promote the medical home model.&lt;ref name=Backer2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=Backer LA |title=Building the case for the patient-centered medical home |journal=[[Family Practice Management]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=14–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19186734 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=19186734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnst2009&gt;{{cite news |author=Arnst C |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_27/b4138034173005.htm |title=The family doctor: a remedy for health-care costs? |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, its membership included "some 500 large employers, insurers, consumer groups, and doctors".&lt;ref name=Arnst2009/&gt;

In 2007, the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American College of Physicians]], and [[American Osteopathic Association]]—the largest primary care physician organizations in the United States—released the ''Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home''.&lt;ref name=JointPrinciples&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acponline.org/hpp/approve_jp.pdf |title=Joint principles of the patient-centered medical home |date=March 2007 |accessdate=2009-06-30 |author1=American Academy of Family Physicians |author2=American Academy of Pediatrics |author3=American College of Physicians |author4=American Osteopathic Association |authorlink1=American Academy of Family Physicians |authorlink2=American Academy of Pediatrics |authorlink3=American College of Physicians |authorlink4=American Osteopathic Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315230746/http://www.acponline.org/hpp/approve_jp.pdf |archive-date=2007-03-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Defining principles included: 
*'''Personal physician''': "each patient has an ongoing relationship with a personal physician trained to provide first contact, continuous and comprehensive care."
*'''Physician directed medical practice''':  "the personal physician leads a team of individuals at the practice level who collectively take responsibility for the ongoing care of patients."
*'''Whole person orientation''': "the personal physician is responsible for providing for all the patient's health care needs or taking responsibility for appropriately arranging care with other qualified professionals."
* '''Care is coordinated and/or integrated''': Care is coordinated and/or integrated between complex health care systems, for example, across specialists, hospitals, home health agencies, and nursing homes, and also includes the patient's loved ones and community-based services. This goal can be attained though the utilization of registries, health information technology, and exchanges, ensuring patients receive culturally and linguistically-appropriate care.&lt;ref name=PCPCC-Principles /&gt;
* '''Quality and safety''': 
** Partnerships between the patient, physicians, and their family are an integral part of the medical home. Practices are encouraged to advocate for their patients and provide compassionate quality, patient-centered care.
** Guide decision-making rooted in evidence-based medicine and with the use of decision-support tools.
** Physicians' voluntary engagement in performance measurements to continuously gauge quality improvement.
** Patients are involved in decision-making and provide feedback to determine if their expectations are met.
** Utilization of informational technology to ensure optimal patient care, performance measurement, patient education, and enhanced communication
** At the practice level, patients and their families participate in quality improvement activities.&lt;ref name="PCPCC-Principles" /&gt; 
* Enhanced access to care is available through open scheduling, extended hours and new options for patient communication.&lt;ref name=PCPCC-Principles /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1=M.A. | last1=Balara | first2=J.E. | last2=Harper | title=Patient Centered Medical Home: An Approach for the Health Plan | type=White paper | publisher=HTMS | url=http://www.htms.com/pdfs/PCMH_White_Paper.pdf | accessdate=2 February 2012 | format=PDF | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Payment must "appropriately recognize the added value provided to patients who have a patient-centered medical home." 
** Payment should reflect the time physician and non-physician staff spend doing patient-centered care management work outside the face-to-face visit.
** Services involved with coordination of care should be paid for.
** It should support measurement of quality and efficiency with the use and adoption of health information technology.&lt;ref name=BatesBitton-2010/&gt;
** Enhanced communication should be supported.
** It should value the time physicians spend using technology for the monitoring of clinical data.
** Payments for care management services should not result in deduction in payments for face-to-face service.
** Payment "should recognize case mix differences in the patient population being treated within the practice."
** It should allow physicians to share in the savings from reduced hospitalizations. 
** It should allow for additional compensation for achieving measurable and continuous quality improvements.

A survey of 3,535 U.S. adults released in 2007 found that 27 percent of the respondents reported having "four indicators of a medical home."&lt;ref name=Beal2007&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Beal AC, Doty MM, Hernandez SE, Shea KK, Davis K |url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2007/Jun/Closing%20the%20Divide%20%20How%20Medical%20Homes%20Promote%20Equity%20in%20Health%20Care%20%20Results%20From%20The%20Commonwealth%20F/1035_Beal_closing_divide_medical_homes%20pdf.pdf |title=Closing the divide: how medical homes promote equity in health care.

Important developments concerning medical homes between 2008 and 2010 included:
* The [[Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care]] (AAAHC) began accrediting medical homes in 2009, and is the only accrediting body to conduct on-site survey for organizations seeking Medical Home [[accreditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care]] |url=http://www.aaahc.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=mha |title=Medical Home Accreditation |accessdate=30 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] released ''Physician Practice Connections–Patient-Centered Medical Home'' (PPC-PCMH), a set of voluntary standards for the recognition of physician practices as medical homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Committee for Quality Assurance |url=http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/631/Default.aspx |title=Physician Practice Connections–Patient-Centered Medical Home (PPC-PCMH) |accessdate=14 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716013805/http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/631/Default.aspx |archive-date=2009-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2010, seven key health information technology domains were identified as necessary for the success of the PCMH model: telehealth, measurement of quality and efficiency, care transitions, personal health records, and, most important, registries, team care, and clinical decision support for chronic diseases.&lt;ref name=BatesBitton-2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0007 |vauthors=Bates D, Bitton A |title=The future of health information technology in the patient-centered medical home |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=614–21 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20368590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accreditation ===
The Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) in 2009 introduced the first accreditation program for medical homes to include an onsite survey.  Unlike other quality assessment programs for medical homes, AAAHC Accreditation also mandates that PCMHs meet the Core Standards required of all ambulatory organizations seeking AAAHC Accreditation.
  
AAAHC standards assess PCMH providers from the perspective of the patient.  The onsite survey is conducted by surveyors who are qualified professionals – physicians, registered nurses, administrators and others – who have first-hand experience with ambulatory health care organizations.  The onsite survey process gives them an opportunity to directly observe the quality of patient care and the facilities in which it is delivered, review medical records and assess patient perceptions and satisfaction.

The AAAHC Accreditation Handbook for Ambulatory Health Care includes a chapter specifically devoted to medical home standards, including assessment of the following characteristics:  
* '''Relationship,''' including communication, understanding and collaboration between the patient and the provider and physician-directed health care team.  Where appropriate the relationship between the medical home and the patient's family or other caretakers also is assessed.
* '''Continuity of care,''' including the requirement that a significant number (more than 50 percent) of a patient's medical home visits are with the same provider/physician team.  The standards also require documentation of all consultations, referrals and appointments in the clinical record; and proactively planned transitions of care (e.g. from pediatric to adult or adult to geriatric or from inpatient to outpatient to nursing home to hospice).  
* '''Comprehensiveness of care,''' including preventive and wellness care, acute injury and illness care, chronic illness management and end-of-life care.  Standards for the provision of appropriate patient education, self-management and community resources also are addressed.
* '''Accessibility,''' including written policies that support patient access and routine assessment of patients' perceptions and satisfaction regarding access to the medical home.  Medical care must be available 24/7, 365 days a year.  
* '''Quality,''' including patient care that is physician directed, the use and periodic assessment of evidence based guidelines and performance measures in delivering clinical services, and ongoing quality improvement activities.

In addition, electronic data management must be continually assessed as a tool for facilitating the Accreditation Association medical home.

AAAHC Medical Home Accreditation also requires that core standards required of all ambulatory organizations seeking AAAHC Accreditation be met, including: Standards for [[patient rights|rights of patients]]; governance; administration; [[quality of care]]; [[quality management]] and improvement; clinical records and health information; [[infection control|infection prevention and control]], and safety; and facilities and environment.  Depending on the services provided, AAAHC-Accredited medical homes may also have to meet adjunct standards such as for [[anesthesia]], [[surgery|surgical]], [[pharmacy|pharmaceutical]], [[pathology]] and medical laboratory, diagnostic and other imaging, and [[dentistry|dental services]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aaahc.org/accreditation/primary-care-medical-home/ | title=AAAHC Medical Home Page | publisher=AAAHC Website | date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certification program ===
In addition to its accreditation program for medical homes, the AAAHC is conducting a pilot "Medical Home Certification" program, which includes an onsite survey to evaluate an organization against their standards for medical homes.  Full accreditation requires that organizations also be evaluated against all AAAHC core standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aaahc.org/news/archives/2011/aaahc-to-launch-medical-home-certification-pilot/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716062415/http://www.aaahc.org/news/archives/2011/aaahc-to-launch-medical-home-certification-pilot/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=July 16, 2012 | title=AAAHC To Launch Medical Home Pilot | publisher=AAAHC Website | date=March 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition program ===
The [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]]'s (NCQA) "Physician Practice Connections and Patient Centered Medical Home" (PPC-PCMH) Recognition Program emphasizes the systematic use of patient-centered, coordinated care management processes. It is an extension of the Physician Practice Connections Recognition Program, which was initiated in 2003 with support from organizations such as The [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], The [[Commonwealth Fund]] and [[Bridges to Excellence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=NCQA Patient-Centered Medical Home: PPC®-PCMH™ |publisher=National Committee for Quality Assurance |url=http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/PCMH%20brochure-web.pdf |accessdate=31 January 2012 |format=PDF |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PPC-PCMH enhances the quality of patient care through the well known and empirically validated [[Wagner Chronic Care Model]], which encourages the health care system to use community resources to effectively care for patients with chronic illnesses through productive interactions between activated patients and a prepared practice team. Furthermore, it recognizes practices that successfully use systematic processes and technology leading to improved quality of patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=McColl Institute | author2=Group Health Cooperative | title=Summary of Wagner Chronic Care Model | format=PDF | publisher=SEFAP | url=http://www.sefap.it/economiasanitaria_news_200902/Collaboratives-Summary%5B1%5D.pdf | accessdate=31 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the guidance from the ACP, the AAFP, the AAP and the AOA the NCQA launched PPC-PCMH and
based the program on the medical home joint principles developed by these organizations.&lt;ref name=PPC-PCMH_Companion_Guide&gt;{{Citation |publisher=National Committee for Quality Assurance |title=Physician Practice Connections—Patient Centered Medical Home Companion Guide |url=http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Programs/Recognition/Companion_Guide/PPC-PCMH_Companion_Guide.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2012 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If practices achieve NCQA's PCMH Recognition they can take advantage of financial incentives that health plans, employers, federal and state-sponsored pilot programs offer and they may qualify for additional bonuses or payments.

In order to attain PPC-PCMH Recognition, specific elements must be met. Included in the standards are ten "must-pass" elements:

; ELEMENT 1A—Access and communication processes
: The practice has written processes for scheduling appointments and communicating with patients.
; ELEMENT 1B—Access and communication results
: The practice has data showing that it meets the standards in element 1A for scheduling and communicating with patients.
; ELEMENT 2D—Organizing clinical data
: The practice uses electronic or paper-based charting tools to organize and document clinical information.
; ELEMENT 2E—Identifying important conditions
: The practice uses an electronic or paper-based system to identify the following in the practice's patient population:
:* Most frequently seen diagnoses
:* Most important risk factors
:* Three clinically important conditions
; ELEMENT 3A—Guidelines for important conditions
: The practice must implement evidence-based guidelines for the three identified clinically important conditions.
; ELEMENT 4B—Self management support
: The practice works to facilitate self-management of care for patients with one of the three clinically important conditions.
; ELEMENT 6A—Test tracking and follow-up
: The practice works to improve effectiveness of care by managing the timely receipt of information on all tests and results.
; ELEMENT 7A—Referral tracking
: The practice seeks to improve effectiveness, timeliness and coordination of care by following through on critical consultations with other practitioners.
; ELEMENT 8A—Measures of performance
: The practice measures or receives performance data by physician or across the practice regarding:
:* Clinical process
:* Clinical outcomes
:* Service data
:* Patient safety
; ELEMENT 8C—Reporting to physicians
: The practice reports on its performance on the factors in Elements 8A.&lt;ref name=PPC-PCMH_Companion_Guide /&gt;

== Scientific evidence ==
Recent peer-reviewed literature that examines the prevalence and effectiveness of medical homes includes:
* In 2007, researchers from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published a study involving interviews with 5400 parents; the authors concluded that continuous primary care in a medical home was associated with higher rates of vaccinations for the respondents' children.&lt;ref name=Allred2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allred NJ, Wooten KG, Kong Y |title=The association of health insurance and continuous primary care in the medical home on vaccination coverage for 19- to 35-month-old children |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=119 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S4–11 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17272584 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2089C|last2=Wooten |last3=Kong }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schoen and colleagues (2007) surveyed adults in seven countries, using the answers to four questions to categorize the respondents as having a medical home or not.&lt;ref name=Schoen2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schoen C, Osborn R, Doty MM, Bishop M, Peugh J, Murukutla N |title=Toward higher-performance health systems: adults' health care experiences in seven countries, 2007 |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=w717–34 |year=2007 |pmid=17978360 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.6.w717|last2=Osborn |last3=Doty |last4=Bishop |last5=Peugh |last6=Murukutla }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a medical home was associated with less difficulty accessing care after hours, improved flow of information across providers, a positive opinion about health care, fewer duplicate tests, and lower rates of medical errors.&lt;ref name=Schoen2007/&gt;
* A review of 33 articles by Homer et al. on medical homes for children with special health care needs published in 2008 "provide[d] moderate support for the hypothesis that medical homes provide improved health-related outcomes."&lt;ref name=Homer2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Homer CJ |title=A review of the evidence for the medical home for children with special health care needs |journal=Pediatrics |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=e922–37 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18829788 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-3762 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Klatka K |author3=Romm D |display-authors=3 |last4=Kuhlthau |first4=K. |last5=Bloom |first5=S. |last6=Newacheck |first6=P. |last7=Van Cleave |first7=J. |last8=Perrin |first8=J. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2008 review by Rosenthal determined that peer-reviewed studies show "improved quality, reduced errors, and increased satisfaction when patients identify with a primary care medical home."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal2008/&gt;
* In a survey of parents or legal guardians of children with special health care needs published in 2009, 47.1% of the children had a medical home, and the children with a medical home had "less delayed or forgone care and significantly fewer unmet needs for health care and family support services" than the children without a medical home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strickland BB, Singh GK, Kogan MD, Mann MY, van Dyck PC, Newacheck PW |title=Access to the medical home: new findings from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs |journal=Pediatrics |volume=123 |issue=6 |pages=e996–1004 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19482751 |doi=10.1542/peds.2008-2504|last2=Singh |last3=Kogan |last4=Mann |last5=Van Dyck |last6=Newacheck }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reid ''et al.'' (2010) showed within the Group Health system in Seattle that a medical home demonstration was associated with 29% fewer emergency visits, 6% fewer hospitalizations, and total savings of $10.30 per patient per month over a twenty-one-month period (p=0.08, a result that approaches statistical significance, meaning that the difference could still be due to chance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reid RJ |title=The group health medical home at year two: cost savings, higher patient satisfaction, and less burnout for providers |journal=Health Affairs |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=835–43 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20439869 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0158 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Coleman K |author3=Johnson EA |display-authors=3 |last4=Fishman |first4=P.

== International comparisons ==
In a study of 10 countries, the authors wrote that in most of the countries "health promotion is usually separate from acute care, so the notion[] of a... medical home as conceptualized in the United States... does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuo AA, Inkelas M, Lotstein DS, Samson KM, Schor EL, Halfon N |title=Rethinking well-child care in the United States: an international comparison |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=1692–702 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17015563 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0620|last2=Inkelas |last3=Lotstein |last4=Samson |last5=Schor |last6=Halfon }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the seven-country study of Schoen et al. found that the prevalence of medical homes was highest in New Zealand (61%) and lowest in Germany (45%).&lt;ref name=Schoen2007/&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Comparison with "gatekeeper" models  ===

Some suggest that the medical home mimics the [[Case management (USA health system)|managed care]] "gatekeeper" models historically employed by [[HMO]]s; however, there are important distinctions between care coordination in the medical home and the "gatekeeper" model.&lt;ref name=Arnst2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brody2009&gt;{{cite news |author=Brody JE |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907EFDB1638F930A15755C0A96F9C8B63 |title=Personal health; a personal, coordinated approach to care |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the medical home, the patient has open access to see whatever physician they choose.  No referral or permission is required.  The personal physician of choice, who has comprehensive knowledge of the patient's medical conditions, facilitates and provides information to [[Medical specialty|subspecialists]] involved in the care of the patient.  The gatekeeper model placed more financial risk on the physicians resulting in rewards for less care.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  The medical home puts emphasis on medical management rewarding quality patient-centered care.

===Organizations criticizing the model===

The medical home model has its critics, including the following major organizations:
* The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] expresses cautions such as "a shifting of financial and other resources to support the PCMH model could have adverse effects on sectors of the health care system" and "there should be proven value in health care outcomes for patients and reduced costs to the health care system before there is widespread implementation of this model."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=American College of Emergency Physicians |url=http://www.acep.org/practres.aspx?id=40804 |title=Patient-centered medical home model position statement |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2009-07-12}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[American Optometric Association]] is concerned that medical homes "may restrict access to eye and vision care" and requests "that optometry be recognized as a principal provider of eye and vision care services within the PCMH"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[American Optometric Association]] |url=http://www.aoa.org/x9206.xml |title=Patient-centered medical home - where does optometry fit in? |accessdate=2009-07-12}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=American Optometric Association |url=http://www.aoa.org/documents/Medical%20Home%20Policy%20Paper.pdf |title=Eye and vision care in the patient-centered medical home |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2009-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902145941/http://www.aoa.org/documents/Medical%20Home%20Policy%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=2009-09-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[American Psychological Association]] states that Congress should ensure that "careful consideration is paid to the role of psychologists and non-physician providers in the medical home model, which should be more appropriately named the 'health home model'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=American Psychological Association Practice Association |url=http://www.apapractice.org/apo/legislative_advocacy/health_care_reform.html |title=Health care reform: Congress should ensure that psychologists' services are key in primary care initiatives |date=February 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-12}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===

One notable implementation of medical homes has been Community Care of [[North Carolina]] (CCNC), which was started under the name "Carolina Access" in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Willson2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Willson CF |title=Community care of North Carolina: saving state money and improving patient care |journal=NCMJ |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=229–33 |year=2005 |pmid=16130951 |url=http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/archives/?community-care-of-north-carolina-saving-state-money-and-improving-patient-care-5142 |access-date=2011-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714161410/http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/archives/?community-care-of-north-carolina-saving-state-money-and-improving-patient-care-5142 |archive-date=2011-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CCNC consists of 14 community health networks that link approximately 750,000 [[Medicaid]] patients to medical homes.&lt;ref name=Steiner2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steiner BD, Denham AC, Ashkin E, Newton WP, Wroth T, Dobson LA |title=Community Care of North Carolina: Improving Care Through Community Health Networks |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=361–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18626037 |pmc=2478510 |doi=10.1370/afm.866|last2=Denham |last3=Ashkin |last4=Newton |last5=Wroth |last6=Dobson Jr }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is funded by North Carolina's Medicaid office, which pays $3 per member per month to networks and $2.50 per member per month to physicians.&lt;ref name=Steiner2008/&gt; CCNC is reported to have improved healthcare for patients with asthma and diabetes.&lt;ref name=Steiner2008/&gt; Non-peer-reviewed analyses cited in a peer-reviewed article suggested that CCNC saved North Carolina $60 million in fiscal year 2003 and $161 million in fiscal year 2006.&lt;ref name=Steiner2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lodh M, Mercer Government Human Services Consulting |url=http://www.communitycarenc.com/PDFDocs/Mercer%20SFY03.pdf |title=ACCESS cost savings -- state fiscal year 2003 analysis (letter to Mr. Jeffrey Simms, Division of Medical Assistance, State of North Carolina) |date=2004-06-25 |accessdate=2009-07-09 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lurito K, Mercer Government Human Services Consulting |url=http://www.communitycarenc.com/PDFDocs/Mercer%20SFY05_06.pdf |title=CCNC/ACCESS cost savings -- state fiscal year 2005 and 2006 analysis (letter to Mr. Jeffrey Simms, Division of Medical Assistance, State of North Carolina) |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2009-07-09 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an independent analysis asserted that CCNC cost the state over $400 million in 2006 instead of producing savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Disease Management Purchasing Consortium International |url=http://www.dismgmt.com/nc_savings_not_plausible.php |title=Mercer's Community Care of North Carolina savings claims called "not plausible" |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726120523/http://dismgmt.com/nc_savings_not_plausible.php |archive-date=2009-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent analyses show that the program improved the quality of care for asthma and diabetes patients significantly, reducing emergency department and hospital use that produced savings of $150 million in 2007 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/public-private-partnership-supports-medical-homes-managing-medicaid-enrollees-diseasecase |title=Public-Private Partnership Supports Medical Homes in Managing Medicaid Enrollees via Disease/Case Management and Other Initiatives, Leading to Higher Quality and Significant Cost Savings |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.pcmhri.org/ Rhode Island Chronic Care Sustainability Initiative (CSI-RI)] is a community-wide collaborative effort convened in 2006 by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner to develop a sustainable model of primary care that will improve the care of chronic disease and lead to better overall health outcomes for Rhode Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcmhri.org/about-us|title=CTC-RI Mission &amp; Vision - PCMHRI|work=PCMHRI|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSI-RI is focused on improving the delivery of chronic illness care and supporting and sustaining primary care in the state of Rhode Island through the development and implementation of the patient-centered medical home. The CSI-RI Medical Home demonstration officially launched in October 2008 with 5 primary care practices and was expanded in April 2010 to include an additional 8 sites.&lt;ref name="pcpcc.net"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcpcc.net/content/rhode-island-chronic-care-sustainability-initiative |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307115306/http://www.pcpcc.net/content/rhode-island-chronic-care-sustainability-initiative |archive-date=2011-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcmhri.org/about-csi-ri-medical-home-demonstration|title=CTC Medical Home Practices - PCMHRI|work=PCMHRI|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen primary care sites, 66 providers, 39 Family Medicine residents, 68,000 patients (46,000 covered lives), and all Rhode Island payers are participating in the demonstration. Further, its selection to participate in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Multi-Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration, CSI-RI is one few medical home demonstrations in the nation with virtually 100% payer participation. Since the start of the demonstration, CSI-RI sites have implemented a series of delivery system reforms in their practices, aimed at becoming patient-centered medical homes, and in turn receive a supplemental per-member-per-month payment from all of Rhode Island's insurers. Each participating practice site also receives funding from participating payers for an on-site nurse care manager, who can work with all patients in the practice, regardless of insurance type or status. All 5 original pilot sites achieved NCQA level 1 PPC-PCMH recognition in 2009, and all 8 expansion sites achieved at least level 1 PPC-PCMH recognition in 2010. As of December 2010, all of the pilot sites and two of the expansion sites have been recognized by NCQA as level 3 patient-centered medical homes.

== Projects evaluating medical home concepts ==

The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] offers grants to primary care practices in order for them to become patient-centered medical homes. The grants are designed to increase the evidence base for these types of transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/focusing-priority-populations |title=Focusing on Priority Populations: An Interview With Cecilia Rivera Casale, Senior Advisor for Minority Health, AHRQ |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 31, 2009, there were at least 26 pilot projects involving medical homes with external payment reform being conducted in 18 states.&lt;ref name="Bitton A, Martin C, Landon BE 2010 584–92"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bitton A, Martin C, Landon BE |title=A Nationwide Survey of Patient Centered Medical Home Demonstration Projects |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=584–92 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20467907 |doi=10.1007/s11606-010-1262-8 |pmc=2869409|last2=Martin |last3=Landon }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pilots included over 14,000 physicians caring for nearly 5 million patients.&lt;ref name="Bitton A, Martin C, Landon BE 2010 584–92"/&gt; The projects are evaluating factors such as clinical quality, cost, patient experience/satisfaction, and provider experience/satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcpcc.net/content/pcpcc_pilot_report.pdf |title=Patient-centered medical home.

* The [[New Jersey Academy of Family Physicians]] and [[Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey]] implemented a pilot project in March 2009. This project is ongoing and involves more than 60 primary care practice sites and 165 primary care physicians. Specialties include family medicine/practice, internal medicine and multi-specialties in which 50% or more of the care provided is primary care.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* The Texas Medical Home Initiative, a multi-stakeholder primary-care driven organization, has launched a two-year pilot involving 7 primary care practices in North and East Texas. This project involves 45 physicians and 75,000 patients. Services to the practices include practice coaching, a patient registry system, assistance with developing practice agreements with specialty practices to build the "medical neighborhood".

In 2006, TransforMED announced the launch of the National Demonstration Project aimed at transforming the way primary care is delivered in our country.  The practice redesign initiative, funded by the AAFP, ran from June 2006 to May 2008. It was the first and largest "proof-of-concept" project to determine empirically whether the TransforMED Patient-Centered Medical Home model of care could be implemented successfully and sustained in today's health care environment. More specifically, the project served as a learning lab to gain better insight into the kinds of hands-on technical support family physicians want and need to implement the PCMH model of care.

Between 2002 and 2006, [[Group Health Cooperative]] made reforms to increase efficiency and access at 20 primary care clinics in western Washington. These reforms had an adverse impact, increasing physician workload, fatigue, and turnover. Negative trends in quality of care and utilization also appeared. As a result, the Group Health Research Institute developed a patient-centered medical home model in one of the clinics. By increasing staff, patient outreach and care management, the clinic reduced emergency department visits and improved patient perceptions of care quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/focusing-priority-populations |title=Medical Home Features Small Panels, Long Visits, Outreach, and Caregiver Collaboration, Leading to Less Staff Burnout, Better Access and Quality, and Lower Utilization |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of PCMH and accountable care organizations (ACO) in the coordination of patient care ==
There are four core functions of primary care as conceptualized by Barbara Starfield and the [[Institute of Medicine]]. These four core functions consist of providing "accessible, comprehensive, longitudinal, and coordinated care in the context of families and community".&lt;ref name=NAS-1996 /&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}}

In the PCMH model, the integration of diverse services that a patient may need is encouraged. This integration which also involves the patient in interpreting the streams of information and working together to find a plan that fits with the patient's values and preferences is under-recognized and under-appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Starfield | first1=B. | last2=Shi | first2=L. | last3=Macinko | first3=J. | title=Contribution of primary care to health systems and health | journal=The Milbank Quarterly | volume=83 | issue=3 | pages=457–502 | year=2005 | pmid=16202000 | pmc=2690145 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2005.00409.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appropriate coordinated care depends on the patient or the population of patients and to a large extent, the complexity of their needs. The challenges involved with facilitating the delivery of care increases as the complexity of their needs increase. These complexities include chronic or acute health conditions, the [[social vulnerability]] of the patient, and the environment of the patient including the number of providers involved in their care. Other factors that may play a role in the patient's coordination of care include their preferences and their ability to organize their own care. The increases in complexity may overwhelm informal coordinating functions requiring a care team that can explicitly provide coordinated care and assume responsibility for the coordination of a particular patient's care.&lt;ref name=NAS-1996 /&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}}

According to the ACO, care coordination achieves two critical objectives—high-quality and high-value care. ACOs can build on the coordinated care provided by the PCMHs and ensure and incentivize communications between teams of providers that operate in various settings. ACOs can facilitate transitions and align the resources needed to meet the clinical and coordinated care needs of the population. They can develop and support systems for the coordination of care of patients in non-ambulatory care settings. Furthermore, they can monitor health information systems and the timeliness and completeness of information transactions between primary care physicians and specialists. The tracking of this information can be used to incentivize higher levels of responsiveness and collaborations.&lt;ref name=NAS-1996 /&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}}

Morozov is an alcoholic. He was marked at the age of 24 by the trauma from witnessing the death of his uncle, who drowned in the Moscow River while swimming drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2208400.stm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; From Our Own Correspondent &amp;#124; Russia's deepening malaise |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-08-28 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once visiting a friend in early recovery in 1993, Mr. Morozov drove through the fields of Durakovo and found an Orthodox shrine, its cupola smashed and filled with a stork’s nest. He took it as a sign from God, built a small cottage, and launched a business in a nearby town, building a factory to mass-produce Russian Orthodox icons. As he brought friends and acquaintances with alcohol problems to the cottage for increasingly longer visits, he transformed the place into an informal treatment center. ''Rumors spread'', he says. ''That’s how people learned about us''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emery|first=Jane L.|year=2003|title=Trends in Russian Addiction Treatment: Feature Articles - Treatment Strategies or Protocols|journal=Counselor, The Magazine for Addiction Professionals|volume=4|number=3|pages=34&amp;ndash;39|url=http://www.counselormagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=128&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=63|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821193337/http://www.counselormagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=128&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=63|archivedate=2012-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Nino Kirtadze]] made a documentary film entitled ''For God, Tsar and the Fatherland'' (alternative title: ''Durakovo: Village of Fools''), regarding the rehabilitation centre in Đurakovo. Mr. Morozov was a central figure of the film, being suggested his authoritarian views of power, his sympathy towards president [[Vladimir Putin]], his anti-democracy conceptions and profound mistrust towards the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Democracy: Russia's Village of Fools - BBC 4|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3324452662680976553|publisher=Video.google.com|accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Osstell AB''' is a company headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden that develops, manufactures, and sells devices and accessories used to measure [[dental implant]] stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=552773|title=Osstell AB: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1999 with the aim of developing and commercializing a device that utilized [[resonance frequency analysis]] (RFA) to determine the level of stability of a dental implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osstell.com/about/|title=About - Osstell – Implant Stability.|last=www.osstell.com|first=Osstell -|newspaper=Osstell – Implant Stability.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patented technology ==
In a [[dental implant]] procedure, a hole is drilled into the jawbone and a titanium implant is inserted. If and when the implant has proven to be stable in the jawbone, a prosthetic tooth is then affixed to the implant.

Osstell’s patented [[Resonance frequency analysis|RFA]] device (the most recent generation called Osstell IDx) helps dentists assess the stability of the implant, without having to physically disturb it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osstell.com/products/|title=Products - Osstell – Implant Stability.|last=www.osstell.com|first=Osstell -|newspaper=Osstell – Implant Stability.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small aluminum rod, called a SmartPeg, is placed in the implant. The [[Resonance frequency analysis|RFA]] device prompts vibration in the rod by initiating magnetic pulses of varying frequencies. The RFA device detects the resonance frequency of the rod (called SmartPeg) while attached to the implant. The resonance frequency is converted to a numeric scale from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating higher stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Implant Dentistry - A Rapidly Evolving Practice|last=|first=|publisher=Intech|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=111–126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scale, called the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ), corresponds with kHz frequency range of 3500–8500&amp;nbsp;kHz. The ISQ scale was developed by Osstell in order to give an immediately comprehensible indicator of implant stability and is now the global standard for implant stability measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osstell.com/clinical-guidelines/the-isq-scale/|title=The ISQ Scale - Osstell – Implant Stability.|last=www.osstell.com|first=Osstell -|newspaper=Osstell – Implant Stability.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instruments are manufactured in factories in [[Kungsbacka]] and [[Vänersborg]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fouriertransform.se/en/Our-Investments/Osstell-AB--Global-market-leader-in-measuring-the-stability-of-dental-implants/|title=Osstell AB - Fouriertransform AB|website=www.fouriertransform.se|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmacogenetics''' is the study of inherited [[genetics|genetic]] differences in drug [[metabolic pathway]]s (and other pharmacological principles, like enzymes, messengers and receptors) which can affect individual responses to drugs, both in terms of therapeutic effect as well as adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Klotz-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Klotz | first1 = U. | title = The role of pharmacogenetics in the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs: pharmacokinetic and therapeutic implications. | journal = Clin Pharmacokinet | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–9 | month =  | year = 2007 | doi =  10.2165/00003088-200746040-00001| pmid = 17375979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pharmacogenetics'' is often used interchangeably with the term ''[[pharmacogenomics]]'' which also investigates the role of acquired and inherited genetic differences in relation to drug response and drug behaviour through a systematic examination of genes, gene products, and inter- and intra-individual variation in gene expression and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Center for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy| url=https://pharmacy.unc.edu/research/centers/cpit/| accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In oncology, ''pharmacogenetics'' historically is the study of [[germline mutation]]s (e.g., [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s affecting genes coding for liver enzymes responsible for drug deposition and [[pharmacokinetics]]), whereas ''pharmacogenomics'' refers to [[mutation|somatic mutations]] in [[cancer|tumoral]] DNA leading to alteration in drug response (e.g., [[KRAS]] mutations in patients treated with [[epidermal growth factor receptor|anti-Her1]] [[biologic medical product|biologics]]).&lt;ref name="pmid10866212"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roses AD | title = Pharmacogenetics and the practice of medicine | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | issue = 6788 | pages = 857–65 |date=June 2000 | pmid = 10866212 | doi = 10.1038/35015728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacogenetics is believed to account for inter-ethnic differences (e.g., between patients of Asian, Caucasian and African descent) in adverse events and efficacy profiles of many widely used drugs in cancer chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Syn NL, Yong WP, Lee SC, Goh BC | title = Genetic factors affecting drug disposition in Asian cancer patients | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism &amp; Toxicology | volume = 11 | issue = 12 | pages = 1879–92 | date = 2015-01-01 | pmid = 26548636 | doi = 10.1517/17425255.2015.1108964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicting drug-drug interactions ==

Much of current clinical interest is at the level of pharmacogenetics, involving variation in genes involved in [[drug metabolism]] with a particular emphasis on improving drug safety. The wider use of pharmacogenetic testing is viewed by many as an outstanding opportunity to improve prescribing safety and efficacy. Driving this trend are the 106,000 deaths and 2.2 Million serious events caused by adverse drug reactions in the US each year.&lt;ref name="pmid9555760"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lazarou J, Pomeranz BH, Corey PN | title = Incidence of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients: a meta-analysis of prospective studies | journal = JAMA | volume = 279 | issue = 15 | pages = 1200–5 |date=April 1998 | pmid = 9555760 | doi = 10.1001/jama.279.15.1200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2016}} As such ADRs are responsible for 5-7% of hospital admissions in the US and Europe, lead to the withdrawal of 4% of new medicines, and cost society an amount equal to the costs of drug treatment.&lt;ref name="Ingelman-Sundberg_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ingelman-Sundberg M, Rodriguez-Antona C | title = Pharmacogenetics of drug-metabolizing enzymes: implications for a safer and more effective drug therapy | journal = Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. | volume = 360 | issue = 1460 | pages = 1563–70 |date=August 2005 | pmid = 16096104 | pmc = 1569528 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2005.1685 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons of the list of drugs most commonly implicated in adverse drug reactions with the list of metabolizing enzymes with known [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s found that drugs commonly involved in adverse drug reactions were also those that were metabolized by enzymes with known polymorphisms (see Phillips, 2001).

Scientists and doctors are using this new technology for a variety of things, one being improving the efficacy of drugs. In psychology, we can predict quite accurately which anti-depressant a patient will best respond to by simply looking into their genetic code.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}{{dubious|date=February 2016|reason=Massively overstates what pharmacogenetics can do - wayyy too confident a claim}} This is a huge step from the previous practice of adjusting and experimenting with different medications to get the best response. Antidepressants also have a large percentage of unresponsive patients and poor prediction rate of ADRs ([[adverse drug reactions]]). In depressed patients, 30% are not helped by [[antidepressant]]s. In psychopharmacological therapy, a patient must be on a drug for 2 weeks before the effects can be fully examined and evaluated. For a patient in that 30%, this could mean months of trying medications to find an antidote to their pain. Any assistance in predicting a patient’s drug reaction to psychopharmacological therapy should be taken advantage of. Pharmacogenetics is a very useful and important tool in predicting which drugs will be effective in various patients.&lt;ref name="pmid20205659"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirchheiner J, Seeringer A, Viviani R | title = Pharmacogenetics in psychiatry--a useful clinical tool or wishful thinking for the future? | journal = Curr. Pharm. Des. | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–44 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20205659 | doi = 10.2174/138161210790112728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug Plavix blocks platelet reception and is the second best selling prescription drug in the world, however, it is known to warrant different responses among patients.&lt;ref name="urlThe 10 Biggest-Selling Drugs That Are About to Lose Their Patent - DailyFinance"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/02/27/top-selling-drugs-are-about-to-lose-patent-protection-ready/ | title = The 10 Biggest-Selling Drugs That Are About to Lose Their Patent  | author = Alazraki M | year = 2011 | work = | publisher = DailyFinance | pages = | language = | quote = | accessdate = 2012-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] studies have linked the gene [[CYP2C19]] to those who cannot normally metabolize [[Plavix]]. Plavix is given to patients after receiving a [[Coronary stent|stent in the coronary artery]] to prevent clotting.

Stent clots almost always result in heart attack or sudden death, fortunately it only occurs in 1 or 2% of the population. That 1 or 2% are those with the CYP2C19 SNP.&lt;ref name="pmid19706858"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shuldiner AR, O'Connell JR, Bliden KP, Gandhi A, Ryan K, Horenstein RB, Damcott CM, Pakyz R, Tantry US, Gibson Q, Pollin TI, Post W, Parsa A, Mitchell BD, Faraday N, Herzog W, Gurbel PA | title = Association of cytochrome P450 2C19 genotype with the antiplatelet effect and clinical efficacy of clopidogrel therapy | journal = JAMA | volume = 302 | issue = 8 | pages = 849–57 |date=August 2009 | pmid = 19706858 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1232 | pmc = 3641569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has been applied in at least two hospitals, Scripps and Vanderbilt University, where patients who are candidates for heart stents are screened for the CYP2C19 variants.&lt;ref name="isbn0-465-02550-1"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Creative Destruction of Medicine: How the Digital Revolution Will Create Better Health Care | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 2012 | pages = | isbn = 0-465-02550-1 | oclc = | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another newfound use of pharmacogenetics involves the use of Vitamin E. The Technion Israel Institute of Technology observed that vitamin E can be used to in certain genotypes to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], but in the same patients with another genotype, vitamin E can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease. A study was carried out, showing vitamin E is able to increase the function of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] in those with the genotype haptoglobin 2-2 who suffer from diabetes. HDL is a lipoprotein that removes cholesterol from the blood and is associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease. However, if you have the misfortune to possess the genotype haptoglobin 2-1, the study shows that this same treatment can drastically decrease your HDL function and cause cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21722898"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farbstein D, Blum S, Pollak M, Asaf R, Viener HL, Lache O, Asleh R, Miller-Lotan R, Barkay I, Star M, Schwartz A, Kalet-Littman S, Ozeri D, Vaya J, Tavori H, Vardi M, Laor A, Bucher SE, Anbinder Y, Moskovich D, Abbas N, Perry N, Levy Y, Levy AP | title = Vitamin E therapy results in a reduction in HDL function in individuals with diabetes and the haptoglobin 2-1 genotype | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 219 | issue = 1 | pages = 240–4 |date=November 2011 | pmid = 21722898 | doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.005 | pmc=3200506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacogenetics is a rising concern in clinical oncology, because the therapeutic window of most anticancer drugs is narrow and patients with impaired ability to detoxify drugs will undergo life-threatening toxicities. In particular, genetic deregulations affecting genes coding for [[Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase|DPD]], [[UGT1A1]], [[TPMT]], [[cytidine deaminase|CDA]] and [[CYP2D6]] are now considered as critical issues for patients treated with 5-FU/capecitabine, irinotecan, mercaptopurine/azathioprine, gemcitabine/capecitabine/AraC and tamoxifen, respectively. The decision to use pharmacogenetic techniques is influenced by the relative costs of [[genotyping]] technologies and the cost of providing a treatment to a patient with an incompatible genotype. When available, phenotype-based approaches proved their usefulness while being cost-effective.&lt;ref name="pmid20204365"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang CG, Ciccolini J, Blesius A, Dahan L, Bagarry-Liegey D, Brunet C, Varoquaux A, Frances N, Marouani H, Giovanni A, Ferri-Dessens RM, Chefrour M, Favre R, Duffaud F, Seitz JF, Zanaret M, Lacarelle B, Mercier C | title = DPD-based adaptive dosing of 5-FU in patients with head and neck cancer: impact on treatment efficacy and toxicity | journal = Cancer Chemother.

In the search for informative correlates of psychotropic drug response, pharmacogenetics has several advantages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Malhotra AK | year = 2010 | title = The state of pharmacogenetics | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/neuropsychiatry/content/article/10168/1550787 | journal = Psychiatr Times | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 38–41, 62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The genotype of an individual is essentially invariable and remains unaffected by the treatment itself.{{clarify|date=February 2016|reason=This is technically correct in that the genotype is invariable, but the phenotype determined via those genotypes is affected (often quite strongly) by treatment with inhibitors or inducers, and this really needs to be explained. Here's a case of how this plays out: let's say a patient has CYP2D6 genotypes that predict a CYP2D6 phenotype resulting in normal metabolism, but as this hypothetical patient is on fluoxetine (a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor), this result is quite likely not reflective of their actual state of CYP2D6 metabolism (which can be measured directly using dextromethorphan).}}
*Molecular biology techniques provide an accurate assessment of the genotype of an individual.{{weasel inline|date=February 2016}}
*There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of genomic information that is available. This information provides the necessary data for comprehensive studies of individual genes and broad investigation of genome-wide variation.
*The ease of accessibility to genotype information through peripheral blood or saliva sampling and advances in molecular techniques has increased the feasibility of DNA collection and genotyping in large-scale clinical trials.

==History==
The first observations of genetic variation in drug response date from the 1950s, involving the muscle relaxant [[suxamethonium chloride]], and drugs metabolized by [[N-acetyltransferase]]. One in 3500 [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] has less efficient variant of the [[enzyme]] ([[butyrylcholinesterase]]) that [[metabolize]]s suxamethonium chloride.&lt;ref name="pmid16968950"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gardiner SJ, Begg EJ | title = Pharmacogenetics, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and clinical practice | journal = Pharmacol. Rev. | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 521–90 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16968950 | doi = 10.1124/pr.58.3.6 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the drug’s effect is prolonged, with slower recovery from surgical paralysis. Variation in the [[N-acetyltransferase]] gene divides people into "slow acetylators" and "fast acetylators", with very different [[Mean lifetime|half-lives]] and [[blood concentration]]s of such important drugs as [[isoniazid]] (antituberculosis) and [[procainamide]] (antiarrhythmic). As part of the inborn system for clearing the body of [[xenobiotic]]s, the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s (CYPs) are heavily involved in [[drug metabolism]], and genetic variations in CYPs affect large populations.  One member of the CYP superfamily, [[CYP2D6]], now has over 75 known allelic variations, some of which lead to no activity, and some to enhanced activity. An estimated 29% of people in parts of [[East Africa]] may have multiple copies of the gene, and will therefore not be adequately treated with standard doses of drugs such as the painkiller [[codeine]] (which is activated by the enzyme). The first study using Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) linked age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with a SNP located on chromosome 1 that increased one’s risk of AMD. AMD is the most common cause of blindness, affecting more than seven million Americans. Until this study in 2005, we only knew about the inflammation of the retinal tissue causing AMD, not the genes responsible.&lt;ref name="isbn0-465-02550-1"/&gt;

==Thiopurines and TPMT (thiopurine methyl transferase)==
One of the earliest tests for a genetic variation resulting in a clinically important consequence was on the enzyme [[thiopurine methyltransferase]] (TPMT). TPMT metabolizes [[6-mercaptopurine]] and [[azathioprine]], two [[thiopurine]] drugs used in a range of indications, from childhood [[leukemia]] to [[autoimmune diseases]]. In people with a deficiency in TPMT activity, thiopurine metabolism must proceed by other pathways, one of which leads to the active thiopurine [[metabolite]] that is toxic to the bone marrow at high concentrations.
Deficiency of TPMT affects a small proportion of people, though seriously. One in 300 people have two variant [[alleles]] and lack TPMT activity; these people need only 6-10% of the standard dose of the drug, and, if treated with the full dose, are at risk of severe [[bone marrow suppression]]. For them, [[genotype]] predicts clinical outcome, a prerequisite for an effective pharmacogenetic test. In 85-90% of affected people, this deficiency results from one of three common variant alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Genetic Science Learning Center|title=Your Doctor's New Genetic Tools.|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/health/pharma/intro/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202101452/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/health/pharma/intro/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 February 2009|publisher=Lern.Genetics|accessdate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around 10% of people are [[heterozygous]] – they carry one variant allele – and produce a reduced quantity of functional enzyme. Overall, they are at greater risk of adverse effects, although as individuals their [[genotype]] is not necessarily predictive of their clinical outcome, which makes the interpretation of a clinical test difficult. Recent research suggests that patients who are heterozygous may have a better response to treatment, which raises whether people who have two [[wild-type]] alleles could tolerate a higher therapeutic dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharmacogenomics: Personalizing Medicine|url=http://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/pharmacogenomics/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409170510/http://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/pharmacogenomics/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 9, 2005|work=Discovery's Edge|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=April 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) have recently deliberated the inclusion of a recommendation for testing for TPMT deficiency to the prescribing information for [[6-mercaptopurine]] and [[azathioprine]]. The information previously carried the warning that inherited deficiency of the enzyme could increase the risk of severe bone marrow suppression. It now carries the recommendation that people who develop bone marrow suppression while receiving 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine be tested for TPMT deficiency.{{citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=No source}}

==Hepatitis C==
A polymorphism near a human interferon gene is predictive of the effectiveness of an artificial interferon treatment for Hepatitis C. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a]] or [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b]] (brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron) combined with [[ribavirin]], it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response to the treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid19684573"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ge D, Fellay J, Thompson AJ, Simon JS, Shianna KV, Urban TJ, Heinzen EL, Qiu P, Bertelsen AH, Muir AJ, Sulkowski M, McHutchison JG, Goldstein DB | title = Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7262 | pages = 399–401 |date=September 2009 | pmid = 19684573 | doi = 10.1038/nature08309 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more probable to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others, and demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.&lt;ref name="pmid19759533"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas DL, Thio CL, Martin MP, Qi Y, Ge D, O'Huigin C, Kidd J, Kidd K, Khakoo SI, Alexander G, Goedert JJ, Kirk GD, Donfield SM, Rosen HR, Tobler LH, Busch MP, McHutchison JG, Goldstein DB, Carrington M | title = Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7265 | pages = 798–801 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19759533 | doi = 10.1038/nature08463 | url = | issn = | pmc=3172006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrating into the health care system ==

Despite the many successes, most drugs are not tested using GWAS. However, it is estimated that over 25% of common medication have some type of genetic information that could be used in the medical field.&lt;ref name="pmid18657016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frueh FW, Amur S, Mummaneni P, Epstein RS, Aubert RE, DeLuca TM, Verbrugge RR, Burckart GJ, Lesko LJ | title = Pharmacogenomic biomarker information in drug labels approved by the United States food and drug administration: prevalence of related drug use | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 8 | pages = 992–8 |date=August 2008 | pmid = 18657016 | doi = 10.1592/phco.28.8.992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the use of [[personalized medicine]] is widely adopted and used, it will make medical trials more efficient. This will lower the costs that come about due to adverse drug side effects and prescription of drugs that have been proven ineffective in certain genotypes. It is very costly when a clinical trial is put to a stop by licensing authorities because of the small population who experiences adverse drug reactions. With the new push for pharmacogenetics, it is possible to develop and license a drug specifically intended for those who are the small population genetically at risk for adverse side effects.
&lt;ref name=Corrigan_2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Corrigan OP | title = Personalized Medicine in a Consumer Age|journal=Current Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine |volume= 9 | pages = 168–176 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.2174/187569211796957566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to test and analyze an individual’s DNA to determine if the body can break down certain drugs through the biochemical pathways has application in all fields of medicine. Pharmacogenetics gives those in the health care industry a potential solution to help prevent the significant number of deaths that occur each year due to drug reactions and side effects. The companies or laboratories that perform this testing can do so across all categories or drugs whether it be for high blood pressure, gastrointestinal, urological, psychotropic or anti-anxiety drugs. Results can be presented showing which drugs the body is capable of breaking down normally versus the drugs the body cannot break down normally. This test only needs to be done once and can provide valuable information such as a summary of an individual’s genetic [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|polymorphisms]], which could help in a situation such as being a patient in the emergency room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-soram-khalsa/pharmacogenetics-what-it-is-_b_7683164.html|title=Pharmacogenetics: What It Is And Why You Need to Know|last=Director|first=Dr Soram Khalsa Medical|last2=Institute|first2=East-West Medical Research|date=2015-06-28|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pharmacogenetics continues to gain acceptance in clinical practice, when to utilize pharmacogenetics will be of importance in advancing patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alzghari SK, Blakeney L, Rambaran KA | title = Proposal for a Pharmacogenetic Decision Algorithm | journal = Cureus | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1289 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28680777 | pmc = 5493454 | doi = 10.7759/cureus.1289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological advances ===

As the cost per genetic test decreases, the development of personalized drug therapies will increase.&lt;ref name="pmid17168846"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paul NW, Fangerau H | title = Why should we bother? Ethical and social issues in individualized medicine | journal = Curr Drug Targets | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 1721–7 |date=December 2006 | pmid = 17168846 | doi = 10.2174/138945006779025428| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology now allows for genetic analysis of hundreds of target genes involved in medication metabolism and response in less than 24 hours for under $1,000.  This a huge step towards bringing pharmacogenetic technology into everyday medical decisions. Likewise, companies like [[deCODE genetics]], [https://rxight.com MD Labs Pharmacogenetics], [[Navigenics]] and [[23andMe]] offer genome scans. The companies use the same [[genotyping]] chips that are used in GWAS studies and provide customers with a write-up of individual risk for various traits and diseases and testing for 500,000 known SNPs. Costs range from $995 to $2500 and include updates with new data from studies as they become available. The more expensive packages even included a telephone session with a genetics counselor to discuss the results.&lt;ref name="isbn0-465-02550-1"/&gt;

==Ethics==
Pharmacogenetics has become a controversial issue in the area of bioethics. It's a new topic to the medical field, as well as the public. This new technique will have a huge impact on society, influencing the treatment of both common and rare diseases. As a new topic in the medical field the ethics behind it are still not clear. However, ethical issues and their possible solutions are already being addressed.

There are three main ethical issues that have risen from pharmacogenetics. First, would there be a type equity at both drug development and the accessibility to tests.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Breckenridge A, Lindpaintner K, Lipton P, McLeod H, Rothstein M, Wallace H | title = Pharmacogenetics: ethical problems and solutions | journal = Nat. Rev. Genet. | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 676–80 |date=September 2004 | pmid = 15372090 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1431 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concern of accessibility to the test is whether it is going to be available directly to patients via the internet, or over the counter. The second concern regards the confidentiality of storage and usage of genetic information.&lt;ref name=Corrigan&gt;{{cite journal | author = Corrigan OP | title = Pharmacogenetics, ethical issues: review of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Report | journal = J. Med. Ethics | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 144–8 |date=March 2005 | pmid = 15738433 | pmc = 1734105 | doi = 10.1136/jme.2004.007229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thirdly, would patients have the control over being tested.

One concern that has risen is the ethical decision health providers must take with respect to educating the patient of the risks and benefits of medicine developed by this new technology. Pharmacogenetics is a new process that may increase the benefits of medicine while decreasing the risk.  However clinicians have been unsuccessful in educating patients regarding the concept of benefits over risk. The Nuffield Council reported that patients and health professionals have adequate information about pharmacogenetics tests and medicine.&lt;ref name=Corrigan /&gt; 
Health care providers will also encounter an ethical decision in deciding to tell their patients that only certain individuals will benefit from the new medicine due to their genetic make-up.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge /&gt;  Another ethical concern is that patients who have not taken the test be able to have access to this type of medicine. If access is given by the doctor the medicine could negatively impact the patient's health. The ethical issues behind pharmacogenetics tests, as well as medicine, are still a concern and policies will need to be implemented in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11120">A '''Private Health Services Plan''' in Canada is '''Health and/or Dental Care''', as part of an insured Group Insurance Plan or a self-insured plan, such as a Health Spending Account, Cost-Plus Plan or one of the three options under a Health and Welfare Trust. 

== Overview ==

Health and Welfare Trusts are divided into three sections, one of which is a Private Health Services Plan. Private Health Services Plans can be Insured (by an Insurance Company) or Self-insured (through an Insurer or Administrator). Self-insured Private Health Services Plans are often referred to as Health Spending Accounts. The Canada Revenue Agency states that Self-insured Private Health Services Plans (Health Spending Accounts) are NOT AVAILABLE to any self-employed unincorporated employers without arms-length employees. Their only option is an Insured Plan with an Insurer. This can be confirmed by contacting CRA at [https://web.archive.org/web/20140805195443/http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ itrulingsdirectorate@cra-arc.gc.ca]

In 1986, the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] introduced an interpretation bulletin entitled IT-85R2 - Health &amp; Welfare Trusts for Employees.&lt;ref&gt;IT-85R2 - Health &amp; Welfare Trusts for Employees, Revenue Canada, July 31, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  This bulletin provided the basics for what would be known as a Health Spending Account or HSA to most Canadians.  The original 1986 bulletin provided a tax-free vehicle for incorporated professionals and companies.  Three years later in 1989, after pressure from non-incorporated entities, Canada Revenue Agency released another bulletin, IT-339R2 (''Meaning of Private Health Services Plan''), providing details on the concept of a Private Health Services Plan or PHSP for non-incorporated businesses in Canada.

The Canada Revenue Agency, in the annual Guides it publishes for those reporting self-employment income from a business or a profession,&lt;ref name="Guide to T2125"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t2125/ |title=Guide to T2125 |publisher=Canada Revenue Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from farming,&lt;ref name="Guide to T2042"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4003/ |title=Guide to T2042 |publisher=Canada Revenue Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides instructions for deducting Private Health Services Plan premiums.

== Confusion and controversy ==

There is no confusion or controversy, just a lack of understanding of the CRA IT Bulletins. The funds in a PHSP, as outlined in the guidelines set in interpretation bulletin IT-339R2,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;IT-339R2 - Meaning of Private Health Services Plan, Revenue Canada, August 8, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; ''CANNOT'' revert to the employer. Canada Revenue Agency released another bulletin in 1998 indicating that the funds could revert to the employer but ''ONLY'' in the case of a notional credit program tied to a flex benefits or cafeteria style plan. The "notional credit" model, outlined in the Canada Revenue Agency IT-bulletin entitled IT-529&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;IT-529 - Flexible Employee Benefit Programs, Revenue Canada, February 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; was designed to allow companies to add an HSA to a Flex Benefits Plan as an additional benefit for items not covered under the traditional group benefits plan.  The bulletin provided the accounting rules for flex benefit programs and using notional credits for the employer.

Today, the major insurers offer Health Spending Accounts with a core group health insurance program. Several HSA Providers also offer Health Spending Accounts as stand-alone benefit solutions with carry-forward of deposited funds or incurred expenses - but not both - for a period of 12 months.

== Funding ==

The employer can make contributions to an insured PHSP (like group insurance) with monthly premiums, or to a self-insured PHSP (like a Health Spending Account) on a periodic basis, or set a calendar year maximum for a plan with no prior contributions.

=== Self-employed individuals with no employees other than family members ===

Note: This is for an Insured Plan with an Insurer, and NOT for a Self-insured PHSP (a Health Spending Account)

* Business owner: $1,500/year
* Spouse: $1,500/year
* Dependent over 18 years or older: $1,500/year
* Dependent under 18 years old: $750/year
Example: A household with 1 sole-proprietor, a spouse, and one child under 18 years old would be eligible for 2 X $1,500 PLUS $750, for a total of $3,750.

===Self-employed individuals with arms length employees===

The business owner may have the same spending limit assigned to full-time staff.

===Corporations (incorporated businesses)===
* Maximums for Employee/Shareholders must be "reasonable" (usually 10% of T4 income)
* Different maximums and benefits can apply to different Classes of Employees. All Employees in the Class must be included.
  Example: Executives $10,000/year, Managers $5,000/year, Employees $2,500/year

'''Forfeiture of Funds''' - Any funds must be used within 12 months from the date of deposit, with a 12 month carry-forward available as an optional selection. '''Deposit are NEVER forfeited to the administrator''', as '''this would be theft of the Employer's funds'''.

== Participation Rules ==

A sole-proprietor can establish a PHSP with an Insurer only. If the sole-proprietor has arms-length employees, they can provide a Health Spending Account for Employees and the same benefits for themselves.

== Eligible Expenses ==

The most common definition of a medical expense is a payment made to a licensed medical practitioner qualified to practice under the provincial laws of the place where the expenses were incurred.  Medical expenses eligible to be paid out of the PHSP are expenses which would otherwise qualify as medical expenses within section 118.2(2) of the Income Tax Act.  Some of the basic healthcare expenditures covered by an HSA include...

===Prescription medicines, drugs, and vitamins===

Drugs prescribed by a Licensed Practitioner and dispensed by a Registered Pharmacist are eligible.
Vitamins and supplements (even if prescribed by a Licensed Medical Practitioner) are not an eligible medical expense.

===Vision===

Eyeglasses, if prescribed, are eligible medical expenses.

===Dental===

An amount paid to a dentist, dental hygienist, dental surgeon or dental mechanic for dental services provided to the patient (to the extent that the fees are for diagnostic, therapeutic or rehabilitative services) are eligible medical expenses.

===Professional services===

An amount paid to a licensed medical practitioner is an eligible medical expense.  They can include depending on the provincial jurisdiction:

•	Chiropractor
•	Audiologist
•	Chiropodist
•	Christian Science Practitioner
•	Dentist
•	Dental Hygienist
•	Dental Technician
•	Denturist
•	Dietician
•	Osteopath
•	Physiotherapist
•	Podiatrist
•	Psychiatrist
•	Psychoanalyst
•	Physician and Surgeon
•	Psychologist
•	Radiologist
•	Massage Therapist
•	Midwife
•	Neurologist
•	Occupational Therapist
•	Optician
•	Speech Therapist
•	Registered Nurse
•	Respiratory Therapist
•	Naturopath

All medical doctors, medical practitioners, dentists, pharmacists, nurses or optometrists must be authorized to practice under the laws of the provincial jurisdiction where the service is rendered, in order for the medical expenses to be eligible.

===Cosmetic surgery===

It has generally been accepted that an amount paid to a medical practitioner for surgery of any kind, whether cosmetic or elective generally qualifies as a medical expense.  It is presumed that such surgery is carried out for a valid medical reason.

CRA has however qualified that expenses for purely cosmetic procedures, including any related services and other expenses such as travel, incurred after March 4, 2010, are no longer an eligible expense. Both surgical and non-surgical procedures purely aimed at enhancing one’s appearance are a non-eligible expense.

Examples of expenses that are non-eligible include the following:
•	liposuction;
•	hair replacement procedures;
•	botulinum injections; and
•	teeth whitening.

An expense, including those identified above, will continue to qualify if it is necessary for medical or reconstructive purposes, such as surgery to address a deformity related to a congenital abnormality, a personal injury resulting from an accident or trauma, or a disfiguring disease.

===Transportation costs===

In addition to ambulance charges to and from hospitals, eligible medical expenses include any commercial transport service transporting a patient and an attendant (if medically necessary to accompany the patient) to a clinic/hospital/doctor’s office.  The distance traveled must be in excess of 40&amp;nbsp;km to obtain such equivalent service not readily available closer to home.  If the distance traveled is in excess of 80&amp;nbsp;km, the eligible costs would include meals and accommodation, in addition to transportation expenses.

===Insurance Premiums===

Premiums paid to a non-government medical or hospital care group plan are eligible medical expenses.

== Dependants ==

The employee can submit medical claims for him/herself and any of his/her dependents that are defined as:

* Any dependent child or grandchild of the employee or their spouse
* Any Canadian resident (at any time in the year) parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece or nephew of the employee or their spouse who was dependent on them at any time during the year.

== Popularity and Growth ==

For years, PHSPs have been a part of Canadian group health and dental plans. The PHSP can be set up as the primary health and dental plan by using a Health Spending Account, as a cost effective alternative to a traditional insured benefits plan.

Major insurers such as [[Manulife]], [[Sun Life]], and [[Great-West Life Assurance]] offer Health Spending Accounts supplementary to group insurance (insured employee benefit plans) only.

Note: Self-insured PHSP (Employer provided for Employees) are Health Spending Accounts.

Note: HSAs for unincorporated owners without arms-length employees,are not acceptable to CRA.

      <comment>/* Protein ranking */ Updating, since soy is a "complete protein"</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16293">'''Protein quality''' is the [[Digestion#Protein digestion|digestibility]] and quantity of [[essential amino acid]]s for providing the proteins in correct ratios for human consumption. There are various methods that rank the quality of different types of [[protein]], some of which are outdated and no longer in use, or not considered as useful as they once were thought to be. The [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] (PDCAAS), which was recommended by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), became the industry standard in 1993. FAO has recently recommended the newer [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]] (DIAAS) to supersede PDCAAS. The dairy industry is in favor of this, because while PDCAAS truncates all protein types that exceed the [[essential amino acid]] (EAA) requirements to 1.0, DIAAS allows a higher than 1.0 ranking: while for example both soy protein isolate and whey isolate are ranked 1.0 according to PDCAAS, in the DIAAS system, whey has a higher score than soy.

==PDCAAS versus DIAAS==
The main limitations of PDCAAS is that it doesn't take into account [[Antinutrient|anti-nutrient]] factors like [[phytic acid]] and [[trypsin inhibitor]]s, which limit the absorption of protein among other nutrients. For this reason, DIAAS is promoted as the superior method and preferable over the PDCAAS. Other older methods like BV, PER, NPU and [[nitrogen balance]] may not reveal much about the amino acid profile and digestibility of the protein source in question, but can still be considered useful in that they determine other aspects of protein quality not taken into account by PDCAAS and DIAAS.

==Protein ranking==
Below follows a table that compares various proteins based on their rankings. Some of these results may differ and vary significantly depending on if it is soybeans or soy protein isolate, and so on. For example, while soybeans have a PDCAAS score of 0.91, many soy protein isolates (though not all) typically get a PDCAAS score of 1.0. Likewise, the amino acid profile may differ from crop to crop depending on the soil, and between different breeds of soy. Generally speaking, however, soybeans rarely outperform whey protein isolate in PDCAAS rankings.

==Amino acid profile==
Below follows a table that compares the complete amino acid profiles of various proteins. The amino acid score is based on the prevalence of the essential amino acids and depends on if they reach sufficient quantity. PDCAAS scores do not take into account the quantity of the non-essential amino acids.

The '''Rannasee''' (or '''Rannastausee''') is an artificial freshwater lake in [[Austria]] and in [[Germany]]. The reservoir is located along the [[Ranna River]] (which forms this part of the border between the two countries) and is the largest lake in the Bavarian Forest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rannasee.de/seepanorama/rannasee.htm | title = Aktivurlaub und Familienurlaub im südlichen Bayerischen Wald, zwischen Donau und Dreisessel – Urlaubsgebiet Rannasee – Bayerwaldurlaub | first = Franz | last = Schuster | accessdate = 2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rannasee was created in 1983 by damming the southeast corner (at the cost of 6.4 million [[Deutschmark]]s) both as a tourist resort and to generate hydro-electric power. The reservoir spans {{convert|20|ha}} and reaches a maximum depth of {{convert|8|m}}, directly behind the dam. The village of [[Meierhof]] occupies the east shore north of the dam.

The '''Romanian Red Cross''' (CRR), also known as the '''National Society of Red Cross from Romania''' (''Societatea Naționalǎ de Cruce Roșie din România''), is a volunteer-led, humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief and education inside Romania. It is the designated national  affiliate of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

==History of the RNRC==

===Establishment and early history===
[[Romania]] became a signatory to the [[First Geneva Convention]] of 1864 and ratified it in 1874. Two years later, on July 4, 1876, the Romanian Red Cross Society was founded in Romania and began work in the present headquarters of the Colțea Hospital in Bucharest.
[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|The First Geneva Convention, 1864]]

Among the signatories of the founding document of the Romanian Red Cross, there were important personalities of the time, such as: Nicolae Cretzulescu, George Gr. Cantacuzino, [[C.A. Rosetti]], Ion Ghica, Dimitrie Sturza, Gr. G. Cantacuzino and Dr. [[Carol Davila]].

The first president of the Romanian Red Cross was Prince Dimitrie Ghica, between 1876-1897.

In less than three weeks after the establishment, on July 20, 1876, the first Romanian Red Cross ambulance went on a humanitarian mission on the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Serbian-Turkish front]], south of the [[Danube]]. On the basis of solidarity that unites National Societies, the first mission of the Romanian Red Cross was meant to provide medical help to wounded soldiers, regardless of belligerent state they belonged to.

===Romanian War of Independence and First Balkan War===
During the [[Romanian War of Independence|War of Independence of 1877-1878]], the Romanian Red Cross has stepped in with medical personnel, ambulances and sanitary trains in supporting the campaign. A hospital was founded in [[Bucharest]] and  medical settlements in different cities all over the country. Red Cross Societies from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]] and [[France]] have sent material aid and medical personnel. On the front near [[Rahova]], the Red Cross volunteers fought to limit the ravages of [[typhoid fever]].

In 1885, the [[First Balkan War|first Balkan war]] broke out, and the Romanian Red Cross proposed to the governments of two countries - [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] to accept an ambulance to cary the wounded. Immediately after receiving the agreement, two Romanian Red Cross ambulances had left the country, providing medical assistance to a total of 625 wounded and sick. Romanian sanitary formations deployed in Serbia and took care of three hospitals with a total of 110 beds. Material effort of the Romanian Red Cross  amounted to 40 000 lei at the time.

The proven skill and care of the Romanian doctors, have been particularly appreciated by the governments of both belligerent countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crucearosie.ro/despre-noi/istoria-sncrr-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1888 and 1892, the Romanian Red Cross has expanded its activities by organizing special courses to prepare nurses. In 1891, a permanent school for nurses was established, and a year later a teaching hospital with 10 beds was founded. Taking advantage of a brief period of peace, the Romanian Red Cross has continued to organize and prepare, both in material terms, but also in terms of staff, to be able to act more effectively in case of necessity.

===Second Balkan War, cholera epidemics in Romania===
In 1913, during the [[second Balkan War]], the Romanian Red Cross mobile hospital staff provided assistance to soldiers suffering from cholera on Bulgarian territory.

With the return of troops in the country, [[cholera]] spread in Romania, affecting a large number of people in the counties of Romanati, Teleorman and Dolj. The Red Cross intervened after it was requested this time by the national authorities and so large tents, medical supplies and medical teams managed to nurture and save thousands of cholera infected patients. In a letter of gratitude to the President of the Romanian Red Cross [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], dr. Laugier, chief physician of the county of Dolj, wrote: "With gratitude I find that the cholera epidemic was completely extinguished  in the shortest possible time, giving conscientious and skilled care to patients". The Red Cross medical teams had only mobile units at the time, but also a bacteriology laboratory, where they were performed more than 7,000 medical tests, "reaching out to 44 communes with people infected with cholera".

By the statute of the Red Cross, adopted in 1876, women were not part of the leadership of the Society. Therefore, in 1906, the 'Ladies Red Cross Society in Romania ", was established and its first elected president was Irina Campineanu. The society was operating in parallel with the one established in 1876 and it dealt with raising funds to help in time of war and disaster, preparing volunteers, co-opted devoted ladies in almost all cities around the country. In 1915, the General Assembly of the National Red Cross Society approved the merger of these two entities. On this occasion, [[Marie of Romania|Queen Marie]], under whose patronage the Red Cross was at that time, the Romanian people was sent the following message: "The Red Cross, our hope in case of peace as in war, should not perish. Everyone of us, small to large should support it with devotion, enthusiasm and infinite love. "

===The Romanian Red Cross after the First World War===
With the support of a large number of volunteers, the Romanian Red Cross passed the fire test of the [[First World War]]. The mission of the RNRC was to assist the military by organizing 58 Hospitals both Bucharest and whole Romania. At the call of the Red Cross National Society, women belonging to various social groups have volunteered to work in hospitals and canteens run by the organization. Queen Marie herself was involved in operations, in support of those wounded. [[File:Medal - Marie of Romania.jpg|thumb|Queen Marie of Romania, on a medal in Red Cross attire]]

During these difficult years for the country, the Romanian Red Cross assisted more than 150,000 wounded in own hospitals, provided food for soldiers, refugees and people affected by conflict, facilitated the exchange of correspondence between the POWs and their families, supported Romanian prisoners held in enemy camps with food and clothing. Funds for these operations have been mobilized by the Red Cross from public donations, from the population and from external sources.

After stopping the [[cholera]], another [[epidemic]] broke out throughout the full scale armed conflict: [[typhus]]. In early 1917, the Romanian Red Cross cared for the wounded evacuated from the front, and patients affected by the two serious infectious diseases. The RNRC had to face this difficult situation, given that the occupying army requisitioned the best medical establishments of the Red Cross and took to benefit their own troops, for a good part of the materials and drugs that were bought with huge efforts by the RNRC. Only in the [[Battle of Bucharest|occupied capital]] over 7,000 patients were cared for. The RNRC branches were active in over 40 cities, taking care of thousands of wounded and sick.

==Prevention and disaster relief==
The RNRC is the only humanitarian organization in the country which has clear duties as auxiliary to public authorities, especially in the field of prevention and intervention in case of disaster.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with law 139/1995 modified by Law no. 524/2004, the SNCRR Statute, Act 481 of 2004 on civil protection, HG 2288 in 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First aid==
Basic First Aid is only a temporary relief granted in an emergency case  to save lives, prevent suffering further complications and improve until an appropriate medical service can intervene.The Romanian Red Cross has an unbroken tradition of over 134 years in giving basic first aid training and volunteer Red Cross nurses. The first courses on proper "bandaging" was organized in 1877, at the Colțea Hospital in Bucharest. Since then, thousands have graduated from first aid courses or Red Cross volunteer sisters courses. Romanian personalities wore throughout white uniforms with the emblem of the Red Cross. During World War I, Queen Marie, dressed in Red Cross nurse's uniform, inspected the front or rear front of hospitals campaign and actively took part in assisting those injured.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crucearosie.ro/activitati/prim-ajutor/cursuri-de-prim-ajutor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The RNRC organizes regular courses on basic first aid at each county branch. These courses are given by medics, which are attested as trainers of paramedical assistance. The RNRC always offers its trainees all the necessary equipment, materials and tools. This course is finalised with an exam which proves that the person who took part in these courses is qualified in giving basic first aid.

==Health education==
If a century ago the RNRC run campaigns against malaria and typhus, today the Romanian Red Cross is working to prevent and combat HIV/AIDS, TB and avian flu, each time getting involved in public health priority issues. Drug use, maternal health, combating [[non-communicable disease]]s, respiratory, cardio-vascular diseases - are special problems that are also in the RNRCs attention.

The program addresses the entire population, in general, and in particular reaches out to youth, and the shares are held in partnership with governmental institutions and NGOs. Health Programs are developed with the support of volunteers trained in seminars organized by the Romanian Red Cross.

RNRC prepares and distributes information materials: leaflets, brochures, educational and health-themed campaigns and actions on specific themes. Also, the Romanian Red Cross marks annually, through public events, today's global health issues, and those of the World Health Organization schedule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crucearosie.ro/activitati/educatie-pentru-sanatate.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social services==
The Romanian Red Cross social program is aimed at improving the living conditions of vulnerable people.For the Romanian Red Cross, "vulnerable people" are those who are at risk, due to situations that threaten their survival or their ability to live in conditions of minimum material security and human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crucearosie.ro/activitati/servicii-sociale.html&lt;/ref&gt; These actions aimed at improving the quality of life of those in need are generally developed in three main directions:
* prevent suffering by helping people in preparing to avoid exposure to situations that may increase vulnerability
* helping people whose vulnerability is worsened by a disaster or crisis
* relief of suffering by reducing vulnerability, improving capacities of people who live constantly in situations where their material security and human dignity are threatened

The group - which is the target and address of the RNRC social program consists of: persons residing in Romania and, for economic, physical, mental or social reasons are unable to ensure social needs. If the basic social needs have not been met, such as food, shelter, clothing, health - where the most vulnerable people are; the main focus most certainly are those living in extreme poverty - under a dollar a day.

==Missing persons==
People search service is a special and unique service of the Red Cross, at an international level, in the humanitarian field.

Being nearly a century old, the Red Cross people search service has a range of action in 186 countries worldwide. This service can restore and maintain ties between family members, due to international armed conflicts, internal national disturbances, natural disasters or special social situations, of a humanitarian nature, that were separated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crucearosie.ro/uploads/Formulare/rrc%20tracing%20form%20romana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian Red Cross responds to all requests of citizens who meet the following search criteria:

- interruption of contact with relatives abroad
- locate missing relatives during international conflicts
- mediation to obtain certificates of detention, imprisonment, deportation, death
- transmission of Red Cross messages (to/from) conflict areas, where normal communication channels have been discontinued
- assistance to unaccompanied minors, following an armed conflict, to restore family links&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crucearosie.ro/activitati/cautari-persoane.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches==
In Romania, the RNRC has 47 branches, 1,996 sub-branches and 1,207 committees is making benefit of a single and unique structure, established over 130 years ago.
There exists a county branch in each of the counties of Romania, plus one for each sector of the city of Bucharest. The sub-branches are organised as one for each, city, town, commune and village.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crucearosie.ro/despre-noi/filiale.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11323">Under [[United States law]], "Biological Select Agents or Toxins" (BSATs) — or simply '''select agents''' for short — are [[bio-agent]]s which since 1997&lt;ref&gt;''Additional Requirements for Facilities Transferring or Receiving Select Agents'', Title 42 CFR Part 72 and Appendix A; 15 April 1997 (DHHS).&lt;/ref&gt; have been declared  by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) or by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) to have the "potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety". The agents are divided into (1) '''HHS select agents and toxins''' affecting humans; (2) '''USDA select agents and toxins''' affecting agriculture; and (3) '''overlap select agents and toxins''' affecting both.

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) regulates the laboratories which may possess, use, or transfer select agents within the United States in its '''Select Agent Program''' (SAP) — also called the '''Federal Select Agent Program''' (FSAP) — since 2001. The SAP was established to satisfy requirements of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] of 2001 and the [[Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act|Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002]], which were enacted in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent [[2001 anthrax attacks]].

Using BSATs in biomedical research prompts concerns about [[Dual-use technology|dual use]]. The federal government created the [[National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity]] which promotes biosecurity in [[life science]] research.  It is composed of government, education and industry experts who provide policy recommendations on ways to minimize the possibility that knowledge and technologies emanating from biological research will be misused to threaten public health or national security.

==Regulation==
The CDC has regulated the laboratories which may possess, use, or transfer select agents within the United States under the SAP since 2001. The SAP was established to satisfy requirements of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] of 2001 and the [[Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act|Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002]], which were enacted in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent [[2001 anthrax attacks]].

==Violations==
In July 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Roos, Robert (2015), [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/07/cdc-dod-anthrax-errors-involved-575-shipments "CDC: DoD anthrax errors involved 575 shipments'], ''[[CIDRAP]] News'' (18 July issue).&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory E. Demske, chief counsel to the inspector general in the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), testified that 30 civil violations of the SAP rules had been identified in the past 13 years, and that violators had paid about $2.4 million in fines. He explained that when the CDC's [[Division of Select Agents and Toxins]] detects possible SAP misconduct by an HHS worker, it coordinates with the OIG to gather facts; if it concludes that a civil violation might have occurred, it turns the case over to the OIG for possible enforcement. But if it suspects a crime, it pursues the matter with the FBI. Since passage of the Bioterrorism Act of 2002, the OIG had received 68 referrals from the CDC for possible Select Agent enforcement and found violations in 30 of those cases. Notices of violation were sent to 5 federal entities, 3 universities, and 2 other private organizations, all unnamed in his testimony. Demske remarked that no federal agencies had been fined for SAP violations.

==List of Select Agents==

:'''''Tier 1''' BSATs are indicated by an asterisk (*).&lt;ref&gt;Select agent regulations were revised in October 2012 to designate thirteen "Tier 1" agents with a documented risk of causing a high consequence event higher than other BSATs. Criteria for Tier 1 status were (1) Ability to produce a mass casualty event or devastating effects to the economy; (2) Communicability; (3) Low infectious dose; and (4) History of or current interest in weaponization based on threat reporting. In the same revision Chapare virus, Lujo virus, and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were added to the list of select agents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5166">'''Skevophylax Georges Zervos''', also known as '''Skevos Zervos''' ({{lang-el|Σκευοφύλαξ Γεώργιος Ζερβός}}, 1875–1966) was a prominent Greek Professor; a pioneer surgeon in [[Organ transplantation|Transplant]]s and [[Telemedicine]], who became a local and national benefactor in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.%24b584268;size=125;view=image;page=root;seq=90;num=87 | title=A Catalogue of Paris Peace Conference delegation propaganda in the Hoover War Library, | publisher=Stanford University Press | author=Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace | year=1926 | page=87 | volume=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skevos was born and raised in Kalymnos City or Pothia, the capital of the island [[Kalymnos]], [[Greece]]. Skevos was a member of a local wealthy, influential, distinguished and aristocratic family on the island. The family of Skevos had built the local hospital and local orphanage on the island, and through this they became local benefactors.

His brother was a local prominent citizen called Kleanthes Zervos and his nephew was the local Christian Bishop of Kalymnos, Nikephoros Zervos whom in 1905 founded and established the Nikephoros High School, the first high school set up in Kalymnos. In front of the high school, there is a statue bust dedicated to Nikephoros Zervos.

Skevos in his student years was a traditional free naked sponge diver in Kalymnos. Skevos dived with a traditional and multi-purpose tool called a Skandalopetra, which was used as a steering wheel/base tied as a line of communication with the boat. Diving for sponges is a part of the traditional diving heritage of Greece and the [[Aegean Sea]].

In 1910, Skevos was the first surgeon to perform the testicle transplantation from an ape to a man. This operation was successful. In 1934, this surgery was officially recognised by the [[Russia]]n Surgeon [[Serge Voronoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Skevos Zervos (1875-1966) and the first transplants of monkey testicles to a man | author=Androutsos G. | pmid=15726751 | year=2004 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=449–56 | journal=Histoire des sciences medicales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Skevos assisted the Greek Politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] who traveled to the Paris Peace Conference in regaining the [[Dodecanese]] as a part of the modern state of Greece. On March 7, 1948, he was a paragon of the Central Dodecanese Committee and was present in [[Rhodes]], when the [[United Nations]], returned the Dodecanese region to the then government of Greece.

Skevos was a Medical Professor of the School of Medicine at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]]. There Skevos developed a system that allowed him to examine a patient from a distance. This examination was concerning auscultation and cardiac pulses. The data could be transmitted in any place around the world. Virtues of the system were demonstrated in several experiments conducted in plenary sessions of the Athens Medical Society at the National [[University of Athens]], at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] and at the [[Athens Academy]] during the signals were transmitted from several Athens hospitals and various Greek cities. His scientific research was published in the ''Annals of the Athens Medical Society'' (1946–1956). His system was proposed to be used on board of the Greek Ships that were offering regular service between [[Piraeus]] and [[New York City]]. The communication at this time could not be afforded and the system was not used.

Skevos in his elder years married, however he had no children. In his honor the "disease of the naked sponge divers" was named "Skevos Zervos disease". As a posthumous honor, the local Kalymnian Government erected a life-size statue of him.

{{H5N1}}
:''See [[Influenza pandemic]] for government preparation for an H5N1 pandemic''
The '''social impact of H5N1''' is the effect or influence of [[H5N1]] in human society; especially the financial, political, social, and personal responses to both actual and predicted deaths in birds, humans, and other animals. Billions of dollars are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential [[avian influenza]] pandemic. Over ten billion dollars have been lost and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1. People have reacted by buying less chicken causing poultry sales and prices to fall. Many individuals have stockpiled supplies for a possible flu pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On November 1, 2005 President George W. Bush unveiled the National Strategy To Safeguard Against The Danger of Pandemic Influenza&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html Whitehouse.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109011356/http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; backed by a request to Congress for $7.1 billion to begin implementing the plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html State.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914184240/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html |date=2006-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2006 donor nations pledged two billion US dollars to combat bird flu at the two-day International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2006/2006-01-18-02.asp Newswire]&lt;/ref&gt; Over ten billion dollars have been spent and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12033509/ MSNBC] [http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf US AID] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815071811/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf |date=2008-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', due to the H5N1 threat, as of March 2006: "governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin NYT]&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment strategies are being altered to manage the effects of H5N1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.bmo.com/news/article/0,1257,contentCode-4922_divId-4_langId-1_navCode-112,00.html BMO Financial Group]&lt;/ref&gt; This changes the valuations of trillions of dollars' worth of stocks worldwide as investors move assets in accordance with both fears and hopes.

Poultry farming practices have changed due to H5N1:
*killing millions of poultry
*[[Vaccination|vaccinating]] poultry against bird flu
*vaccinating poultry workers against [[human flu]]
*limiting travel in areas where H5N1 is found
*increasing farm hygiene
*reducing contact between [[livestock]] and wild birds
*reducing open-air [[wet market]]s
*limiting workers contact with [[Cockfight|cock fighting]]
*reducing purchases of live fowl
*improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php Council on Foreign Relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013053617/http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, after nearly two years of using mainly culling to control the virus, the [[Vietnam]] government in 2005 adopted a combination of mass poultry vaccination, disinfecting, culling, information campaigns and bans on live poultry in cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T080147Z_01_HAN5054_RTRUKOC_0_UK-BIRDFLU-VIETNAM.xml Reuters]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} article ''Vietnam to unveil advanced plan to fight bird flu'' published on April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down due to fears from H5N1 driving demand below supply, resulting in devastating losses for many poultry farmers. Poor poultry farmers can't afford mandated measures keeping their bird livestock from contact with wild birds (and other measures) thus risking losing their livelihood altogether. Multinational poultry farming is increasingly becoming a profit loser as H5N1 achieves status as endemic in wild birds worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/a13fd43bc74b6209dc90f6d849ffa45b.htm Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial ruin for poor poultry farmers, that can be as severe as threatening starvation, has caused some to commit suicide and many others to stop cooperating with efforts to deal with H5N1; further increasing the human toll, the spread of the disease and the chances for a pandemic mutation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/BKK260524.htm Reuters] article ''Cambodian ostracised for reporting bird flu'' published on April 12, 2006.

==Political==
[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US HHS]] Secretary [[Michael O. Leavitt]] has said "Everything you say in advance of a [[pandemic]] is [[alarmist]]; anything you do after it starts is inadequate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |title=Virginia Pandemic Influenza Summit informs community partners about pandemic influenza plans at the national and state level |access-date=2006-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213521/http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

H5N1, like everything else, is subject to [[spin (public relations)|political spin]]; wherein every interest group picks and chooses among the facts to support their favorite cause resulting in a distortion of the overall picture, the motivations of the people involved and the believability of the predictions.

[[Donald Rumsfeld]], formerly [[United States Secretary of Defense]], is a past board member and current minor shareholder of [[Gilead Sciences]] which owns [[intellectual property rights]] to [[Oseltamivir]] (also called "Tamiflu"). In November 2005, George W. Bush urged Congress to pass 7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which one billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.

Some believe ''The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is essentially a problem of industrial poultry practices.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grain.org/briefings/?id=194 Grain international, non-profit foundation] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4721598.stm BBC news] [http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/news/story.jsp?id=2006032808270002118201&amp;dt=20060328082700&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview= CNN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616201320/http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/news/story.jsp?id=2006032808270002118201&amp;dt=20060328082700&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview= |date=2006-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have a more nuanced position. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] article ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.:"Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1024.htm CDC] ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Robert Webster explains: "If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can't blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10639567/ MSNBC quoting Reuters quoting Robert G. Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok saying that "The issue of vaccines has to take top priority", and Julie Hall, in charge of the WHO's outbreak response in China, saying that China's vaccinations could be "masking" the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |title=China H5N1 outbreak puts vaccines under spotlight |date=17 March 2006 |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318225839/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |archive-date=18 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that Dr Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK said: "The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done, because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected; and then you get drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours' of H5N1 out there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4737276.stm BBC] ''Bird flu vaccine no silver bullet'' February 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have called for tax breaks due to H5N1. A May 7, 2006 report from India E-News states that: "Pakistani poultry farmers have sought a 10-year tax exemption to support their dwindling business after the detection of the H5N1 strain of bird flu triggered a fall in demand and prices, a poultry trader said. "We have asked the government to give us tax exemption on income from the poultry business for at least 10 years to meet losses caused by the bird flu scare", Abdul Basit told DPA. Basit, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) in the country's commercial hub of Lahore, was part of a delegation of the Pakistan Poultry Association, which met food ministry officials to present their demand. The federal poultry board of the food ministry is to meet on May 9 to consider the tax-cut demand for the poultry business in the upcoming national budget due in mid-June."&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiaenews.com/2006-05/6960-pakistani-poultry-demands-10-year-tax-holiday.htm India eNews] article ''Pakistani poultry industry demands 10-year tax holiday'' published May 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social==
[[Reuters]] reported that [[WHO]] expert Hassan al-Bushra said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even now, we remain unsure about [[Tamiflu]]'s real effectiveness. As for a vaccine, work cannot start on it until the emergence of a new virus, and we predict it would take six to nine months to develop it. For the moment, we cannot by any means count on a potential vaccine to prevent the spread of a contagious influenza virus, whose various precedents in the past 90 years have been highly pathogenic. However, it is crucial that countries in the Middle East invest and start developing their own research and technical facilities, where they can produce their own drugs when the time comes rather than wait to import expensive medicines from abroad at the risk of their population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/e83d17668fc60eb55518a76c1de858fd.htm Reuters article ''MIDDLE EAST: Interview with WHO experts Hassan al-Bushra and John Jabbour''] 2 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a pandemic occurs, local response will be more important than national or international response, as every community will have its own resources swamped dealing with its own problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |title="Any community that fails to prepare with the expectation the federal government will come to the rescue will be tragically wrong." - US HHS |access-date=2006-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213521/http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International groups, nations, local governments, corporations, schools, and groups of all kinds have made plans and run drills to prepare for an H5N1 pandemic.

Online avian flu forums have received increasing attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avianflutalk.com/ Avian flu forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-help groups have organized to provide news and information about resources, aid and relief efforts in preparation for avian flu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avianfluhelp.blogspot.com/ Avian flu help]&lt;/ref&gt;

British reports warn that in response to an [[influenza pandemic]] local groups will not be able to rely on the armed forces, widespread infection could occur in days not months, an effective vaccine can not be counted on, and the huge death toll could swamp mortuaries so "A key point for local planning is likely to be the identification of potential sites for the location of facilities for the temporary storage of bodies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=508792006 Scotsman News] Report on leaked British study.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Many individuals have stockpiled supplies (Tamiflu, food, water, etc.) for a possible flu pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Many+individuals+have+stockpiled+supplies+%28Tamiflu%2C+food%2C+water%2C+etc%29+for+a+possible+flu+pandemic.&amp;btnG=Google+Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals have started web sites and companies using interest and ignorance in H5N1 to sell information, cures, and advertising space. Some even use concern over H5N1 to find victims for their [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/27/spyware_diy/ The Register] article "S'kiddies get into spyware for just $15" by John Leyden published March 27, 2006 accessed February 28, 2007 says "Spam samples trapped by internet security firm Sophos use newsworthy topics to lure unwary users. One presents itself as a warning about the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, providing links to the bogus website, purporting to offer health advice.

A significant effect of H5N1 has been personal fear concerning the unknown, even by those most in-the-know. Dr. [[David Nabarro]], chief avian flu coordinator for the United Nations, describes himself as "quite scared"; says avian flu has too many unanswered questions; and if the disease starts spreading to humans, borders will close, airports will shut down, and travelers everywhere will be stranded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/27/news/worrier.php NYT article picked up by IHT]&lt;/ref&gt; With evaluations of the threat ranging from those who say it is a hoax to those who warn of billions of humans dying, uncertainty and fear motivate personal behaviors around the world affecting many people even before the threat becomes reality.

==Pop culture==

The 1998 chart-topping hit song "[[One Week (song)|One Week]]" by [[Barenaked Ladies]] includes the lines "Chickity China the Chinese chicken / Have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'", a reference to the outbreaks of H5N1 in Hong Kong around the time the song was written.

==Compared to annual flu season==
{{main|Flu season}}
The annual flu season deaths and costs caused by viruses other than H5N1 provide a point of contrast - something to compare against. According to the United States Government, the annual flu in the United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. In addition to this human toll, influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion in the United States. A pandemic, or worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus, could dwarf this impact by overwhelming our health and medical capabilities, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of hospitalizations, and hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html Message from President Bush] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109011356/http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that: "A study by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the consequences of a severe pandemic could, in the United States, include 200 million people infected, 90 million clinically ill, and 2 million dead. The study estimates that 30 percent of all workers would become ill and 2.5 percent would die, with 30 percent of workers missing a mean of three weeks of work — resulting in a decrease in the gross domestic product of 5 percent. Furthermore, 18 million to 45 million people would require outpatient care, and economic costs would total approximately $675 billion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/13/1411 New England Journal of Medicine] Volume 354:1411-1413 - March 30, 2006 - Number 13 - ''Vaccines against Avian Influenza — A Race against Time''&lt;/ref&gt; One study concludes that a pandemic that reduced the available dock workers by 28% would cut the throughput capacity for containers arriving at American ports on the West coast by 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Pandemic influenza, worker absenteeism and impacts on freight transportation | From Proc 41st Hawaii Intl Conf Syst Sci, published online Apr 9 {{cite web |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FD4AC2FD-B7C8-4A13-A32C-6CF328A0C036/0/Slide4.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119194526/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FD4AC2FD-B7C8-4A13-A32C-6CF328A0C036/0/Slide4.jpg |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsimlyansk Reservoir''' or '''Tsimlyanskoye Reservoir''' ({{lang-ru|Цимля&amp;#769;нское водохрани&amp;#769;лище}}) is an artificial lake on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] in the territories of [[Rostov Oblast|Rostov]] and [[Volgograd Oblast]]s at {{coord|47|50|N|42|50|E|region:RU_type:waterbody}}. Completed in 1952, the [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] is one of the largest in [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop/EFS/photoinfo.pl?PHOTO=STS068-254-44 National Aeronautics and Space Administration] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126194450/http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop/EFS/photoinfo.pl?PHOTO=STS068-254-44 |date=2008-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing power ({{Interlanguage link multi|Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station|ru|3=Цимлянская ГЭС}} ) and [[irrigation]] to the [[Rostov]] and [[Volgograd]] regions. Crops grown around the lake include [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[maize]], [[alfalfa]], [[fruit]], [[grapes]], and [[vegetable]]s.

The reservoir, together with the [[Volga-Don Canal]] and the lower course of the Don, provides an important waterway between the [[Volga]] River / [[Caspian Sea]] basin and the [[Sea of Azov]]. The Tsimlyansk Dam also provides flood control for the lower Don River basin.

Completion of the lake resulted in strong local industrial growth. In particular, the city of [[Volgodonsk]] owes its existence to the Tsimlyansk Dam project.

Under the waters lies the ancient [[Khazar]] fortress town of [[Sarkel]].

==Navigation==
Along with the [[Volga-Don Canal]], the reservoir forms part of a waterway for the shipping of raw materials from the upper Don and [[Volga River|Volga]]-[[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] basins to the lower Don River - [[Sea of Azov]] basin and vice versa. According to the federal agency responsible for the maintenance of this waterway (Федеральное Государственное Учреждение "Волго-Донское ГБУВПиС"), guaranteed depth of the main navigable waterway through the reservoir in the navigation season of 2007 was to be maintained at no less than 3.6 meters, with the width of the navigable waterway no less than 50 meters. It was to be available for navigation for 233 days, from April 5 to November 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascorus.ru/famrt/Volgo-Don.html Программа категорий средств навигационного оборудования и сроков их работы, гарантированных габаритов судовых ходов в навигацию 2007 года по федеральному государственному учреждению "Волго-Донское ГБУВПиС"] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To descend from the reservoir to the lower Don, ships have to pass two [[ship lock]]s: the lock in the Tsimlyansky Dam itself ({{coord|47|33|05|N|42|08|06|E}}), known as Lock No. 14, followed by Lock No. 15 ({{coord|47|33|17|N|42|06|42|E}}) a couple of kilometers farther west. The locks are assigned these numbers because they are considered part of the same sequence of locks as the 13 locks on the Volga-Don Canal itself. During the navigation seasons of 2008 through 2010, the two locks are scheduled to operate from April 2 through December 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascorus.ru/navig_2008_new.html Сроки работы шлюзов] (Lock operation periods), from the site of the Russian Shipping Companies' Association. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with some other countries, [[water fluoridation]] in the United States is a contentious issue. As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation. On January 25, 1945, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], became the first community in the United States to fluoridate its drinking water to prevent tooth decay.

Fluoridation became an official policy of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lennon MA |title=One in a million: the first community trial of water fluoridation |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=759–60 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17128347 |pmc=2627472 |doi=10.2471/BLT.05.028209}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population.&lt;ref name=US-CDC-WF-Stats-2006&gt;{{cite web |author= Division of Oral Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC |title= Water fluoridation statistics for 2006 |url=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2006stats.htm |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of 2012, 67.1% of the U.S. population were getting water from community water systems (CWS) supplying water that had fluoride at or above recommended levels.  Those included the 3.5% of the population that were on CWS with naturally occurring fluoride at or above recommended levels.  74.6% of those on CWS were receiving water with fluoride at or above recommended levels.&lt;ref name=US-CDC-WF-Stats-2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2012stats.htm |title=Community Water Fluoridation --- 2012 Water Fluoridation Statistics |work=www.cdc.gov |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. regulations for [[bottled water]] do not require disclosing fluoride content.&lt;ref name=Hobson/&gt; A survey of bottled water in Cleveland and in Iowa, published in 2000, found that most had fluoride levels well below the 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L level common in tap waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumandier JA, Ayers LW |title=Fluoride and bacterial content of bottled water vs tap water |journal=Archives of Family Medicine |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=246–50 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10728111 |url=http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10728111 |doi=10.1001/archfami.9.3.246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily00&gt;{{cite web |title=Study Finds Some Bottled Water Has More Bacteria And Less Fluoride Than Tap Water |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/03/000322090356.htm |date=March 22, 2000 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |work=www.sciencedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of water fluoridation}}
[[Image:McKayandBlackCDC01.jpg|thumb|right|1909 photograph by Frederick McKay of [[Greene Vardiman Black]] (left) and Isaac Burton and F.Y. Wilson, studying the Colorado Brown Stain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William A. |last=Douglas |title=History of Dentistry in Colorado, 1859–1959 |year=1959 |page=199 |location=Denver |publisher=Colorado State Dental Assn |hdl=2027/mdp.39015055618535}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Community water fluoridation in the United States is partly due to the research of Dr. Frederick McKay, who pressed the dental community for an investigation into what was then known as "Colorado Brown Stain."&lt;ref name="csdshistory"&gt;[http://www.cs-ds.org/history.asp#fluoride History of Dentistry in the Pikes Peak Region], [http://www.cs-ds.org/index.asp Colorado Springs Dental Society] webpage, page accessed February 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The condition, now known as [[dental fluorosis]], when in its severe form is characterized by cracking and pitting of the teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidr.nih.gov/dev/deleted_files/flouride.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=7&amp;questionID=4858 McGraw-Hill's AccessScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5295412 Report Judges Allowable Fluoride Levels in Water : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Of 2,945 children examined in 1909 by Dr. McKay, 87.5% had some degree of stain or mottling.  All the affected children were from the [[Pikes Peak]] region.  Despite the negative impact on the physical appearance of their teeth, the children with stained, mottled and pitted teeth also had fewer cavities than other children.  McKay brought this to the attention of [[Greene Vardiman Black]], and Black's interest was followed by greater interest within the dental profession.

Initial hypotheses for the staining included poor nutrition, overconsumption of pork or milk, [[radium]] exposure, [[List of childhood diseases|childhood disease]]s, or a [[calcium]] deficiency in the local drinking water.&lt;ref name="csdshistory" /&gt; In 1931, researchers from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) concluded that the cause of the [[Colorado]] stain was a high concentration of fluoride ions in the region's drinking water (ranging from 2 to 13.7&amp;nbsp;mg/L) and areas with lower concentrations had no staining (1&amp;nbsp;mg/L or less).&lt;ref&gt;Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/bauxite.htm "The Bauxite Story – A look at ALCOA"], from the [http://www.fluoride-history.de Fluoride History] website, page accessed May 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Pikes Peak's rock formations contained the mineral [[cryolite]], one of whose constituents is fluorine.  As the rain and snow fell, the resulting runoff water dissolved fluoride which made its way into the water supply.

[[Dentistry|Dental]] and aluminum [[researchers]] then moved toward determining a relatively safe level of [[fluoride]] to be added to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of fluorosis, and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add fluoride in order to help prevent [[tooth decay]]. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.&lt;ref name=US-CDC-WF-Stats-2006 /&gt;

In April 2015, fluoride levels in the United States were lowered for the first time in 50 years, to the minimum recommended levels of 0.7ppm, because too much fluoride exposure has become a common issue for children teeth, visible in the form of white splotches. The basis were the results of two national surveys (1999–2004 NHANES) which assessed the prevalence of dental fluorosis, and found that two out of five adolescents had tooth streaking or spottiness on their teeth - an increase of mostly very mild or mild forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/fluoride-levels-us-drinking-water-lowered-splotchy-teeth|title=US lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for first time in over 50 years|date=27 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=18 May 2017 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/|title=U.S. Public Health Service Recommendation for Fluoride Concentration in Drinking Water for the Prevention of Dental Caries|publisher=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early studies ===
[[Image:H-Trendley-Dean.jpeg|thumb|left|[[H. Trendley Dean]] set out in 1931 to study fluoride's harm, but by 1950 had demonstrated the benefits of small amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Division of Oral Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC |title= Achievements in public health, 1900–1999: Fluoridation of drinking water to prevent dental caries |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=48 |issue=41 |pages=933–40 |year=1999 |pmid= |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4841a1.htm}} Contains [http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4841bx.htm H.

A study of varying amounts of fluoride in water was led by Dr. [[H. Trendley Dean]], a dental officer of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, H.T.

''Journal of the American Dental Association'', 16, 1269 – 1273, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 and 1937, Dr. Dean and other dentists compared statistics from [[Amarillo]], which had 2.8 – 3.9&amp;nbsp;mg/L fluoride content, and low fluoride [[Wichita Falls]].  The data is alleged to show fewer cavities in Amarillo children, but the studies were never published.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[http://www.fluoride-history.de/bartlett.htm Questionable Fluoride Safety Studies: Bartlett – Cameron, Newburgh – Kingston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Dean's research on the fluoride-dental caries relationship, published in 1942, included 7,000 children from 21 cities in [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]].  The study concluded that the optimal amount of fluoride which minimized the risk of severe fluorosis but had positive benefits for tooth decay was 1&amp;nbsp;mg per day, per adult.  Although fluoride is more abundant in the environment today, this was estimated to [[correlate]] with the concentration of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

In 1937, dentists Henry Klein and Carroll E. Palmer had considered the possibility of fluoridation to prevent cavities after their evaluation of data gathered by a Public Health Service team at dental examinations of Native American children.&lt;ref&gt;Klein H., Palmer C.E.: "Dental caries in American Indian children", Public Health Bulletin, No. 239, Dec. 1937&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of papers published afterwards (1937–1941), yet disregarded by his colleagues within the U.S.P.H.S., Klein summarized his findings on tooth development in children and related problems in epidemiological investigations on caries prevalence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 1939, Dr. Gerald J. Cox&lt;ref&gt;Meiers, Peter: [http://www.fluoride-history.de/cox.htm  "Gerald Judy Cox"].&lt;/ref&gt; conducted laboratory tests using [[rat]]s that were fed aluminum and fluoride. Dr. Cox suggested adding fluoride to drinking water (or other media such as milk or bottled water) in order to improve oral health.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G.J., M.C. Matuschak, S.F. Dixon, M.L. Dodds, W.E.

In the mid-1940s, four widely cited studies were conducted.  The researchers investigated cities that had both fluoridated and unfluoridated water.  The first pair was [[Muskegon, Michigan]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], making Grand Rapids the first community in the world to add fluoride to its drinking water to try to benefit dental health on January 25, 1945.&lt;ref name="mntmichigan"&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=27595 After 60 Years of Success, Water Fluoridation Still Lacking in Many Communities].

In 1952 Nebraska Representative A.L. Miller complained that there had been no studies carried out to assess the potential adverse health risk to [[senior citizens]], [[pregnant women]], or people with [[chronic diseases]] from exposure to the fluoridation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; A decrease in the incidence of tooth decay was found in some of the cities which had added fluoride to water supplies. The early comparison studies would later be criticized as, "primitive," with a, "virtual absence of quantitative, statistical methods...nonrandom method of selecting data and...high sensitivity of the results to the way in which the study populations were grouped..." in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark, "The mystery of declining tooth decay" ''Nature'', July 10, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Water fluoridation}}
As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/benefits.htm The Benefits of Fluoride], from the [https://www.cdc.gov/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] website, accessed March 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2002 study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cdc.gov/nohss/FluoridationV.asp Fluoridation Status: Percentage of U.S. Population on Public Water Supply Systems Receiving Fluoridated Water], from the [https://www.cdc.gov Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] website, accessed March 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 67% of U.S. residents were living in communities with fluoridated water at that time.

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] has identified community water fluoridation as one of ten great public health achievements of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/ Community Water Fluoridation]&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC recommends water fluoridation at a level of 0.7–1.2&amp;nbsp;mg/L, depending on climate. The CDC also advises parents to monitor use of fluoride toothpaste, and use of water with fluoride concentrations above 2&amp;nbsp;mg/L, in children up to age 8.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs.htm  Community Water Fluoridation FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a CDC database for researching the water fluoridation status of neighborhood water.&lt;ref name=cdcMWF&gt;{{cite web |title=Oral Health Data Systems --- My Water's Fluoride |url=http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/MWF/index.asp |work=www.cdc.gov |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, 70% of people polled in a survey conducted by the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) believed community water should be fluoridated, with 18% disagreeing and the rest undecided.&lt;ref&gt;American Dental Association Survey Center. 1998 consumers' opinions regarding community water fluoridation. Chicago, Illinois: American Dental Association, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, the [[American Dental Association|ADA]] began recommending to parents that [[infants]] from 0 through 12 months of age should have their [[formula]] prepared with water that is fluoride-free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis.&lt;ref&gt;What is the ADA’s interim guidance on infant formula and fluoride? American Dental Association Website accessed May 28, 2008 [http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fluoride/infantsformula_faq.asp#2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether or not to fluoridate water supplies frequently arises in local governments.  For example, on November 8, 2005, citizens of [[Mt. Pleasant, Michigan]] voted 63% to 37% in favor of reinstating fluoridation in public drinking water after a 2004 ballot initiative ceased water fluoridation in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, Stacie.  [http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/pubs/adanews/adanewsarticle.asp?articleid=1684 "Michigan town votes to return fluoridation"] November 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, voters in Xenia, Ohio; Springfield, Ohio; Bellingham, Washington; and Tooele City, Utah all rejected water fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noforcedfluoride.org No Forced Fluoride in Bellingham, Washington (Fluoride)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Skagit County]] in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], the [[county commissioners]] in 2007 voted 2 to 1 to order the local public utility district to begin fluoridating the public water supply by Jan. 2009. $1.2 million was to be provided by the privately funded Washington Dental Service Foundation to begin building the equipment needed to add fluoride to the Judy Reservoir, which supplies the majority of Skagit Valley's water [[customers]].  The source and type of fluoride to be added to the drinking water of more than 70,000 citizens had not been disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goskagit.com/home/article/state_attorney_general_says_board_can_require_fluoridation/ goskagit.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2009, Skagit County commissioners rescinded the 2007 order, citing costs and possible lawsuits.&lt;ref name=SVH021009&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Commissioners vote to halt fluoride program|url=http://www.goskagit.com/home/article/commissioners_vote_to_halt_fluoride_program/|publisher=Skagit Valley Herald|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of adding fluoridation to the water of 44 Florida communities has been researched by the State Health Office in Tallahassee.&lt;ref name="RingelbergCost"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ringelberg ML, Allen SJ, Brown LJ |title=Cost of fluoridation: 44 Florida communities |journal=Journal of Public Health Dentistry |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=75–80 |year=1992 |pmid=1564695 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-7325.1992.tb02247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In communities with a population of over 50,000 people, fluoridation costs were estimated at 31 cents per person per year. The estimated cost rises to $2.12 per person in areas with a population below 10,000.

== Decisions about water fluoridation ==
Many political and popular entities and activities determine whether fluoride is added to water supplies.  Those include courts, local governments, [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|popular referenda]], and [[Water board#United States|water authorities]].

=== Court cases ===
Fluoridation has been the subject of many [[Legal case|court cases]] wherein activists have sued municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical treatment and [[due process]] are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Cross2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cross DW, Carton RJ |title=Fluoridation: a violation of medical ethics and human rights |journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=24–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12749628 |doi=10.1179/107735203800328830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation.&lt;ref name="beck"/&gt;  To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pratt E, Rawson RD, Rubin M |title=Fluoridation at fifty: what have we learned? |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics |volume=30 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=117–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12508513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early cases ====
A flurry of cases were heard in numerous state courts across the U.S. in the 1950s during the early years of water fluoridation.  State courts consistently held in favor of allowing fluoridation to continue, analogizing fluoridation to mandatory vaccination and the use of other chemicals to clean the public water supply, both of which had a long-standing history of acceptance by courts.

In 1952, a [[Code of Federal Regulations|Federal Regulation]] was adopted that stated in part, "The [[Federal Security Agency]] will regard water supplies containing fluorine, within the limitations recommended
by the Public Health Service, as not actionable under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]."&lt;ref&gt;17 Fed. Reg. 6743 (July 23, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--what exactly did this do?--&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Oklahoma]] analogized water fluoridation to mandatory vaccination in a 1954 case.&lt;ref name="dowell"&gt;273 P.2d 859, 862–63 (Okl. 1954) (available at [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=ok&amp;vol=/supreme/1954/&amp;invol=1954OK194 FindLaw for Legal Professionals])&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted, "we think the weight of well-reasoned modern precedent sustains the right of municipalities to adopt such reasonable and undiscriminating measures to improve their water supplies as are necessary to protect and improve the public health, even though no epidemic is imminent and no contagious disease or virus is directly involved .... To us it seems ridiculous and of no consequence in considering the public health phase of the case that the substance to be added to the water may be classed as a mineral rather than a drug, antiseptic or germ killer; just as it is of little, if any, consequence whether fluoridation accomplishes its beneficial result to the public health by killing germs in the water, or by hardening the teeth or building up immunity in them to the bacteria that causes caries or tooth decay. If the latter, there can be no distinction on principle between it and compulsory vaccination or inoculation, which, for many years, has been well-established as a valid exercise of police power."&lt;ref name="dowell" /&gt;

In the 1955 case ''Froncek v. City of Milwaukee'', the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] affirmed the ruling of a circuit court which held that "the fluoridation is not the practice of medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy, by the City" and that "the legislation is a public health measure, bearing a real, substantial, and reasonable relation to the health of the city."&lt;ref&gt;69 N.W.2d 242, 252 (Wis. 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], in 1955's ''Kraus v. City of Cleveland'', said, "Plaintiff's argument that fluoridation constitutes mass medication, the unlawful practice of medicine and adulteration may be answered as a whole. Clearly, the addition of fluorides to the water supply does not violate such principles any more than the chlorination of water, which has been held valid many times."&lt;ref&gt;127 N.E.2d 609, 613 (Ohio 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fluoridation consensus ====
In 1973, as cases continued to be brought in state courts, a consensus developed that fluoridation, at least from a legal standpoint, was acceptable.&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973's ''Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills'', the [[California Court of Appeal]], Second District, said, "Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question."&lt;ref name="beck" /&gt;

==== Contemporary challenges ====
Much of the contemporary debate on water fluoridation revolves around questions of how consumer demand for fluoride is determined and processed, which fluoridation costs and benefits are considered, how conflicts over its provision and production are addressed or resolved, and how the merits of relevant health policies can be equally recast in terms of their presumed demerits.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lee Mendoza (2011).  Fluoride-treated water and the problem of merit goods.  ''Water Policy Journal'', 13 (1): 38–52, http://www.iwaponline.com/wp/01301/wp013010038.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lee Mendoza (2009).  Promoting Social Welfare Through Oral Health: New Jersey's Fluoridation Experience.  ''Social Work in Public Health'', 24 (6): 584-599, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19371910902911321#%2EVEvmpovF8VE%2E.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Advocates continue to make contemporary challenges to the spread of fluoridation.  For instance, in 2002, the city of [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]], California, chose to disregard a California law mandating fluoridation of water systems with 10,000 or more hookups, and the dispute between the city and the state ended up in court.  The trial court and the intermediate appellate court ruled in favor of the state and its fluoridation mandate, and the Supreme Court of California declined to hear the case in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Donna [http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/February/10/local/stories/07local.htm "Supreme Court turns down Watsonville's appeal to keep fluoride out of its water."] Santa Cruz Sentinel.  February 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2000, courts in Washington,&lt;ref&gt;Parkland Light &amp; Water Co. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Bd. of Health, 90 P.3d 37 (Wash. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;Pure Water Committee of W. MD., Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Pure Water Comm. of W. MD., Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Cumberland, MD. Not Reported in F.Supp.2d, 2003 WL 22095654 (D.Md. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and Texas&lt;ref&gt;Espronceda v. City of San Antonio, Not Reported in S.W.3d, 2003 WL 21203878 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; have reached similar conclusions.

=== State law ===
[[San Diego, California]] began water fluoridation in February 2011, despite its Municipal Code Section 67.0101, which prohibits the city from fluoridating.  The local ordinance was preempted by [[California]] law that requires fluoridation when an outside funding source is available.  In 2008, First 5 Commission of San Diego County, a state-funded child advocacy organization, provided nearly $4 million to San Diego, for fluoridation equipment and operating costs for the first two years of fluoridation.&lt;ref name="sandiego00"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.sandiego.gov/water/quality/fluoridation.shtml |title=Water Fluoridation |accessdate=December 27, 2014 |work=www.sandiego.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That organization is funded with tobacco taxes instituted by [[California Proposition 10 (1998)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://first5sandiego.org/about-first-5-san-diego/ |title=About First 5 San Diego |accessdate=December 27, 2014 |work=first5sandiego.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  San Diego raises the fluoride level of its water to 0.7&amp;nbsp;mg/L, as recommended by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]].&lt;ref name="sandiego00"/&gt;

In 2012, [[New Hampshire]] began requiring public water systems that fluoridate to post the following notice in their consumer confidence reports:  "Your public water supply is fluoridated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if your child under the age of 6 months is exclusively consuming infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water, there may be an increased chance of dental fluorosis. Consult your child's health care provider for more information."  The law was passed with overwhelming majorities in the legislature and took effect August 4.&lt;ref name=NHnotice0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-hampshire-passes-first-state-wide-fluoride-warning-law-159700895.html |title=New Hampshire Passes First State-Wide Fluoride Warning Law |date=June 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2012/hb1416.html |title=CHAPTER 122, HB 1416-LOCAL – FINAL VERSION |accessdate=January 18, 2015 |work=www.gencourt.state.nh.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local ordinances ===
On September 22, 2011, The city council of [[College Station, Texas]] voted, 6–1, against fluoridating city water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.cstx.gov/2011/09/23/city-council-meeting-summary-sept-22/ |accessdate=December 25, 2014 |title=City Council Meeting Summary (Sept. 22) |publisher=blog.cstx.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending 22 years of fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fluoride-free-dentistry.com/Texas.html |title=College Station Council Votes to End Fluoridation |accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the [[Pinellas County, Florida]] commissioners voted to stop adding fluoride to the county's public drinking water. ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' editor Tim Nickens and columnist Daniel Ruth then published a joint series of ten editorials challenging the decision in 2012, and two of the commissioners who had voted to stop fluoridation were voted out of office and replaced with candidates who had pledged to add it back.&lt;ref name="deggans-2013"&gt;{{cite news |title=Times' Tim Nickens, Daniel Ruth win Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing |last=Deggans |first=Eric |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/times-tim-nickens-daniel-ruth-win-pulitzer-prize-for-editorial-writing/2115247 |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, after a 6–1 vote, the county resumed the addition of fluoride, which the ''Times'' characterized as being "long considered the most effective method to prevent tooth decay".&lt;ref name="deggans-2013" /&gt; Nickens and Ruth were awarded the 2013 [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] for their series.&lt;ref name="deggans-2013" /&gt;

The Board of County Commissioners of [[Hernando County, Florida]] voted, 4–1, on February 25, 2014 not to begin fluoridating the county's water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hernandotoday.com/he/list/news/hernando-commissioners-say-no-to-fluoridation-20140225/ |title=Hernando commissioners say no to fluoridation |date=February 25, 2014 |accessdate=December 25, 2014 |publisher=hernandotoday.com |author=Michael D.

=== Referenda ===
On May 21, 2013, voters in [[Portland, Oregon]] decided 61–39% not to commence fluoridation of Portland's water, which is supplied to 900,000 people. It was the fourth defeat of fluoridation proposals in Portland, the first being in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-30229-portland_voters_soundly_reject_fluoride.html |title=Portland Voters Soundly Reject Fluoride |accessdate=December 25, 2014 |author=Aaron Mesh |work=Willamette Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2012, the Portland City Council unanimously passed Ordinance No. 185612, authorizing and directing the [[Portland Water Bureau]] to begin fluoridating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?a=425876&amp;c=60394 |title=2013 Referendum Petition Log, Measure 26-151 |accessdate=December 25, 2014 |publisher=City of Portland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those opposing the ordinance immediately began a petition process to hold a referendum that could reverse the ordinance. In October, it was revealed that four city council members had had undisclosed meetings with pro-fluoridation lobbyists. Public calendars of those four did not mention the meetings, except that one meeting was mentioned with a vague title. This was in violation of a city ordinance requiring the disclosure of such meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/portlandcityhall/2012/10/portland_city_council_calendar.html |title=Portland City Council calendars don't show meetings reported by fluoride lobbyists: Portland City Hall roundup |accessdate=December 25, 2014 |author=Brad Schmidt |work=The Oregonian |date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 33,000 signatures were gathered for the petition, which led to the referendum that defeated fluoridation. In the campaign, the pro-fluoridation side out-raised opponents $850,000 to $270,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/244512/why-portland-refuses-to-fluoridate-its-drinking-water |title=Why Portland refuses to fluoridate its drinking water |accessdate=December 25, 2014 |date=May 22, 2013 |author=Peter Weber |work=The Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''watermaker''' is a device used to obtain [[potable]] water by [[reverse osmosis]] of seawater. In boating and [[yachting]] circles, [[desalination|desalinators]] are often referred to as "watermakers".

==Varieties==
Many versions are used by long-distance ocean cruisers. The devices can be expensive to buy and maintain, but are a huge advantage because of the reduced need to have large [[water tank]]s for a long passage. 

Depending on the design, watermakers can be powered by electricity from the battery bank, an engine, an AC generator or hand operated. There is a portable, towed, water-powered watermaker available which converts to hand operation in an emergency.

==Water requirement==

There is great variation in the amount of water consumed.

At home in the [[United States]], each person uses about 55 gallons (208 liters) of water per day on average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/DrinkingWater/documents/waterconservation/appendib.pdf Virginia GPCD].&lt;/ref&gt; Where supplies are limited, and in emergencies, much less may be used.

Typical cruising yachts use from 4 to 20 litres (1.05 to 5.28 gallons) per person per day, the average probably being about 6 litres (1.59 gallons). The minimum water intake required to maintain body [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] is 1.5 litres (0.4 gallons) per day. The maintenance of comfort under normal circumstances requires 3% of mass body weight or typically about 2.3 litres (0.61 gallons) per person of drinking water per day.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Popular brands of yacht watermakers typically make from 2 to 150 litres per hour of operation (0.53 to 41 gallons) depending on the model.

There are strong opinions among small boat cruisers about the usefulness of these devices. The arguments may be summarised as:

===Pros===
* The user is independent of shore-based water supplies, which is especially important in remote area.
* They provide safe water when shore-based water is of uncertain quality.
* Some designs are portable and can be converted to manual operation in an emergency.
* The hand-held unit offered by one manufacturer and the towed water-powered watermaker offered by another manufacturer can be transferred to a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|liferaft]] in an emergency.

===Cons===
* They are expensive: Indicative costs are [[United States dollar|US$]]2,000 for the manual type, [[United States Dollar|US$]]3,000 for the towed water-powered type, [[United States dollar|US$]]4,000 or more for an engine-driven type (designed to be fitted to the [[inboard motor]] of the vessel), and about the same for an AC generator-driven type.
* Some types (but not all) are time-consuming and expensive to [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintain]].
* They are power hungry, except the hand-held emergency watermaker and the towed water powered type. Accordingly, these devices overcome the problem of large electric current demand. The drawbacks for the non-electric designs are that manual operation is tiring for the operator and the towed watermaker only works while the vessel is moving. 

Some manufacturers of electrically powered watermakers have [[energy recovery]] systems in their design which reduce the power consumption; however, these are typically some 50% more expensive for any similar size due to their additional complexity. As a guideline, assuming a 12V DC system, the energy recovery incorporated in those watermakers have the effect of reducing the electric current used from perhaps typically 20A to about 8A. Like any piece of equipment, it is bound to fail at some time and cause expense/anxiety.

==Technology==
All watermakers designed for small boats and yachts rely on essentially the same technology, exploiting the principle of "reverse osmosis": a high pressure pump forcing seawater through a membrane that allows water but not salt to pass.

The common comparison is that of a filter; however, as the holes in the membrane are smaller than molecules of [[sodium chloride]] (salt) and indeed smaller than bacteria, and pressures in the nature of 45-50 [[bar (unit)|bar]] are required, the process is much more complex than the common water filter or the oil filter found in automobile engines.

==Atmospheric water generator==
{{Main|Atmospheric water generator}}
The term watermaker may also refer to an [[atmospheric water generator]], a machine that extracts potable water from the humidity in air using a [[refrigeration]] or a [[desiccant]]. Condensing moisture by refrigeration requires a minimum ambient temperature of about 10-15°C (50-60˚F), while desiccant adsorbers have no such restriction. Either method is suitable for a desert climate, where water production is dependent on ambient humidity. The Negev desert in Israel, for example, has a significant average relative humidity of 64%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking Water from Air Humidity|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090605091856.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to some online sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sahara|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Sahara+Desert|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1922 article in ''[[Popular Science]]'' cites an average relative humidity of 30% for the Sahara Desert, about half the humidity in an air-conditioned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=W. H.|title=How You Can Burn 30% Less Coal and Still Keep Warm This Winter|journal=Popular Science Monthly|year=1922|volume=101|pages=32|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uo5JAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA3-PA32&amp;pg=RA3-PA32#v=onepage|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the effect of the [[dew point]] causes early mornings to have higher humidity, so that atmospheric water generation is possible even in the harshest climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrogen water maker|url=http://hydrogenwatermaker.net/|date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12060">'''Women's Health Protective Association''' (sometimes, '''Woman's Health Protective Association'''; original parent body, '''Ladies' Health Protective Association''') was a US women's organization focused on improving a city's [[public health]] and protecting the immediate neighborhood. It was founded in [[New York City]] in November 1884 as the Ladies' Health Protective Association. 

The impetus for the association occurred when a few women were annoyed by a nuisance maintained in the immediate neighborhood of their homes. They assembled in the parlor of one of the women to talk over the situation and devise some plan of concerted effort that could be brought to bear upon the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|New York City Metropolitan Board of Health]] to induce it to abate this nuisance. The result led to the formation of "The Ladies' Health Protective Association." It commanded public attention because its work was public and for the public. The meetings became important enough to have reporters assigned from the daily papers attend them, and reports appeared.{{sfn|Smith|Walton|1895|p=99}} 

Associations were formed in other cities on the same general principles. The newer associations substituted the word "woman," or "women," for " ladies," although the original charter granted by [[New York (state)|New York State]] was to "The Ladies' Health Protective Association." By 1895, the parent body decided, in view of the prejudices against the use of the word "lady", to change its name to The Woman's Health Protective Association.{{sfn|Smith|Walton|1895|p=99}}

==Manhattan, New York==
[[File:Womens Health Protective Assn font 116 jeh.jpg|thumb|Women's Health Protective Association fountain, [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]]]]
In November, 1884, eleven women residing on [[Turtle Bay, Manhattan|Beekman Hill]], whose houses were located on a high bluff overlooking the [[East River]], were so outraged at the continuance of the foul odors which polluted the atmosphere of the entire neighborhood, causing them to keep windows closed in the hottest weather, and depriving them of their right to pure air, that they resolved to investigate the cause of this nuisance. Accordingly, they made a tour of the neighborhood, in that section of the city known as the [[abattoir]] district, which extends on [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] from Forty-third Street to [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th Street]]. Their first visit was a revelation, and while they returned to their homes ill from the inspection and the discovery of the nuisance, they decided that some action must be taken to better the conditions. The following morning their number was increased to fifteen, and it was resolved that these women should form themselves into an organization, to be known as the Ladies' Health Protective Association.{{sfn|Committee on municipal administration|1898|p=439}}

They found that relief would require more than protests, and probably a struggle of some months, at least, with official greed and public indifference. For efficiency, they formed an association afterwards christened “The Ladies Health Protective Association of New York”. Only after ten years of persistent effort was their original purpose accomplished. In the meantime, however, they accomplished other things no less important. They demonstrated woman's power and fitness to cope with these questions. They formed committees to investigate the water supply, gas houses, school hygiene, street cleaning, garbage disposal, sewer system, [[sanitation]] of prisons and tenements, and in several instances influenced the legislature to pass sanitary laws.{{sfn|Ohio State Board of Health|1896|p=341}} The group's first convention occurred May 14-15, 1896 at the [[New York Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="archive.org1896"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ladies' Health Protective Association|title=First Convention of the Ladies' Health Protective Association of New York : Academy of Medicine|url=https://archive.org/details/firstconventiono00ladi|publisher=Ladies' Health Protective Association|accessdate=26 January 2017|date=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A marble stele and drinking fountain, designed by [[Bruno Louis Zimm]] were placed at [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] and [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] in 1909 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the organization.&lt;ref name="nycgovparks.org/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Riverside Park|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/riverside-park/monuments/1723|publisher=New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brooklyn, New York==
{{Quote box

The [[Brooklyn]] association was organized in March, 1890, and incorporated April 2,1890, with a voluntary secretary. Annual dues of US$1 supported the society. There 25 members of the board of directors, with an executive committee of seven, meeting once a month. The departments of work were: municipal, legal, lecture, press, and house. The Association had no organ of its own, but came in touch with its workers, who could attend the monthly meetings of the board of directors. The society was non-partisan and had neighborhood or branch associations in election districts.{{sfn|Tolman|1895|p=174}} 

Some of its accomplishments were: cleaner streets, because of boxes for waste placed on the street-corners; cleaner cars, due to placards prohibiting spitting on the floor; increased interest in the cleanliness and health of the city on the part of the women; and the initial movement resulting in the overthrow of the ring rule in 1893.{{sfn|Tolman|1895|p=174}} In 1893, they played an important role in the election of Hon. [[Charles A. Schieren]] for mayor.{{sfn|Ohio State Board of Health|1896|p=341}}

The Association originated in the thought of its president, who desired to see Brooklyn made a cleaner and more attractive city, through a more patriotic interest on the part of the women. A meeting was called to consider to what extent women are responsible for the condition of the streets, and that conference led to the organization of the Women's Health Protective Association of Brooklyn, somewhat on the lines of the older Association of the same name in New York. It grew steadily in four years, numbering 450 paying members, while a much larger number were actively engaged in extending its influence and carrying out its principles.{{sfn|Tolman|1895|p=174}} In 1896, there were 1,000 members with five local branches.{{sfn|Ohio State Board of Health|1896|p=341}}

==Philadelphia, Pennsylvania==
{{Quote box

When we consider that every life saved to our city means just so much added to the world's working force; when we think of the amount of misery caused in each home by every case of sickness; the enormous amount of capital invested in huge institutions to take care of people after they are sick, and when we know that if the principles for which each committee stands are carried out, a far greater result will be obtained in preventing misery and wretchedness, by preventing sickness than can possibly result from an attempt to heal after the misery has come, we faintly realize the magnitude and importance of the work we have attempted.”{{sfn|Ohio State Board of Health|1896|p=341}}

The Woman's Health Protective Association of [[Philadelphia]] organized in 1893 as a committee of the [[New Century Club (Philadelphia)|New Century Club]]. This association seems to have established its work on a broader and more comprehensive basis and extended its influence along longer lines than others. 

The first committee to get to work was that on contagious diseases, whose activities included the endorsement of a bill in the state legislature providing for inspection of all cattle farms in the state, with reference to their sanitary condition and the prevention of tuberculosis; also, the establishment of a pay hospital for contagious diseases. The street cleaning and garbage committee personally visited the slum districts every week. Other committees included water supply and a sweating system. A trolley committee urged the importance to public health of running more cars, to avoid overcrowding, of vestibules for protection of motormen, the adopting of fenders, longer straps to accommodate women and children, and conspicuous signs forbidding expectoration. A literature committee studied the literature of the day for all matters pertaining to sanitary subjects.{{sfn|Ohio State Board of Health|1896|p=341}}

==National organization==
A national convention was held in Philadelphia May 3, 1897, with delegates from forty clubs and societies, the majority representing health protective or village improvement associations. The Woman's Health Protective Association of the United States was formed, with [[Olive Pond Amies]] as president.{{sfn|Croly|1898|p=1046}}

[[File:ICS Lima.svg|thumb|[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] "Lima", also called the "Yellow Jack" when flown in harbor, now means "ship is under quarantine".]]

In [[International maritime signal flags]], plain yellow, green, and even black flags have been used to symbolize disease in both ships and ports, with the color yellow having a longer historical precedent, as a color of marking for houses of infection, previous to its use as a maritime marking color for disease.

The present flag used for the purpose is the "Lima" ('''L''') flag, which is a mixture of yellow and black flags previously used. It is sometimes called the "yellow jack", which became a name for [[yellow fever]]. Cholera ships also used a yellow flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackowiak|first=Philip A.|last2=Sehdev|first2=Paul S.|date=November 2002|title=The Origin of Quarantine|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=35|issue=9|pages=1071–1072|doi=10.1086/344062|issn=1058-4838|pmid=12398064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plain yellow flag ("Quebec" or '''Q''' in [[international maritime signal flags]]), perhaps derives its letter symbol for its initial use in '''q'''uarantine, but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite—a ship that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and inspection by Port State Control to allow the grant of [[Pratique|"free pratique"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/xf~q.html|title=Quarantine Flag|website=Flagspot.net|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plain yellow flags are still commonly used to mark a recent death in a neighborhood in cities such as [[Jakarta]], regardless of the cause. They are placed in intersections leading to the home of the recently deceased as direction markers for mourners, and to mark the [[Funeral procession|funeral convoy]] so that it is given the [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right of way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://doingbusinessinindonesia.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/yellow-flag-in-jakarta-powerful-and-unstoppable/|title=Yellow flag in Jakarta, powerful and unstoppable|date=2013-07-24|work=Live in Indonesia|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
