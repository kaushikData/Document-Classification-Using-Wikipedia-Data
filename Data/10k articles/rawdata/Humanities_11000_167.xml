The '''Africa Alphabet''' (also '''International African Alphabet''' or '''IAI alphabet''') was developed by the [[International African Institute| International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]] in 1928, with the help of some Africans led by [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann]], who served as director of the organization from 1926 until 1939. Meanwhile, the aim of the '''International Institute of African Languages and Cultures''', later known as [[International African Institute]] (IAI), was to enable people to write all the [[African languages]] for practical and scientific purposes without the need of [[diacritic]]s. It is based on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] with a few differences, such as ''j'' and ''y'', which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in English.

This alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many African languages (serving "as the basis for the transcription" of about 60, by one count&lt;ref&gt;Sow, Alfa I., and Mohamed H. Abdulaziz, "Language and Social Change," Ch. 18 in Ali A. Mazrui (ed.) Africa Since 1935 (UNESCO General History of Africa, Vol. 8). University of California Press, 1993. P. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;), but not all, and discussions of harmonization of systems of transcription that led to, among other things, adoption of the [[African reference alphabet]].

The African Alphabet was used, with the International Phonetic Alphabet, as a basis for the [[World Orthography]].

[[File:Bush at the American Competitiveness Initiative 2006.jpg|thumb|President George W. Bush participates in a Panel on the American Competitiveness Initiative at Cisco Systems, Inc in San Jose, California, Friday, April 21, 2006.]]

The '''American Competitiveness Initiative''' (ACI) is a [[federal assistance]] program intended to help America maintain its competitiveness through investment in research and development (R&amp;D) and education.  The ACI’s focus is on programs that are likely to strengthen U.S. competitiveness by targeting funding to agencies that support research in the physical sciences.  [[NASA]], however, is not included in the ACI.

In partnership with the private sector, state and local governments, and colleges and universities, the ACI hopes to promote new levels of educational achievement and economic productivity.

== Background ==
In October 2005, the National Academies of Science released a report that revealed how U.S. technological leadership and export are currently under threat. As an example, the report cited that out of the 120 chemical plants built around the world worth $1 billion or more, one is constructed in the United States but 50 are in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India and China: An Advanced Technology Race and how the United States Should Respond|last=Preeg|first=Ernest|publisher=Manufacturer Alliance|year=2008|isbn=9780974567433|location=Arlington, VA|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization stressed that "the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-mccready/is-america-on-the-right-p_b_64003.html|title=Is America On The Right Path?|last=McCready|first=Mike|date=2007-09-11|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months after the publication of the report, ACI was announced in President [[George W. Bush]]’s [[State of the Union Address]] given on January 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2006_presidential_documents&amp;docid=pd06fe06_txt-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In his statement, the President said: "Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hard-working, ambitious people - and we are going to keep that edge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Charge Kept: The Record of the Bush Presidency 2001 - 2009|last=Bush|first=George|publisher=Morgan James Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781600377877|location=New York|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Initiative committed $5.9 billion ($1.3 billion in new Federal funding, and an additional $4.6 billion in R&amp;D tax incentives) in [[Fiscal year|FY]] 2007 to increase investments in [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], strengthen education, and encourage [[entrepreneurship]].  Over ten years, the Initiative plans to commit $50 billion to increase funding for research and $86 billion for R&amp;D [[Tax incentive|tax incentives]].&lt;ref name="eda"&gt;http://www.eda.gov/PDF/EDAUpdate_0206.html&lt;/ref&gt; Key programs under the ACI include:

* more rigorous math courses with new programs for elementary and middle school students and research-based instruction;
* in-service development of new Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate teachers in schools that serve low-income families; and 
* preservice development for 30,000 math and science professionals who will become adjunct high school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State strategies and practices for educational technology|last=Mitchell|first=Karen|last2=Bakia|first2=Marianne|last3=Yang|first3=Edith|publisher=Education Publications Center|year=2007|isbn=9781422325070|location=Jessup, MD|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACI was signed into law in 2007 and has since been replaced by the [[America COMPETES Act]]. The cutoff date for grants appropriated and funded by this bill was December 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/attachments/108276/public/ACI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anvil firing launch.jpg|thumb|An anvil being fired]]
'''Anvil firing''' (also known in the USA as an ''anvil launching'' or an ''anvil shooting''&lt;ref&gt;“Anvil Shooting,” Tennessee Folk Series, Tennessee Arts Commission, The National Education Association and the Public Broadcasting System Radio Series, 1977-79.&lt;/ref&gt;) in the USA is the practice of firing an [[anvil]] into the air with [[gunpowder]]. In the UK this is where black powder is filled onto the top of the Anvil and ignited. If the Anvil did not shatter it was deemed safe to use. 

[[File:Anvil firing prep.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A prepared anvil. Gun powder is in a chamber between the anvils and [[visco fuse]] ]]
Typically, two anvils are used: one as a base (placed upside down), and another one (also known as the "flier") as the [[projectile]] (placed right-side up, atop the base).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Angie |editor1-last=Cheek |editor2-first=Lacy Hunter |editor2-last=Nix |others=Foxfire Fund |title= The Foxfire 40th anniversary book : faith, family, and the land |url= |year=2006 |publisher= Anchor Books|location= |language= |isbn=978-0-307-27551-6 |oclc= 65538811 |pages=193–196 |chapter=Anvil Shooting |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PohdYKIXMrYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22Anvil+shooting%22+Foxfire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OIcxTdEaEv&amp;sig=HMCzEHqZiOd9LsxJiPel-3T_hXo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FyanTMaZM4nJnAfJp8jZDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, a single anvil can be fired from a [[Rock (geology)|stone]] base. The space formed by the anvil's concave base is filled with [[black powder]] (not modern [[double-base powder|gunpowder]]s, which have much higher energy densities) and a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] is made to project out. The fuse is lit, and the resulting [[deflagration]] (the rapid [[combustion]] of the powder rather than [[detonation]]) sends the projectile anvil several feet into the air.

An alternative method is to place the bottom anvil upside down, and fill the hardy hole with black powder. A torus or [[washer (hardware)|washer]], often made from a [[playing card]], is placed over the hole, with a space for a fuse or powder trail. The top anvil is placed upside down, face to face with the bottom anvil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=A Tennessee folklore sampler : selections from the Tennessee folklore society bulletin, 1935-2009 |url= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= |month= |origyear= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=131 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anvil firing was once commonly performed in the [[Southern United States]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} as a substitute for [[fireworks]] during celebrations. One such noteworthy celebration was held on the day the state of [[Texas]] voted to [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. On February 23, 1861, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] and prominent [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] supporter, [[Thomas Lopton Campbell Jr.]], was held captive and forced to "fire the anvils" in the streets of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anvils were also traditionally fired on [[St Clement's Day|St. Clement's Day]], honoring [[Pope Clement I]], the [[patron saint]] of [[blacksmiths]] and metalworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okehamptonpeople.co.uk/news/Blacksmiths-celebrate-St-Clement-s-Day-Sticklepath-s-Finch-Foundry-November-21st/story-4537589-detail/story.html |title=Blacksmiths celebrate St Clement's Day at Sticklepath's Finch Foundry - November 21st |last1=Short |first1=Walter |date=17 November 2009 |work= |publisher=okehamptonpeople |accessdate=1 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416031024/http://www.okehamptonpeople.co.uk/news/Blacksmiths-celebrate-St-Clement-s-Day-Sticklepath-s-Finch-Foundry-November-21st/story-4537589-detail/story.html |archivedate=16 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its practice has lessened in recent years,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} enthusiasts still participate in anvil launching events and competitions. On September 5, 2011, [[The Science Channel]] premiered ''[[Flying Anvils]]'', a reality television series about anvil firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/flying-anvils/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128105332/http://science.discovery.com/tv/flying-anvils/ |archivedate=2013-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
Individuals may be crushed by a falling anvil. The black powder can also prematurely ignite when the top anvil is placed, which can cause black marks on any nearby individuals.

As in any case where an [[explosive]] is confined on all sides by [[metal]], [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] presents a hazard. If a damaged or structurally weak anvil is used, the anvil base may shatter upon [[Combustion|ignition]].

==Physics and chemistry==
The technique depends on the fact that [[black powder]] is a [[low explosive]], which burns more rapidly when under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gurstelle|first1= William |authorlink1= William Gurstelle|title= Absinthe &amp; flamethrowers : projects and ruminations on the art of living dangerously |url= |year= 2009 |publisher= Chicago Review Press|location= Chicago |isbn= 978-1-55652-822-4|oclc= 273817829 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical uses==
A 21 anvil salute replaced the traditional 21 gun salute on [[Victoria Day]] 1860 in [[New Westminster, British Columbia]], after the town's cannon and status as capital of British Columbia was taken away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.genesreunited.co.uk/boards.asp?wci=thread&amp;tk=1222899 |title=The Anvil Salute |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher=Genes Reunited |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 1864 during the Civil War, the commander of the [[Iowa]] Home Guard militia in [[Davis County, Iowa]], having no artillery piece at his disposal, ordered a local citizen to fire an anvil in the county seat at Bloomfield to alert militiamen in outlying townships in response to intelligence received of the presence of Confederate bushwhackers in Davis County. This was in response to a report of two suspected Confederate guerrillas at a residence in the neighborhood where they had demanded money and food and had terrorized the occupants, Mr. and Mrs. Gore. The private citizen who carried out the order to fire the anvil was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Lieutenant Colonel S.A. Moore, Iowa Home Guard, January 1, 1865 in A History of Davis County Iowa, 1886, pp 556–566.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baden culture''', {{circa}} 3600–2800 BC,&lt;ref&gt;The corresponding [[Blytt-Sernander]] climate phase is the [[Subboreal]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Chalcolithic]] [[archaeological culture|culture]] found in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe]]. It is known from [[Moravia]] ([[Czech Republic]]), [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], northern [[Serbia]], western [[Romania]] and eastern [[Austria]]. Imports of Baden pottery have also been found in Germany and Switzerland ([[Arbon|Arbon-Bleiche III]]), where it could be dated by [[dendrochronology]].

==History of research==
The Baden culture was named after [[Baden bei Wien|Baden near Vienna]] by the Austrian prehistorian [[Oswald Menghin]]. It is also known as the Ossarn group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=The Ossarn group represents a later phase of the Baden culture, with sites located in Lower Austria south of the Danube and in northern and central Burgenland. |first=Sue |last=Colledge |first2=James |last2=Conolly |title=The Origins and Spread of Domestic Plants in Southwest Asia and Europe |location=Walnut Creek |publisher=Left Coast Press |year=2007 |page=214 |isbn=978-1-59874-988-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  or Pecel culture. The first monographic treatment was produced by J. Banner in 1956. Other important scholars are E. Neustupny, [[Ida Bognar-Kutzian]] and [[Vera Nemejcova-Pavukova]].

Baden has been interpreted  as part of a much larger archaeological complex encompassing cultures at the mouth of the [[Danube]] ([[Ezero culture|Ezero]]-[[Cernavoda III]]) and the [[Troad]]. In 1963, [[Nándor Kalicz]] had proposed a connection between the Baden culture and [[Troy]], based on the anthropomorphic urns from Ózd-Centre (Hungary). This interpretation cannot be maintained in the face of [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon dates]]. The author himself (2004) has called this interpretation a "cul-de-sac", based on a misguided historical methodology.

==Chronology==
Baden developed out of the late [[Lengyel culture]] in the western Carpathian Basin. Němejcová-Pavuková proposes a polygenetic origin, including southeastern elements transmitted by the [[Ezero culture]] of the early Bronze Age (Ezero, layers XIII-VII) and Cernavoda III/[[Coțofeni culture|Coțofeni]]. Ecsedy parallelises Baden with [[Helladic|Early Helladic II]] in Thessaly, Parzinger with [[Sitagroi]] IV. Baden was approximately contemporaneous with the late [[Funnelbeaker culture]], the [[Globular Amphora culture]] and the early [[Corded Ware culture]].
The following phases are known: Balaton-Lasinya, Baden-Boleráz, Post-Boleráz (divided into early, Fonyod/Tekovský Hrádok and late, Červený Hrádok/Szeghalom-Dioér by Vera Němejcová-Pavuková) and classical Baden.

==Settlement==
The settlements were often located on hilltops and were normally undefended.

==Burial==
Both inhumations and cremations are known. In Slovakia and Hungary, the burned remains were often placed in [[anthropomorphic]] urns  (Slána, Ózd-Center). In [[Nitriansky Hrádok]], a mass grave was uncovered. There are also burials of cattle. Up to now, the only cemetery known from the early Boleráz-phase is Pilismárot (Hungary), which also contained a few examples of stroke-ornamented pottery.

In Serbia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/srejovic/dsrejovic-eneolit.html Dragoslav Srejović, "Kulture bakarnog i ranog bronzanog doba na tlu Srbije"]&lt;/ref&gt; anthropomorphic urns were found in the towns of Dobanovci, Gomolava, Perlez and Zemun.

==Economy==
The economy was mixed. Full-scale agriculture was present, along with the keeping of domestic stock—pigs, goats, etc. The Baden culture has some of the earliest attestation of often wheeled, wagon-shaped models in pottery, sometimes with a handle. There are burials of pairs of cattle that have been interpreted as draft animals. Though there are no finds of actual wagons, some scholars take these finds together as proof for the presence of real wagons.

==Interpretation==
In the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] espoused by [[Marija Gimbutas]], the Baden culture is seen as being Indo-Europeanized. For proponents of the older theory that seeks the Indo-European homeland in central Europe in the area occupied by the preceding [[Funnelbeaker culture]], it is similarly considered Indo-European.

'''CaseMap''' was introduced 1998 as [[relational database]] [[software]] for law offices to store and retrieve [[evidence]] and sources of evidence in litigation. It includes [[Table (database)|database table]]s (the program's documentation refers to them as ''spreadsheets'') for facts, issues, documents, [[physical evidence]], [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s, [[pleading]]s, persons, organizations, places, and other types of data. The program's documentation refers to these types of data as ''objects''. Using the program involves linking the various sources of evidence (e.g., documents, [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s, and persons) to facts that are relevant in the case and to the issues to be decided in the case. The facts table can be sorted by date to provide a chronology of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The use of large volumes of [[digital evidence]] and [[e-discovery]] in modern litigation has led law offices to increase their use of litigation support programs such as CaseMap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Cultural homogenization can impact national identity and culture, which would be "eroded by the impact of global cultural industries and multinational  media".&lt;ref name="Kirby2000"/&gt; The term is usually used in the context of [[Western culture]] dominating and destroying other cultures.&lt;ref name="Berger2000"/&gt; The process of cultural homogenization in the context of the domination of the Western ([[American culture|American]]), [[capitalist culture]] is also known as [[McDonaldization]],&lt;ref name="Jennings2010"/&gt; [[coca-colonization]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"/&gt;[[Americanization]]&lt;ref name="Alon2006"/&gt; or [[Westernization]]&lt;ref name="Hopper2007"/&gt; and criticized as a form of [[cultural imperialism]]&lt;ref name="Barker2008-159-161"/&gt; and [[neo-colonialism]].&lt;ref name="Willis2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KramaraeSpender2000"/&gt; This process has been resented by many [[indigenous culture]]s.&lt;ref name="connor2006"/&gt; However, while some scholars, critical of this process, stress the dominance of American culture and [[corporate capitalism]] in modern cultural homogenization, others note that the process of cultural homogenization is not one-way, and in fact involves a number of cultures exchanging various elements.&lt;ref name="Jennings2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barker2008-159-161"/&gt; Critics of cultural homogenization theory point out that as different cultures mix, homogenization is less about the spread of a single culture as about the mixture of different cultures, as people become aware of other cultures and adopt their elements.&lt;ref name="Jennings2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barker2008-159-161"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willis2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KramaraeSpender2000"/&gt; Examples of non-American culture affecting the West include [[world music]] and the popularization of non-American television (Latin American [[telenovelas]], Japanese [[anime]], Indian [[Bollywood]]), religion ([[Islam]], [[Buddhism]]), food, and clothing in the West, though in most cases insignificant in comparison to the Western influence in other countries.&lt;ref name="Barker2008-159-161"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KramaraeSpender2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiramoto2012"/&gt; The process of adoption of elements of global culture to local cultures is known as [[glocalization]]&lt;ref name="Barker2008-159-161"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2000"/&gt; or [[cultural heterogenization]].&lt;ref name="Clarke2008"/&gt;

Some scholars like [[Arjun Appadurai]] note that "the central problem of today's global interaction [is] the tension between cultural homogenization and cultural heterogenization".&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"/&gt;

== Perspectives ==
The debate regarding the concept of cultural homogenization consists of two separate questions:

* whether homogenization is occurring or not
* whether it is good or not.

John Tomlinson says, "It is one thing to say that cultural diversity is being destroyed, quite another to lament the fact."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson1991"/&gt;

Tomlinson argues that globalization leads to homogenization.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson1991"/&gt; He comments on Cees Hamelink, "Hamelink is right to identify cultural synchronization as an unprecedented feature of global modernity."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson1991"/&gt;  However, unlike Hamelink, he believes in the idea that homogenization is not a bad thing in itself and that benefits of homogenization may outweigh the goods of cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson1991"/&gt;

Appadurai, acknowledging the concept of homogenization, still provides an alternative argument of [[indigenization]]. He says that " the homogenization argument subspeciates into either an argument about Americanization or an argument about commoditization.... What these arguments fail to consider is that at least as rapidly as forces from various metropolises are brought into new societies, they tend to become indigenized."

Although there is more to be explored on the dynamics of indigenization, examples such as Indonesianization in Irian Jaya and Indianization in Sri Lanka show the possibility of alternatives to Americanization.&lt;ref name="Appadurai1996"/&gt;

Generally homogenization is viewed negatively, as it leads to the "reduction in cultural diversity."&lt;ref name="Barker2008-159-161"/&gt; However, some scholars have a positive view on homogenization, especially in the area of education.&lt;ref name="Baker and LeTendre2005"/&gt; They say that it "produces consistent norms of behavior across a set of modern institutions, thus tying institutions such as the modern nation state and formal education together in a tight political sphere."&lt;ref name="Baker and LeTendre2005"/&gt;

Teaching universal values such as rationality by mass schooling is a part of the positive benefits that can be generated from homogenization.&lt;ref name="Baker and LeTendre2005"/&gt;

'''''Dictionary of Women Artists''''' is a two-volume dictionary of 600 women artists born before 1945, going back to the Middle Ages. It was edited by Delia Gaze with 23 advisors and over 100 contributors. Gaze is a writer for the [[Oxford DNB]] and wrote several biographies that were released in the 2004 edition of the ODNB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/search?q=delia+gaze Delia Gaze] in the ODNB&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is widely cited as a reference for Western women artists and has a disclaimer that it is biased towards Western artists because of the constraints imposed on the selection. The book includes a list of artists in alphabetical order and chronological order and a bibliography of sources. Preceding the biographies is a series of "introductory surveys", a product of a somewhat dated notion in gender studies that women can be grouped into categories. There are many women artists mentioned in the surveys whose biography was not included, because there was not enough documented material to fulfill the inclusion criteria. The work was meant as a follow-up to a previous reference work including 21,000 women painters, sculptors, printmakers, and illustrators by Chris Petteys, the ''Dictionary of Women Artists: An International Dictionary of Women Artists Born Before 1900'', published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27948939 Reviewed Work: ''DICTIONARY OF WOMEN ARTISTS'' 2 vol. by Delia Gaze], Review by: Sheila Klos in ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (Spring 1998), pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with that work is that the more well-documented women were included with countless "one-liners".

In 2001 Gaze produced a new "Concise" edition with a smaller selection in a single volume.

'''''Doctor Who''''' is a British [[science fiction]] television programme produced by the [[BBC]] since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a [[Time Lord]] called "[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]", an [[extraterrestrial being]], to all appearances human, from the planet [[Gallifrey]]. The Doctor explores the universe in a [[time-travelling]] [[space ship]] called the [[TARDIS]]. Its exterior appears as a blue British [[police box]], which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by [[Companion (Doctor Who)|a number of companions]], the Doctor combats [[List of Doctor Who villains|a variety of foes]] while working to save civilisations&lt;!-- This is acceptable spelling in British English.

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006–2011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007–2011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009–2010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.

Thirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord "transforms" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character. Together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special "[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]".

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Premise==
''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name "[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] ("Time and Relative Dimension in Space"), a [[time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a "chameleon circuit" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].

Across time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.

==History==
{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}
''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|title=An Unearthly Child|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157–230 ("Production Diary")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947–1979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]]s were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any "[[bug-eyed monster]]s". According to producer Verity Lambert; "We didn't have a lot of choice&amp;nbsp;— we only had the Dalek serial to go&amp;nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that." Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&amp;nbsp;– ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]]. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]], controller of BBC 1.&lt;ref name="powell"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,1511487,00.html|title=Doctor Who makes the Grade|first=Jason|last=Deans|work=The Guardian|quote=But Mr Grade was not at the helm when Doctor Who was finally retired for good in 1989&amp;nbsp;— that decision fell to the then BBC1 controller, Jonathan Powell.|date=21 June 2005|accessdate=4 February 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was effectively [[cancellation (television)|cancelled]] with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed that the series would return.&lt;ref name="8thdrspecial"/&gt;

While in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. [[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th series was still in production.&lt;ref name="8thdrspecial"&gt;Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Panini Comics 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]], broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as an [[international co-production]] between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC and [[BBC Worldwide]]. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1&amp;nbsp;million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.&lt;ref name="8thdrspecial" /&gt;

Licensed media such as novels and audio plays provided [[Doctor Who spin-offs|new stories]], but as a television programme ''Doctor Who'' remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Doctor Who returns to BBC1 screens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/26/bbc.broadcasting|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=26 September 2003|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Television]] announced the in-house production of a new series after several years of attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The executive producers of the new incarnation of the series were writer [[Russell T Davies]] and [[BBC Cymru Wales]] head of drama [[Julie Gardner]].

''Doctor Who'' finally returned with the episode [[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|"Rose"]] on BBC One on 26 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctor Who is Saturday night hit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4385801.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have since been ten further series in 2006–2008, 2010–2015 and 2017–2018, and Christmas Day specials every year since 2005. No full series was broadcast in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Russell T|last2=Cook|first2=Benjamin|title=Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale: The Final Chapter|year=2010|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-84607-861-3|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; although four additional specials starring [[David Tennant]] were made. Davies left the show in 2010 after the end of series 4 and the David Tennant specials were completed. [[Steven Moffat]], a writer under Davies was announced as Davies' successor along with [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the new doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7453623.stm|title=Profile: Russell T Davies|date=2008-06-13|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale, to be replaced by [[Chris Chibnall]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-22/doctor-who-showrunner-steven-moffat-quits-to-be-replaced-by-broadchurch-creator-chris-chibnall|title=Steven Moffat quits Doctor Who to be replaced by Chris Chibnall in 2018|author=Ben Dowell|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth series debuted in April 2017, with a Christmas special preceding it in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/report-moffat-leaving-doctor-who-chris-chibnall-new-showrunner-79586.htm|title=Official: Moffat Leaving Doctor Who After Series 10, Chris Chibnall New Showrunner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 version of ''Doctor Who'' is a direct [[Continuity (fiction)|plot continuation]] of the original 1963–1989 series&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is often emphasised in the accompanying making-of documentaries in the series ''Doctor Who Confidential'', as well as in occasional flashbacks to images of earlier versions of the Doctor.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1996 telefilm. This is similar to the 1988 continuation of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|Mission Impossible]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rewind: ‘Mission: Impossible’ (1988) revisited|url=http://www.cultbox.co.uk/features/rewind/rewind-mission-impossible-1988-revisited|publisher=cultbox.co.uk|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but differs from most other series relaunches which have either been reboots (for example, ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/newseriesfaq.php |title=Outpost Gallifrey: TV Series FAQ |publisher=gallifreyone.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601210834/http://www.gallifreyone.com/newseriesfaq.php |archivedate=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'') or set in the same universe as the original but in a different time period and with different characters (for example, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and spin-offs).

The programme has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see [[#Viewership|Viewership]]).

===Public consciousness===
It has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of US President [[John F. Kennedy]] the previous day; in fact it went out after a delay of eighty seconds.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Howe|first=David J.|authorlink=David J.

The programme soon became a national institution in the United Kingdom, with a large following among the general viewing audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454592/index.html|title=Doctor Who (1963–89, 2005–)|first=Anthony|last=Clark|work=[[Screenonline]]|quote=The science fiction adventure series Doctor Who (BBC, 1963–89) has created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme.|accessdate=21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/D/htmlD/doctorwho/doctorwho.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211080018/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/D/htmlD/doctorwho/doctorwho.htm|archivedate=11 February 2007|title=Doctor Who|first=John|last=Tulloch|work=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|quote=The official fans have never amounted to more than a fraction of the audience.

With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children. Morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening and gory content. [[John Nathan-Turner]] produced the series during the 1980s and was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/1965981.stm|title=Doctor Who Producer Dies|accessdate=6 July 2007|publisher=BBC News|date=3 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "[[Behind the sofa|Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa]]" entered British [[popular culture|pop culture]], signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a [[television program]]me while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Leith|title=Worshipping Doctor Who from behind the sofa|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/samleith/3560202/Worshipping-Doctor-Who-from-behind-the-sofa.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=4 July 2008|accessdate=5 July 2008|quote=The cliché about ''Doctor Who''&amp;nbsp;— that it had us "hiding behind the sofa"&amp;nbsp;— is more telling in its tone than its questionable factuality. It connotes nostalgia, and a pleasurable mixture of fright and fascination&amp;nbsp;— but above all it connotes domesticity. It united fear and soft furnishings in the British mind.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the [[Museum of the Moving Image (London)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in [[London]] named their exhibition celebrating the programme "Behind the Sofa". The electronic [[Doctor Who theme music|theme music]] too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill "at the center of many people's relationship with the show",&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5971113/if-you-werent-scared-of-doctor-who-as-a-child-you-may-never-fully-understand-it If you weren't scared of Doctor Who as a child, you missed out on a crucial experience]&amp;nbsp;– IO9, by Charlie Jane Anders, 25 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2011 online vote at [[Digital Spy]] deemed the series the "scariest TV show of all time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/tubetalk/a348363/doctor-who-named-scariest-tv-show-of-all-time-your-top-10-revealed.html 'Doctor Who' named scariest TV show of all time: Your Top 10 revealed], ''Digital Spy'', Catriona Wightman &amp; Morgan Jeffery, 31 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Jon Pertwee]]'s [[Doctor Who (season 8)|second series]] as the Doctor, in the serial ''[[Terror of the Autons]]'' (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims, and blank-featured policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC&amp;nbsp;– Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide&amp;nbsp;– Terror of the Autons|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/terrorautons/detail.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable moments in that decade include a disembodied brain falling to the floor in ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide&amp;nbsp;– The Brain of Morbius|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/brainmorbius/detail.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Doctor apparently being drowned by a villain in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (both 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC&amp;nbsp;– Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide&amp;nbsp;– The Deadly Assassin|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/deadlyassassin/detail.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tardis BBC Television Center.jpg|thumb|The [[TARDIS]] prop used from 2010–2017.]]
A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence ("any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental") ''Doctor Who'' was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time.&lt;ref name="times-violence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Violence is not really Dr Who's cup of tea|work=The Times|first=Philip|last=Howard|date=29 January 1972|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as "very unsuitable" for family viewing.&lt;ref name="times-audience"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Times Diary&amp;nbsp;— Points of view|work=The Times|date=27 January 1972|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the findings of the survey in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, "to compare the violence of ''Dr Who'', sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously."&lt;ref name="times-violence"/&gt;

The image of the [[TARDIS]] has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter [[Anthony Coburn]], who lived in the resort of [[Herne Bay, Kent]], was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13411516|title=Doctor Who fan in tardis replica plan for Herne Bay|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the BBC applied for a trade mark to use the TARDIS' blue [[police box]] design in merchandising associated with ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002104259|title=Case details for Trade Mark UK00002104259|accessdate=27 October 2013|work=[[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|UK Patent Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Patent Office]] ruled in favour of the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/t-challenge-decision-results-bl?BL_Number=O/336/02|title=Trade mark decision|accessdate=17 January 2007|work=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]] website}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm//legal/decisions/2002/o33602.pdf|title=In the matter of application No. 2104259 by The British Broadcasting Corporation to register a series of three marks in Classes 9, 16, 25 and 41 And in the Matter of – Opposition thereto under No. 48452 by The Metropolitan Police Authority|accessdate=17 January 2007|last=Knight|first=Mike|work=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]]|format=PDF}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2352743.stm|title=BBC wins police Tardis case|accessdate=17 January 2007|date=23 October 2002|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule.&lt;ref name="Doctor Who Education"&gt;{{cite web|title=10 things you didn't know about Doctor Who|url=http://uktv.co.uk/watch/stepbystep/aid/576125|publisher=[[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]]|accessdate=20 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116052952/http://uktv.co.uk/watch/stepbystep/aid/576125|archivedate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science.&lt;ref name="Doctor Who Education" /&gt; This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.&lt;ref name="Doctor Who Education" /&gt;

However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-orientated episodes, which were not popular with the production team,&lt;ref name="Doctor Who Education" /&gt; were dropped after ''[[The Highlanders (Doctor Who)|The Highlanders]]'' (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: ''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]'' (1982), set in 1920s England.&lt;ref name=Orchid&gt;''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]''.

BBC One, London. 1 March 1982&amp;nbsp;– 2 March 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes.&lt;ref name="BBC Doctor Who Episode List"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctor Who Episode List|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/treasurehunt/missing/drwho.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following ''[[The Gunfighters]]'' (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers.&lt;ref name="BBC Doctor Who Episode List" /&gt;

Of the programme's [[List of Doctor Who writers|many writers]], [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]] was the most prolific,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Debnath|first=Neela|title=Review of Doctor Who 'The Talons of Weng-Chiang' (Series 14)|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/12/31/review-of-doctor-who-%E2%80%98the-talons-of-weng-chiang%E2%80%99-series-14/|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Douglas Adams]] became the most well known outside ''Doctor Who'' itself, due to the popularity of his ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Online&amp;nbsp;– Cult&amp;nbsp;– Hitchhiker's&amp;nbsp;– Douglas Adams&amp;nbsp;– Biography|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/dna/biog.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shada, Douglas Adams's 'lost' Doctor Who story, to be novelised|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/24/douglas-adams-doctor-who-story-published|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 October 2013|date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The serial format changed for the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|2005 revival]], with a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth series]], and ten episodes from the  [[Doctor Who (series 11)|eleventh series]]. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early "classic" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]" from 2008 and "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.

{{DW episode count}} ''Doctor Who'' instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format for the classic era), 45/50-minute episodes (for ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the most common format for the revival era since 2005), two feature-length productions (1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' and the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]]), twelve [[Christmas special#Television series specials|Christmas specials]] (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 [[Children in Need]] charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a ''Doctor Who''-themed edition of [[The Proms]]. The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of [[Comic Relief]]. Starting with the 2009 special "[[Planet of the Dead]]", the series was filmed in [[1080i]] for [[HDTV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctor Who to be filmed in HD |url=http://www.drwho-online.co.uk/news/#newseries-hd0 |work=Doctor Who Online |date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2009 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and [[BBC HD]].

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special [[3D television|3D]] episode, "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", was broadcast in 2013.&lt;ref name="bbc3D"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21413511|title=BBC announces Doctor Who 3D Special|publisher=BBC News|date=11 February 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning,&lt;ref name="tennantReturns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21980892|title=Doctor Who: David Tennant returns for anniversary show|publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 2013|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide.&lt;ref name="NotParticularlyGoodReferenceWillReplace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/doctor-who-to-go-3d-for-half-century-sepcial-edition/|title='Doctor Who' goes 3D for its half-century edition|publisher=Digital Trends|date=12 February 2013|accessdate=2 April 2013|author=McMillan, Graeme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Steven Moffat confirmed that ''Doctor Who'' would run for at least another five years, extending the show until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctor Who 'to remain on-screen until at least 2020'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-32202633|publisher=BBC|date=7 April 2015|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Shanghai Media Group|SMG Pictures]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]], the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-06-03/the-bbc-is-already-preparing-for-at-least-five-more-series-of-doctor-who|title=The BBC is already preparing for at least FIVE more series of Doctor Who|publisher=RadioTimes|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2017/doctor-who-china|title=BBC - Doctor Who Gets Brand Boost in China - Media Centre|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing episodes===
{{Main|Doctor Who missing episodes}}
Between about 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The tapes, based on a [[405-line television system|405-line broadcast standard]], were rendered obsolete when UK television changed to a [[625-line television system|625-line signal]] in preparation for the soon-to-begin colour transmissions.&lt;/ref&gt; [[wiping|wiped]], or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from [[broadcast quality]]. This included many old episodes of ''Doctor Who'', mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors: [[William Hartnell]] and [[Patrick Troughton]]. In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, &amp; 5, from which 79 episodes are missing). In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/archive.htm |title=BBC Archive Holdings |first=Richard |last=Molesworth |work=[[Doctor Who Restoration Team]] |quote=A full set was held at least until early 1972, as 16 mm black and white film negatives (apart&amp;nbsp;— of course&amp;nbsp;— from 'Masterplan' 7). . |accessdate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228210500/http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/archive.htm |archivedate=28 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying "spare" film copies had been brought to a stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/archive.htm |title=BBC Archive Holdings |first=Richard |last=Molesworth |work=[[Doctor Who Restoration Team]] |quote=the videotapes began to be wiped, or re-used, until the formation of the BBC's Film and Videotape Library in 1978 put a stop to this particular practice. |accessdate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228210500/http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/archive.htm |archivedate=28 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No 1960s episodes exist on their original videotapes (all surviving prints being film transfers), though some were transferred to film for editing before transmission, and exist in their broadcast form.&lt;ref name="Doctor Who Restoring and Reconstructing Missing Episodes"&gt;{{cite news|title='Doctor Who': Restoring and Reconstructing Missing Episodes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A14066589|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought prints for broadcast, or by private individuals who acquired them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8&amp;nbsp;mm [[cine film]] and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. Short clips from every story with the exception of ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'' (1964), "[[Mission to the Unknown]]" (1965) and ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]'' (1966) also exist.

In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer [[John Cura]], who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''Doctor Who''. These have been used in [[Doctor Who missing episodes#Reconstruction|fan reconstructions]] of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low-quality VHS copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewinski|first=John Scott|title=Fans Reconstruct Doctor Who's Trashed Past|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/09/who-recon/|work=Wired|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most sought-after lost episodes is part four of the last William Hartnell serial, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966), which ends with the [[First Doctor]] transforming into the [[Second Doctor|Second]]. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor-quality silent 8&amp;nbsp;mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children's magazine show ''[[Blue Peter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Lara|title=Zimbabwe 'hoarding lost 'Who' episodes'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a147355/zimbabwe-hoarding-lost-who-episodes.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.

"Official" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 [[CD-ROM]], and as special features on DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio [[Cosgrove Hall Films|Cosgrove Hall]], reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006. The missing episodes of ''[[The Reign of Terror (Doctor Who)|The Reign of Terror]]'' were animated by animation company Theta-Sigma, in collaboration with [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]], and became available for purchase in May 2013 through Amazon.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/06/dwn210611211508-reign-of-terror-update.html|title=The Reign of Terror&amp;nbsp;— animation update|publisher=[[Doctor Who News Page]]|first=Chuck|last=Foster|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent animations made in 2013 include ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Moonbase]]'' (1967).

In April 2006, ''[[Blue Peter]]'' launched a challenge to find missing ''Doctor Who'' episodes with the promise of a full-scale [[Dalek]] model as a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 2006|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/bluepeter/content/articles/2006/04/19/doctor_who_feature.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424144255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/bluepeter/content/articles/2006/04/19/doctor_who_feature.shtml|archivedate=24 April 2006|title=Blue Peter&amp;nbsp;— Missing Doctor Who tapes|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, it was announced that part 3 of ''[[Galaxy 4]]'' (1965) and part 2 of ''[[The Underwater Menace]]'' (1967) had been returned to the BBC by a fan who had purchased them in the mid-1980s without realising that the BBC did not hold copies of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulkern|first=Patrick|title=Doctor Who: two long-lost episodes uncovered|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-11/doctor-who-two-long-lost-episodes-uncovered|accessdate=11 December 2011|newspaper=Radio Times|date=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2013, the BBC announced that films of eleven episodes, including nine missing episodes, had been found in a Nigerian television relay station in [[Jos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Allen|url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/article/two-missing-doctor-who-adventures-found/|title=Two "Missing" Doctor Who Adventures Found|publisher=BBC Worldwide|date=10 October 2013|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the eleven films discovered were the six-part serial ''[[The Enemy of the World]]'' (1968), from which all but the third episode had been missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doctor Who Online|url=http://news.drwho-online.co.uk/Nine-Missing-Doctor-Who-Episodes-Recovered!.aspx|title=Nine Missing Doctor Who Episodes Recovered!|publisher=Doctor Who Online|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining films were from another six-part serial, ''[[The Web of Fear]]'' (1968), and included the previously missing episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.

===The Doctor===
{{Main|The Doctor (Doctor Who)}}
[[File:Versions of the Doctor.jpg|thumb|The Doctor portrayed by series leads in chronological order. Left to right from top row; [[William Hartnell]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[Jon Pertwee]], [[Tom Baker]], [[Peter Davison]], [[Colin Baker]], [[Sylvester McCoy]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[David Tennant]], [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]], [[Peter Capaldi]] and [[Jodie Whittaker]].]]
The Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable [[Time travel|time machine]], the "[[TARDIS]]" (an [[acronym]] for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality referred to as "dimensional transcendentality").&lt;ref group="note"&gt;When it became an entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "TARDIS" often came to be used to describe anything that appeared larger on the inside than its exterior implied.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/424|title=Full record for Tardis-like adj.|work=Science Fiction Citations|accessdate=7 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523205631/http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/424|archivedate=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure and was eventually revealed to be a [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]], which the Doctor fled by stealing the TARDIS.

====Changes of appearance====
{{Main|Regeneration (Doctor Who)}}
Producers introduced the concept of [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] to permit the recasting of the main character. This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, [[William Hartnell]]. The term "regeneration" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a "renewal", and the Second Doctor underwent a "change of appearance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chakoteya.net/DoctorWho/4-3.htm|title=The Doctor Who Transcripts - The Power of the Daleks|website=chakoteya.net|language=en-gb|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chakoteya.net/DoctorWho/6-7.htm|title=The Doctor Who Transcripts - The War Games|website=chakoteya.net|language=en-gb|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The serials ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976) and ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983) established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Berriman|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/interview-russell-t-davies-talks-about-that-sarah-jane-adventures-line/|title=Interview: Russell T Davies Talks About THAT Sarah Jane Adventures Line|publisher=gamesradar.com|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/article/steven-moffat-on-doctor-numbers-and-the-regeneration-limit|title=Steven Moffat on ‘Doctor numbers’ and the regeneration limit|author=Darren Scott|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" (2013) depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the [[Twelfth Doctor]], due to the [[Eleventh Doctor]] being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set.&lt;!--A note explaining this can go here, but it would be best not to digress into an explanation of the circumstances of a particular regeneration in the paragraph which introduces the general concept--&gt;&lt;ref name=507joke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2010/10/26/interview-russell-t-davies-talks-about-that-sarah-jane-adventures-line/|publisher=sfx.co.uk|title=Interview – Russell T.

Although the idea of casting a woman as the Doctor had been suggested by the show's writers several times, including by Newman in 1986 and Davies in 2008, until 2017, all official depictions were played by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Doctor Who nearly became the Time Lady|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/8052694/How-Doctor-Who-nearly-became-the-Time-Lady.html|date=10 October 2010|first=Marc|last=Horn|accessdate=17 July 2017|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Could Catherine Zeta-Jones be the next Doctor Who|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/18/could-catherine-zeta-jones-be-next-doctor-who|date=18 December 2008|first=Sam|last=Nichols|accessdate=17 July 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jodie Whittaker]] took over the role as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, and is the first woman to be cast as the character. Whittaker had previously starred in television series such as ''[[Return to Cranford]]'',  ''[[Broadchurch]]'' alongside [[David Tennant]] ([[Tenth Doctor]]) and the dystopian anthology ''[[Black Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name="ThirteenthDoctorCasting"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/07/16/doctor-jodie-whittaker-replace-peter-capaldi-time-lord-regeneration/ |title=Doctor Who: Jodie Whittaker is to replace Peter Capaldi in the Time Lord regeneration game |work=The Telegraph |date=16 July 2017 |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show introduced the Time Lords' ability to change sexes on regeneration in earlier episodes, first in dialogue, then with [[Michelle Gomez]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].

In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, [[John Hurt]] guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the [[War Doctor]] in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]".&lt;ref name="HurtDoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/10065201/Doctor-Who-The-Name-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html|title=Doctor Who: The Name of the Doctor, BBC One, review|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|author=Hogan, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown in mini-episode "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" [[retroactive continuity|retroactively inserted]] into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.&lt;ref name="HurtDoctorNumber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a533505/doctor-who-steven-moffat-on-regeneration-limit.html?rss|title='Doctor Who': Steven Moffat on regeneration limit|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|author=Rigby, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is from the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where [[Michael Jayston]] portrayed the [[Valeyard]], who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between the twelfth and final incarnation.

On rare occasions, other actors have stood in for the lead. In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].

The casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's sex (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors to date have been white) and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).&lt;ref&gt;Ted B.

====Meetings of different incarnations====
There have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada]]'' episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short "[[Time Crash]]" alongside David Tennant, and in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in "[[The Doctor Falls]]" and "[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]" (both 2017). In "[[The Name of the Doctor]]" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].&lt;ref name="HurtDoctor" /&gt; Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show.

====Revelations about the Doctor====
{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}

Throughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms "Fourth", the First Doctor excitedly replies "Goodness me. So there are five of me now." In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself "the Eleventh" in "[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]". In the 2013 episode "The Time of the Doctor," the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied "Fall of the Eleventh" which had been trailed throughout the series.

During the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being "half human".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that "purists tend to disregard this",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&amp;nbsp;— FAQ&amp;nbsp;— Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.

The programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, "being so ancient", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to—"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in "[[The Empty Child]]" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, "Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither." The Doctor remarks in response, "Yeah, I know the feeling." In "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, "No, not any more." In both "[[Fear Her]]" (2006) and "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.

In "[[The Wedding of River Song]]" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in "The Name of the Doctor" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in "The Time of the Doctor" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.

===Companions===
{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}
The companion figure&amp;nbsp;– generally a human&amp;nbsp;– has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor's "moral duty".&lt;ref name=Overview&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7736130.stm|title=Doctor Who (before the Tardis)|publisher=BBC News|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]) and her teachers [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) and [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]]). These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.&lt;ref name=Overview/&gt; The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&amp;nbsp;— or loves&amp;nbsp;— on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.

Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.&lt;ref name=AbsentPostcolonial&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title="Sociopathetic Abscess" or "Yawning Chasm"? The Absent Postcolonial Transition in ''Doctor Who''|last=Orthia|first=Lindy A.|year=2010|volume=45|issue=2|pages=207–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eleventh Doctor]] became the first to travel with a married couple, [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]), whilst out-of-sync meetings with [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] ([[Alex Kingston]]) and [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) provided ongoing story arcs. The [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]] introduced [[Pearl Mackie]] as [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]], the Doctor's newest traveling companion.&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36111598 |title=Doctor Who: Pearl Mackie named as new companion |website=BBC |date=23 April 2016 |accessdate=24 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Potts is the Doctor's first openly gay companion. Pearl Mackie said that the increased representation for LGBTQ people is important on a mainstream show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Potts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/doctor-new-companion-bill-potts-gay-actress-says-time/|website=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companions have gone on to re-appear, either in the main series or in spin-offs. Sarah Jane Smith became the central character in ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007–11) following a return to ''Doctor Who'' in 2006. Guest stars in the series included former companions Jo Grant, [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]], and [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] ([[Nicholas Courtney]]). The character of Jack Harkness also served to launch a spin-off, ''[[Torchwood]]'', (2006–2011) in which Martha Jones also appeared.

===Adversaries===
{{See also|List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens|List of Doctor Who villains}}
When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the "[[bug-eyed monster]]" of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctor Who (before the Tardis)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7736130.stm|publisher=BBC Magazine|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[monster]]s were popular with audiences and so became a staple of ''Doctor Who'' almost from the beginning.

With the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce classic [[Cultural icon|icons]] of ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctor Who series two secrets revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4100000/newsid_4104500/4104586.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=19 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Auton]]s with the Nestene Consciousness and [[Dalek]]s returned in series 1, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] in series 2, the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Macra|Macra]] and [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] in series 3, the [[Sontaran]]s and [[Davros]] in series 4, and the [[Time Lord]]s including [[Rassilon]] in the 2009–10 Specials. Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurians]] in series 5, [[Cybermat]]s in series 6, the [[Great Intelligence]] and the [[Ice Warrior]]s in Series 7, and [[Zygon]]s in the 50th Anniversary Special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=|year=2011|title=Monster Files: Cybermats|medium=|publisher=iTunes Store|time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: [[Slitheen]] (Raxacoricofallapatorians), [[Ood]], [[Judoon]], [[Weeping Angel]]s and [[Silence (Doctor Who)|the Silence]].

Besides infrequent appearances by enemies such as the Ice Warriors, [[Ogron]]s, the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]], and [[Black Guardian]], three adversaries have become particularly iconic: the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master.

====Daleks====
{{Main|Dalek}}
[[File:Dalek (10634451635).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A Dalek at the Doctor Who Experience, Cardiff]]
The Dalek race, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0562905/|title=The Dead Planet|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s oldest villains. The Daleks are [[Kaled]]s from the planet [[Skaro]], mutated by the scientist [[Davros]] and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a [[directed-energy weapon]]. Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to "exterminate" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the  [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearances being in the 2015 episodes "[[The Witch's Familiar]]" and "[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]". Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', although played by several different actors.

The Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] (who intended them to be an [[allegory]] of the [[Nazism|Nazis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nationterry/nationterry.htm|title=Nation, Terry|accessdate=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BBC designer [[Raymond Cusick]].&lt;ref name="cusick"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21563344|title=Doctor Who Dalek designer Ray Cusick dies after illness|publisher=BBC|date=24 February 2013|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daleks' début in the programme's second serial, ''[[The Daleks]]'' (1963–64), made both the Daleks and ''Doctor Who'' very popular. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]]. In "[[Victory of the Daleks]]" a new set of Daleks were introduced that come in a range of colours; the colour denoting its role within the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p007l73p|title=The New Daleks|publisher=BBC|date=29 April 2010|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cybermen====
{{Main|Cyberman}}
[[File:Cyberman from Doctor Who (529659465).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|A 2006 Cyberman]]
Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's [[Counter-Earth|twin planet]] Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating [[cyborg]]s, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for. With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the ''Doctor Who'' franchise.

The 2006 series introduced a totally new variation of Cybermen. These Cybus Cybermen were created in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] by the mad inventor John Lumic; he was attempting to preserve the humans by transplanting their brains into powerful metal bodies, sending them orders using a mobile phone network and inhibiting their emotions with an electronic chip.

====The Master====
{{Main|The Master (Doctor Who)}}
The Master is the Doctor's [[archenemy]], a renegade [[Time Lord]] who desires to rule the universe. Conceived as "[[Professor Moriarty]] to the Doctor's [[Sherlock Holmes]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition'' No. 2, 5 September 2002, [subtitled ''The Complete Third Doctor''], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was [[Roger Delgado]], who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by [[Peter Pratt]] and [[Geoffrey Beevers]] until [[Anthony Ainley]] took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of ''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]'', and was played by American actor [[Eric Roberts]].

Following the series revival in 2005, [[Derek Jacobi]] provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]". During that story, the role was then assumed by [[John Simm]] who returned to the role multiple times through the [[Tenth Doctor]]'s tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/news/latest/090728_news_02|title=John Simm Returns for the Finale!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2014 episode "[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]", it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or "Time Lady", going by the name of "Missy" (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of "Master"). This incarnation is played by [[Michelle Gomez]].

[[John Simm]] returned in his role as the Master in the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]].&lt;ref name="Series10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/9ecdaaa1-10e1-45a7-a266-bdd7a1adcdf2|title=John Simm to return as the Master in Doctor Who|publisher=BBC|date=6 April 2017|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{See also|List of Doctor Who composers}}

===Theme music===
{{Main|Doctor Who theme music}}
{{Listen|filename=Doctor Who theme excerpt.ogg|title=Doctor Who theme excerpt|description=An excerpt from the original (1963) classic theme music to ''Doctor Who''}}

The [[Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme music]] was one of the first [[electronic music]] signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised. The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concrète]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979–80). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, "Jeez, Delia, did I write that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite |date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986). [[Keff McCulloch]] provided the new arrangement for the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s era which lasted from [[Doctor Who (season 24)|season 24]] (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer [[John Debney]] created a new arrangement of [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme for ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]'' in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, [[Murray Gold]] provided a new arrangement which featured [[sampling (music)|samples]] from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode "[[The Christmas Invasion]]".

A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallifreynewsbase.blogspot.com/2010/01/murray-gold-returns.html|title=Murray Gold Returns|date=3 January 2010|work=Doctor Who News Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/7603262/Doctor-Who-nasty-new-theme-tune-angers-fans.html|title=Doctor Who: 'nasty' new theme tune angers fans|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special "[[The Snowmen]]", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-21/the-name-of-the-doctor/|title=The Name of the Doctor|website=Radiotimes.com|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the "Doctor Who Theme" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, "Who Is the Doctor".&lt;ref group=note&gt;Often mistitled "I am the Doctor" on YouTube uploads. Originally released as a 7" vinyl single, plain sleeve, December 1972 on label Purple PUR III&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as [[The KLF]]) released the single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including "Rock and Roll Part 2" by [[Gary Glitter]] (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of "Doctorin' the Tardis").&lt;ref name="guardianmusic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/07/doctor_who_a_musical_force.html|title=Doctor Who: a musical force?|accessdate=7 July 2008|last=Peel|first=Ian|date=7 July 2008|work=The Guardian|publisher=blog|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]],&lt;ref name="guardianmusic" /&gt; [[Pink Floyd]],&lt;ref name="guardianmusic" /&gt; the Australian string ensemble [[FourPlay Electric String Quartet|Fourplay]], New Zealand punk band [[Blam Blam Blam]], [[The Pogues]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Dub Syndicate]], and the comedians [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Mitch Benn]]. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]''. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011 the Mankind version was released as a [[music download|digital download]] on the album ''Gallifrey And Beyond''.

On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for [[Doctor Who (series 11)|series 11]] would be provided by [[Royal Birmingham Conservatoire]] alumnus [[Segun Akinola]].&lt;ref name= "akinola"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jeffery |first=Morgan |url= http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a860312/doctor-who-series-11-composer-music/ |title=Doctor Who series 11 composer has been revealed |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidental music===
{{Main|List of music featured on Doctor Who}}
{{See also|List of Doctor Who music releases}}
Most of the innovative incidental music for ''Doctor Who'' has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used [[Royalty free music|stock music]], as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or [[cover version]]s of songs by popular music acts such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]]. Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.

The incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].

The most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).

In 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke (composer)|Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].

The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.

From the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode "[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|title=Doctor Who: Bradley Walsh WON'T work with two big stars after they confirm their exits|first=Rory|last=O'Connor|publisher=Express|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; all incidental music for the series was composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]], and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and [[Russell T Davies]] answered questions during the interval and [[Dalek]]s and [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]] on Christmas Day 2006. A [[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|Doctor Who Prom]] was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] as part of the annual [[BBC Proms]]. The BBC Philharmonic and the [[London Philharmonic Choir]] performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time. The event was presented by [[Freema Agyeman]] and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode "[[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]]", written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=27 July 2008|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2008/whatson/2707.shtml|title=BBC Prom 27 July 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for the eleventh series would be provided by [[Royal Birmingham Conservatoire]] alumnus [[Segun Akinola]].&lt;ref name="akinola"/&gt;

Premiering the day after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], the first episode of ''Doctor Who'' was repeated with the second episode the following week. ''Doctor Who'' has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes were also repeated on [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]], before its transition to an [[BBC Three (online)|online-only channel]] . The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings.&lt;ref name="ratings chart"&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Hilton |title=Doctor Who&amp;nbsp;— Top Chart Placing&amp;nbsp;– 1963–2008 |url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&amp;sub=news&amp;id=season4_final_4.jpg |work=Doctor Who News Page |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=16 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719041204/http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&amp;sub=news&amp;id=season4_final_4.jpg |archivedate=19 July 2008  }};{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&amp;sub=news&amp;id=2007_ratings.jpg |title=Doctor Who Top Ratings: 1963–2007 |accessdate=17 July 2008 |first=Matt |last=Hilton |date=11 January 2008 |work=Doctor Who News Page |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315003100/http://www.gallifreyone.com/picview.php?ret=news&amp;sub=news&amp;id=2007_ratings.jpg |archivedate=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the "[[Dalekmania]]" period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought ''Doctor Who'' ratings of between 9 and 14&amp;nbsp;million, even for stories which did not feature them.&lt;ref name="ratings chart" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas |last=Marlborough |title=Dead, but they won't lie down |url=http://www.cuttingsarchive.org.uk/news_mag/1960s/cuttings/dead.htm |format=Reprint, hosted on Doctor Who Cuttings Archive |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=28 December 1964 |accessdate=16 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619093807/http://cuttingsarchive.org.uk/news_mag/1960s/cuttings/dead.htm |archivedate=19 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="ratings chart" /&gt;

An audience survey during the 1970s revealed that at the time 60% of the viewership were adults.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

During the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16&amp;nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months. At the time of Season 19's broadcast in 1982 the show was being watched by a global audience of 98 million, 88 million in 38 foreign countries, and an average of ten million in the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', the most popular show at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22628484 ''bbc.co.uk'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11935400 ''bbc.co.uk'']&lt;/ref&gt; During Tennant's run (the third notable period of high ratings), the show had consistently high viewership; with the Christmas specials regularly attracting over 10 million.&lt;ref name="ratings chart" /&gt;

The BBC One broadcast of "[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]", the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81&amp;nbsp;million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels.&lt;ref name="ratings chart" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=weeklyterrestrial&amp;requesttimeout=500 |title=Weekly Viewing Summary: Terrestrial Top 30&amp;nbsp;– Week ending 6 July 2008 |accessdate=16 July 2008 |work=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] |date=16 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713233601/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=weeklyterrestrial&amp;RequestTimeout=500 |archivedate=13 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/cgi-bin/viewnews.cgi?id=EkEykpAEuAeSoAAghE&amp;tmpl=newsrss&amp;style=feedstyle |title=Journey's End: Officially Number One |accessdate=16 July 2008 |last=Hilton |first=Matt |date=16 July 2008 |work=Doctor Who News Page |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719155722/http://www.gallifreyone.com/cgi-bin/viewnews.cgi?id=EkEykpAEuAeSoAAghE&amp;tmpl=newsrss&amp;style=feedstyle |archivedate=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current revival also garners the highest audience [[Appreciation Index]] of any drama on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/11/these-scifi-people-vote/ |title=These sci-fi people vote |last=Wright |first=Mark |work=[[The Stage]] |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=9 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409164855/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/11/these-scifi-people-vote/ |archivedate= 9 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 20th anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' had its début on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on a number of PBS stations two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in Edmonton, Canada, 15 days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Oceania====
[[New Zealand]] was the first country outside the United Kingdom to screen ''Doctor Who'', beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2018, the series is aired on Fridays on TVNZ 2, and on TVNZ On Demand on the same episode as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/shows/doctor-who|title=Doctor Who |website=tvnz.co.nz|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the show has had a strong fan base since its inception, having been exclusively first run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) since January 1965. (See [[Doctor Who in Australia]]) The ABC has periodically repeated episodes; of note were the weekly screenings of all available classic episodes starting in 2003, for the show's 40th anniversary, and the weekdaily screenings of all available revived episodes in 2013 for the show's 50th anniversary. The ABC broadcasts the modern series first run on [[ABC1]] and [[ABC ME]], with repeats on [[ABC2]]. The ABC also provided partial funding for the 20th anniversary special ''The Five Doctors'' in 1983.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The series also has a fan base in the United States, where it was shown in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on [[PBS]] stations.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[TVOntario]] picked up the show in 1976 beginning with ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'' and aired each series (several years late) through to series 24 in 1991. From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer [[Judith Merril]] who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO's status as an educational channel. Its airing of ''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'' was cancelled as a result of accusations that the story was [[racism|racist]]; the story was later broadcast in the 1990s on cable station YTV. CBC began showing the series again in 2005. The series moved to the Canadian cable channel [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] in 2009.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For the Canadian broadcast, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the ''Doctor Who Confidential'' documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" on 26 December 2005, [[Billie Piper]] recorded a special video introduction. CBC began airing series two on 9 October 2006 at 20:00 E/P (20:30 in Newfoundland and Labrador), shortly after that day's [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] double header on [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] in most of the country.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Adaptations and other appearances==

===''Doctor Who'' films===
{{Main|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}
There are two ''Doctor Who'' feature films: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', released in 1965 and ''[[Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.]]'' in 1966. Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, ''[[The Daleks]]'' and ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'' respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept.

In these films, [[Peter Cushing]] plays a human scientist&lt;ref name=Tele1&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Smith is the eleventh, and youngest, actor to play Doctor Who|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/4124547/Matt-Smith-is-the-eleventh-and-youngest-actor-to-play-Doctor-Who.html?image=4|work=News|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (online)|accessdate=15 June 2011|location=London|date=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; named "Dr. Who", who travels with his granddaughter and niece and other companions in a time machine he has invented. The [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)#Other appearances|Cushing version]] of the character reappears in both comic strips and a short story, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.

In addition, several planned films were proposed, including a sequel, ''The Chase'', loosely based on the [[The Chase (Doctor Who)|original series story]], for the Cushing Doctor, plus [[List of unmade Doctor Who serials and films#Proposed films|many attempted television movie and big screen productions]] to revive the original ''Doctor Who'', after the original series was cancelled.

Paul McGann starred in [[Doctor Who (film)|the only television film]] as the eighth incarnation of the Doctor. After the film, he continued the role in audio books and was confirmed as the eighth incarnation through flashback footage and a mini episode in the 2005 revival, effectively linking the two series and the television movie.

In 2011, [[David Yates]] announced that he had started work with the BBC on a ''Doctor Who'' film, a project that would take three or more years to complete. Yates indicated that the film would take a different approach to ''Doctor Who'',&lt;ref name="VarietyWhoFilm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118046098|title=Yates to direct bigscreen 'Doctor Who'|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam|date=14 November 2011|work=Variety|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the current ''Doctor Who'' showrunner [[Steven Moffat]] stated later that any such film would not be a reboot of the series and a film should be made by the BBC team and star the current TV Doctor.&lt;ref name="DigitalSpyWhoFilm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/s7/doctor-who/news/a354022/doctor-who-movie-will-not-be-a-reboot-says-steven-moffat.html|title='Doctor Who' Movie Will Not Be A Reboot Says Moffat|last=Sperling|first=Daniel|date=2 December 2011|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/film/883654-doctor-who-movie-will-star-matt-smith-if-it-gets-made-says-steven-moffat|title=Doctor Who movie will star Matt Smith if it gets made, says Steven Moffat|work=Metro|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spin-offs===
{{Main|Doctor Who spin-offs}}
''Doctor Who'' has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, [[Trevor Martin]] played the role in ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]''. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled ''[[Doctor Who&amp;nbsp;– The Ultimate Adventure]]''. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, [[David Banks (British actor)|David Banks]] (better known for playing [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while [[Terry Nation]] wrote ''[[The Curse of the Daleks]]'', a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.

A pilot episode ("[[A Girl's Best Friend]]") for a potential spinoff series, ''[[K-9 and Company]]'', was aired in 1981 with [[Elisabeth Sladen]] reprising her role as companion [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and [[John Leeson]] as the voice of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]], but was not picked up as a regular series.

Concept art for an animated ''Doctor Who'' series was produced by animation company [[Nelvana]] in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Bailey, Shaun (Producer); Kalangis, Johnny (Director) |date=2004 |title=The Planet of the Doctor, Part 6: Doctor Who &amp; Culture II |url=http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/videos.html |format=[[QuickTime]] or [[Windows Media]] |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[CBC Television]] |location=Toronto |accessdate=9 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702214033/http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/videos.html |archivedate=2 July 2009 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|title=Planet of the Doctor|accessdate=9 April 2009|work=[[CBC Television]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430203208/http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled ''[[Torchwood]]'' (an [[anagram]] of "Doctor Who"), set in modern-day [[Cardiff]] and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] on 22 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Hub|last=Walker|first=Stephen James|authorlink=Stephen James Walker|year=2007|publisher=[[Telos Publishing]]|location=Tolworth, Surrey|isbn=978-1-84583-013-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Barrowman]] reprised his role of [[Jack Harkness]] from the 2005 series of ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4349120.stm|title=Doctor Who spin-off made in Wales|publisher=BBC News|date=17 October 2005|accessdate=24 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; [[Eve Myles]] as [[Gwen Cooper]], who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Unquiet Dead]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=24 February 2006 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/02/24/29846.shtml |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QSmqr0PU?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/02/24/29846.shtml |archivedate=20 July 2007 |title=Team Torchwood |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 April 2006 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Naoko Mori]] who reprised her role as [[Toshiko Sato]] first seen in "[[Aliens of London]]". A second series of ''Torchwood'' aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her ''Doctor Who'' role of [[Martha Jones]]. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called ''Children of Earth'' which was set largely in London. A fourth series, ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'' jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.

''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', starring [[Elisabeth Sladen]] who reprised her role as investigative journalist [[Sarah Jane Smith]], was developed by [[CBBC]]; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Russell T Davies creates new series for CBBC, starring Doctor Who's Sarah Jane Smith|publisher=BBC|date=14 September 2006|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/09_september/14/sarah.shtml|accessdate=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second series followed in 2008, notable for (as noted above) featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress [[Katy Manning]] reprising her role as [[Jo Grant]]. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011&amp;nbsp;– uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011.

An animated serial, ''[[The Infinite Quest]]'', aired alongside the 2007 series of ''Doctor Who'' as part of the children's television series ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]''. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and [[Freema Agyeman]] but is not considered part of the 2007 series.&lt;ref name="cartoon_bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's a Toon? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/01/26/40315.shtml |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2007 |work=BBC ''Doctor Who'' website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202125822/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/01/26/40315.shtml |archivedate=2 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second animated serial, ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'', aired in six parts on the [[BBC Red Button]] service, and the official ''Doctor Who'' website in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8300002.stm|title=Wire star set for Dr Who cartoon|date=9 October 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'', featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by [[Patrick Ness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/953c5b1f-3cc8-4db9-8184-f1b6567260f1|title=BBC Latest News&amp;nbsp;– Doctor Who&amp;nbsp;– Doctor Who Spin Off: Class|author=The Doctor Who Team|work=Doctor Who}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Capaldi&amp;Filming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-02-29/doctor-who-spin-off-class-to-start-filming-in-april-with-peter-capaldi-set-to-pop-up-in-new-show|title=Doctor Who spin off Class begins filming in April 2016 and may feature Peter Capaldi|publisher=[[RadioTimes]]|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show's first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/24/peter-capaldi-will-appear-in-doctor-who-spin-off-class-which-now-has-an-air-date-6150072/|title=Peter Capaldi Will appear in Buffy-style Doctor Who spin-off Class|last=Metro.co.uk|first=Olivia Waring for|date=24 September 2016|website=Metro|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was picked up by [[BBC America]] on 8 January 2016 and by [[BBC One]] a day later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/class-doctor-who-spinoff-2016-prey-philip-glenister-1201675312/|title=BBC America Sets ‘Doctor Who’ Spinoff ‘Class’ for 2016|publisher=Variety|last=Friedlander|first=Whitney|date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/class/news/a837477/bbc-three-class-doctor-who-spin-off-cancelled/|title=BBC Three boss confirms Doctor Who spin-off Class is done: "It just didn't really land for us"|first=Morgan|last=Jeffrey|work=DigitalSpy|date=7 September 2017|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series ''[[Faction Paradox]]'', ''[[Iris Wildthyme]]'' and ''[[Bernice Summerfield]]''; as well as the made-for-video series ''[[P.R.O.B.E.]]''; the Australian-produced television series ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'', which aired a 26-episode first season on [[Disney XD (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney XD]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=25 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4939144.stm|title=Doctor Who dog K9 gets spin-off|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the audio spin-off ''Counter-Measures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/news/New-Doctor-Who-Spin-off-Counter-Measures|title=New Doctor Who Spin off&amp;nbsp;...

===Aftershows===
When the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' was brought back, an aftershow series was created by the BBC, titled ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]''. There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled ''[[Doctor Who: The Fan Show]]'', which began airing from the tenth series. Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of ''Doctor Who'' through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner. Each episode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the ''Doctor Who'' episode that preceded it.

===Charity episodes===
In 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' was shown as part of the annual BBC Children in Need Appeal, however it was not a charity-based production, simply scheduled within the line-up of Friday 25 November 1983. This was the programme's very first co-production with Australian broadcaster [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Five Doctors |title-link=The Five Doctors |year=1985 |type=Cover |publisher=BBC |id=BBC 2020 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five Doctors Serial 6K|url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_6k.htm|publisher=drwhoguide.com|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a full-length, 90-minute film, the longest single episode of ''Doctor Who'' produced to date (the television movie ran slightly longer on broadcast where it included commercial breaks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=6k|title=The Five Doctors|publisher=Outpost Gallifrey|author=Shaun Lyon|date=31 March 2007|accessdate=24 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503123320/http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=6k|archivedate=3 May 2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/6k.html|title=The Five Doctors|publisher=A Brief History of Time Travel|last=Sullivan|first=Shannon|date=7 August 2007|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.

In 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.&lt;ref name=RTDgone&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|publisher=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original "mini-episodes" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|untitled seven-minute scene]] which introduced [[David Tennant]] as the [[Tenth Doctor]]. It was followed in November 2007 by "[[Time Crash]]", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the [[Fifth Doctor]] (played once again by [[Peter Davison]]).

A set of two mini-episodes, titled [[Space and Time (Doctor Who)|"Space" and "Time"]] respectively, were produced to support [[Comic Relief]]. They were aired during the [[Comic Relief#2011 event|Comic Relief 2011 event]].&lt;ref name="comicrelief2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a306899/moffat-reveals-who-comic-relief-plot.html|title=Doctor Who For Comic Relief&amp;nbsp;– Exclusive|work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|date=2 March 2011|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2011 [[Children in Need]], an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need. The 2012 edition of CiN featured the mini-episode ''The Great Detective''.

===Spoofs and cultural references===
{{Main|Doctor Who spoofs}}
''Doctor Who'' has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including [[Spike Milligan]] (a Dalek invades his bathroom&amp;nbsp;— Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and [[Lenny Henry]].

In the [[Channel 4]] series ''[[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' (created by later ''Doctor Who'' executive producer Russell T.

Since its beginnings, ''Doctor Who'' has generated hundreds of products related to the show, from toys and games to collectible picture cards and postage stamps.

Many games have been released that feature the Daleks, including [[Dalek#Computer games|Dalek computer games]].

===Audios===
{{See also|List of Doctor Who audio releases|List of Doctor Who audiobooks|List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish}}

The earliest ''Doctor Who''-related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'' released in 1966.  Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.

Since 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Cathrine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.

In addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.

===Books===
{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}

''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the [[Virgin New Adventures]] and [[Virgin Missing Adventures]]. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]]. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979. This is published by Panini, as is the ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'' magazine for younger fans.

Numerous ''Doctor Who'' [[video games]] have been created from the mid-80s through to the present day.

==Chronology and canonicity==

Since the creation of the ''Doctor Who'' character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about ''Doctor Who'', in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and stage performances. The BBC takes no position on the [[Canon (fiction)|canonicity]] of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea of canonicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Russell T.|title=Doctor Who Magazine|issue=356|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish history]], [[Jews]] have experienced numerous mass expulsions or ostracism by various local authorities and have sought [[refugee|refuge]] in other countries.

The [[Land of Israel]] was always regarded by Jews as the [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wordfromjerusalem.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/the-case-for-israel-chapter1.pdf |title=The Jewish Claim to Palestine |publisher=Word From Jerusalem |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|establishment]] in 1948, the [[State of Israel]] adopted the 1950 [[Law of Return]] restoring Israel as the Jewish homeland and making it the place of refuge for '''Jewish refugees''' at the time and into the future. This law was intended to encourage Jews to return to their homeland in Israel.

;119: Large Jewish communities of Cyprus, [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and Alexandria become extinct after the Jewish defeat in [[Kitos War]] against Rome. This event caused a major demographic shift in the Levant and North Africa.

[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|thumb|right|Expulsions of Jews in Europe from 1100 to 1600]]

;12th–14th centuries: [[France]]. The practice of expelling the Jews accompanied by confiscation of their property, followed by temporary readmissions for ransom, was used to enrich the crown: expulsions from [[Paris]] by [[Philip Augustus of France|Philip Augustus]] in 1182, from France by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1254, by [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1322, by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1359, by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] in 1394.

;13th century: The influential [[philosopher]] and [[logician]] [[Ramon Llull]] (1232–1315) called for expulsion of all Jews who would refuse conversion to Christianity. Some scholars regard Llull's as the first comprehensive articulation, in the Christian West, of an expulsionist policy regarding Jews.

;1288: [[Naples]] issues first expulsion of Jews in Southern Italy.&lt;ref name="JVL-Italy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Timeline of Jewish History in Italy |website =Jewish Virtual Library |date=2018-02-27 |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/timeline-of-jewish-history-in-italy |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that this event happened on [[Tisha B'Av]], as with many other events in Jewish history.

;1495: Charles VIII of France occupies Kingdom of Naples, bringing new persecution against the Jews, many of whom went there as refugees from Spain.&lt;ref name="JVL-Italy" /&gt;

;1569: Pope Pius V expels the Jews from the papal states, with the exception of Ancona and Rome.&lt;ref name="JVL-Italy" /&gt;

;1593: Pope Clement VIII expels the Jews living in all the papal states, except Rome, Avignon and Ancona. Jews are invited to settle in Leghorn, the main port of Tuscany, where they are granted full religious liberty and civil rights, by the Medici family, who want to develop the region into a center of commerce.&lt;ref name="JVL-Bavaria" /&gt;

]]The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] persecution started with the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]] in 1933, reached a first climax during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938 and culminated in [[the Holocaust]] of [[European Jewry]]. The [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] prohibited Jewish emigration to [[Mandatory Palestine]]. The 1938 [[Evian Conference]], the 1943 [[Bermuda Conference]] and other attempts failed to resolve the problem of Jewish refugees, a fact widely used in [[Nazi propaganda]] (see also [[MS St. Louis|MS ''St. Louis'']]). A small number of [[German Jewish|German]] and [[Austrian Jewish]] refugees from Nazism emigrated to Britain, where attitudes were not necessarily positive.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-british-jews-nazis-myth.html |title=Warm British welcome for Jews fleeing Nazis a 'myth' |publisher=[[Phys.org]] / [[University of Manchester]] |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the refugees fought for Britain in the Second World War. After WW-II, eastern European Holocaust survivors migrated to the allied-controlled part of Europe, as the Jewish society to which most of them belonged did not exist anymore. Often they were lone survivors consumed by the often futile search for other family and friends, and often unwelcome in the towns from which they came. They were known as [[displaced person]]s (also known as [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah]]) and placed in [[displaced persons camp]]s, most of which were by 1951 closed. The last camp [[Föhrenwald]] was closed in 1957.

:Then [[UNHCR]] announced in February 1957 and in July 1967, that these Jews who had fled from Arab countries "may be considered prima facie within the mandate of this office," so according them in international law, as bona fide refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Unbearable Silence about the Jewish Refugees |website=Gatestone Institute |url=https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3498/jewish-refugees |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1947: [[Egypt]] passed the Companies' Law. This law required that no less than 75% of employees of companies in Egypt must be Egyptian citizens. This law strongly affected Jews, as only about 20% of all [[Jews in Egypt]] were [[Egyptian citizens]]. The rest, although in many cases born in Egypt and living there for generations, did not hold Egyptian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Egypt.html#5&lt;/ref&gt;

;1948: State of Israel established. [[Antisemitism in Egypt]] strongly intensified. On May 15, 1948, emergency law was declared, and a royal decree forbade Egyptian citizens to leave the country without a special permit. This was applied to Jews. Hundreds of Jews were arrested and many had their property confiscated. In June through August 1948, bombs were planted in Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish businesses looted. About 250 Jews were killed or wounded by the bombs. Roughly 14,000 Jews left Egypt between 1948–50.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

;1949: Jordan occupies and then annexes the [[West Bank]] – largely allotted by the 1947 UN Partition of Palestine to an Arab state, proposal rejected by the Arab leadership – and conducts large scale discrimination and persecution of all non-Muslim residents – Jewish, Christian (of many denominations), Druze, Circassian, etc. – and forces Arabisation of all public activity, including schools and public administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A.

;1954: [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] seizes power in Egypt. Nasser immediately arrested many Jews who were tried on various charges, mainly for Zionist and communist activities. Jews were forced to donate large sums of money to the military. Strict supervision of Jewish enterprises was introduced; some were confiscated and others forcibly sold to the government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

;1956: [[Suez Crisis]]. Roughly 3,000 Egyptian Jews were interned without charge in four detention camps. The government ordered thousands of Jews to leave the country within a few days, and they were not allowed to sell their property, nor to take any capital with them. The deportees were made to sign statements agreeing not to return to Egypt and transferring their property to the administration of the government. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]] helped about 8,000 stateless Jews to leave the country, taking most of them to Italy and Greece. Most of the Jews of Port Said (about 100) were smuggled to Israel by Israel agents. The system of deportation continued into 1957. Other Jews left voluntarily, after their livelihoods had been taken from them, until only 8,561 were registered in the 1957 census.  The Jewish exodus continued until there were about 3,000 Jews left as of in 1967.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

;1967: [[Six-Day War]]. Hundreds of Egyptian Jews arrested, suffering beatings, torture, and abuse. Some were released following intervention by foreign states, especially by Spain, and were permitted to leave the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; [[Libyan Jews]], who numbered approximately 7,000, were subjected to [[pogrom]]s in which 18 were killed, prompting a mass exodus that left fewer than 100 Jews in [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jews of Libya |website=Jewish Virtual Library |date=2018-02-27 |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jews-of-libya |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1970: Less than 1,000 Jews still lived in Egypt in 1970. They were given permission to leave but without their possessions. As of 1971, only 400 Jews remained in Egypt. As of 2013, only a few dozen Jews remain in Egypt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

;1960s–1989: Due to the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] thousands of Jews were forced by the communist authorities to leave Poland. ''See also [[rootless cosmopolitan]], [[Doctors' plot]], [[Jackson-Vanik amendment]], [[refusenik (Soviet Union)|refusenik]], [[Zionology]], [[Pamyat]].''{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

;1962: Jews flee [[Algeria]] as result of [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]] violence. The community feared that the proclamation of independence would precipitate a Muslim outburst. By the end of July 1962, 70,000 Jews had left for France and another 5,000 for Israel. It is estimated that some 80% of Algerian Jews settled in France.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Algeria.html&lt;/ref&gt;

;1965: Situation of [[Jews in Algeria]] rapidly deteriorates. By 1969, fewer than 1,000 Jews remain. By the 1990s, the numbers had dwindled to approximately 70.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

;1970s–1990s: State-sponsored persecution in the [[Soviet Union]] prompted hundreds of thousands of [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], known as [[Refusenik]]s because they had been denied official permission to leave, to flee; most went to Israel or came to the United States as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Azbel' and Grace Pierce Forbes.

'''Fascination Books''' was one of [[South Africa]]'s largest book chains with branches throughout South Africa. After 13 years of considerable growth, owner and founder Johan Marais applied for liquidation in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|title=Book chain closes doors: Fin24: Companies|date=2011-07-11|access-date=2017-08-31|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711003053/http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was the largest independent book chain in the South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|title=Book chain closes doors {{!}} Fin24|date=2012-02-12|access-date=2017-08-31|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212133157/http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|archivedate=2012-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stocked a wide range of books, focussing on religious books, while also stocking a great variety of books in [[Afrikaans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fascinationonline.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024223822/http://www.fascinationonline.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=26 |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Johan Marais}}
Beside Johan Marais being the founder and sole owner of the Fascination Books group, he is also the managing director of the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johanmarais.co.za/AboutJohan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He specialises in the field of [[herpetology]] and is currently completing a master's degree at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] under professor Graham Alexander, with whom he collaborated on the book ''Guide to [[Reptiles]] of Southern Africa''. Prior to this he published ''Snake versus Man'' (1994), ''Conservation and Utilization of the [[Nile Crocodile]]'' (1991; with professor Gerrie Smith), ''Snakes of the World'' (1984), ''Snakes and Snakebites'' (2001)  ''What's that Snake?'', a short identification guide on Southern African snakes, as well as ''Snakes of Southern Africa'' (2004; originally published in 1992, then totally rewritten), a complete guide, which was followed by the aforementioned reptile guide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johanmarais.co.za/AboutJohan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; All these books are published by Struik Books South Africa.

== Online Store ==
In April 2008, the company also introduced an online store on its website, with a range of up to 3 million books.  According to Marais, the online store was formed as a separate company and will not be part of the liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|title=Book chain closes doors {{!}} Fin24|date=2012-02-12|access-date=2017-08-31|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212133157/http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|archivedate=2012-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glamis Manse Stone''', also known as '''Glamis 2''', is a Class II [[Pictish stone]] at the village of [[Glamis]], [[Angus, Scotland]]. Dating from the 9th century, it is located outside the Manse, close to the parish church.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1997, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; It is inscribed on one side with a [[Celtic cross]] and on the other with a variety of [[Pict]]ish symbols.

==Location==
The cross slab is situated at the northeast edge of Glamis village in the grounds of the Manse, close to St Fergus church ({{gbmapping|NO38584686}}).&lt;ref name=Canmore&gt;{{citation

The cross face bears a Celtic cross carved in relief with [[ogee]] armpits. It has an incised ring and the shaft and roundel are decorated with [[Celtic knot|knotwork]] interlace designs, with the arms and portion above the roundel holding zoomorphic interlaces. The cross is surrounded by incised symbols and figural representations. In the lower left-hand quadrant is depiction of two bearded, long-haired men apparently fighting with axes. Above them is what appears to be a cauldron with human legs dangling out of it. The lower right-hand quadrant holds what appears to be either a deer or a hound's head, similar to symbols found on the [[Monifieth Sculptured Stones|Monifieth 2 stone]], above a [[Triple disc (Pictish symbol)|triple disc]] symbol. The top right quadrant holds a [[centaur]] holding a pair of axes. The top left quadrant holds what has been interpreted as a lion.&lt;ref name="date and context"/&gt;

The rear of the slab holds three incised symbols: a serpent above a fish, with a mirror at the bottom.

Historian Lloyd Laing has noted some peculiarities of the layout of the cross face. Firstly, the arms are not perfectly perpendicular to the shaft, being rotated slightly (2.5° anticlockwise). Secondly, the axis of the interlace of the cross roundel is skewed from the axis of the shaft by some 13°.&lt;ref name="date and context"/&gt;

The Glamis manse stone belongs to the Aberlemno School of Pictish sculpture as extended by Laing from Ross Trench Jellicoe's original proposed list. In addition to the Glamis manse stone, stones in the Aberlemno School include [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones#Aberlemno 2|Aberlemno 2]] (the Kirkyard Stone), [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones#Aberlemno 3|Aberlemno 3]], Menmuir 1, Kirriemuir 1, [[Monifieth Sculptured Stones#Monifieth 2|Monifieth 2]], [[Eassie Stone|Eassie]], Rossie Priory, and Glamis 1 (Hunter's Hill).&lt;ref name="date and context"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

He believed in the idea that cultural innovations occur only once and that they spread geographically. Based on this, he traced the origins of many cultural and traditional practices across the world, including the New World, to ideas that he believed came from Egypt and in some instances from Asia. An expert on brain anatomy, he was the first to study Egyptian mummies using radiological techniques. He took an interest in extinct humanoids and was embroiled in controversy over the authenticity of the [[Piltdown Man]].

==Professional career==
Smith was born in [[Grafton, New South Wales]] to Stephen Sheldrick Smith who had moved to Australia from London in 1860 and Mary Jane, née Evans. He received his early education from Grafton Public School where his father was headmaster. When the family moved to Sydney in 1883 he went to Darlington Public School before joining [[Sydney Boys High School]]. He attended evening classes on physiology by Thomas Anderson Stuart and took an early interest in biology. In an autobiographical note Smith noted that Stuart had shown them the convolutions of the human brain and declared that nobody understood them fully. Smith decided at that point that he would work towards understanding them. Accordingly, he went to study medicine at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1888 and received a Doctor of Medicine in 1895, with a dissertation on the fore-brain of the [[monotremes]]) and developed an interest in the anatomy of the human brain. He received a James King travelling scholarship and went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], graduating BA in 1896. Afterwards he catalogued the human [[brain]]-collection of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=adb /&gt;

Smith obtained an appointment at the Cairo School of Medicine in 1900 on the suggestion of his anthropologist friend Alexander Macalister. Smith became [[archaeology|archaeological]] advisor to the archaeological survey of Nubia in the wake of plans to construct the Aswan Dam which threatened to drown numerous archaeological sites. Smith conducted investigations on the [[brain]]s of [[Egypt]]ian [[mummy|mummies]]. He was the first to non-destructively use [[x-ray]]s to study mummies.&lt;ref name=todd&gt;{{cite journal| title=The scientific influence of Sir Grafton Elliot Smith| author=Todd, T. Wingate|pages= 523–526 | volume=39| issue=3| year=1937| journal=American Anthropologist| doi=10.1525/aa.1937.39.3.02a00120}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith took a special interest in the pathologies indicated in ancient skeletal remains. He noted for instance that many Egyptian skulls had biparietal thinning which had been common in European aristocrats in the past. Smith hypothesized this was the result of wearing heavy wigs or headgear. From 1909 to 1919 he was Professor in anatomy in [[Manchester]], 1919–1937 he held the chair of Anatomy at the [[University College London]]. He was elected President of the [[Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] for 1924 to 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.anatsoc.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/AS-officers-hist-final.pdf| title = The Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland – Presidents of the Society|publisher= The Anatomical Society|accessdate = 21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I he took an interest in the neurology of [[shell shock]], visiting military hospitals and serving on the British [[General Medical Council]].&lt;ref name=waldron&gt;{{cite journal|author=Waldron, H.A.| title= The study of the human remains from Nubia: the contribution of Grafton Elliot Smith and his colleagues to palaeopathology| journal=Medical History| volume=44| year=2000|pages=363–388| pmc=1044289| pmid=10954970|doi=10.1017/S0025727300066758}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Cite book|author=Blunt, Michael J. |chapter=Smith, Sir Grafton Elliot (1871–1937)|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography| publisher= Australian National University|url= http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/smith-sir-grafton-elliot-8470/text14895|year= 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was the leading specialist on the evolution of the brain of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macmillan|first=Malcolm
|year=2009|title=Evolution and the neurosciences down-under|journal=[[Journal of the history of the neurosciences]]|volume=18
|issue=2|pages=150–96 | pmid = 19367486|doi = 10.1080/09647040701662377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his ideas on the evolution of the primate brain still form the core of present scholarship. He proposed the following stages of development:
# a smell-dominated insectivore of the jumping [[shrew]]-type
# vision-dominated animals with an expanded cortex of tree-shrew-type
# acutely visioned, manually dexterous mammals of tarsius-type
# monkeys
# anthropoids using their hands to use and produce tools

==Honours and awards==
Smith was decorated by the [[Khedive]] of Egypt, [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmy]] in 1909 with an Insignia of the Third Class of the Imperial Ottoman Order of the Osmaniah.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12265/page/720/data.pdf Edinburgh Gazette, July 8, 1910. p. 720.]&lt;/ref&gt; He became Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1907,&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; [[Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]], cross of the French Legion of Honour, and was knighted in 1934. In 1912 he received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society, in 1930 the Honorary Gold Medal of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]], in 1936 the [[Huxley Memorial Medal]] from the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref name=adb /&gt;

==European hypothesis==

British anthropologists [[Arthur Keith]] and Grafton Elliot Smith both supported the European origin of humankind as opposed to models of Asian and African origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henke, Winfriend |author2= Hardt, Thorolf |year=2007|title= Handbook of paleoanthropology. Vol. 1.|publisher= Springer| isbn=9783540324744|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several of his works, Smith argued that Europe was the cradle of humanity, identifying a European [[Mediterranean race]] as the occupants of the original home of modern humans. His cradle was large, as he claimed the Mediterranean race had occupied the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]] and western Europe, including the [[British isles]]. He especially linked the Mediterranean race to the civilization of Egypt. Smith's arguments later became known as his theory of [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yoffee, Norman |author2= Sherratt, Andrew  |year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Archaeological_Theory.html?id=qUUQ-CZ5nsoC |title=Archeological theory, who sets the agenda?|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521449588|page= 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smith and [[William James Perry]], Egypt was the source of all cultural innovations and the ultimate source of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaw, Ian |year=2002| title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell| isbn=0631235833 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smith, "Man did not become truly erect until his brain had developed in a very particular way to make it possible for him to use his hands". That line of reasoning reinforced the European origin of human, which Smith and Keith supported, as the mostly large brained specimens such as the [[Cro-Magnon]] had been found in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Corbey, Raymond | author2=Roebroeks, Wil |year=2001| title=Studying human origins, disciplinary history and epistemology| publisher= Amsterdam University Press| isbn=9053564640|page= 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '[[hyperdiffusionism]]' seems to have been coined by the British archaeologist [[Glyn Daniel]] in his book ''The Idea of Prehistory'' (1962) with a somewhat derogatory intention. It was intended to represent extremes of [[diffusionism]], a theme popular in early 20th century archaeology that itself has been subject to criticism. Smith believed that all megalithic phenomena, whether in Northwestern [[Europe]], [[India]], [[Japan]] or [[Mesoamerica]], had originated in Ancient Egypt. "Small groups of people, moving mainly by sea, settled at certain places and there made rude imitations of the Egyptian monuments of the [[Pyramid]] Age." (Smith 1911, ix). Smith believed in a direct [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] to [[Syria]], [[Crete]], East [[Africa]], Southern [[Arabian peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Sumer]], and other areas were influenced by secondary diffusion. The [[Neolithic]] culture of Europe was derived from Egypt as well, according to Smith. He even interpreted a mummy from a [[Torres Strait]] island as definitely being indicative of an Egyptian influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Macleay Museum Mummy from Torres Straits: A Postscript to Elliot Smith and the Diffusion Controversy| author=Pretty, Graeme L.| journal=Man|volume=4| issue=1| year=1969| pages=24–43 | jstor=2799262| doi=10.2307/2799262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of hyperdiffusionism is now referred to by more neutral terms (when referring to the Americas) such as [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]].

Smith interpreted a small carving detail in Copán [[Maya stelae|stela]] B as an elephant, an animal unknown in the New World. [[Alfred Maudslay]] had described the detail as being a stylized tapir. Smith argued that the carving shows an elephant with a mahout atop it. He went on to point out many Asian features in the sculpture in his book ''Elephants and ethnologists'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Elephants and Maya Art|author=Yetts, W. Perceval| journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs| volume= 45| issue= 261| year= 1924| pages=262–265, 268–269| jstor=862358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
[[Egypt]] held a fortunate geographical position that made contacts to western [[Asia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] possible, while being safe from [[invasion]]s. The fertile soil led to ample leisure, in art and the crafts could be cultivated. Smith believed that agriculture had originated in Egypt and only later spread to [[Mesopotamia]]. "The earliest cultivators of the soil in Egypt were in fact laying the foundations not merely of [[agriculture]] and [[irrigation]] but of all the [[art]]s and craft, the [[society|social]] organization and [[religion|religious]] beliefs which became an integral part of the civilization that was being built up sixty centuries ago and in later ages was diffused throughout the world." (Smith 1911, 6)

Artificial irrigation led to cooperation and the development of a central [[government]] that was based on professional knowledge, a rule of hydraulic [[engineers]]. The prosperity of everybody depended on a successful administration and a strong central government (cf. [[Karl Wittfogel]]'s hydraulic hypothesis). Later on, the leading engineer became a [[sacred king]] (cf. [[Henri Frankfort]]) and a [[god]] ([[Osiris]]) after death. [[Ritual]] and [[magic and religion|magic]] formed the germs of the first [[science]]s, of [[biology]] and [[physics]]. The building of tombs initiated the development of [[architecture]].

Other inventions of the [[Egyptians]] were:
*Weaving
*Metal working (gold and copper)
*Calendar
*Seagoing ships
*"Art of shaving"
*Wigs
*Hats
*Pillows

The invention of [[metallurgy]] was the most important, as it quickened the pace of invention, widened the scope of human endeavour, stimulated the advancement of arts and crafts, and awakened courage and the spirit of great adventure. The search for copper was to become the most important factor in the universal spread of civilisation. Prospectors settled in foreign countries and introduced agriculture, burial customs, and their religion as well.

At first, Smith remained vague on the reasons for the spread of Egyptian influence to places without mineral deposits like [[Polynesia]]. However, in 1915 [[William James Perry]], a professor of comparative religion at the [[University of Manchester]], advanced the view that the "megalith-builders" were looking for [[pearl]]s and [[gemstone|precious stones]], which Smith adopted as well.

Smith did not believe that the spread of [[culture]] was necessarily connected to a certain race, in contrast to other diffusionists, like the German prehistorian [[Gustaf Kossinna]]. While he saw a racial affinity between the Egyptians and the first agriculturalists of southern Europe, both being of the "brown race," the spread of civilisation was mainly a spread of [[idea]]s, not of [[tribe]]s or people.

However, in ''The Ancient Egyptians and their Influence Upon the Civilization of Europe'', written in 1911, he clearly demonstrates a steep rise in "Asiatic traits (Armenoid, Alpine, Celtic)," within the Egyptian aristocracy, to Dynastic Egypt itself (amongst other pre-historical phenomena).

====History====
In the age of [[Colonialism]], hyperdiffusionism proved attractive, as it showed how [[missionary|missionaries]], engineers and prospectors had spread civilisation all over the earth, as the colonial nations believed that they were doing themselves.

Later on, hyperdiffusionism supplied a single simple explanation of the complex process of neolithisation that made it attractive to amateur archaeologists worldwide. It could be used to retain a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] view on history in the face of increasing evidence for impressive autochthonous development, such as in Zimbabwe ([[Great Zimbabwe]]), Polynesia ([[Easter Island]]), and Micronesia ([[Nan Madol]] on the island of [[Pohnpei]]).

Now, it is widely believed that the megalithic graves of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], northern [[Germany]], and [[Poland]] are much older than the Egyptian pyramids, and the Mesoamerican pyramids are more recent and considered to be local cultural innovations.

== Private life ==
His father had migrated to [[New South Wales]] from London. He had attended a working men's college under [[John Ruskin]] and later became a teacher and headmaster in [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]], New South Wales. His older brother (Stephen H. Smith) was later Director of Education in New South Wales; his younger brother (Stewart Arthur Smith) was Acting Professor of Anatomy at the University of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/4139 Royal College of Physicians - Lives of the fellows]&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Kathleen Macreadie in 1902 just before moving to Cairo. During his time in London, he lived variously in Hampstead, Gower Street, and at [[Regent's Park]]. During his London years, he became a friend of Dr. [[W. H. R. Rivers]].

Smith's youngest son, Stephen Smith, died in an accident in 1936. Smith spent his final year in a nursing home in London.

Grafton Smith died on [[New Year's Day]] 1 January 1937 at [[Broadstairs]] in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Latin American Studies''' (ILAS) was established in 1965 at the [[University of London]], with the objective of providing a focus for research on the literature, history, politics and economics of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Between 2004 and 2013, the ILAS formed part of the [[Institute for the Study of the Americas]] (ISA), along with the [[Institute of United States Studies]] (IUSS). In August 2013, ILAS was re-established to focus solely on supporting research on Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;http://ilas.sas.ac.uk/about-us/news/important-announcement-regarding-changes-institute-study-americas&lt;/ref&gt; Located in [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]], ILAS is one of ten institutes that together comprise the [[School of Advanced Study]], University of London.

The national and international mission of ILAS is to support researchers engaged in scholarship in the humanities broadly defined pertaining to Latin America and the Caribbean by building and maintaining national scholarly networks; hosting visiting fellows; hosting and promoting academic events; and providing digital resources of use for the research community. The Institute’s focus is multidisciplinary and, as part of the School of Advanced Study, benefits from academic collaboration across a wide range of subject fields in the humanities and social sciences. Further, ILAS works closely with cultural, diplomatic and business organizations with an interest in Latin America.

[[Image:Heitiki01.jpg|thumb|right|19th-century sketch of a [[New Zealand]] [[Māori people|Māori]] [[hei-tiki]]]]
'''Jewellery making in the Pacific''' started later than in other areas, due to relatively recent human settlement. Early [[Polynesia]]n [[jewellery]], which was made of bone, wood and other natural materials, has not survived. The precise start of island jewellery-making is difficult to pinpoint, due to many of the island nations' founders migrating there from other areas, such as [[Tahiti]].

Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist. Headdresses, necklaces, hair pins and arm and waist belts are the most common pieces amongst island cultures.

==Types and social meanings==

The styles and types of [[jewellery]] in the [[Pacific]] changes greatly from [[island]] to island, as does the purpose of wearing it. As in most cultures, jewellery in the Pacific is worn to symbolise the wearer's power, whether it be wealth or victory in battle. Jewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either power, but in many cases across the Pacific, jewellery is worn to show fertility. As a prime example, the [[hei-tiki]] of the [[New Zealand]] [[Māori people|Māori]] is said to be a sign of fertility. However, many historians suggest that the carved [[necklace]] has connections with Tiki, the first Māori, who also has strong ties with the symbolism of fertility. Historians also speculate that the reason the tiki is worn is that the Tiki is a product of the ancient belief of a god named Tiki. This supreme being is known to be ancient and not solely localised to the Māori, and is thought to date back to before the Māoris even settled in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="maori"&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucTheC-t1-g1-t2-body1-d13.html#n303 Hiroa, T.R. 1974. The Coming of the Maori], ''Wellington: Whitcombe and Tombs''&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like European Jewellery many pacific cultures used rare substances like special shells to show that they had traditional wealth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.new-guinea-tribal-arts.com/traditional-pacific-island-jewelry/|title=Traditional Pacific Island Jewelry {{!}} sell Pacific Island Jewelry {{!}} tribal {{!}} Ethnic|date=2018-05-17|work=new guinea tribal arts|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many pieces of Jewellery were important items of trade and acted as a form of currency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.new-guinea-tribal-arts.com/new-guinea-adornments/|title=New Guinea Adornments {{!}} sell New Guinea Adornment {{!}} tribal adornments|date=2018-05-16|work=new guinea tribal arts|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The best documented example is [[Kula ring|Kula]] from Milne bay province in Papua New Guinea

Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy in battle. The wearing of headdresses is particularly common in [[Papua New Guinea]], where there are often many different types of headdress for different occasions. These headdresses are usually made out of vegetation, but designs often include [[birds of paradise]] feathers, including the highly sought-after [[King of Saxony bird-of-paradise|King of Saxony]] feathers. The power associated with the headdresses in Papua New Guinea is phenomenal, perhaps stirred by the amount of work and craftsmanship that has gone into make such a feathered display.

Like the Papua New Guineans, New Zealand Māori wore feathered headdresses too to symbolize power. The now extinct [[huia]] feather was highly prized, with chiefs wearing white-tipped huia feathers to symbolise power over chiefs wearing monotone feathers. Huia feathers were revered as "taonga" or treasures by Māori and in later times, the European settlers. The huia feathers were often grouped in twos and were usually accompanied by a [[kiwi]] feather cloak, an ear piercing and commonly a small [[jade]] club. After Western colonisation, European woman began wearing the feathers{{dubious|date=December 2010}}  to express their strong social standing.&lt;ref name="maori"/&gt;

[[Image:Opal Armband 800pix.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[opal]] [[bracelet]] from Australia]]
Pacific jewellery has now lost much of its former strong cultural meaning. Most Pacific jewellery now is created for the sole purpose of commercial and tourist profits. Indeed, some pieces of jewellery have become major symbols of the Pacific's lifestyle to tourists, such as [[lei (Hawaii)|lei]]s in [[Hawaii]], which are now commonly associated with that area and its laid back, tourist-friendly attitude. Another example is the previously mentioned New Zealand tiki, which is generally one of the more purchased jewellery types from the country.&lt;ref name="maori"/&gt; 

[[Australia]] is notable for its large deposits of [[opal]]s, with the country being the number one supplier of opals in the world. The richest source is at [[Lightning Ridge]]&lt;ref name="opal"&gt;Dorling Kindersley Ltd. 1989. Facts and Fallacies: Stories of the Strange and Unusual. ''Reader's Digest''. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
In some regions of the Pacific, jewellery is still very much untouched by outside influences, and therefore very primal. Testaments to this are parts of [[Borneo]] and Papua New Guinea, which are still unexplored by Westerners. Tribesmen may wear boar bones through their noses, very much like the typical tribal cliché people outside these cultures use.

Much of the islands' tribal designs were lost due to the introduction of outside religions via the flood of Western missionaries that entered the area. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to [[Christianity]]. Now, most traditional jewellery is created for tourists or under a newly found respect for the tribal designs. Indeed, many island nations are now rekindling the art of traditional jewellery making in an attempt to salvage lost designs or techniques. After the mass conversion to other religions, Pacific jewellery eventually adopted religious symbols in their jewellery designs. For example, many designs incorporated Christian symbols such as the cross.

Traditional pieces of island jewellery were occasionally made for religious purposes. Many pieces were created for tribal ceremonies, tattoo rituals and marriage. In fact, use of jewellery for religious functions in the Pacific was as common as in any other culture. Pieces were often handed down from generation to generation, further escalating the importance of the jewellery. Design was key in Pacific pieces: even simple shapes such as a background square could have a complicated meaning when placed with other symbols.  Historians have conceded that this level of design is often lacking in other cultures.&lt;ref name="pacific jewelelry"&gt;Neich, R., Pereira, F. 2004. Pacific Jewellery and Adornment. ''David Bateman'' &amp; ''Auckland Museum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:Ahu Tahai.jpg|thumb|right|Restored [[moai]] with [[pukao]] (headdress) on [[Easter Island]]]]
Many examples of Pacific jewellery exist. As with the rest of the world, every [[Polynesia]]n culture had at least one form of body adornment. Even the [[Rapa Nui]] people of [[Easter Island]], a small island over 2,000 miles from any land mass, had jewellery. Examples of their jewellery can be found on the giant [[moai]] they left behind, some of which wear [[pukao]] headdresses. It is thought that the moai with these adornments depicted individuals of higher social standing, because in other cultures, people who could afford jewellery were considered wealthier and more important in ancient times.

One of the most recognisable pieces of jewellery tied to a culture is the [[Hawaii]]an [[Lei (Hawaii)|lei]]. This floral necklace is given out when an outsider arrives, and thus is used widely as a commercial icon for travellers who visit the islands. Special candy leis have also been introduced for children's birthday parties.

Some nations are still less industrialized than other larger nations, for example, the island nation of [[Samoa]]. Although a haven for tourists, the country is still well below the poverty line and thus, jewellery that is not for commercial use, is still quite primitive. Craftsmen from the area still use natural materials to create their jewellery, and the way in which they go about making the jewellery is also often based on ancestral designs. Shells, bone, coconut and wood are all used in Samoan jewellery. [[Coir]] is often used in place of string.

Throughout the Pacific, some jewellery pieces are more common than others. For example, necklaces, earrings and headdresses of different sorts are all very common items used by Polynesians to adorn themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.new-guinea-tribal-arts.com/traditional-shell-jewellery/|title=Traditional shell jewellery {{!}} sell Traditional shell jewellery {{!}} tribal {{!}} Ethnic|date=2018-05-22|work=new guinea tribal arts|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some pieces, such as the wearing of masks, are only apparent in certain areas, such as [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Micronesia]]. Breast plates were worn by Fijians and Tongan as well as some other small islands in the Pacific. Belts and adornments hung off them, are mainly situated around Papua New Guinea and its neighbours, while nose piercings are also found in that area. Overall, although jewellery pieces in the Pacific are very similar amongst the island nations, they are also varied greatly and each piece represents the wearer's beliefs, ancestry and nation to the observer.

[[Image:Koeh-077.jpg|thumb|250px|The roots of ''[[Ipomoea]] jalapa'', when dried, are carried as the John the Conquer root [[amulet]].]]
'''John the Conqueror''', also known as '''High John the Conqueror''', '''John de Conquer''', and many other folk variants, is a [[folk hero]] from African-American folklore. He is associated with a certain root, the '''John the Conqueror root''', or '''John the Conqueroo''', to which [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers are ascribed in [[American folklore]], especially among the [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] tradition of [[folk magic]]. [[Muddy Waters]] mentions him as Johnny Cocheroo pronounced Johnny Conqueroo in the songs, "[[Mannish Boy]]" and "[[Hoochie Coochie Man|I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man]]". In  "Mannish Boy" the line is "I think I'll go down/To old Kansas too/I'm gonna bring back my second cousin/That little Johnny Conqueroo", and in "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man" it is called "John De Conquer Blue".

== Folk hero ==

John the Conqueror was an African [[prince]] who was sold as a [[slavery|slave]] in the Americas. Despite his enslavement, his spirit was never broken and he survived in [[folklore]] as a sort of a [[trickster]] figure, because of the tricks he played to evade his masters. [[Joel Chandler Harris]]'s [[Br'er Rabbit]] of the ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories is said to be patterned after High John the Conqueror. [[Zora Neale Hurston]] wrote of his adventures ("High John de Conquer") in her collection of folklore, ''The Sanctified Church''.

In one traditional John the Conqueror story told by [[Virginia Hamilton]], and probably based on "[[Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil's Daughter]]", John falls in love with the [[Devil]]'s daughter. The Devil sets John a number of impossible tasks: he must clear sixty [[acre]]s (25 [[hectare|ha]]) of land in half a day, and then sow it with [[maize|corn]] and reap it in the other half a day. The Devil's daughter furnishes John with a magical [[axe]] and [[plow]] that get these impossible tasks done, but warns John that her father the Devil means to kill him even if he performs them. John and the Devil's daughter steal the Devil's own horses; the Devil pursues them, but they escape his clutches by [[shape-shifting]].

In "High John De Conquer", Zora Neale Hurston reports that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurston|first=Zora Neale|date=October 1943|title=High John De Conquer|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1943oct-00450|journal=The American Mercury|volume=|pages=450–458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|like [[King Arthur]] of England, he has served his people. And, like King Arthur, he is not dead. He waits to return when his people shall call him again&amp;nbsp;... High John de Conquer went back to Africa, but he left his power here, and placed his American dwelling in the root of a certain plant. Only possess that root, and he can be summoned at any time.}}

This is from Hurston's published article in American Mercury magazine in 1943.  In this article she relates a few stories about High John, enough to define him, but not an exhaustive survey of the folklore.  The purpose was to present the nation with the hope-building and the power of this inspiring figure during the darkest days of World War II.  The article ends with:

{{quote|So the brother in black offers to these United States the source of courage that endures, and laughter. High John de Conquer. If the news from overseas reads bad, if the nation inside seems like it is stuck in the Tar Baby, listen hard, and you will hear High John de Conquer treading on his singing-drum. You will know then, that no matter how bad things look now, it will be worse for those who seek to oppress us. ... White America, take a laugh from out of our black mouths, and win! We give you High John de Conquer.|The American Mercury, October 1943, pp. 450-458&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1943oct-00450]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plant Information and details on Species==

The root known as High John the Conqueror or John the Conqueror root is said to be the root of ''[[Ipomoea jalapa]]'', also known as ''[[Ipomoea purga]]'', an ''[[Ipomoea]]'' species related to the morning glory and the [[sweet potato]]. The plant is known in some areas as bindweed or [[jalap]] root. It has a pleasant, earthy odour, but it is a strong [[laxative]] if taken internally. It is not used for this purpose in folk magic; it is instead used as one of the parts of a [[mojo (African American culture)|mojo bag]]. It is typically used in sexual spells of various sorts and it is also considered lucky for [[gambling]]. It is likely that the root acquired its sexual magical reputation because, when dried, it resembles the [[testicle]]s of a dark-skinned man. Because of this, when it is employed as an [[amulet]], it is important that the root used be whole and unblemished. Dried pieces and chips of the root are used in formulating oils and washes that are used in other sorts of spells.

[[Cecil Adams]] has written that John the Conqueror root is the root of [[St. John's wort]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_318.html&lt;/ref&gt; St. John's wort root is a thin and thread-like root, while John the Conqueror root is a tuber. John the Conqueror root is carried by the user, and the spell is cast by rubbing the root, which could not be done with a filamentous root.

== Other herbs related to the legend ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Other roots are linked to the same body of legends.

Low John is the root of the [[trillium]] or wake-robin, ''[[Trillium grandiflorum]]''.  It is carried on the person for assistance in family matters. It is also known as [[Dixie]] John or Southern John, and additionally is the basis for a [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] formula called Dixie Love Oil.

"Chewing John" is [[galangal]], ''[[Alpinia galanga]]'' – a member of the [[ginger]] family. This is chewed much as [[chewing tobacco]] is chewed, to sweeten the breath and to calm the stomach. It is said that if you spit the juice from chewing this root onto the floor of a courtroom before the [[judge]] enters, you will win your case. Other names for this root are Little John and Little John to Chew. (This is called "Low John" in the Deep South.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18991">'''Language analysis for the determination of origin''' ('''LADO''') is an instrument used in asylum cases to [[Linguistic profiling#Geographic origin|determine the national or ethnic origin]] of the asylum seeker, through an evaluation of their language profile. To this end, an interview with the asylum seeker is recorded and analysed. The analysis consists of an examination of the [[Dialectology|dialectologically]] relevant features (e.g. [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]] and [[loanword]]s) in the speech of the [[asylum seeker]]. LADO is considered a type of speaker identification by [[Forensic linguistics|forensic linguists]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Tiersma &amp; Lawrence M. Solan (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; LADO analyses are usually made at the request of government immigration/asylum bureaux attempting to verify asylum claims, but may also be performed as part of the appeals process for claims which have been denied; they have frequently been the subject of appeals and litigation in several countries, e.g. Australia, the Netherlands and the UK.

==Background==
A number of established linguistic approaches are considered to be valid methods of conducting LADO, including language variation and change,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2010). 'Language variation and LADO (Language Analysis for Determination of Origin).' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The role of language in European asylum procedures: A linguistic and legal survey, pp73-87. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JK Chambers, Peter Trudgill and Natalie Schilling-Estes, eds. (2002). The Handbook of Language Variation and Change. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; forensic phonetics,&lt;ref&gt;Moosmüller, Sylvia. (2010). 'IAFPA position on language analysis in asylum procedures.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 43–47. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; dialectology, and language assessment.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Tim &amp; Carsten Roever. (2006). Language testing: The social dimension. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying assumption leading to government immigration and asylum bureaux's use of LADO is that a link exists between a person's nationality and the way they speak. To linguists, this assumption is flawed: instead, research supports links between the family and community in which a person learns their  native language, and enduring features of their way of speaking it. The notion that [[Linguistic anthropology#Socialization|linguistic socialization]] into a [[speech community]] lies at the heart of LADO has been argued for by linguists since 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Language and National Origin Group. (2004). 'Guidelines for the Use of Language Analysis in relation to Questions of National Origin in Refugee Cases'. The International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law 11(2): 261–266.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now accepted by a range of government agencies (e.g. Switzerland,&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Baltisberger, Eric &amp; Priska Hubbuch. (2010). 'LADO with specialized linguists: The development of Lingua's working method.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp9-19. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway&lt;ref&gt;UDI 2009. 'Specified requirements for language analysis for the Norwegian Immigration Administration.' Oslo: Utlendingsdirektoratet, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;), academic researchers (e.g. Eades 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Eades, Diana. (2009). 'Testing the claims of asylum seekers: The role of language analysis.' Language Assessment Quarterly 6: 30–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser 2011,&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Helen. 2011. 'Language analysis for the determination of origin (LADO).' In C. A. Chapelle (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Maryns 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Maryns, Katrijn. 2006. The asylum speaker: Language in the Belgian asylum procedure. Manchester: St. Jerome.&lt;/ref&gt; and Patrick 2013&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2013.) 'Asylum and language analysis.' In Susan K Brown &amp; Frank D Bean (eds.), Encyclopedia of Migration. Heidelberg: Springer Verlag. http://www.springerreference.com/docs/edit/chapterdbid/349348.html&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as some commercial agencies (e.g. De Taalstudio, according to Verrips 2010&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2010). 'Language analysis and contra-expertise in the Dutch asylum procedure.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(2): 279–294.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Where it is used==
Since the mid-1990s, language analysis has been used to help determine the geographical origin of [[asylum seeker]]s by the governments of a growing number of countries (Reath, 2004),&lt;ref&gt;Reath, A. (2004). 'Language analysis in the context of the asylum process: Procedures, validity, and consequences.' Language Assessment Quarterly: 1–4, 209–233.&lt;/ref&gt; now including [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

Pilots have been conducted by the UK, [[Ireland]], and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;UDI 2009. 'Specified requirements for language analysis for the Norwegian Immigration Administration.' Oslo: Utlendingsdirektoratet, July 2009. https://www.udiregelverk.no/Global/Images/Rettskilder/Rundskriv/RS%202011%20023/RS%202011%20023V5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The UK legitimised the process in 2003; it has subsequently been criticised by immigration lawyers (see response by the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association&lt;ref&gt;IPA April 2009. 'Response to the UK Border Agency "NAM+ Asylum Programme" presentation to the National Asylum Stakeholder Forum (NASF) on 19 March 2009' http://www.docstoc.com/docs/44362029/Response-to-the-UK-Border-Agency-NAM-Asylum-Programme&lt;/ref&gt;), and also Craig 2012&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Sarah. 2012. The use of language in asylum decision-making in the UK – a discussion. Journal of Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Law 26(3): 255–268. Oxford University Press: Westlaw.&lt;/ref&gt;); and social scientists (e.g. Campbell 2013&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John. (2013.) 'Language analysis in the United Kingdom's Refugee Status Determination system: Seeing through policy claims about 'expert knowledge'.' Ethnic and Racial Studies 36(4): 670–690.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as linguists (e.g. Patrick 2011&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2011.) 'Key problems in language analysis for the determination of origin.' Plenary address to the International Association of Forensic Linguistics 10th Biennial conference at Aston University (July 2011). http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~patrickp/papers/IAFL10plenary_July2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the [[Netherlands]] LADO is commissioned by the Dutch Immigration Service (IND, http://www.ind.nl/Themas/Taalanalyse/Pages/default.aspx). Language analysis is used by the IND in cases where asylum seekers cannot produce valid identification documents, and, in addition, the IND sees reason to doubt the claimed origin of the asylum seeker. The IND has a specialised unit (Bureau Land en Taal, or BLT; in English, the Office for Country Information and Language Analysis, or OCILA) that carries out these analyses. Challenges to BLT analyses are provided by De Taalstudio &lt;http://www.taalstudio.nl/taalanalyse/index_uk.html&gt;, a private company that provides language analysis and contra-expertise in LADO cases. Claims and criticisms regarding the Dutch LADO processes are discussed by Cambier-Langeveld (2010),&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2010.) 'The validity of language analysis in the Netherlands.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 21–33. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; the senior linguist for BLT/OCILA, and by Verrips 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2010.) 'Language analysis and contra-expertise in the Dutch asylum procedure.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(2): 279–294.&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of De Taalstudio.

Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; 2010&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, Karin. (2010.) 'Dutch court decisions and language analysis for the determination of origin.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 43–47. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) reviews the legal situation.

LADO reports are provided to governments in a number of ways: by their own regularly-employed linguists and/or freelance analysts; by independent academic experts; by commercial firms; or by a mixture of the above. In Switzerland language analysis is carried out by LINGUA, a specialized unit of the Federal Office for Migration, which both employs linguists and retains independent experts from around the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; The German and Austrian bureaux commission reports primarily from experts within their own countries. The UK and a number of other countries have commercial contracts with providers such as the Swedish firms Sprakab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakab.se/Home.html |title=Home |publisher=Sprakab.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Verified &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verified.se/ |title=Verified AB – Language Analyses, Dialect Identification, Linguistic Expertise |publisher=Verified.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
both of which have carried out language analyses for UK Visas and Immigration (formerly UK Border Agency) and for the Dutch Immigration Service, as well as other countries around the world.

==Language analysts==
It is widely agreed that language analysis should be done by language experts. Two basic types of practitioners commonly involved in LADO can be distinguished: trained native speakers of the language under analysis, and professional linguists specialized in the language under analysis. Usually native speaker analysts are free-lance employees who are said to be under the supervision of a qualified linguist. When such analysts lack academic training in linguistics, it has been questioned whether they should be accorded the status of 'experts' by asylum tribunals, e.g. by Patrick (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2012.) 'Language analysis for determination of origin: Objective evidence for refugee status determination.' Chapter 38 in Peter M. Tiersma &amp; Lawrence M. Solan (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt; who refers to them instead as "non-expert native speakers (NENSs)". Eades et al. (2003) note that "people who have studied linguistics to professional levels [...] have particular knowledge which is not available to either ordinary speakers or specialists in other disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;Eades, D., H. Fraser, J. Siegel, T. McNamara &amp; B. Baker. (2003.) 'Linguistic identification in the determination of nationality: A preliminary report.' Language Policy 2: 179–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Dikker and Verrips (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Dikker, S. &amp; Verrips, M. (2004.) 'Taalanalyse: een vak apart.' Onderzoeksrapport. Monnickendam: De Taalstudio.&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that native speakers who lack training in linguistics are not able to formulate reliable conclusions regarding the origin of other speakers of their language. The nature of the training which commercial firms and government bureaux provide to their analysts has been questioned in academic and legal arenas, but few specifics have been provided to date; see however accounts by the Swiss agency Lingua&lt;ref&gt;Baltisberger, Eric &amp; Priska Hubbuch. (2010.) 'LADO with specialized linguists: The development of Lingua's working method.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp9-19. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambier-Langeveld of BLT/OCILA,&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2010.) 'The role of linguists and native speakers in language analysis for the determination of speaker origin.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(1): 67–93&lt;/ref&gt; as well as responses to the latter by Fraser &lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Helen. (2011.) 'The role of linguists and native speakers in language analysis for the determination of speaker origin: A response to Tina Cambier-Langeveld.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 18(1): 121–130.&lt;/ref&gt; and Verrips.&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2011.) 'LADO and the pressure to draw strong conclusions: A response to Tina Cambier-Langeveld.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 18(1): 131–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims for and against the use of such native-speaker analysts, and their ability to conduct LADO satisfactorily vis-a-vis the ability of academically-trained linguists, have only recently begun to be the subject of research (e.g. Wilson 2009),&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kim. (2009.) 'Language analysis for the determination of origin: Native speakers vs. trained linguists.' MSc dissertation in Linguistics, University of York&lt;/ref&gt; and no consensus yet exists among linguists. While much linguistic research exists on the ability of people, including trained linguists and phoneticians and untrained native speakers, to correctly perceive, identify or label recorded speech that is played to them, almost none of the research has yet been framed in such a way that it can give clear answers to questions about the LADO context.

==Litigation==
The matter of native-speaker analysts and many other issues are subjects of ongoing litigation in asylum tribunals and appeals courts in several countries. Vedsted Hansen (2010&lt;ref&gt;Vedsted Hansen, Jens. 2010. 'The use of language analysis in the Danish asylum procedure.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 199–207. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) describes the Danish situation, Noll (2010&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Gregor. 2010. 'The 2007 rejection of anonymous language analysis by the Swedish Migration Court of Appeal: A precedent?' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 211–213. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) comments on Sweden, and Zwaan (2010) reviews the Dutch situation.
 
In the UK, a 2010 Upper Tribunal (asylum) case known as 'RB',&lt;ref&gt;RB (Linguistic evidence Sprakab) Somalia [2010] UKUT 329 (IAC) (15 September 2010), http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2010/00329_ukut_iac_2010_rb_somalia.html&lt;/ref&gt; supported by a 2012 Court of Appeal decision,&lt;ref&gt;RB (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 277 (13 March 2012), http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/277.html&amp;query=rb+and+somalia&amp;method=boolean&lt;/ref&gt; argue for giving considerable weight to LADO reports carried out by the methodology of native-speaker analyst plus supervising linguist. In contrast, a 2013 Scottish Court of Sessions decision known as M.Ab.N+K.A.S.Y.&lt;ref&gt;M.Ab.N. &amp; K.A.S.Y. v SSHD [2013] CSIH 68, http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2013CSIH68.html&lt;/ref&gt; found that all such reports must be weighed against the standard Practice Directions for expert reports. Lawyers in the latter case have argued that "What matters is the lack of qualification",&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Joseph. Free Movement blog, 24 July 2013. 'Court of Sessions rules on linguistic analysis.' http://www.freemovement.org.uk/2013/07/24/court-of-session-rules-on-linguistic-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; and since the Scottish court has equal standing to the England and Wales Appeals Court, the UK Supreme Court was petitioned to address the issues. On 5–6 March 2014, the UK Supreme Court &lt;ref&gt;UK Supreme Court. http://www.supremecourt.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; heard an appeal&lt;ref&gt;UKSC 2012/0202. {{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/case_2013_0202.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082701/http://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/case_2013_0202.html |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by the Home Office concerning the nature of expert linguistic evidence provided to the Home Office in asylum cases, whether expert witness should be granted anonymity, the weight that should be given to reports by the Swedish firm Sprakab, and related matters.

==Criticism==
Some methods of language analysis in asylum procedures have been heavily criticized by many linguists (e.g., Eades et al. 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Eades, Diana &amp; Jacques Arends, eds. (2004). Language Analysis and Determination of Nationality. In International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law: Forensic Linguistics, 11(2): 179–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Arends, 2003). Proponents of the use of native-speaker analysts agree that "[earlier] LADO reports were not very satisfactory from a linguistic point of view... [while even] today's reports are still not likely to satisfy the average academic linguist".&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2012.) 'Clarification of the issues in language analysis: A rejoinder to Fraser and Verrips.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 19(1): 95, 108, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following an item on the Dutch public radio programme Argos, member of parliament De Wit of the Socialist Party presented a number of questions to the State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice regarding the reliability of LADO. The questions and the responses by the State Secretary can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justitie.nl/images/betrouwbaarheid%20taalanalyses_12840_tcm34-161304.pdf |title=Ministerie van Veiligheid en Justitie &amp;#124; Rijksoverheid.nl |publisher=Justitie.nl |date=1995-04-30 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic [[U.S. Air Mail]] was established as a new class of mail service by the [[United States]] [[Post Office Department]] (POD) on May 15, 1918, with the inauguration of the Washington&amp;ndash;Philadelphia&amp;ndash;New York route. Special [[postage stamps]] were issued for use with this service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400048427 The Official Blackbook Price Guide to U.S. Postage Stamps 2005], 27th Edition (Official Blackbook Price Guide to United States Postage Stamps) by Thomas E.

[[Scott catalog]]ed stamps received a "C" designation for airmail issues beginning in 1940.  Designated for international mail, and showing a small airplane, the January, 2012 $1.05 Scenic America series issue was designated C150.  However, with the January, 2013 issue of the $1.10 Global [[Forever Stamp]] no specific airmail purpose was shown in the design.  Rather, the Postal Service stated that this "stamp offers a single price for any First-Class Mail International 1-ounce letter to any country in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.usps.com/store/browse/productDetailSingleSku.jsp?productId=S_578804&amp;categoryId=subcatS_S_Sheets Global Forever]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a regular series Scott number, 4740, was designated.

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre – The World Heritage Convention|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=25 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827065310/http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/|archive-date=27 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] inherited the former country of [[Yugoslavia]]'s accession to the convention on 12 July 1993 as one of the successor states.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ba|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=25 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803110624/http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ba|archive-date=3 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2018}}, there are three sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the list and a further nine on the tentative list (the official list of sites that may be considered for future submission).&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; The first site, the [[Stari Most|Old Bridge Area of the Old City of Mostar]], was inscribed to the list at the 29th UNESCO session in 2005.&lt;ref name="unesco1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/946|title=Old Bridge Area of the Old City of Mostar – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=25 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228224325/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/946/|archive-date=28 December 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, during the [[Bosnian War]], it was destroyed by the [[Croatian Defence Council]] in an artillery barrage.

The latter is a transnational site, which is also partly in Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro.

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre – The World Heritage Convention|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]], following its [[Independence of Croatia|declaration of independence]] from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on 25 June 1991, succeeded the convention on 6 July 1992.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/hr|title=Croatia|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are ten sites inscribed on the list and 15 sites on the tentative list. The first three sites, [[Historical Complex of Split with the Palace of Diocletian]], [[Dubrovnik]], and [[Plitvice Lakes National Park]], were inscribed to the list at the 3rd UNESCO session in 1979. Further sites were added in 1997, 2000, 2008, 2016, and 2017.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; In total, there are eight cultural and two natural sites, as determined by the organization's [[World Heritage site#Selection criteria|selection criteria]]. Three of the sites are shared with other countries.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt;

During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], military confrontations took place in Dubrovnik ([[Siege of Dubrovnik]]) and in the Plitvice Lakes area. Extensive artillery damage in Dubrovnik and landmines laid around Plitvice resulted in the two sites being listed as [[List of World Heritage in Danger|endangered]] in 1991. Following their restoration, Plitvice and Dubrovnik were removed from the list of endangered sites in 1997 and 1998, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/1997/whc-97-conf208-17e.pdf |title=World Heritage Committee: Twenty-first session |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|format=PDF |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/1998/whc-98-conf203-18e.pdf |title=World Heritage Committee: Twenty-first session|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org |format=PDF |date= 14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Croatia's World Heritage sites generate large numbers of visitors, new threats are emerging due to the detrimental effects of uncontrolled mass tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sven Milekic, Dusica Tomovic, Sinisa Jakov Marusic |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/uncontrolled-tourism-threatens-balkan-unesco-sites-04-13-2017 |title=Uncontrolled Tourism Threatens Balkan UNESCO Sites |publisher=Balkan Insight |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/3616 |title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - State of Conservation (SOC 2017) Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatia) |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16652">[[Charles-Auguste Lebourg]] was a French sculptor born in [[Nantes]] in 1829. He died in Paris in 1906. This is a listing of his main works.

==Main works==
These are listed below.

==Paris' Hôtel de ville==
In 1881, Lebourg executed an allegory of Nantes as part of the town hall's decoration.&lt;ref name=wkp/&gt;

=="Travail"==
Lebourg executed the bronze statue '''"Travail"''' for the École Diderot.&lt;ref name=wkp/&gt; It was shown at the 1885 Paris Salon and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]].&lt;ref name=wkp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikiphidias.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=481:lebourg-charles-auguste&amp;catid=34:biographie&amp;Itemid=53#Synthèse|title=Biographical details|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leveilleurdenuit.pagesperso-orange.fr/|title=école Diderot|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bust of Richard Wallace, Fourth Marquess of Hertford and Lady Wallace==
[[Image:Charles Lebourg - buste de Mme Wallace.jpg|Bust of Lady Wallace|thumb|centre|200px|Lady Wallace]]
In 1872 Lebourg completed a posthumous bust in white marble based on a photograph of the Wallaces by Étienne Corjat of 1855. His white marble bust of Lady Wallace shown here was exhibited at the Paris salon in May 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisburn.com/books/historical_society/volume8/volume8-8.html
|title=Richard Wallace and his wife|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Berger lisant"==
[[File:Statue Fontainebleau Charles Le Bourg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marble statue "Berger lisant" by Charles-Auguste Lebourg (French sculptor, 1829-1906), in a niche of the wing of the "Galerie des Cerfs", Château de Fontainebleau]]
This Lebourg sculpture depicting a shepherd reading stands in the grounds of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statuedefrance.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=534
|title=Berger lisant|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Louvre==
Lebourg has three of his sculptures decorating parts of the outside of the Louvre. The Mollien Pavilion and the Ailes Mollien (an "aile" is a wing) is part of the cour Napoléon and is named after a Treasury minister at the time of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] ([[Nicolas François, Count Mollien]]) and Lebourg's '''"La Chasse"''' is one of the group of children decorating what is known as the "aile en retour Mollien". The second of Lebourg's sculptures can be seen in the Richelieu pavilion where the tympanum of the arcade of the passage leading to the rue de Rivoli is decorated with Lebourg's bas relief '''"Vérite et Histoire"'''. The third sculpture, again part of the cour Napoléon, decorates the Apollon rotunda and is entitled '''"La Force"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louvre.sculpturederue.fr/index.html

|title=La Chasse|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Wallace Fountains]]==
Lebourg is arguably best known for his [[caryatid]]s for the famous cast-iron [[Wallace fountain]], a public drinking fountain seen all over France and in many parts of the world. They are named after the Englishman Richard Wallace, who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the Wallace Collection in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford. The caryatids depict '''"La Simplicité"''', '''"La Bonté"''', '''"La Sobriété"''' and '''"La Charite"''' as shown below.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Monument to the men of [[Loire-Inférieure]] who died in the 1870 war==
[[File:Nantes - Monum morts 1870 05.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Lemborg's Infantryman ("Le Fantassin") stands between Henri Émile Allouard.s " "Le Fusilier colonial" and Louis-Auguste Baralis' "Le Marin"]]
This monument stands in [[Nantes]]'s Place Duchesse-Anne. Four sculptors worked on the monument, Georges Bareau, Charles-Auguste Lebourg, Henri Émile Allouard and Louis-Auguste Baralis. Lebourg's contribution was the statue of the infantryman. The monument was erected in 1897 and the inauguration ceremony in April of that year was attended by [[Félix Faure]], Jules Méline, Louis Barthou, Admiral Armand Besnard and Hippolyte-Étienne Étiennez the Nantes mayor. The bronze at the monument's summit, entitled '''"Pour le drapeau"''' was by Georges Bareau and had been cast in bronze by Barbedienne. It depicted a man slaying an eagle and at the monuments base were '''"le Fantassin"''' by Lebourg, '''"le Marin"''' by Louis Baralis, '''"l’Artilleur"''' by Émile Allouard and '''"Le Fusilier colonial"''' also by Allouard. In 1940 the occupying Germans dismantled the bronze believing that the slain eagle could be construed as representing the German eagle but the municipal workers of Nantes delegated to carry out the dismantlement managed to hide the sculpture, so stopping it being melted down. The work was retrieved in 1981, restored and re-erected in 1987.

'''''Masculinities without Men?''''' is a book by [[Bobby Noble (academic)|Jean Bobby Noble]].

==Summary==
Noble explores how the construction of [[gender]] was thrown into crisis during the twentieth-century, resulting in a permanent rupture in the sex/gender system, and how [[masculinity]] became an unstable category, altered across time, region, social class, and ethnicity. Noble demonstrates that [[transgender]] and [[transsexual]] masculinity began to emerge as a unique category in late twentieth-century fiction, distinct from [[lesbian]] or female masculinity.

==Reception==
''Masculinities without Men?'' has gotten some significant scholarly notice. However, reviews of the book have been mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Claudia|last=Breger|title=Feminine Masculinities: Scientific and Literary Representations of "Female Inversion" at the Turn of the Twentieth Century|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=14|number=1/2|date=Jan–Apr 2005|pages=76–106|publisher=University of Texas Press|jstor= 3704710|doi=10.1353/sex.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Donna|last=McCormack|title=Masculinities without Men?: Female Masculinity in Twentieth-Century: Fictions (review)|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=15|number=2 |year=2006|pages=333–338|doi=10.1353/sex.2007.0010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Madelyn|last=Detloff|title=Gender Please, Without the Gender Police: Rethinking Pain in Archetypal Narratives of Butch, Transgender, and FTM Masculinity|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies |volume=10|number=1-2|year=2006|pages= 87–105|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Online|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J155v10n01_05|doi=10.1300/J155v10n01_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sarah|last=Trimble|title=Playing Peter Pan: Conceptua izing "Bois" in Contemporary Queer Theory|journal=Canadian Woman Studies |volume=24|number=2-3|date= |pages=57–84 |publisher= |url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/cws/article/viewFile/6120/5308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ov Cristian|last=Norocel|title=Romania is a family and it needs a strict father: conceptual metaphors at work in radical right populist discourses|journal=Nationalities Papers: The Journal of Nationalism and Ethnicity |volume=38 |number=5|year=2010|pages= 705–721|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Online|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00905992.2010.498465|doi=10.1080/00905992.2010.498465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico’s capital is both the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities#America, Middle|oldest capital city in the Americas]] and one of two founded by Native Americans, the other being [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]].

The city of Mexico-[[Tenochtitlan]] was founded by the [[Mexica]] people in 1325. The old Mexica city that is now simply referred to as [[Tenochtitlan]] was built on an island in the center of the inland lake system of the [[Valley of Mexico]], which it shared with a smaller city-state called [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]].&lt;ref&gt;Frances F. Berdan, ''The Aztecs of Mexico: An Imperial Society'', New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston 1982, pp. 10–14.&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, the Mexicas' principal god, [[Huitzilopochtli]], indicated the site where they were to build their home by presenting a [[golden eagle]] perched on a [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] devouring a [[rattlesnake]].&lt;ref name="Frances F. Berdan 1982, p. 14"&gt;Frances F. Berdan, ''The Aztecs of Mexico: An Imperial Society'', New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states around Lake Texcoco and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the [[Aztec]] Empire had reached much of [[Mesoamerica]], touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Frances F. Berdan 1982, p. 14" /&gt;

=== Spanish conquest ===

[[File:El caballito de Tolsa b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain|El caballito de Tolsa]] representing [[Charles IV of Spain]]]]

After landing in [[Veracruz]], Spanish explorer [[Hernán Cortés]] advanced upon Tenochtitlan with the aid of many of the other native peoples,&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ciudadmexico.com.mx/historia.htm |title = Historia de la Ciudad de México |language = Spanish |accessdate = October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortés put Moctezuma under [[house arrest]], hoping to rule through him.&lt;ref name="pbs2"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_f00.html |title = Conquistadors – Cortés.

Tensions increased until, on the night of June 30, 1520 – during a struggle known as "[[La Noche Triste]]" – the Aztecs rose up against the Spanish intrusion and managed to capture or drive out the Europeans and their [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcalan]] allies.&lt;ref name="pbs4"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_g00.html |title = Conquistadors – Cortés.

The Aztecs thought the Spaniards were permanently gone, and they elected a new king, [[Cuitláhuac]], but he soon died; the next king was [[Cuauhtémoc]].&lt;ref name="pbs6"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_h00.html |title = Conquistadors – Cortés.

Cortés began a [[siege of Tenochtitlan]] in May 1521. For three months, the city suffered from the lack of food and water as well as the spread of [[smallpox]] brought by the Europeans.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico" /&gt; Cortés and his allies landed their forces in the south of the island and slowly fought their way through the city.&lt;ref name="pbs7"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_i00.html |title = Conquistadors – Cortés.

=== Rebuilding ===

[[File:Mexico City Zocalo Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] was built by the Spaniards over the ruins of the main Aztec temple]]

Cortés first settled in [[Coyoacán]], but decided to rebuild the Aztec site to erase all traces of the old order.&lt;ref name="Marroqui" /&gt; He did not establish a territory under his own [[Sovereignty|personal rule]], but remained loyal to the Spanish crown. The first Spanish [[viceroy]] arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. By that time, the city had again become a [[city-state]], having power that extended far beyond its borders.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Alvarez |first = Jose Rogelio |encyclopedia = Enciclopedia de Mexico |language = Spanish |title = Mexico, Ciudad de |year = 2000 |publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica |volume = 9 |pages = 5242–5260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Spanish preserved Tenochtitlan's basic layout, they built [[Catholic Church|Catholic churches]] over the old Aztec temples and claimed the imperial palaces for themselves.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000" /&gt; Tenochtitlan was renamed "Mexico" because the Spanish found the word easier to pronounce.&lt;ref name="Marroqui" /&gt;

=== Growth of colonial Mexico City ===
{{See also|List of oldest structures in Mexico City}}
The city had been the capital of the Aztec empire and in the colonial era, Mexico City became the capital of [[New Spain]]. The [[viceroy of Mexico]] or vice-king lived in the viceregal palace on the main square or [[Zócalo]]. The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]], the seat of the Archbishopric of New Spain, was constructed on another side of the Zócalo, as was the archbishop's palace, and across from it the building housing the City Council or ''ayuntamiento'' of the city.

A famous late seventeenth-century painting of the Zócalo by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]] depicts the main square, which had been the old Aztec ceremonial center. The existing central place of the Aztecs was effectively and permanently transformed to the ceremonial center and seat of power during the colonial period, and remains to this day in modern Mexico, the central place of the nation.

The rebuilding of the city after the siege of Tenochtitlan was accomplished by the abundant indigenous labor in the surrounding area. Franciscan friar [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]] who arrived in New Spain in 1524, described the rebuilding of the city as one of the afflictions or plagues of the early period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The seventh plague was the construction of the great City of Mexico, which, during the early years used more people than in the construction of Jerusalem. The crowds of laborers were so numerous that one could hardly move in the streets and causeways, although they are very wide. Many died from being crushed by beams, or falling from high places, or in tearing down old buildings for new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, ''Motolinia's History of the Indians of New Spain,'' translated and edited by Elizabeth Adnros Foster. Wesport: Greenwood Press, (1950) 1973, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Preconquest Tenochtitlan was built in the center of the inland lake system, with the city reachable by canoe and by wide causeways to the mainland. The causeways were rebuilt under Spanish rule with indigenous labor.

[[File:ViewTorreMayor04.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chapultepec Castle]] inside [[Chapultepec]] park]]
Colonial Spanish cities were constructed on a grid pattern, if no geographical obstacle prevented it. In Mexico City, the Zócalo (main square) was the central place from which the grid was then built outward. The Spanish lived in the area closest to the main square in what was known as the ''traza'', in orderly, well laid-out streets. Indian residences were outside that exclusive zone and houses were haphazardly located.&lt;ref&gt;Edmundo O'Gorman, ''Reflexiones sobre la distribución urbana coloinal de la ciudad de México'', Mexico 1938, pp. 16ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards sought to keep Indians separate from Spaniards but since the Zócalo was a center of commerce for Indians, they were a constant presence in the central area, so strict segregation was never enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Mörner and Charles Gibson, "Diego Muñoz Camargo and the Segregation Policy of the Spanish Crown," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'', vol. 42, pp. 558ff.&lt;/ref&gt; At intervals Zócalo was where major celebrations took place as well as executions. It was also the site of two major riots in the seventeenth century, one in 1624, the other in 1692.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', Pearson 2003, pp. 246–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the ''desagüe'', compelled thousands of Indians over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for Indian cultivation close to the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Noble David Cook, ''Born to Die: Disease and New World Conquest, 1492–1650.'' New York: Cambridge University Press 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|historic center]].&lt;ref name="EncMex2000" /&gt;
Economically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or [[Peru]], Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Concise History of Mexico. |last = Hamnett |first = Brian R. |year = 1998 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Port Chester, New York, USA |isbn = 978-0-521-58120-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[nobility]] flourished in New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas. Spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. Spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it. In the ensuing centuries, possession of a [[Mexican nobility|noble title in Mexico]] did not mean one exercised great political power, for one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not.&lt;ref name="Ladd"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Artes deMexico Palacios de la Nueva España The Mexican Nobility |last = Ladd |first = Doris M |year = 1998 |publisher = Artes de Mexico y del Mundo |location = Mexico City |isbn = 978-968-6533-61-3 |pages = 84–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family. Most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in New Spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. The craze to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Many of these palaces can still be seen today, leading to Mexico City's nickname of "The city of palaces" given by [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander Von Humboldt]].&lt;ref name="Marroqui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EncMex2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ladd" /&gt;

The [[Grito de Dolores]] ("Cry of Dolores"), also known as El Grito de la Independencia ("Cry of Independence"), marked the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. The Battle of Guanajuato, the first major engagement of the insurgency, occurred four days later. After a decade of war, Mexico's independence from Spain was effectively declared in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 27, 1821.&lt;ref name="Iturbide"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040411084151/http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm |dead-url = yes |archive-date = April 11, 2004 |title = Don Agustín de Iturbide |accessdate = October 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of Mexico.&lt;ref name="citydata"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Mexico-City-History.html |title = Mexico City History |accessdate = October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Federal District]] was established by the new government and by the signing of their new constitution, where the concept of a [[federal district]] was adapted from the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Countries of the World"&gt;{{Cite book |first = Thomas E. |last = Weil |title = Mexico: Chapter 3B. Evolution of a Nation |work = Countries of the World |publisher = Bureau Development, Inc. |date = January 1, 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this designation, Mexico City had served as the [[seat of government]] for both the [[State of Mexico]] and the nation as a whole. [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]] and then [[Toluca]] became the capital of the State of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Ashoka |last = Mody |title = Infrastructure Delivery |work = Countries of the World |publisher = World Bank Publications |date = October 31, 1996 |page = 187 |isbn = 978-0-8213-3520-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Battle of Mexico City in the U.S.–Mexican War of 1847 ===
The [[Battle for Mexico City]] was the series of engagements from September 8 to 15, 1847, in the general vicinity of Mexico City during the [[Mexican–American War|U.S. Mexican War]]. Included are major actions at the battles of [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]] and [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]], culminating with the fall of Mexico City. The U.S. Army under Winfield Scott scored a major success that ended the war. The American invasion into the Federal District was first resisted during the [[Battle of Churubusco]] on August 8 where the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]], which was composed primarily of Catholic Irish and German immigrants, but also Canadians, English, French, Italians, Poles, Scots, Spaniards, Swiss, and Mexican people, fought for the Mexican cause repelling the American attacks. After defeating the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]], the Mexican–American War came to a close after the United States [[Military deployment|deployed]] [[Military organization|combat units]] deep into [[Mexico]] resulting in the capture of Mexico City and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th [[Division (military)|Divisions]].&lt;ref name="Cerro"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/cerro_gordo.html |title = The Battle of Cerro Gordo |accessdate = October 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion culminated with the storming of [[Chapultepec Castle]] in the city itself.&lt;ref name="storming"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/chapultepec_pillows_attack.html |title = The Storming of Chapultepec (General Pillow's Attack) |accessdate = October 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this battle, on September 13, the 4th Division, under [[John A. Quitman]], spearheaded the attack against Chapultepec and carried the castle. Future [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] generals [[George E. Pickett]] and [[James Longstreet]] participated in the attack. Serving in the Mexican defense were the cadets later immortalized as ''[[Niños Héroes|Los Niños Héroes]]'' (the "Boy Heroes"). The Mexican forces fell back from Chapultepec and retreated within the city. Attacks on the Belén and San Cosme Gates came afterwards. The [[treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was signed in what is now the far north of the city.&lt;ref name="treaty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/wars_end_guadalupe.html |title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo |author=Richard Griswold del Castillo |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nE7IO7rN?url=http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/wars_end_guadalupe.html |archivedate=February 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porfirian era (1876–1911) ===

[[File:Hotel Ciudad de México - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|French-styled architecture in [[Benito Juárez, Mexico City]], whose architectural legacy remains in the neighborhoods  of [[Condesa]], [[Zona Rosa, Mexico City|Zona Rosa]], [[Historic Center of Mexico City|Centro Historico]] and [[San Miguel Chapultepec|Chapultepec.]]]]
[[File:Palacio Postal - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|right|The gilded central foyer of the Palacio Postal, now used as the primary post office of central Mexico City.]]
Events such as the [[Mexican–American War]], the [[French Intervention]] and the [[Reform War]] left the city relatively untouched and it continued to grow, especially during the rule of President [[Porfirio Díaz]]. During this time the city developed a modern infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation systems and communication systems. However the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest of the country languished in poverty.

Under the rule of Porfirio Díaz, Mexico City experienced a massive transformation. Díaz's goal was to create a city which could rival the great European cities. He and his government came to the conclusion that they would use Paris as a model, while still containing remnants of Amerindian and Hispanic elements. This style of Mexican-French fusion architecture became colloquially known as Porfirian Architecture. Porfirian architecture became very influenced by Paris' [[Haussmannization]].

During this era of Porfirian rule, the city underwent an extensive modernization. Many Spanish Colonial style buildings were destroyed, replaced by new much larger Porfirian institutions and many outlying rural zones were transformed into urban or industrialized districts with most having electrical, gas and sewage utilities by 1908. While the initial focus was on developing modern hospitals, schools, factories and massive public works, perhaps the most long-lasting effects of the Porfirian modernization were creation of the Colonia Roma area and the development of Reforma Avenue. Many of Mexico City's major attractions and landmarks were built during this era in this style.

Diaz's plans called for the entire city to eventually be modernized or rebuilt in the Porfirian/French style of the Colonia Roma; but the Mexican Revolution began soon afterward and the plans never came to fruition, with many projects being left half-completed. One of the best examples of this is the Monument to the Mexican Revolution. Originally the monument was to be the main dome of Diaz's new senate hall, but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall and its supporting pillars were completed, this was subsequently seen as a symbol by many Mexicans that the Porfirian era was over once and for all and as such, it was turned into a monument to victory over Diaz.

=== Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) ===
[[File:Porforio Diaz.jpg|thumb|right|[[Porfirio Diaz]], (second from right) commissioned many of the ornate European style buildings constructed from the 1890-1910 and hoped for Mexico City to eventually rival European cities like Paris in opulence.]]
The capital escaped the worst of the violence of the ten-year conflict of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The most significant episode of this period for the city was the February 1913 [[Decena trágica|la Decena Trágica]] ("The Ten Tragic Days"), when forces counter to the elected government of [[Francisco I. Madero]] staged a successful coup. The center of the city was subjected to artillery attacks from the army stronghold of the ''ciudadela'' or citadel, with significant civilian casualties and the undermining of confidence in the Madero government. [[Victoriano Huerta]], chief general of the [[Huerta's Federal Army|Federal Army]], saw a chance to take power, forcing Madero and Pino Suarez to sign resignations. The two were murdered later while on their way to [[Palacio de Lecumberri|Lecumberri prison]].&lt;ref name="redescolar"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm |title = La Decena Trágica, febrero de 1913 |language = Spanish |accessdate = October 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Huerta's ouster in July 1914 saw the entry of the armies of [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], but the city did not experience violence. Huerta had abandoned the capital and the conquering armies marched in. [[Venustiano Carranza]]'s [[Constitutionalist]] faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and Carranza took up residence in the presidential palace.

=== 20th century to present ===

[[File:San-Angel-Casa-Rivera-Kahlo.jpg|thumb|right|Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera house in [[San Angel|San Ángel]] designed by [[Juan O'Gorman]], an example of 20th Century Modernist Architecture in Mexico]]

The history of the rest of the 20th century to the present focuses on the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences. In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.&lt;ref name="larosa"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Atlas and Survey of Latin American History. |last = LaRosa |first = Michael J.(Editor) |year = 2005 |publisher = M. E. Sharpe, Inc. |location = Armonk, New York, USA |pages = 118–125 |isbn = 978-0-7656-1597-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century&lt;ref name="EncMex2000" /&gt; and then began to grow upwards in the 1950s, with the [[Torre Latinoamericana]] becoming the city's first skyscraper.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico" /&gt; The [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] brought about the construction of large sporting facilities.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000" /&gt;

In 1969 the [[Mexico City Metro|Metro system]] was inaugurated.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico" /&gt;
Explosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring State of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000" /&gt;

In 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge [[shanty town|shantytowns]] that extended for many miles.&lt;ref name="citydata" /&gt; This caused serious [[air pollution in Mexico City]] and [[water pollution]] problems, as well as [[groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence due to overextraction of groundwater]].&lt;ref name="water"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Mexico City's Water Supply: Improving the Outlook for Sustainability. |author = National Research Council Staff. |year = 1995 |publisher = National Academies Press |location = Washington, D.C., USA |page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation.

The autocratic government that ruled Mexico City since the Revolution was tolerated, mostly because of the continued economic expansion since World War II. This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately. Nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the [[Tlatelolco massacre|massacre of an unknown number of protesting students]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]].&lt;ref name="citydata" /&gt;

Three years later, a demonstration in the Maestros avenue, organized by former members of the 1968 student movement, was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called "Los Halcones", composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the U.S.

On Thursday, September 19, 1985, at 7:19&amp;nbsp;am [[Central Standard Time|CST]], Mexico City was struck by an [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|earthquake of magnitude 8.1]]&lt;ref name="Campus"&gt;{{Cite news |first = Yunnven |last = Campus |title = A 20 años del sismo del 85 |url = http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/terremoto/475688.html |publisher = Televisa |location = Mexico City |date = September 19, 2005 |accessdate = October 4, 2008 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080922025641/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/terremoto/475688.html |archivedate = September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]. Although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in Asia and other parts of Latin America,&lt;ref name="Moreno"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Moreno Murillo |first = Juan Manuel |year = 1995 |title = The 1985 Mexico Earthquake |periodical = Geofisica Coumbia |publisher = Universidad Nacional de Colombia |issue = 3 |pages = 5–19 |issn = 0121-2974 |url = http://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/esrj/article/view/31225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it proved to be a disaster politically for the [[One-party state|one-party]] government. The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well.&lt;ref name="haber"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Haber |first = Paul Lawrence |encyclopedia = Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico |title = Earthquake of 1985 |year = 1995 |publisher = Taylor &amp; Frances Ltd. |pages = 179–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the last straw may have been the controversial elections of 1988. That year, the presidency was set between the P.R.I.'s candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and a coalition of left-wing parties led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, son of the former president Lázaro Cárdenas. The counting system "fell" because coincidentally the light went out and suddenly, when it returned, the winning candidate was Salinas, even though Cárdenas had the upper hand.

As a result of the fraudulent election, Cárdenas became a member of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]]. Discontent over the election eventually led [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]] to become the first [[mayor|elected mayor]] of Mexico City in 1997. Cárdenas promised a more [[democracy|democratic government]], and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run for the presidency.

Mexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico, sometimes called the Basin of Mexico. This valley is located in the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.&lt;ref name="PorruaCuenca"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Diccionario Porrua de Historia, Biografia y Geografia de Mexico 6th ed. – Mexico, Cuenca de |year = 1995 |publisher = Editorial Porrua |location = Mexico City |language = Spanish |isbn = 978 968 452 907 6 |page = 2238 |volume = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?cscid=100 |title = Mexico City: Opportunities and Challenges for Sustainable Management of Urban Water Resources |date = December 2004 |accessdate = November 25, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207190625/http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?cscid=100 |archivedate = December 7, 2008 |deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a minimum altitude of {{convert|2,200|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over {{convert|5,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="natresearch"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Mexico City's Water Supply: Improving the Outlook for Sustainability. |author = National Research Council Staff |year = 1995 |publisher = National Academies Press |location = Washington, D.C., USA |isbn = 978-0-309-05245-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="PorruaCuenca" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natresearch" /&gt;

Mexico City primarily rests on what was [[Lake Texcoco]].&lt;ref name="PorruaCuenca" /&gt; Seismic activity is frequent here.&lt;ref name="yip"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Yip |first = Maricela |author2 = Madl, Pierre |title = Air Pollution in Mexico City |page = 16 |publisher = University of Salzburg, Austria |date = April 16, 2002 |url = http://biophysics.sbg.ac.at/mexico/air.htm |accessdate = November 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called ''[[groundwater-related subsidence]]''. Since the beginning of the 20th century the city has sunk as much as {{convert|9|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in some areas. This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the [[Wet season|rainy season]].&lt;ref name="natresearch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yip" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/17/world/americas/mexico-city-sinking.html?emc=edit_ta_20170217&amp;nl=top-stories&amp;nlid=73270920&amp;ref=headline&amp;_r=0 New York Times: "Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis" By Michael Kimmelman] February 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of [[Milpa Alta]], [[Tlalpan]] and [[Xochimilco]].&lt;ref name="yip" /&gt;

Mexico City has a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety (Cwb)|subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwb''), due to its tropical location but high elevation. The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of [[Iztapalapa]], [[Iztacalco]], [[Venustiano Carranza, D.F.|Venustiano Carranza]] and the east portion of [[Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.|Gustavo A. Madero]] are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of [[Tlalpan]] and [[Milpa Alta]], a mountainous region of [[pine]] and [[oak]] trees known as the range of [[Ajusco]].

The average annual temperature varies from {{convert|12|to|16|C|F}}, depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below {{convert|3|C|0}} or above {{convert|30|C|0}}.&lt;ref name=weatherspark&gt;{{cite web |title = Average Weather for Mexico City |url = http://weatherspark.com/averages/32574/Mexico-City-Distrito-Federal |publisher = Weather Spark |accessdate = October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was {{convert|−4.4|C}} on February 13, 1960, and the highest temperature on record was {{convert|33.9|C}} on May 9, 1998.&lt;ref name="Extreme temps"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/es/pronosticos/pronosticossubmenu/reporte-diario-del-observatorio-de-tacubaya |title = Reporte Diario del Observatorio de Tacubaya |publisher = Servicio Meteorológico Nacional |language = Spanish |accessdate = October 13, 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161014033451/http://smn.cna.gob.mx/es/pronosticos/pronosticossubmenu/reporte-diario-del-observatorio-de-tacubaya |archivedate = October 14, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail.

It does not snow in the city (only in nearby mountain tops), but in the past this was not the case. Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico used to have several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year —except 1880— recorded snowfalls&lt;ref name=Clima-CDMX/&gt;) mostly by [[lake-effect snow]], but the draining of [[Lake Texcoco]] and also [[global warming]] restricted the snowfalls after the snowstorm of February 11, 1907; following that year snow has only occurred on January 28, 1920, on March 5, 1940, and for the last time on January 12, 1967, coinciding with the operation of ''[[Lake Texcoco#Artificial drainage|Deep Drainage System]]'' that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.&lt;ref name=Clima-CDMX&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jáuregui Ostos |first=Ernesto |title=El clima de la Ciudad de México |year=2000 |publisher=Instituto de Geografía de la UNAM |isbn=968-856-819-8 |language= Spanish |location=México, D.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region of the [[Valley of Mexico]] receives [[Anticyclone|anti-cyclonic]] systems. The weak winds of these systems do not allow for the dispersion, outside the basin, of the [[air pollution|air pollutants]] which are produced by the 50,000 industries and 4 million vehicles operating in and around the metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sma.df.gob.mx/sma/download/archivos/proaire_2002-2010.pdf |title = Program to improve air quality in the Metropolitan zone of the valley of Mexico – 2002.

The area receives about {{convert|820|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from June through September/October with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year.&lt;ref name="natresearch" /&gt; The area has two main seasons. The rainy season runs from June to October when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea, the wettest month being July. The [[dry season]] runs from November to May, when the air is relatively drier, the driest month being December. This dry season is subdivided into a cold period and a warm period. The cold period spans from November to February, when polar [[air mass]]es push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry. The warm period extends from March to May when tropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain to form.&lt;ref name="lafragua"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Lafregua |first = J |author2 = Gutierrez, A, Aguilar E, Aparicio J, Mejia R, Santillan O, Suarez MA, Preciado M |title = Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico |version =  |publisher = Anuario IMTA |year = 2003 |url = http://www.imta.gob.mx/instituto/historial-proyectos/th/2003/HDR1-Balance.pdf |format = PDF |id =  |accessdate = December 1, 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230728/http://www.imta.gob.mx/instituto/historial-proyectos/th/2003/HDR1-Balance.pdf |archivedate = December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally much of the valley laid beneath the waters of [[Lake Texcoco]], a system of interconnected salt and freshwater lakes. The [[Aztec]]s built dikes to separate the [[Freshwater|fresh water]] used to raise crops in ''[[chinampa]]s'' and to prevent recurrent floods. These dikes were destroyed during the siege of Tenochtitlan, and during colonial times the Spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods. Only a small section of the original lake remains, located outside Mexico City, in the municipality of [[San Salvador Atenco|Atenco]], [[State of Mexico]].

Architects [[Teodoro González de León]] and [[Alberto Kalach]] along with a group of Mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists have developed the project plan for ''Recovering the City of Lakes''. If approved by the government the project will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the [[Valley of Mexico]], the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning.

{{Further|Air pollution in Mexico City}}

[[File:AerialViewMexicoCity.jpg|thumb|right|Air pollution over Mexico City]]

By the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 [[carbon monoxide]] pollution had dropped drastically, while levels of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] were nearly three times lower than in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/los-angeles-and-mexico-city-a-tale-of-two-cities-2152222|title=Los Angeles and Mexico City: A Tale of Two Cities|first=Julia|last=Cooke|date=February 27, 2008|website=laweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most [[ozone]]-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond [[WHO]]-defined safe limits.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/10/coming-up-for-air/ |title = Coming up for air |work = Harvard Gazette |accessdate = December 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and [[nitrogen oxide]]s.&lt;ref name=clean&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28391130/wid/18298287/page/2/ |title = Mexico City cleans up its reputation for smog |date = December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the ''[[Hoy No Circula|A day without a car]]'' program to two days of the week.&lt;ref name=clean /&gt; The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and [[diesel fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=clean /&gt; The introduction of [[Mexico City Metrobús|Metrobús]] [[bus rapid transit]] and the [[EcoBici (Mexico City)|Ecobici]] bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.&lt;ref name="harvard" /&gt;

The Acta Constitutiva de la Federación of January 31, 1824, and the Federal Constitution of October 4, 1824,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html |title = Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States (1824) |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120318225631/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html |archivedate = March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fixed the political and administrative organization of the [[Mexico|United Mexican States]] after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. In addition, Section XXVIII of Article 50 gave the new Congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located. This location would then be appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The two main candidates to become the capital were Mexico City and [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/publica/rev/boletin/cont/85/art/art13.htm Boletín Mexicano de Derecho Comparado] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410153948/http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/publica/rev/boletin/cont/85/art/art13.htm |date=April 10, 2014 }}. Juridicas.unam.mx. Retrieved on April 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in large part to the persuasion of representative [[Servando Teresa de Mier]], Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country's population and history, even though Querétaro was closer to the center geographically. The choice was official on November 18, 1824, and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 acres) centered on the [[Zócalo|Zocalo]]. This area was then separated from the [[State of Mexico]], forcing that state's government to move from the [[Palace of the Inquisition (Museum of Mexican Medicine)|Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine)]] in the city to [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]]. This area did not include the population centers of the towns of [[Coyoacán]], [[Xochimilco]], [[San Mateo Mexicaltzingo|Mexicaltzingo]] and [[Tlalpan]], all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name="EncMex2003"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Alvarez |first = Jose Rogelio |encyclopedia = Enciclopedia de Mexico |title = Distrito Federal |year = 2003 |publisher = Sabeco International Investment Corp. |volume = IV |language = Spanish |isbn = 978-1-56409-063-8 |pages = 2293–2314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854 president [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] enlarged the area of Mexico City almost eightfold from the original {{convert|220|to|1700|sqkm|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}, annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion. (The [[Mexican–American War]] had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of Mexico City were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current {{convert|1479|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} by adjusting the southern border with the state of [[Morelos]]. By that time, the total number of municipalities within Mexico City was twenty-two.

While Mexico City was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor, the municipalities within it were autonomous, and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century. In 1903, Porfirio Díaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the Federal District. Eventually, in December 1928, the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the Federal District. In place of the municipalities, the Federal District was divided into one "Central Department" and 13 ''delegaciones'' (boroughs) administered directly by the government of the Federal District. The Central Department was integrated by the former municipalities of Mexico City, Tacuba, Tacubaya and Mixcoac.

In 1941, the [[Pedro María de Anaya|General Anaya]] borough was merged to the Central Department, which was then renamed "Mexico City" (thus reviving the name, but not the autonomous municipality). From 1941 to 1970, the Federal District comprised twelve ''delegaciones'' and Mexico City. In 1970, Mexico City was split into four different ''delegaciones'': [[Cuauhtémoc]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]], [[Venustiano Carranza]] and [[Benito Juárez]], increasing the number of ''delegaciones'' to 16. Since then, the whole Federal District, whose ''delegaciones'' had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered ''de facto'' a synonym of Mexico City.&lt;ref name="df.gob.mx"&gt;[http://www.df.gob.mx/leyes/normatividad.html?materia=1&amp;apartado=15&amp;disp=140 Statute of Government of the Federal District] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313061806/http://www.df.gob.mx/leyes/normatividad.html?materia=1&amp;apartado=15&amp;disp=140 |date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of a ''de jure'' stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. In 1993, the situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the [[Constitution of Mexico]]; Mexico City and the Federal District were stated to be the same entity. The amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District.&lt;ref name="df.gob.mx" /&gt;

On January 29, 2016, Mexico City ceased to be the ''Federal District'' (Spanish: ''Distrito Federal'' or D.F.).&lt;ref name=FederalDistrictNowOfficially/&gt; The former "Distrito Federal" is now officially known as "Ciudad de México" (or "CDMX").&lt;ref name=FederalDistrictNowOfficially/&gt; Mexico City is now in transition to become the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state.&lt;ref name=FederalDistrictNowOfficially/&gt; Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.&lt;ref name="UN2"/&gt;

Mexico City, being the seat of the powers of the Union, belongs not to any particular state but to all of them. Therefore, the president, representing the federation, used to designate the head of government of the Federal District (today the head of the government of Mexico City), sometimes called outside Mexico as the "Mayor" of Mexico City. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the 1980s, the dramatic increase in population of the previous decades, the inherent political inconsistencies of the system, and dissatisfaction with the inadequate response of the federal government after the 1985 earthquake made residents begin to request political and administrative autonomy to manage their local affairs. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Some [[political party|political groups]] even proposed that the Federal District be converted into the 32nd state of the federation.

In response to the demands, Mexico City received a greater degree of autonomy, with the 1987 elaboration the first Statute of Government (''Estatuto de Gobierno'') and the creation of an Assembly of Representatives. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the 1990s, this autonomy was further expanded and since 1997, residents can directly elect the head of government of the Federal District and the representatives of a unicameral Legislative Assembly, which succeeded the previous assembly, by popular vote.

The first elected head of government was [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]]. He resigned in 1999 to run in the 2000 [[election|presidential elections]] and designated [[Rosario Robles]] to succeed him, who became the first woman, elected or otherwise, to govern Mexico City. In 2000, [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] was elected, and he resigned in 2005 to run in the 2006 presidential elections; [[Alejandro Encinas]] was designated by the Legislative Assembly to finish the term. In 2006, [[Marcelo Ebrard]] was elected to serve until 2012.

The city does not have a constitution, unlike the states of the Union, but it has a Statute of Government. As part of the recent changes in autonomy, the budget is administered locally; it is proposed by the head of government and approved by the Legislative Assembly. Nonetheless, it is the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]] that sets the ceiling to internal and external [[government debt|public debt]] issued by the city government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.finanzas.df.gob.mx/documentos/CodigoFinanciero_2007.pdf |title = Codigo Financiero Del Distrito Federal* |format = PDF |accessdate = April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 44th article of the Mexican Constitution, if the powers of the Union move to another city, Mexico City would become a new state, the "State of the Valley of Mexico", with the new limits set by the Congress of the Union.

=== Elections and government ===

In 2012, elections were held for the post of head of government and the representatives of the Legislative Assembly. Heads of government are elected for a six-year period without the possibility of re-election. Traditionally, the position has been considered as the second most important executive office in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, Brian (1999) ''A Concise History of Mexico'' [[Cambridge University Press]]; [[Cambridge]], UK, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Legislative Assembly of Mexico City]] is formed, as it is the case for state legislatures in Mexico, by both single-seat and proportional seats, making it a system of [[parallel voting]]. Mexico City is divided into 40 electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by the [[plurality voting system]], locally called "uninominal deputies". Mexico City, as a whole, is a single constituency for the parallel election of 26 representatives, elected by [[proportional representation]], with open-party lists, locally called "plurinominal deputies".

Even though [[proportionality (political maxim)|proportionality]] is supposed to prevent a party from being overrepresented, several restrictions apply in the assignation of the seats. No party can have more than 63% of all seats, both uninominal and plurinominal. In the 2006 elections, the PRD got the absolute majority in the direct uninominal elections, securing 34 of the 40 FPP seats. As such, the PRD was not assigned any plurinominal seat to comply with the law that prevents over-representation. The overall composition of the Legislative Assembly is:

The politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City since the second half of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country, whether with the support of the federal government, as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s, or by laws that were since approved by the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand [[abortion in Mexico]] beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/420927.html |title = Aprueba ALDF en lo general reforma sobre el aborto |publisher = [[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |date = April 24, 2007 |accessdate = April 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize [[same-sex marriage]].

For administrative purposes, the Federal District is divided into 16 "delegaciones", or boroughs. While they are not fully equivalent to municipalities, the boroughs have gained significant autonomy, and since 2000, their heads of government have been elected directly by [[plurality voting system|plurality]] (they had been appointed by the head of government of the Federal District). Since Mexico City is organized entirely as a Federal District, most of the [[Municipal services|city services]] are provided or organized by the Government of the Federal District, not by the boroughs themselves; in the [[constituent state]]s, such services would be provided by the municipalities. The boroughs of Mexico City with their 2010 populations are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&amp;c=1223 2010 census tables: INEGI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502025339/http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&amp;c=1223 |date=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;br /&gt;Select ''Municipales'' (Municipal), then ''Descargar'' (Download).&lt;/ref&gt;

The boroughs are composed by hundreds of ''[[Colonias of Mexico City|colonias]]'' or [[Neighbourhood|neighborhoods]], which have no jurisdictional autonomy or representation. The [[Historic center of Mexico City|Historic Center]], in the borough of [[Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City|Cuauhtémoc]], is the oldest part of the city (along with some other, formerly separate colonial towns such as [[Coyoacán]] and [[San Ángel]]), some of the buildings [[List of oldest structures in Mexico City|dating back to the 16th century]]. Other well-known central neighborhoods include [[Condesa]], known for its [[Art Deco]] architecture and its restaurant scene; [[Colonia Roma]], a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux arts]] neighborhood and artistic and culinary hot-spot, the [[Zona Rosa, Mexico City|Zona Rosa]], formerly the center of nightlife and restaurants, now reborn as the center of the [[LGBT in Mexico|LGBT]] and [[Koreans in Mexico|Korean-Mexican]] communities; and [[Tepito]] and [[La Lagunilla]], known for their local working-class foklore and large [[flea market]]s. [[Santa María la Ribera]] and [[Colonia San Rafael|San Rafael]] are the latest neighborhoods of magnificent [[Porfiriato]] architecture seeing the first signs of gentrification.

West of the [[Historic center of Mexico City|Historic Center]] (''Centro Histórico'') along [[Paseo de la Reforma]] are many of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods such as [[Polanco]], [[Lomas de Chapultepec]], [[Bosques de las Lomas]], [[Santa Fe, Mexico City|Santa Fe]], and (in the State of Mexico) [[Interlomas]], which are also the city's most important areas of class A office space, corporate headquarters, skyscrapers and shopping malls. Nevertheless, some areas of lower-income ''colonias'' are right next to rich neighborhoods, particularly in the case of Santa Fe.

The south of the city is home to some other high-income neighborhoods such as [[Colonia del Valle]] and [[Jardines del Pedregal]] and the formerly separate colonial towns of [[Coyoacán]], [[San Ángel]], and San Jerónimo. Along [[Avenida de los Insurgentes|Avenida Insurgentes]] from [[Paseo de la Reforma]], near the center, south past the [[World Trade Center Mexico City|World Trade Center]] and [[UNAM]] university towards the [[Periférico]] ring road, is another important corridor of corporate office space. The far-southern boroughs of [[Xochimilco]] and [[Tláhuac]] have a significant rural population, with [[Milpa Alta]] being entirely rural.

East of the center are mostly lower-income areas with some middle-class neighborhoods such as Jardín Balbuena. Urban sprawl continues further east for many miles into the State of Mexico, including [[Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl]], now increasingly middle-class, but once full of informal settlements. Such slums are still found on the eastern edges of the metropolitan area in the [[Valle de Chalco|Chalco]] area.

North of the Historic Center, [[Azcapotzalco]] and [[Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.|Gustavo A. Madero]] have important industrial centers and neighborhoods that range from established middle-class ''colonias'' such as Claveria and [[Lindavista]] to huge low-income housing areas that share hillsides with adjacent municipalities in the [[State of Mexico]]. In recent years, much of northern Mexico City's industry has moved to nearby municipalities in the [[State of Mexico]]. Northwest of Mexico City itself is [[Ciudad Satélite]], a vast middle to upper-middle-class residential and business area.

The [[Human Development Index]] report of 2005 &lt;ref name="DISTRITO FEDERAL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.mx/IMG/pdf/Distrito_Federal.pdf |title=Panorama de la entidad (Panorama of the entity) |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203130742/http://www.undp.org.mx/IMG/pdf/Distrito_Federal.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that there were three boroughs with a very high Human Development Index, 12 with a high HDI value (9 above .85) and one with a medium HDI value (almost high). [[Benito Juarez, D.F.|Benito Juárez]] borough had the highest HDI of the country (0.9510) followed by [[Miguel Hidalgo, D.F.|Miguel Hidalgo]] which came up fourth nationally with a HDI of (0.9189) and [[Coyoacán]] was fifth nationally, with a HDI of (0.9169). [[Cuajimalpa]] (15th), [[Cuauhtémoc (23rd), D.F.|Cuauhtémoc]] and [[Azcapotzalco]] (25th) also had very high values of respectively 0.8994, 0.8922, and 0.8915.

In contrast, the boroughs of [[Xochimilco]] (172nd), [[Tláhuac]] (177th), and [[Iztapalapa]] (183rd) presented the lowest HDI values of Mexico City with values of 0.8481, 0.8473, and 0.8464 respectively, which are still in the global high-HDI range. The only borough that did not have a high HDI was that of rural [[Milpa Alta]], which had a "medium" HDI of 0.7984, far below all of the other boroughs (627th nationally, the rest being in the top 200). Mexico City's HDI for the 2005 report was of 0.9012 (very high), and its 2010 value of 0.9225 (very high), or (by newer methodology) 0.8307, was Mexico's highest.

=== Metropolitan area ===
{{Main|Greater Mexico City}}
[[File:MX-DF-Crecimiento de la ciudad de México.png|thumb|right|Growth of Mexico city's area from 1900 to 2000]]

Greater Mexico City is formed by Mexico City, 60 municipalities from the [[State of Mexico]] and one from the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. [[Greater Mexico City]] is the [[list of metropolitan areas of Mexico|largest metropolitan area in Mexico]] and the area with the highest population density. {{As of|2009}}, 21,163,226 people live in this urban agglomeration, of which 8,841,916 live in Mexico City proper.&lt;ref name="ZMVM 2009" /&gt; In terms of population, the biggest municipalities that are part of Greater Mexico City (excluding Mexico City proper) are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/TabuladosBasicos/preliminares2010.aspx Censo de Población y Vivienda 2010 Resultados preliminares (choose drop down Mexico for state)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103004900/http://www.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/TabuladosBasicos/preliminares2010.aspx |date=November 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Atizapan de Zaragoza]] (pop. 489,775)
* [[Ixtapaluca]] (pop. 467,630)

The above municipalities are located in the state of Mexico but are part of the Greater Mexico City area. Approximately 75% (10 million) of the state of México's population live in municipalities that are part of Greater Mexico City's conurbation.

Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, and through a policy of decentralization in order to reduce the environmental pollutants of the growing conurbation, the annual rate of growth of the agglomeration has decreased, and it is lower than that of the other four largest metropolitan areas (namely [[Greater Guadalajara]], [[Greater Monterrey]], [[Greater Puebla]] and [[Greater Toluca]]) even though it is still positive.&lt;ref name=sintesis&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/proyectos/conteos/conteo2005/sintesis.pps Síntesis de Resultados del Conteo 2005] INEGI&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[net migration rate]] of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob62&amp;c=3883&amp;e=09 |title=Tasa de emigración, inmigración y migración neta de las entidades federativas |publisher=Inegi.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510155316/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob62&amp;c=3883&amp;e=09 |archivedate=May 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico. In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.

[[File:05022012Convenio ssp tlalpan mondragon pompa070.JPG|thumb|right|Officers of the [[Secretariat of Public Security]]]]

The Secretariat of Public Security of Mexico City (Secretaría de Seguridad Pública de la Ciudad de México – SSP) manages a combined force of over 90,000 officers in Mexico City. The SSP is charged with maintaining [[Public order crime|public order]] and safety in the heart of Mexico City. The historic district is also roamed by tourist police, aiming to orient and serve tourists. These horse-mounted agents dress in traditional uniforms.

The investigative Judicial Police of Mexico City (Policía Judicial de la Ciudad de México – PJCDMX) is organized under the Office of the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General]] of Mexico City (the Procuraduría General de Justicia de la Ciudad de México). The PGJCDMX maintains 16 precincts (delegaciones) with an estimated 3,500 judicial police, 1,100 investigating agents for prosecuting attorneys (agentes del ministerio público), and nearly 1,000 criminology experts or specialists (peritos).

Between 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher "since most people are reluctant to report crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Reuters |title=Police say Giuliani helps cut Mexico City crime |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/20040512-1639-crime-mexico.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040609044928/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/20040512-1639-crime-mexico.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 9, 2004 |publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=May 12, 2004 |accessdate=September 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under policies enacted by Mayor [[Marcelo Ebrard]] between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 [[security camera]]s around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/security-central-in-mexico-citys-makeover/article2084076 |title = Security central in Mexico City's makeover |work = The Globe and Mail |accessdate = May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sees punishment "related to the growing politicisation of security and crime issues and the resulting criminalisation of the people living at the margins of urban society, in particular those who work in the city’s informal economy."&lt;ref name=mueller/&gt;

== Health ==
[[File:Secretaría de Salud, México D.F., México, 2014-10-13, DD 12.JPG|thumb|right|[[Secretariat of Health (Mexico)|Secretariat of Health building]]]]
Mexico City is home to some of the best private hospitals in the country; Hospital Ángeles, Hospital ABC and Médica Sur to name a few. The national [[Publicly-funded health care|public healthcare]] institution for [[private sector|private-sector]] employees, [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]], has its largest facilities in Mexico City—including the National Medical Center and the [[La Raza]] Medical Center—and has an annual budget of over 6&amp;nbsp;billion pesos. The IMSS and other [[public health]] institutions, including the ISSSTE (Public Sector Employees' Social Security Institute) and the National Health Ministry (SSA) maintain large specialty facilities in the city. These include the National Institutes of Cardiology, Nutrition, Psychiatry, Oncology, Pediatrics, Rehabilitation, among others.

The [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a [[catalytic converter]], which reduces the emissions released. Trucks must use only [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG).
Also construction of an [[Mexico City Metro|underground rail system]] was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate [[traffic congestion]]. Today it has over {{convert|201|km|0|abbr=on}} of track and carries over 5 million people every day. Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during [[rush hour]]s the crush is so great, that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women.
Due to these initiatives and others, the air quality in Mexico City has begun to improve, with the air becoming cleaner since 1991, when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

== Economy ==

Mexico City is one of the most important economic hubs in [[Latin America]]. The city proper produces 15.8% of the country's [[gross domestic product]].&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=cuna14&amp;c=1669 |title=Producto interno bruto por entidad federativa.

Mexico City is the greatest contributor to the country's industrial GDP (15.8%) and also the greatest contributor to the country's GDP in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] (25.3%). Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.&lt;ref name="INEGI" /&gt; Mexico City has one of the world's fastest-growing economies and its GDP is set to double by 2020.&lt;ref name="furness"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Furness |first = Charlie |date = April 2008 |title = Boomtown |journal = Geographical |volume = 80 |issue = 4 |pages = 36–45 |id = 0016741X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Mexico City had a [[Human Development Index]] score of 0.915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2006/chapters/spanish/ |title = HDR 2006 &amp;#124; Spanish &amp;#124; Human Development Reports (HDR) &amp;#124; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |publisher = Hdr.undp.org |accessdate = April 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identical to that of [[international rankings of South Korea|South Korea]].

The top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean [[disposable and discretionary income|disposable income]] of {{US$|98,517|link=yes}} in 2007. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and [[luxury goods]].

The economic reforms of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). This led to decentralization&lt;ref name="furness" /&gt; and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the [[State of Mexico]], or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.

Historically, and since [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] times, the [[Valley of Mexico|Valley of Anahuac]] has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's [[Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City|Cuauhtémoc borough]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the ''elites'' began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of [[Mixcoac]] and [[San Ángel]] were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/census.html |title = The Hispanic Experience – Indigenous Identity in Mexico |publisher = Houstonculture.org |accessdate = April 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with an heritage other than Amerindian. However, the census had the particularity that, unlike racial/ethnic census in other countries, it was focused in the perception of [[cultural heritage]] rather than in a racial perception, leading to a good number of white people to identify with "Mixed heritage" due to cultural influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI |work=Academic investigation |publisher=university of the State of Mexico |year=2005 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |language=Spanish |page=196 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.

Up to the 1990s, the Federal District was the most populous [[Political divisions of Mexico|federal entity]] in Mexico, but since then its population has remained stable at around 8.7&amp;nbsp;million. The growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the Federal District to 59 municipalities of the [[State of Mexico]] and 1 in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].&lt;ref name="CONAPOzm2005"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090506013007/http://www.conapo.gob.mx/publicaciones/dzm2005/index.htm Consejo Nacional de Población, México; Delimitación de las zonas metropolitanas de México 2005].

Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the [[Greater Mexico City|Metropolitan Area of Mexico City]] is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,&lt;ref name="sintesis" /&gt; a phenomenon most likely attributable to the [[environmental policy]] of decentralization.

=== Nationality ===
On the other hand, Mexico City is also home to large communities of [[expatriate]]s and immigrants, most notably from the rest of North America ([[Americans|U.S.]] and [[Canadians|Canada]]), from South America (mainly from [[Argentine people|Argentina]] and [[Colombian people|Colombia]], but also from [[Brazilian people|Brazil]], [[Chilean people|Chile]], [[Uruguayan people|Uruguay]] and [[Venezuelan people|Venezuela]]), from Central America and the Caribbean (mainly from [[Cubans|Cuba]], [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[List of Salvadorans|El Salvador]], [[Haitian people|Haiti]] and [[Hondurans|Honduras]]); from Europe (mainly from [[Spanish people|Spain]], [[Germans|Germany]] and [[Swiss people|Switzerland]], but also from [[Czechs|Czech Republic]], [[Hungarian people|Hungary]], [[French people|France]], [[Italian people|Italy]], [[Irish people|Ireland]], [[Dutch people|the Netherlands]], [[Polish people|Poland]] and [[Romanians|Romania]]),&lt;ref name="extranjeros"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/151/15103202.pdf |title=Asociaciones de Inmigrantes Extranjeros en la Ciudad de México.

While no official figures have been reported, [[Census|population estimates]] of each of these communities are quite significant.

Mexico City is home to the largest population of [[Demographics of the United States|U.S. Americans]] living outside the United States. Current estimates are as high as 700,000 U.S. Americans living in Mexico City, while in 1999 the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs estimated over 440,000 Americans lived in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1 = Carl Franz |author2 = Lorena Havens |lastauthoramp = yes |url = http://www.peoplesguide.com/1pages/retire/work/bil-maste/%232americans.html |title = How Many Americans Live in Mexico? |publisher = Peoplesguide.com |accessdate = April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.overseasdigest.com/amcit_nu2.htm |title = Private American Citizens Residing Abroad |publisher = Overseasdigest.com |accessdate = April 17, 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100326040310/http://www.overseasdigest.com/amcit_nu2.htm |archivedate = March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
The majority (82%) of the residents in Mexico City are Roman Catholic, slightly lower than the 2010 census  national percentage of 87%, though it has been decreasing over the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/df/poblacion/diversidad.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=09 Volumen y porcentaje de la población de 5 y más años católica por entidad federativa, 2010] INEGI&lt;/ref&gt; Many other religions and philosophies are also practiced in the city: many different types of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups, different types of [[History of the Jews in Mexico|Jewish communities]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Islamic]] and other [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[philosophical]] groups. There are also growing{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} numbers of irreligious people, whether [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]].

===Tourism===
{{Wikivoyage}}
[[File:Turibus Ciudad de Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|The Turibus runs through many of the most important tourist attractions in the city.]]
Mexico City is a destination for many foreign tourists. Wikipedia's sister project [[Wikivoyage]] has useful information on tourism in Mexico City. The [[Historic center of Mexico City]] (''Centro Histórico'') and the "floating gardens" of [[Xochimilco]] in the southern borough have been declared [[World Heritage Site]]s by [[UNESCO]]. Famous landmarks in the Historic Center include the [[Zócalo|Plaza de la Constitución]] (Zócalo), the main central square with its epoch-contrasting Spanish-era [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] and [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]], ancient Aztec temple ruins [[Templo Mayor]] ("Major Temple") and modern structures, all within a few steps of one another. (The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables).

The most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden [[Angel of Independence]] on the wide, elegant avenue [[Paseo de la Reforma]], modeled by the order of the Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Mexico]] after the [[Champs-Élysées]] in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] (seat of government) with the [[Chapultepec Castle|Castle of Chapultepec]], the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]] and several [[corporate headquarters]] are located. Another important avenue is the [[Avenida de los Insurgentes]], which extends {{convert|28.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.

[[Chapultepec]] Park houses the [[Chapultepec Castle]], now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Museum of Anthropology]] (which houses the [[Aztec calendar stone|Aztec Calendar Stone]]). Another piece of architecture is the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Fine Arts Palace]], a white marble theatre/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below. Its construction began during the presidency of [[Porfirio Díaz]] and ended in 1934, after being interrupted by the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s. The [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas|Plaza of the Three Cultures]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] neighbourhood, and the shrine and [[Basilica]]s of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] are also important sites. There is a [[double-decker bus]], known as the "Turibus", that circles most of these sites, and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed.

In addition, the city has about 160 museums—the world's greatest single metropolitan concentration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.stay.com/mexico-city/museum/ |title = Museums in Mexico City |publisher = Stay.com |date = May 14, 2013 |accessdate = May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—over 100 [[art museum|art galleries]], and some 30 [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year. It has either the third or fourth-highest number of theatres in the world after New York, London and perhaps Toronto. Many areas (e.g. Palacio Nacional and the [[National Institute of Cardiology]]) have murals painted by [[Diego Rivera]]. He and his wife [[Frida Kahlo]] lived in [[Coyoacán]], where several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public. The house where [[Leon Trotsky]] was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán.

In addition, there are several restored ''haciendas'' that are now restaurants, such as the San Ángel Inn, the Hacienda de Tlalpan and the Hacienda de los Morales.

=== Art ===
{{Main|Mexican art}}
[[File:Bellas Artes 01.jpg|275px|thumb|right|[[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] is the prominent cultural center in the city]]

Having been capital of a vast pre-Hispanic empire, and also the capital of richest viceroyalty within the [[Spanish Empire]] (ruling over a vast territory in the Americas and [[Spanish West Indies]]), and, finally, the capital of the United Mexican States, Mexico City has a rich history of [[Mexican art|artistic expression]]. Since the mesoamerican pre-Classical period the inhabitants of the settlements around Lake Texcoco produced many works of art and complex craftsmanship, some of which are today displayed at the world-renowned [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Museum of Anthropology]] and the ''[[Templo Mayor]]'' museum. While many pieces of pottery and stone-engraving have survived, the great majority of the Amerindian iconography was destroyed during the [[Conquest of Mexico]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Much of the early colonial art stemmed from the codices (Aztec illustrated books), aiming to recover and preserve some Aztec and other Amerindian iconography and history. From then, artistic expressions in Mexico were mostly religious in theme. The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] still displays works by [[Juan de Rojas]], [[Juan Correa]] and an [[oil painting]] whose authorship has been attributed to [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]].{{citation needed|date =July 2017}} Secular works of art of this period include the [[equestrian statue|equestrian sculpture]] of [[Charles IV of Spain]], locally known as ''El Caballito'' ("The little horse"). This piece, in bronze, was the work of [[Manuel Tolsá]] and it has been placed at the [[Plaza Tolsá]], in front of the [[Palacio de Mineria]] ([[Mining Palace]]). Directly in front of this building is the beautiful [[Museo Nacional de Arte]] (Munal) (the National Museum of Art).

[[File:ReceptHallMUNAL.JPG|thumb|left|Receptions Hall at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]]]]
During the 19th century, an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos ([[San Carlos Art Academy]]), founded during colonial times, and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (the [[National School of Arts (UNAM)|National School of Arts]]) including painting, sculpture and graphic design, one of UNAM's [[art school]]s. Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ([[National Museum of San Carlos]]). One of the students, [[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]], is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century. [[Porfirio Díaz]]'s regime sponsored arts, especially those that followed the French school. Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished, e.g. those of [[José Guadalupe Posada]] and [[Manuel Manilla]]. The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt, Velázquez, Murillo, and Rubens.

After the [[Mexican Revolution]], an [[avant-garde]] [[art movement|artistic movement]] originated in Mexico City: [[mural]]ism. Many of the works of muralists [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]] are displayed in numerous buildings in the city, most notably at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]. [[Frida Kahlo]], wife of Rivera, with a strong nationalist expression, was also one of the most renowned of Mexican painters. Her house has become a museum that displays many of her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/en/the-blue-house/#back-top|title=The Blue House – Frida Kahlo Museum|website=www.museofridakahlo.org.mx|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former home of Rivera muse [[Dolores Olmedo]] houses the namesake museum. The facility is in Xochimilco borough in southern Mexico City and includes several buildings surrounded by sprawling manicured lawns. It houses a large collection of Rivera and Kahlo paintings and drawings, as well as living ''Xoloizcuintles'' ([[Mexican Hairless Dog]]). It also regularly hosts small but important temporary exhibits of classical and [[modern art]] (e.g. Venetian Masters and Contemporary New York artists).

During the 20th century, many artists immigrated to Mexico City from different regions of Mexico, such as [[Leopoldo Méndez]], an engraver from Veracruz, who supported the creation of the socialist Taller de la Gráfica Popular ([[Popular Graphics Workshop]]), designed to help [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] workers find a venue to express their art. Other painters came from abroad, such as [[Catalonia|Catalan]] painter [[Remedios Varo]] and other Spanish and Jewish exiles. It was in the second half of the 20th century that the artistic movement began to drift apart from the Revolutionary theme. [[José Luis Cuevas]] opted for a modernist style in contrast to the muralist movement associated with social politics.

[[File:Soumaya201808p2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Museo Soumaya]]]]

Mexico City has numerous museums dedicated to art, including Mexican colonial, modern and [[contemporary art]], and international art. The Museo Tamayo was opened in the mid-1980s to house the collection of international contemporary art donated by famed Mexican (born in the state of Oaxaca) painter [[Rufino Tamayo]]. The collection includes pieces by Picasso, Klee, Kandinsky, Warhol and many others, though most of the collection is stored while visiting exhibits are shown. The [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] ([[Museum of Modern Art]]) is a repository of Mexican artists from the 20th century, including Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros, Kahlo, [[Gerzso]], Carrington, Tamayo, among others, and also regularly hosts temporary exhibits of international modern art. In southern Mexico City, the Museo Carrillo Gil ([[Carrillo Gil Museum]]) showcases avant-garde artists, as does the University Museum/Contemporary Art (Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo – or MUAC), designed by famed Mexican architect [[Teodoro González de León]], inaugurated in late 2008.

The [[Museo Soumaya]], named after the wife of Mexican magnate [[Carlos Slim]], has the largest private collection of original [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] sculptures outside Paris.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also has a large collection of [[Dalí]] sculptures, and recently began showing pieces in its masters collection including [[El Greco]], [[Velázquez]], [[Picasso]] and [[Canaletto]]. The museum inaugurated a new futuristic-design facility in 2011 just north of Polanco, while maintaining a smaller facility in [[Plaza de Loreto]] in southern Mexico City. The [[Colección Júmex]] is a contemporary art museum located on the sprawling grounds of the [[Jumex]] juice company in the northern industrial suburb of [[San Cristóbal Ecatepec|Ecatepec]]. It is said to have the largest private contemporary art collection in [[Latin America]] and hosts pieces from its permanent collection as well as traveling exhibits by leading contemporary artists. The new [[Museo Júmex]] in [[Nuevo Polanco]] was slated to open in November 2013. The Museo de San Ildefonso, housed in the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City's historic downtown district is a 17th-century colonnaded palace housing an art museum that regularly hosts world-class exhibits of Mexican and international art. Recent exhibits have included those on [[David LaChapelle]], [[Antony Gormley]] and [[Ron Mueck]]. The National Museum of Art (Museo Nacional de Arte) is also located in a former palace in the historic center. It houses a large collection of pieces by all major Mexican artists of the last 400 years and also hosts visiting exhibits.

[[File:Hochob Campeche - Rekonstruktion des Tempels.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of the entrance to the Hochob temple in the [[National Museum of Anthropology]]]]

[[Jack Kerouac]], the noted American author, spent extended periods of time in the city, and wrote his masterpiece volume of poetry ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' here. Another American author, [[William S. Burroughs]], also lived in the [[Colonia Roma]] neighborhood of the city for some time. It was here that he accidentally shot his wife.

Most of Mexico City's more than 150 museums can be visited from Tuesday to Sunday from 10&amp;nbsp;am to 5&amp;nbsp;pm, although some of them have extended schedules, such as the Museum of Anthropology and History, which is open to 7&amp;nbsp;pm. In addition to this, entrance to most museums are free on Sunday. In some cases a modest fee may be charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/visita.html |title = Ciudad de México.- atractivos turísticos |publisher = Mexicocity.com.mx |accessdate = April 17, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225110752/http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/visita.html |archivedate = February 25, 2009 |deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major addition to the city's museum scene is the [[Museum of Remembrance and Tolerance]] (Museo de la Memoria y Tolerancia), inaugurated in early 2011. The brainchild of two young Mexican women as a Holocaust museum, the idea morphed into a unique museum dedicated to showcasing all major historical events of discrimination and genocide. Permanent exhibits include those on the Holocaust and other large-scale atrocities. It also houses temporary exhibits; one on [[Tibet]] was inaugurated by the [[Dalai Lama]] in September 2011.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

UNAM's main campus, also in the southern part of the city, is home to the Centro Cultural Universitario (the [[University Culture Center]]) (CCU). The CCU also houses the [[National Library of Mexico|National Library]], the interactive [[Universum, Museo de las Ciencias]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Dgdc-Unam |url = http://www.universum.unam.mx/ |title = Universum, Museo de las Ciencias |publisher = Universum.unam.mx |accessdate = April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Sala Nezahualcóyotl concert hall, several theatres and cinemas, and the new University Museum of Contemporary Art (MUAC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://difusion.cultural.unam.mx/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;catid=38&amp;Itemid=86 University Museum of Contemporary Art]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220023046/http://difusion.cultural.unam.mx/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;catid=38&amp;Itemid=86 |date=December 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of the National University's CCU cultural center was inaugurated in 2007 in the facilities of the former [[Foreign minister|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], known as Tlatelolco, in north-central Mexico City.

The [[José Vasconcelos Library]], a national library, is located on the grounds of the former [[Buenavista, Mexico State|Buenavista]] railroad station in the northern part of the city.

The ''[[Papalote children's museum]]'', which houses the world's largest dome screen, is located in the wooded park of [[Chapultepec]], near the ''[[Museo Tecnológico]]'', and ''[[La Feria de Chapultepec Mágico|La Feria]]'' [[amusement park]]. The theme park ''[[Six Flags México]]'' (the largest amusement park in Latin America) is located in the [[Ajusco]] neighborhood, in Tlalpan borough, southern Mexico City. During the winter, the main square of the [[Zócalo]] is transformed into a gigantic [[ice rink|ice skating rink]], which is said to be the largest in the world behind that of Moscow's [[Red Square]].

The Cineteca Nacional (the [[Mexican Film Library]]), near the Coyoacán suburb, shows a variety of films, and stages many film festivals, including the annual [[Muestra Internacional de Cine|International Showcase]], and many smaller ones ranging from Scandinavian and Uruguayan cinema, to Jewish and LGBT-themed films. [[Cinépolis]] and [[Cinemex]], the two biggest film [[chain store|business chains]], also have several film festivals throughout the year, with both national and international movies. Mexico City has a number of [[IMAX]] theatres, providing residents and visitors access to films ranging from documentaries to popular blockbusters on these especially large, dramatic screens.

=== Cuisine ===

Mexico City offers a variety of cuisines. Restaurants specializing in the regional cuisines of Mexico's 31 states are available in the city.
Also available are an array of international cuisines, including [[Canadian cuisine|Canadian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/mexico-food-truck-promoting-canadian-cuisine-1.1328422 Mexico food truck promoting Canadian cuisine]. [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]. Retrieved 29–07–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French cuisine|French]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Croatian cuisine|Croatian]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] (including many regional variations), [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[Lebanese cuisine|Lebanese]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] (again with regional variations), [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], and fellow [[Latin American cuisine]]s such as [[Argentine cuisine|Argentine]], [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazilian]], and [[Peruvian cuisine|Peruvian]].
[[Haute cuisine|Haute]], [[fusion cuisine|fusion]], [[Kashrut|kosher]], [[Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] and [[veganism|vegan]] cuisines are also available, as are restaurants solely based on the concepts of [[local food]] and [[slow Food]].

Mexico City is known for having some of the freshest fish and seafood in Mexico's interior. [[La Nueva Viga Market]] is the second largest seafood market in the world after the [[Tsukiji fish market]] in Japan.

The city also has several branches of renowned international restaurants and chefs. These include Paris' Au Pied de Cochon and [[Brasserie Lipp]], Philippe (by Philippe Chow); Nobu, Morimoto; Pámpano, owned by Mexican-raised opera legend [[Plácido Domingo]]. There are branches of the exclusive Japanese restaurant [[Suntory]], Rome's famed Alfredo, as well as New York steakhouses [[Morton's Restaurant Group|Morton's]] and [[The Palm (restaurant)|The Palm]], and Monte Carlo's BeefBar. Three of the most famous Lima-based [[Haute cuisine|Haute]] [[Peruvian cuisine|Peruvian]] restaurants, La Mar, Segundo Muelle and Astrid y Gastón have locations in Mexico City.

For the 2014 list of [[Restaurant (magazine) Top 50|World's 50 Best Restaurants]] as named by the British magazine ''[[Restaurant (magazine)|Restaurant]]'', Mexico City ranked with the Mexican avant-garde restaurant [[Pujol (restaurant)|Pujol]] (owned by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera) at 20th best. Also notable is the Basque-Mexican fusion restaurant [[Biko (restaurant)|Biko]] (run and co-owned by Bruno Oteiza and Mikel Alonso), which placed outside the list at 59th, but in previous years has ranked within the top 50.&lt;ref name="2014 awards"&gt;[[Restaurant (magazine)|Restaurant]], [http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners The World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards: 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's award-winning [[Mexican wine|wines]] are offered at many restaurants, and the city offers unique experiences for tasting the regional spirits, with broad selections of [[tequila]] and [[mezcal]].

At the other end of the scale are working class [[pulque]] bars known as ''pulquerías'', a challenge for tourists to locate and experience.

== Transportation ==
=== Public transportation ===
[[File:NM-02 STC.jpg|thumb|[[Mexico City Metro]]]]
Mexico City has many modes of public transportation, from the metro (subway) system, to suburban rail, light rail, regular buses, BRT (bus rapid transit), 'pesero' minibuses, and trolleybuses, to bike share.

==== Metro ====
{{Main|Mexico City Metro}}

Mexico City is served by the ''[[Mexico City Metro|Sistema de Transporte Colectivo]]'', a {{convert|225.9|km|0|abbr=on}} [[rapid transit|metro]] system, which is the largest in Latin America. The first portions were opened in 1969 and it has expanded to 12 lines with [[List of Mexico City metro stations|195 stations]]. The metro transports 4.4&amp;nbsp;million people every day. It is the 8th busiest metro system in the world, behind Tokyo (10.0&amp;nbsp;million), Beijing (9.3&amp;nbsp;million), Shanghai (7.8 million), Seoul (7.3 million), Moscow (6.7&amp;nbsp;million), Guangzhou (6.2&amp;nbsp;million), and New York City (4.9 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitp.org/sites/default/files/cck-focus-papers-files/UITP-Statistic%20Brief-Metro-A4-WEB_0.pdf|title=World Metro Figures: Statistics Brief|date=October 2015|publisher=UITP|page=2|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is heavily subsidized, and has some of the lowest fares in the world, each trip costing 5.00 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] (roughly 0.27 USD) from 05:00&amp;nbsp;am to midnight. Several stations display [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] artifacts and architecture that were discovered during the metro's construction. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} However, the metro covers less than half of the total urban area. The Metro stations are also differentiated by the use of icons and glyphs which were created for the illiterate, a unique system that has become iconic characteristic of Mexico City. Each icon was developed based on historical (characters, sites, pre-Hispanic motifs), linguistic, symbolic (glyphs) or geographic references. A complementary system of icons was used for the Metrobús (BRT) stops.

==== Suburban rail ====

A suburban rail system, the ''[[Ferrocarril Suburbano de la Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México|Tren Suburbano]]'' serves the metropolitan area, beyond the reach of the [[Mexico City Metro|metro]], currently with only one line serving to municipalities such as [[Tlalnepantla de Baz|Tlalnepantla]] and [[Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mexico State|Cuautitlán Izcalli]], but with future lines planned to serve e.g. [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Chalco]] and [[Los Reyes Acaquilpan|La Paz]].

==== Peseros ====
[[Pesero]]s are typically half-length passenger buses (known as ''microbús'') that sit 22 passengers and stand up to 28. {{As of|2007}}, the approximately 28,000 peseros carried up to 60 percent of the city's passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.setravi.df.gob.mx/vialidades/transporte_vialidad.html |publisher = SETRAVI |title = Official statistics on ground transport in Mexico City |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090815115257/http://www.setravi.df.gob.mx/vialidades/transporte_vialidad.html |archivedate = August 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bLs3H_IWr3wC&amp;pg=PA381 |page = 381 |title = The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry |author = Robert Cervero | authorlink=Robert Cervero}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Paratransit in America | last = Cervero |first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Cervero|date=1997|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In August 2016, Mayor Mancera announced that new pesero vehicle and concessions would be eliminated completely unless they were ecologically friendly vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/metropoli/cdmx/2016/06/8/no-habra-mas-microbuses-en-la-cdmx-mancera "No habrá más microbuses en la CDMX: Mancera" (Mancera states that there will not be any more microbuses in Mexico City), ''El Universal'', August 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2011 the city's Secretary of Mobility Héctor Serrano states that by the end of the current administration (2018) there would no longer by any peseros/microbuses circulating at all, and that new full-sized buses would take over the routes.&lt;ref name="excelsior-pesero"&gt;[http://www.excelsior.com.mx/comunidad/2016/10/10/1121631 "Al término del gobierno de Mancera ya no habrá microbuses: Semovi"] ("Semovi says that by the end of Mancera's term there will be no microbuses", ''Excelsior'', October 10, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mid-size buses ====
In 2014, the city launched so-called "Bus Rapid Service", with mid-sized [[Mercedes-Benz]] Boxer buses carrying 75-85 passengers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotores-rev.com/en-operacion-69-autobuses-mercedes-benz-boxer-60-mbo/|title=En operación 69 autobuses Mercedes-Benz REVISTA AUTO MOTORES INFORMA|date=September 9, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transporteinformativo.com/inician-operacion-85-autobuses-mercedes-benz-en-corredor-chapultepec-palmas/|title=Inician operación 85 autobuses Mercedes-Benz en Corredor Chapultepec-Palmas - transporteinformativo.com|website=transporteinformativo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; painted purple-on-white, replacing 'peseros' on certain groups of routes. Operation is a concession to the private firms (SAUSA, COTOBUSA, TREPSA) instead of to individual vehicle operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVL8EUfnWz0|title=Presentación del corredor Tacubaya- La Valenciana|first=|last=SAUSA RUTA 86|date=October 7, 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/df/corredor_a_valenciana-ruta_86-transporte_df_0_379762169.html|title=Cambios en ex Ruta 86 causan inconformidad entre choferes|first=Erica|last=Flores|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunicacion.cdmx.gob.mx/noticias/nota/encabeza-jefe-de-gobierno-inicio-de-operaciones-de-los-corredores-sevilla-defensa-y-toreo-buenavista-boletin|title=Encabeza Jefe de Gobierno inicio de operaciones de los Corredores Sevilla-Defensa y Toreo-Buenavista|website=Comunicacion.cdmx.gob.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/comunidad/2014/10/30/989766|title=Inauguran corredor de transporte Palmas-Chapultepec|date=October 30, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Full-sized buses ====
City agency M1, formerly Red de Transporte de Pasajeros (RTP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/metropoli/cdmx/2016/06/19/usuarios-de-m1-se-quejan-de-exceso-en-tiempos-de-espera|title=Usuarios de M1 se quejan de exceso en tiempos de espera|date=June 19, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; operates various networks of large buses including regular, Ecobús, [[Circuito Bicentenario]], Atenea, Express, school and night routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sm1.gob.mx/redderutas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409015423/http://www.sm1.gob.mx/redderutas.html |archivedate=April 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, more bus routes were added to replace pesero routes.&lt;ref name="excelsior-pesero"/&gt;

In 2016, the [[SVBUS]] express bus service was launched, with limited stops and utilizing the city's toll roads on the second-level of the [[Periférico]] ring road and [[Supervía Poniente]] and connecting [[Toreo Parque Central|Toreo]]/[[Metro Cuatro Caminos|Cuatro Caminos]] with [[Santa Fe, Mexico City|Santa Fe]], [[San Jerónimo Lídice]] and [[Santa María Tepepan|Tepepan]] near [[Xochimilco]] in the southeast.

Suburban buses also leave from the city's main intercity bus stations.

==== Bus rapid transit ====
[[File:Estación SetDominguez.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mexico City Metrobús|Metrobús]] rapid transit bus stop station at Indios Verdes]]
The city's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the '''[[Mexico City Metrobús|Metrobús]]''', began operation in June 2005, along [[Avenida de los Insurgentes|Avenida Insurgentes]]. More and more lines opened and as of mid-2017 there are 6 routes with a 7th planned along [[Paseo de la Reforma]] to connect [[Santa Fe, Mexico City|Santa Fe]] with the city center and points north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrobus.cdmx.gob.mx/portal-ciudadano/informacion-linea-7|title=refoma línea 7|first=|last=Metrobús|website=Metrobús}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each line opened, the 'pesero' minibuses were removed from each route, in order to reduce pollution and commute times. As of mid-2017, there were 568&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrobus.cdmx.gob.mx/dependencia/acerca-de/flota|title=Flota|first=|last=Metrobús|website=Metrobús}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metrobús buses. In late 2016 they transported an average of 1.1 million passengers daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.metrobus.cdmx.gob.mx/transparencia/documentos/art14/XIX/CD_4a_2016.pdf|title=Imforme Anual 2016|website=data.metrobus.cdmx.gob.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mexibús]]''' provides 3 bus rapid transit lines connecting [[Metro Ciudad Azteca]] and [[Metro Pantitlán]] with [[Cuautitlán]], [[Ecatepec]] and other suburban areas in the State of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmasivo.com.mx/|title=TRANSMASIVO|website=www.transmasivo.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trolleybus, light rail, streetcars ====

Electric transport other than the metro also exists, in the form of several [[Trolleybuses in Mexico City|Mexico City trolleybus]] routes and the [[Xochimilco Light Rail]] line, both of which are operated by [[Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos]]. The central area's last [[Tram|streetcar]] line (tramway, or ''[[:es:Tranvía|tranvía]]'') closed in 1979.

=== Roads and car transport ===
[[File:Vista de la Ciudad de México desde Periferico y Paseo de la Reforma.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Anillo Periférico]] and [[Paseo de la Reforma]] in [[Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico City|Miguel Hidalgo]]]]
In the late 1970s many arterial roads were redesigned as ''[[Eje vial|ejes viales]]''; high-volume one-way roads that cross, in theory, Mexico City proper from side to side. The ''eje vial'' network is based on a quasi-[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid, with the ''ejes'' themselves being called ''Eje 1 Poniente'', ''Eje Central'', and ''Eje 1 Oriente'', for example, for the north-south roads, and ''Eje 2 Sur'' and ''Eje 3 Norte'', for example, for east-west roads. Ring roads are the [[Circuito Interior]] (inner ring), [[Anillo Periférico]]; the [[Circuito Exterior Mexiquense]] ("State of Mexico outer loop") toll road skirting the northeastern and eastern edges of the metropolitan area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://diarioportal.com/2009/10/12/en-una-semana-abre-la-carretera-ecatepec-naucalpan/ |title = Archived copy |accessdate = September 21, 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220233650/http://diarioportal.com/2009/10/12/en-una-semana-abre-la-carretera-ecatepec-naucalpan/ |archivedate = December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Autopista Chamapa-La Venta|Chamapa-La Venta]] toll road skirting the northwestern edge, and the [[Arco Norte]] completely bypassing the metropolitan area in an arc from northwest ([[Atlacomulco]]) to north ([[Tula de Allende|Tula, Hidalgo]]) to east ([[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]). A second level (where tolls are charged) of the Periférico, colloquially called the ''segundo piso'' ("second floor"), was officially opened in 2012, with sections still being completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Abre Ebrard segundos pisos (Ebrard opens "second levels") |url = http://www.reforma.com/ciudad/articulo/681/1361468/ |work = ''Reforma'' (newspaper) |date = December 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Viaducto Miguel Alemán]] crosses the city east-west from Observatorio to the airport. In 2013 the [[Supervía Poniente]] opened, a toll road linking the new [[Santa Fe, Mexico City|Santa Fe]] business district with southwestern Mexico City.

There is an environmental program, called [[Hoy No Circula]] ("Today Does Not Run", or "One Day without a Car"), whereby vehicles that have not passed emissions testing are restricted from circulating on certain days according to the ending digit of their [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]]; this in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion. While in 2003, the program still restricted 40% of vehicles in the metropolitan area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Actualización Del Programa Hoy No Circula |trans-title=Update of the "Hoy No Circula" Program |url = http://www.sma.df.gob.mx/sma/download/archivos/actualizacion_phnc_dip.pdf |accessdate = September 21, 2013 |author = Gobierno Del Distrito Federal, Secretaría Del Medio Ambiente, Dirección General De Gestión Ambiental Del Aire, Dirección De Instrumentación De Políticas |page = 19 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130923095052/http://www.sma.df.gob.mx/sma/download/archivos/actualizacion_phnc_dip.pdf |archivedate = September 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the adoption of stricter emissions standards in 2001 and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.meca.org/galleries/files/Mexico06.pdf |title = Mexican Emission Standards based on Federal Tier I Light-duty Vehicles up to 6000 lbs.

==== Parking ====
{{Main|Parking in Mexico City}}
Street parking in urban neighborhoods is mostly controlled by the ''[[franelero]]s'' a.k.a. "''viene vienes''" (lit. "come on, come on"), who ask drivers for a fee to park. Double parking is common (with ''franeleros'' moving the cars as required), impeding on the available lanes for traffic to pass. In order to mitigate that and other problems and to raise revenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Miguel Hidalgo borough, Mexico City government, Autoridad del Espacio Público |url=http://movil.miguelhidalgo.gob.mx/uploads/presentacion_anzures.pdf |title=INSTALACIÓN Y OPERACIÓN DE PARQUÍMETROS COLONIA ANZURES |trans-title=Installation and operation of parking meters in Anzures |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022031636/https://movil.miguelhidalgo.gob.mx/uploads/presentacion_anzures.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 721 parking meters (as of October 2013), have been installed in the west-central neighborhoods [[Lomas de Chapultepec]], [[Condesa]], [[Colonia Roma|Roma]], [[Polanco]] and [[Anzures]], in operation from 8 AM to 8 PM on weekdays and charging a rate of 2 pesos per 15 minutes, with offenders' cars booted, costing about 500 pesos to remove. 30 percent of the monthly 16 million-peso (as of October 2013) income from the parking-meter system (named "ecoParq") is earmarked for neighborhood improvements. The granting of the license for all zones exclusively to a new company without experience in operating parking meters, Operadora de Estacionamientos Bicentenario, has generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad-metropoli/2013/impreso/parquimetros-negocio-de-una-sola-empresa-en-el-df-119441.html |newspaper = El Universal |date = October 21, 2013 |title = Parquímetros, negocio de una sola empresa en el DF |trans-title=Parking meters, business of a sole company in the DF |language = Spanish |author = Karla Casillas Bermúdez }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cycling ===
{{Main|EcoBici (Mexico City)}}
[[File:ECOBICI1.jpg|thumb|right|Bicycles available for rental in [[Zona Rosa, Mexico City|Zona Rosa]]]]

The local government continuously strives for a reduction of massive traffic congestion, and has increased incentives for making a [[bicycle-friendly]] city. This includes North America's second-largest [[bicycle sharing system]], [[EcoBici (Mexico City)|EcoBici]], launched in 2010, in which registered residents can get bicycles for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes with a pre-paid subscription of 300 pesos a year. There are, as of September 2013, 276 stations with 4,000 bicycles across an area stretching from the [[Historic center of Mexico City|Historic center]] to [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper = km0 |url = http://www.guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/kmcero/acciones-de-gobierno/nuevas-estaciones-de-ecobici |date = September 2013 |author = Jesús de León Torres |title = Nuevas estaciones de EcoBici |trans-title=New EcoBici stations |language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; within {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of one another and are fully automatic using a transponder based card. Bicycle-service users have access to several permanent [[Ciclovía]]s (dedicated bike paths/lanes/streets), including ones along [[Paseo de la Reforma]] and Avenida Chapultepec as well as one running {{convert|59|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]] to [[Fierro del Toro]], which is located south of [[Cumbres del Ajusco National Park]], near the [[Morelos]] state line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fimevic.df.gob.mx/ciclovia/cartel.htm |title = Untitled Document |work = df.gob.mx |accessdate = May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://transeunte.org/temas/ciclovia-reforma/ |title="Ciclovía Reforma", ''Transeunte'' |access-date=October 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021000458/http://transeunte.org/temas/ciclovia-reforma/ |archive-date=October 21, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's initiative is inspired by forward thinking examples, such as [[Denmark]]'s [[Copenhagenization (bicycling)|Copenhagenization]].

=== Intercity buses ===
The city has four major bus stations (North, South, Observatorio, TAPO), which comprise one of the world's largest transportation agglomerations, with bus service to many cities across the country and international connections. There are some intercity buses that leave directly from the [[Mexico City International Airport]].

=== Airports ===

[[File:AICM AIR T2.jpg|thumb|right|Terminal 2 of the Mexico City airport]]

Mexico City is served by [[Mexico City International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA Airport Code]]: MEX). This airport is Latin America's [[List of the busiest airports in Latin America|busiest]], with daily flights to United States and Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia. [[Aeroméxico]] ([[SkyTeam|Skyteam]]) is based at this airport, and provide codeshare agreements with non-Mexican airlines that span the entire globe. The airport is also a hub for [[Volaris]], [[Interjet]] and [[Aeromar]].

In 2016, the airport handled almost 42 million passengers, about 3.3 million more than the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.aicm.com.mx/categoria/estadisticas |title = Estadísticas del AICM |author = Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de México|publisher =  |accessdate = December 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This traffic exceeds the current capacity of the airport, which has historically centralized the majority of [[air traffic]] in the country. An alternate option is [[Lic. Adolfo López Mateos International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA Airport Code]]: TLC) in nearby [[Toluca]], [[State of Mexico]], although due to several airlines' decisions to terminate service to TLC, the airport has seen a passenger drop to just over 700,000 passengers in 2014 from over 2.1 million passengers just four years prior.

In the Mexico City airport, the government engaged in an extensive restructuring program that includes the addition of a new second terminal, which began operations in 2007, and the enlargement of four other airports (at the nearby cities of [[Toluca]], [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] and [[Cuernavaca]]) that, along with Mexico City's airport, comprise the ''Grupo Aeroportuario del Valle de México'', distributing traffic to different regions in Mexico. The city of [[Pachuca, Hidalgo|Pachuca]] will also provide additional expansion to central Mexico's airport network.

During his annual state-of-the-nation address on September 2, 2014, [[President of Mexico]] [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] unveiled plans for a new international airport to ease the city's notorious air traffic congestion, tentatively slated for a 2018 opening. The new airport, which would have six runways, will cost $9.15 billion and would be built on vacant federal land east of Mexico City International Airport. Goals are to eventually handle 120 million passengers a year, which would make it the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest airport in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Case |first1 = Brendan |last2 = Cattan |first2 = Nacha |last3 = Martin |first3 = Eric |title = Mexico Poised for New Capital Airport Due in 2018 |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-28/mexico-said-poised-for-new-capital-airport-due-in-2018.html |accessdate = September 3, 2014 |work = Bloomberg News |publisher = Bloomberg L.P. |date = August 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Gardner |first1 = Simon |last2 = Alper |first2 = Alexandra |title = UPDATE 2-New $9.15 bln airport for Mexico City to quadruple passenger capacity |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/02/mexico-airport-idUSL1N0R31OR20140902 |accessdate = September 3, 2014 |work = Reuters |date = September 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM), located in Mexico City, is the largest university on the continent, with more than 300,000 students from all backgrounds. Three [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]], several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's [[scientific method|scientific research]] and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centres. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World [[College and university rankings|University Ranking]] published by [[Times Higher Education]] (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/144076.html |title = Times Higher Education Supplement, 2006 |publisher = Eluniversal.com.mx |accessdate = April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as [[Ciudad Universitaria]], was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007.

The second largest higher-education institution is the [[National Polytechnic Institute]] (IPN), which includes among many other relevant centers the [[CINVESTAV|Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados]] (Cinvestav), where varied high-level scientific and technological research is done. Other major higher-education institutions in the city include the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University]] (UAM), the [[National School of Anthropology and History]] (ENAH), the [[Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México]] (ITAM), the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] (3 campuses), the [[Universidad Panamericana Sede México|Universidad Panamericana]] (UP), the [[Universidad La Salle]], the [[Universidad del Valle de México|Universidad del Valle de Mexico]] (UVM), the [[Anahuac Universities Network|Universidad Anáhuac]], [[Simon Bolivar University (Mexico)|Simon Bolivar University]] (USB), the [[Alliant International University]], the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]], [[El Colegio de México]] (Colmex), [[Escuela Libre de Derecho]] and the [[Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas|Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económica]], (CIDE).
In addition, the prestigious [[University of California]] maintains a campus known as "Casa de California" in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/casa/welcome.html |title = University of California Mexico City |publisher = Universityofcalifornia.edu |accessdate = April 17, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110613212934/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/casa/welcome.html |archive-date = June 13, 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universidad Tecnológica de México]] is also in Mexico City.

Unlike those of Mexican states' schools, curricula of Mexico City's [[public school (government funded)|public schools]] is managed by the federal [[Secretariat of Public Education|Secretary of Public Education]]. The whole funding is allocated by the government of Mexico City (in some specific cases, such as [[El Colegio de México]], funding comes from both the city's government and other public and private national and international entities). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The city's public high school system is the ''[[Instituto de Educación Media Superior de la Ciudad de México]]'' (IEMS-DF).

A special case is that of [[Colegio Nacional (Mexico)|El Colegio Nacional]], created during the district's governmental period of [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]] to have, in Mexico, an institution similar to the [[Collège de France|College of France]]. The select and privileged group of Mexican scientists and artists belonging to this institution—membership is for life—include, among many, [[Mario Lavista]], [[Ruy Pérez Tamayo]], [[José Emilio Pacheco]], [[Marcos Moshinsky]] (d.2009), [[Guillermo Soberón Acevedo]]. Members are obligated to publicly disclose their works through conferences and public events such as concerts and recitals.

Among its many public and private schools (K–13), the city offers [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]], [[Multilingualism|multi-lingual]] and [[international school]]s attended by Mexican and [[International student|foreign students]]. Best known are the [[Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt (Mexico City)|Colegio Alemán]] (German school with three main campuses), the [[Liceo Mexicano Japonés]] (Japanese), the Centro Cultural Coreano en México (Korean), the [[Lycée Franco-Mexicain]] (French), the [[ASF Mexico|American School]], The [[Westhill Institute]] (American School), the [[Edron Academy]] and the [[Greengates School]] (British).

== Shopping ==
Mexico City offers an immense and varied consumer retail market, ranging from basic foods to ultra high-end luxury goods. Consumers may buy in [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|fixed indoor markets]], [[tianguis|mobile markets (''tianguis'')]], from [[Street vendors in Mexico City|street vendors]], from downtown shops in a street dedicated to a certain type of good, in convenience stores and traditional neighborhood stores, in modern supermarkets, in warehouse and membership stores and the shopping centers that they anchor, in department stores, [[big-box store]]s and in modern shopping malls.

In addition, "[[tianguis]]" or mobile markets set up shop on streets in many neighborhoods, depending on day of week. Sundays see the largest number of these markets.

=== Traditional markets ===
{{See also|Traditional fixed markets in Mexico}}

The city's main source of fresh produce is the [[Central de Abasto]]. This in itself is a self-contained mini-city in [[Iztapalapa]] borough covering an area equivalent to several dozen city blocks. The wholesale market supplies most of the city's "mercados", supermarkets and restaurants, as well as people who come to buy the produce for themselves. Tons of fresh produce are trucked in from all over Mexico every day.

The principal fish market is known as [[La Nueva Viga Market|La Nueva Viga]], in the same complex as the Central de Abastos. The world-renowned market of [[Tepito]] occupies 25 blocks, and sells a variety of products.

A staple for consumers in the city is the omnipresent "mercado". Every major neighborhood in the city has its own borough-regulated market, often more than one. These are large well-established facilities offering most basic products, such as fresh produce and meat/poultry, dry goods, tortillerías, and many other services such as locksmiths, herbal medicine, hardware goods, sewing implements; and a multitude of stands offering freshly made, home-style cooking and drinks in the tradition of [[aguas frescas]] and [[atole]].

=== Street vendors ===
{{Main|Street vendors in Mexico City}}

Street vendors ply their trade from stalls in the ''tianguis'' as well as at non-officially controlled concentrations around metro stations and hospitals; at ''plazas comerciales'', where vendors of a certain "theme" (e.g. stationery) are housed; originally these were organized to accommodate vendors formerly selling on the street; or simply from improvised stalls on a city sidewalk.&lt;ref name=pena&gt;{{citation|url=http://utminers.utep.edu/spena2/HABITAT%20V23(3)%20INFORMAL%20MARKETS.pdf |title=Informal Markets: Street Vendors in Mexico City |author=Sergio Peña |publisher=Florida State University |year=1999 |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025356/https://utminers.utep.edu/spena2/HABITAT%20V23%283%29%20INFORMAL%20MARKETS.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, food and goods are sold from people walking with baskets, pushing carts, from bicycles or the backs of trucks, or simply from a tarp or cloth laid on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www3.diputados.gob.mx/camara/content/download/21212/105355/file/ITSDM001%20Comercio%20Ambulante.pdf |publisher = Cámara de Diputados (Mexico), Centro de Estudios Sociales y de Opinión Pública |title = Reporte Temático No. 2: Comercio Ambulante |date = June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the centre of the city informal street vendors are increasingly targeted by laws and prosecution.&lt;ref name=mueller/&gt; The weekly [[San Felipe de Jesús Tianguis]] is reported to be the largest in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maspormas.com/ciudad/tianguis-la-san-felipe-no-podras-recorrerlo-dia/|title=Tianguis de la San Felipe: no podrás recorrerlo en un día - Máspormás|date=January 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Downtown shopping ===
The [[Historic Center of Mexico City]] is widely known for specialized, often low-cost retailers. Certain blocks or streets are dedicated to shops selling a certain type of merchandise, with areas dedicated to over 40 categories such as home appliances, lamps and electricals, closets and bathrooms, housewares, wedding dresses, jukeboxes, printing, office furniture and safes, books, photography, jewelry, and opticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work = Km.cero |url = http://guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/sites/default/files/km40_0.pdf |date = November 2011 |title = Calles con vocación |page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main department stores are also represented downtown.

Traditional markets downtown include the [[La Merced Market]]; the [[Mercado Jamaica, Mexico City|Mercado de Jamaica]] specializes in fresh flowers, the [[Mercado de Sonora]] in the occult, and [[La Lagunilla]] in furniture.

Ethnic shopping areas are located in [[Chinatown, Mexico City|Chinatown]], downtown along Calle Dolores, but Mexico City's [[Koreatown]], or [[Pequeño Seúl]], is located in the [[Zona Rosa, Mexico City|Zona Rosa]].

=== Supermarkets and neighborhood stores ===

Large, modern chain supermarkets, [[hypermarkets]] and [[warehouse club]]s including [[Soriana]], [[Comercial Mexicana]], [[Chedraui]], [[Bodega Aurrerá]], [[Walmart]] and [[Costco]], are located across the city. Many anchor shopping centers that contain smaller shops, services, a [[food court]] and sometimes cinemas.

Small "mom-and-pop" corner stores ("abarroterías" or more colloquially as "changarros") abound in all neighborhoods, rich and poor. These are small shops offering basics such as soft drinks, packaged snacks, canned goods and dairy products. Thousands of [[C-stores]] or corner stores, such as [[OXXO|Oxxo]], [[7-Eleven]] and Extra are located throughout the city.

== Parks and recreation ==

[[File:Lago de Chapultepec desde el castillo - panoramio.jpg|250px|thumb|Lake at [[Chapultepec]] park]]
[[File:Alameda Central, Mexico City.jpg|250px|thumb|Sidewalk in [[Alameda Central]]]]
[[Chapultepec Park]], the city's most iconic public park, has history back to the Aztec emperors who used the area as a retreat. It is south of [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]] district, and houses the [[Chapultepec Zoo|city's zoo]], several ponds, seven museums including the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Museum of Anthropology]], and the oldest and most traditional amusement park, [[La Feria de Chapultepec Mágico]], with its vintage Montaña Rusa rollercoaster.

[[File:Estadio Azteca 07a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azteca Stadium]], the [[List of stadiums by capacity|12th largest]] stadium in the world]]

[[Association football]] is the country's most popular and most [[Broadcasting of sports events|televised franchised sport]]. Its important venues in Mexico City include the [[Azteca Stadium]], home to the [[Mexico national football team]] and giants [[Club América|América]], which can seat 91,653 fans, making it the biggest stadium in Latin America. The [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Ciudad Universitaria]] is home to the football club giants [[Club Universidad Nacional|Universidad Nacional]], with a [[seating capacity]] of over 52,000. The [[Estadio Azul]], which seats 33,042 fans, is near the [[World Trade Center Mexico City]] in the Nochebuena [[Colonia (Mexico)|neighborhood]], and is home to the giants [[Cruz Azul]]. The three teams are based in Mexico City and play in the [[Primera División de México|First Division]]; they are also part, with Guadalajara-based giants [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara]], of Mexico's traditional "Big Four" (though recent years have tended to erode the teams' leading status at least in standings).
The country hosted the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], and Azteca Stadium is the first stadium in World Cup history to host the final twice.

Mexico City is the first Latin American city to host the Olympic Games, having held the [[1968 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in 1968, winning bids against [[Buenos Aires]], [[Lyon]] and Detroit. The city hosted the 1955 and 1975 [[Pan American Games]], the last after Santiago and São Paulo withdrew.
The [[ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|ICF Flatwater Racing World Championships]] were hosted here in 1974 and 1994. [[Lucha libre]] is a Mexican style of wrestling, and is one of the more popular sports throughout the country. The main venues in the city are [[Arena México]] and [[Arena Coliseo]].

The [[Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez]] is the main venue for motorsport, and hosts the Formula 1 [[Mexican Grand Prix]] since its return to the sport in 2015, the event being held in the past from 1962 to 1970, and again from 1986 to 1992. From 1980 to 1981 and again from 2002 to 2007, the circuit hosted the [[Champ Car]] World Series [[Gran Premio de México]]. Beginning in 2005, the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]] ran the [[Corona México 200|Telcel-Motorola México 200]]. 2005 also marked the first running of the Mexico City 250 by the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand-Am]] [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]. Both races were removed from their series' schedules for 2009.

Baseball is another sport played professionally in the city. Mexico City is currently home of the [[Diablos Rojos del México|Mexico City Red Devils]] of the [[Mexican League (baseball)|Mexican League]], which is considered a Triple-A league by Major League Baseball. The Devils play their home games at the [[Fray Nano Stadium]], a temporary venue until their new ballpark is completed. Mexico City has some 10 Little Leagues for young baseball players.

In 2005, Mexico City became the first city to host an [[National Football League|NFL]] regular season game outside of the United States, at the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca Stadium]]. The crowd of 103,467 people attending this game was the largest ever for a regular season game in NFL history until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d812c91b4/article/nfl-regularseasonrecord-crowd-of-105121-sees-giantscowboys |title = NFL regular-season-record crowd of 105,121 sees Giants-Cowboys |date =  |website = NFL.com |agency = Associated Press |access-date = January 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has also hosted several [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] pre-season games and has hosted international basketball's [[FIBA Americas Championship]], along with north-of-the-border Major League Baseball exhibition games at [[Foro Sol]]. In 2017, NBA commissioner [[Adam Silver]] expressed interest in placing an [[NBA G League]] expansion team in Mexico City as early as 2018.

Other sports facilities in Mexico City are the [[Palacio de los Deportes]] indoor arena, [[Alberca Olímpica Francisco Márquez|Francisco Márquez Olympic Swimming Pool]], the [[Hipódromo de las Américas|Hipódromo de Las Américas]], the [[Agustin Melgar Olympic Velodrome]], and venues for equestrianism and horse racing, ice hockey, [[rugby football|rugby]], American-style football, baseball, and basketball.

== Media ==

Mexico City is Latin America's leading center for the television, music and film industries. It is also Mexico's most important for the printed media and [[publishing|book publishing]] industries. Dozens of daily newspapers are published, including ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'', ''[[Excélsior]]'', ''[[Reforma]]'' and ''[[La Jornada]]''.

== Nicknames ==
Mexico City was traditionally known as ''La Ciudad de los Palacios'' ("the City of the Palaces"), a nickname attributed to Baron [[Alexander von Humboldt]] when visiting the city in the 19th century, who, sending a letter back to Europe, said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe.

During [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador|Andrés López Obrador]]'s administration a political slogan was introduced: ''la Ciudad de la Esperanza'' ("The City of Hope"). This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname, but has faded since the new motto ''Capital en Movimiento'' ("Capital in Movement") was adopted by the administration headed by [[Marcelo Ebrard]], though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. Since 2013, to refer to the City particularly in relation to government campaigns, the abbreviation '''CDMX''' has been used (from Ciudad de México).

The city is colloquially known as ''Chilangolandia'' after the locals' nickname ''[[chilango]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;1994 Oxford Spanish-English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Chilango is used pejoratively by people living outside Mexico City to "connote a loud, arrogant, ill-mannered, loutish person".&lt;ref&gt;David Lida, ''First Stop in the New World: Mexico City, the Capital of the 21sr Century'', New York: Riverhead Books 2008, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; For their part those living in Mexico City designate insultingly those who live elsewhere as living in ''la provincia'' ("the provinces", the periphery) and many proudly embrace the term chilango.&lt;ref&gt;Lida, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Mexico City are more recently called ''defeños'' (deriving from the postal abbreviation of the Federal District in Spanish: D.F., which is read "De-Efe"). They are formally called ''capitalinos'' (in reference to the city being the capital of the country), but "[p]erhaps because capitalino is the more polite, specific, and correct word, it is almost never utilized".&lt;ref&gt;Lida, ibid. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mongolian Gender Equality Center''' '''(MGEC)''' is a non-government organization based in [[Ulaanbaatar]], [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaatw.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=535:mongolian-gender-equality-now-mgec&amp;catid=127:Asia&lt;/ref&gt;

The MGEC was established in 2002 to fight the growing crime of [[human trafficking]]. In Mongolia, human trafficking is primarily a gendered crime. Young women and girls are trafficked into brothels for illegal and often unpaid prostitution against their consent.

The center has provided support to hundreds of victims of trafficking from countries around the world. The MGEC has worked with authorities to improve legislation against the crime, runs prevention, awareness and advocacy programs and provides legal advocacy, shelter, counseling services and vocational training for repatriated victims of trafficking (VOTs).

Over the last 17 years the MGEC has expanded its work to secure equal rights for men and women in Mongolian society. The center fights discrimination against women because this discrimination lies at the root of gender-based crimes and violence. It has developed a range of educational materials and publications for social workers, teachers, students, police and other officials. Recently, the MGEC has been developing educational tools for parents and teachers on child safety to help prevent sexual abuse of children.

== Human trafficking in Mongolia ==

Human trafficking - the recruitment of individuals by deception or force for the purpose of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] arose in Mongolia during the 1990s. The transition of government from [[socialism]] to [[democracy]] resulted in rapid [[privatization]] of state-owned enterprises. As a result, many [[Mongolia]]ns, especially the young, have faced ongoing difficulties in finding employment making them vulnerable to traffickers offering attractive opportunities to work or study abroad. In addition, after the transition, Mongolians for the first time were able to freely travel in and out of their country.

For many years the majority of Mongolians were trafficked into nearby countries including [[The People's Republic of China]], [[Macau]], [[Malaysia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and The Republic of [[Korea]]. However, in recent years Mongolian trafficking victims have been found in a greater number of destinations, including the United Kingdom,  [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. Mongolians have been trafficked for a variety of purposes, including [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]], [[forced labour]], and arranged (false) marriage.

Anti-trafficking work in Mongolia has been spearheaded by NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2009/&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongolian Gender Equality Center was the first organisation fighting trafficking in Mongolia and continues to be the only organisation providing victim care and rehabilitation. Legislative changes have been made by government due to significant lobbying by NGOs. The law is now compliant with the Palermo Protocol, although government funding for implementation is not provided.

Victims of trafficking are most often girls and women; the most frequent purpose of trafficking is for sexual exploitation. Increasingly, traffickers are targeting poor families from rural areas and trafficking them internally into cities of Mongolia. The shame and stigma associated with sexual abuse often keeps the women silent about their experiences long after they have been identified and returned home.

== Goals ==

The goals of the MGEC are:
* To fight against [[human trafficking]]
* To lobby for improvements in the legal environment for victims of trafficking, gender-based violence and rape
* To lobby for improvements in the provision of [[social services]] to victims of trafficking, gender-based violence and rape
* To promote gender equality throughout all levels of society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoptrafficking.mn/eng/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426142222/http://stoptrafficking.mn/eng/ |archivedate=2010-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of work ==

=== Gender Equality ===

MGEC has developed and published a handbook on gender equality (in partnership with the ''National Pedagogical University'' and the ''Science and Technology University of Mongolia''). In addition, the organization runs educational programs from primary school to university, and is also currently a member of a lobby group that drafts laws on gender equality.

=== Victim protection ===
In 2007 MGEC initiated the “Direct Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking Program” with assistance from the [[International Organization for Migration]]. Since then the program has provided 679 VOTs with assistance from the MGEC including [[repatriation]], [[Physical rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] and [[Social integration|reintegration]] into the Mongolian community.[[Mongolian Gender Equality Center#cite note-5|&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Nearly one thousand victims of sexual violence have also been assisted. Between 2016-17, 63 victims of trafficking were identified and provided with complete reintegration assistance.

The program has assisted victims in the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;Mongolian Gender Equality Centre NGO General Information Publication. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repatriation''' of VOTs from abroad, co-operating with [[NGOs]], government police departments, and [[international organizations]]. Between 2007 and March 2010, 155 Mongolian trafficked nationals aged between 8 and 49 were successfully repatriated with the help of various government bodies.

'''Shelter''' for victims of trafficking and sexual violence in Ulaanbaatar, and Zamiin-Uud (on the border to China which is the most common overland route for international trafficking) with assistance from the Swiss Agency for Development and cooperation (SDC). The shelter supplies food, clothing and health checks, and training in various practical skills.

'''Legal assistance and advice'''. The MGEC provides legal aid to victims of trafficking at no cost to any client who wishes to pursue justice in the courts. The MGEC has provided legal assistance to over a hundred victims. In addition to VoTs, assistance has been given to women who wished to divorce from Korean nationals and victims of sexual abuse not related to trafficking. It remains challenging to convict perpetrators due to loop holes in the law, and the reticence of victims to prosecute. The stigma associated with sexual violence means victims typically do not want their family or public to know of the crimes committed against them, This leaves traffickers able to target additional victims without facing justice.

'''Vocational training''', providing VOTs with the skills to ensure financial independence to prevent recurrence of trafficking. Advice on job seeking and starting a small business is also provided.

'''Accommodation''' Provision of a fully furnished ger (Mongolian traditional housing) for victims who need ongoing accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoptrafficking.mn/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=102 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709074825/http://stoptrafficking.mn/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=102 |archivedate=2009-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trafficking prevention ===
MGEC’s trafficking prevention program aims to develop public understanding through training, research and the distribution of educational materials:

'''Research''': MGEC has conducted national reports into victim’s experiences, the identification of trafficking networks and public opinion.

'''Training''': training sessions to lawyers, police, and government departments on current issues surrounding human trafficking and the [[legal status]] of VOTs. Training occurs throughout Mongolia.

'''Publications''': The organization produces and distributes handbooks and educational materials.

'''Campaigns''': the organization has produced a documentary film based on victim testimonies for the purposes of instruction and training. Public awareness is further raised through newspaper articles and TV programs.

'''Hotline''' – +976 1903: Since November 2007, MGEC has provided a 24-hour trafficking hotline, this free line provides information and assistance as well as the contact details for international organisations that provide support to VOTS. The hotline provides direct information and counseling, receives information from third parties identifying potential trafficked persons, and provides advice for those who are going abroad for work and study.

'''Campaigns''': MGEC organizes general public awareness campaigns, and campaigns targeting at-risk groups based on the findings from MGEC surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Mongolian Gender Equality Centre NGO General Information Publication. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign marriage ===

Between 2000 and 2008 the number of marriages of Mongolian women to foreign nationals increased from 79 to 3,485, and 67.8% of these were to Korean nationals. In July 2008, MGEC, together with the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Mongolian Ministry of Social Welfare &amp; Labour, provided a one-day training program for Mongolian brides. The program focused on Korean culture, language and society, the legal regulations regarding marriage and divorce in Korea, and gave extensive advice on trafficking, [[domestic violence]] and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;''Pre-Departure Orientation Programme Report.'' E. Khishigbayar, MGEC Human Trafficking Project Coordinator.(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this intervention the number of Mongolian women who became trapped in false marriages with Korean nationals has become almost negligible.

=== Education ===
The MGEC has provided training in sexual violence and trafficking to police, judiciary, immigration officials. civil society organisations and government in an ongoing basis for over 15 years.

The MGEC is currently working to provide resources around reproductive and sexual rights to young girls and women in Mongolia. Mongolia a high rate of underage abortion and pregnancy. Lack of autonomy and understanding of sexual rights and health mean many Mongolian young women undertake unsafe sexual practices at a young age. There is also a high rate of sexual assault against children. Such events are often unreported because of the high stigmatization against victims of sexual abuse. Hospital records of assaults that led to injury indicate levels of such behaviour are not decreasing.

The MGEC is developing tools and resources to help young people understand safe touch and their rights for safety. They are also targeting parents to empower them to talk with their children about safety.

Education is being provided to journalists to improve the report of rape and sexual violence in the media. The goal is to move from victim blaming to acknowledgement that responsibility lies with the perpetrator of sexual assault and gender based violence. Lawyers are being provided with specialist training to improve their ability to work with and represent victims of sexual violence in court.

== Trafficking under Mongolian law ==

In 1996, amendments to the Criminal Code (1986) introduced the first provisions addressing trafficking-related offences in Mongolia. As a result, the first case of trafficking was successfully prosecuted, involving a Russian national trafficked two Mongolian girls, aged 18, and 19.

A revised criminal code including laws prohibiting trafficking came into effect in 2002, however articles remained vague and ill-defined. Under Article 113 ''(Sale and Purchase of Humans)'', the sale or purchase of human beings is punishable by a fine (51 to 250 times the minimum wage), obligatory labor for 300 to 500 hours, or by a prison sentence of up to 3 years.

The MGEC lobbied the government to implement laws and procedures to protect victims and witnesses from prosecution resulting from their testimony given against traffickers.

Continued campaigning by the MGEC has resulted in further improvements to Mongolian laws regarding human trafficking.

1.     Mongolia signed the [[Palermo Protocols|Palermo Protocol]] in May 2008

2.     In February 2008, Article 113 (Sale and Purchase of Humans) was revised;[[Mongolian Gender Equality Center#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

3.     In March 2008, the official Legal Interpretation of Article 113 (Sale and Purchase of Humans) of the Criminal Code of Mongolia was developed from the Supreme Court of Mongolia. This led to a significant improvement in the number of cases that resulted in prosecution.

'''Namgyal Institute of Tibetology''' is a [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] museum in [[Gangtok]], [[Sikkim]], [[India]].

The foundation stone of the Institute was laid by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] on 10 February 1957 and it was opened officially by the [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]] on 1 October 1958.

The institute employs researchers and one of its new research programs is a project which seeks to document the social history of Sikkim's approximated 60 monasteries and record this on a computer. Another project seeks to [[digitizing|digitize]] and document old and rare photographs of Sikkim for knowledge distribution.

Khempo Dhazar served as head of the Sheda, a [[Nyingma]] college attached to the Institute, for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/kailash/pdf/kailash_01_01_03.pdf|title=Five Nyingma Lamas in Sikkim|last=Silverstone|first=Marilyn|authorlink=Marilyn Silverstone |date=| website=| page=13| access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Streamline''' is a joint initiative of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in the [[United States]], started in 2005, that adopts a "zero-tolerance" approach to unauthorized border-crossing by engaging in criminal prosecution of those engaging in it.

After launching Streamline at one sector of the Texas/Mexico border sector in 2005, the number of criminal prosecutions for illegal border crossing and/or re-entry quadrupled from around 4,000 annually in the early 2000s to 16,000 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/donald-trump-immigration-policies-q-and-a/index.html |title=The remarkable history of the family separation crisis |website=[[cnn.com]] |date=18 June 2018 |&lt;/ref&gt; The program expanded to several other sectors during the first term of the Obama administration and total prosecutions for first time offenders tripled to 44,000 in 2010 and by 2013, that number doubled to a peak of 97,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/donald-trump-immigration-policies-q-and-a/index.html |title=The remarkable history of the family separation crisis |website=[[cnn.com]] |date=18 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==

Operation Streamline was created with the goal of combating drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, human smuggling, and repeat [[illegal immigration into the United States]].&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Operation_Streamline_Policy_Brief.pdf|title = Assembly-line justice: a review of Operation Streamline|last = Lydgate|first = Joanna|date = January 1, 2010|accessdate = August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ultimate goal is to achieve a 100% criminalization of unauthorized border-crossing.&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt;

== Program description ==

===Regions of operation ===

All states on the U.S.-Mexico border except California have implemented the program.&lt;ref name=mpi/&gt;&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref name=grassroots-gp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/uploads/Operation-Streamline-Green-Paper.pdf|title = Operation Streamline: Drowning Justice and Draining Dollars along the Rio Grande|accessdate = August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the program was operational in the following border sectors: [[Del Rio, Texas]], [[Yuma, Arizona]], [[Laredo, Texas]], [[Tucson, Arizona]], [[El Paso, Texas]], [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], [[McAllen, Texas]], and [[Brownsville, Texas]]. By December 2014, only the
Tucson, Del Rio, and Laredo sectors continued to participate in Streamline.  However, the border sectors that discontinued the Operation Streamline program still continue to prosecute misdemeanor 8 USC § 1325 – improper entry by alien cases.&lt;ref name="DHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2015/OIG_15-95_May15.pdf|title = Streamline: Measuring Its Effect on Illegal Border Crossing|accessdate = August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal prosecution of illegal entry and re-entry ===

Under Operation Streamline, those caught in the act of crossing the United States border without authorization may be rounded up and subject to criminal prosecution. This is in contrast to the historical policy of [[catch and release (U.S. immigration policy)|catch and release]] and even to the policy of deporting people through [[expedited removal]] or after formal removal proceedings. Under Operation Streamline, immigration violations are processed under the ''criminal'' justice system.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/us/split-second-justice-as-us-cracks-down-on-border-crossers.html?_r=1|title = Detainees Sentenced in Seconds in ‘Streamline’ Justice on Border|date = February 11, 2014|accessdate = August 17, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''|last = Santons|first = Fernanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalties that Operation Streamline carries for immigrants are as follows:&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;

* First-time offenders are prosecuted for misdemeanor illegal entry (8 U.S.C. Section 1325) that carries a six-month maximum sentence.
* Any migrant who has been deported in the past and attempts to re-enter without authorization can be charged with felony re-entry that carries a two-year sentence but can involve up to a 20-year maximum if the migrant has a criminal record.

About 99% of people prosecuted under Operation Streamline plead guilty.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', this is because those who plead guilty are likely to get substantially shorter prison terms than the theoretical maximum, whereas those who do not plead guilty are likely to get close to the maximum sentence.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/under-operation-streamline-fast-track-proceedings-for-illegal-immigrants/2014/02/10/87529d24-919d-11e3-97d3-f7da321f6f33_story.html|title = Under Operation Streamline, fast-track proceedings for illegal immigrants|last = Partlow|first = Joshua|date = February 10, 2014|accessdate = August 17, 2015|publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual cost of Operation Streamline in [[Arizona]] alone was estimated as $120 million for court proceedings and $50 million for detention and incarceration.&lt;ref name=nmd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nmd_fact_sheet_operation_streamline.pdf|title = Fact Sheet: Operation Streamline|date = March 1, 2012|accessdate = August 17, 2015|publisher = No More Deaths}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bundling and rapid processing of cases ===

Another distinguishing feature of Operation Streamline is that cases are not heard individually, but rather in large groups, with many people caught crossing the border together generally being processed in one case.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' report, a single court case in [[Tucson, Arizona]] can have up to 70 defendants, the upper limit being set by the physical capacity of the court. The time taken to decide the cases varies between 30 minutes (or 25 seconds per defendant) and 2 hours 35 minutes (or a little over 2 minutes per defendant).&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

=== Relationship with expedited removal ===

[[Expedited removal]] is a removal procedure where a person who has recently entered the United States without authorization and does not qualify for some particular exemptions may be removed without going through formal removal proceedings. A person who is sentenced through Operation Streamline may be subject to expedited removal after completing his or her prison term.&lt;ref name=oser&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1263&amp;context=blrlj|title = Prosecuting the Persecuted: How Operation Streamline and Expedited Removal Violate Article 31 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol|last = Puhl|first = Emily|publisher = Berkeley La Raza Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedited removal may apply not just to people caught by [[United States Border Patrol]] in the act of border-crossing but also people who have recently crossed a border and are living in the United States. Also, although expedited removal may be applied ''after'' criminal prosecution through Operation Streamline, it is itself an administrative procedure and does not involve the criminal justice system.

In terms of historical timeline, the rollout of Operation Streamline started at around the time that the rollout of expedited removal was being completed. Expedited removal was expanded to all border sectors by September 2005 and the entire border zone by March 2006, whereas Operation Streamline launched in December 2005.

=== Relationship with reinstatement of removal ===

[[Reinstatement of removal]] is a removal procedure where a person who had a previous order of removal and subsequently departed the United States, and then re-entered without authorization, may be removed by "reinstating" the previous order. Like expedited removal, it is an administrative procedure that does not involve the criminal justice system. Like expedited removal, it may be applied to a person making a repeat unauthorized entry after the person has gone through the Operation Streamline court process.

=== Relationship with credible fear ===

In principle, a person being subject to criminal prosecution via Operation Streamline should have the opportunity to request asylum and get scheduled for a [[credible fear]] interview. However, due to the rapid processing of these cases, many people do not get this opportunity, and may have to serve their prison term despite being eligible for asylum. After the prison term is completed and they are being processed for expedited removal, they are asked if they would like to request asylum and, if so, are scheduled for the credible fear interview.&lt;ref name=oser/&gt;

== History ==

=== Initial launch in Del Rio (December 2005) ===

An initial version of Operation Streamline was proposed by the [[United States Border Patrol]] for [[Del Rio, Texas]] in response to a significant increase in the number of apprehended non-Mexican migrants, from 10,000 in 2004 to 15,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name=grassroots&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/uploads/GRL_Sept2012_Report-final.pdf|title = Operation Streamline: Costs and Consequences|publisher = Grassroots Leadership|date = September 1, 2012|accessdate = August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas requested a change to the proposal: in order to avoid running afoul of equal protection, the courts would need to criminally prosecute all migrants, not just those from Mexico.&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt; Note that many other related programs, such as the [[expedited removal]] procedure, do treat people differently based on nationality: those from Mexico or Canada without a criminal record are not subject to expedited removal, whereas people from other countries may be subject to expedited removal despite the absence of a criminal record. However, the provisions of these programs do not run afoul of equal protection because they are not administered through the criminal justice system.

After approval from then [[Department of Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]], Operation Streamline became active starting December 2005:  all unauthorized border-crossers in the [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] area of the Del Rio sector would be prosecuted criminally for unlawful entry and re-entry.&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt;

=== Rollout to other border sectors ===
Operation Streamline was gradually rolled out in other parts of the United States border:&lt;ref name=mpi/&gt;&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt;

* [[Yuma, Arizona]] in December 2006
* [[Laredo, Texas]] in November 2007
* [[Tucson, Arizona]] in January 2008
* [[McAllen, Texas]] and [[Brownsville, Texas]] (the [[Rio Grande Valley]] sectors) in June 2008

By 2010, every US-Mexico border sector not in California had implemented Operation Streamline.&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt;

=== Legal challenge ===
In December, 2009, it was decided in United States v. Roblero-Solis that en masse judicial proceedings like those in Operation Streamline violated Rule 11 in the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]. Rule 11 states that the court must determine that a guilty plea is voluntarily made by addressing the defendant personally in court. The Roblero-Solis case determined that “personally” means that the judge must address the defendant in a person-to-person manner.&lt;ref name=Nazarian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nazarian|first1=E.|title=Crossing Over:  Assessing Operation Streamline and the Rights of Immigrant Criminal Defendants at the Border|journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review|date=2011|volume=44|pages=1399–1430|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/lla44&amp;collection=journals&amp;page=1399|archiveurl=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2761&amp;context=llr |archivedate=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protests ===

Starting February 2013, Operation Streamline has been protested by activists in [[Arizona]] and [[Texas]], the two main states where it is operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grassrootsleadership.org/OperationStreamline|title = Operation Streamline|publisher = Grassroots Leadership|accessdate = August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/operation-streamline-protest-tucson-arizona-texas_n_2724637.html|title = Operation Streamline, Immigration Enforcement Program, Protested In Arizona And Texas|last = Planas|first = Roque|date = February 22, 2013|accessdate = August 23, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nacla.org/blog/2015/07/26/civil-disobedience-against-operation-streamline|title = Civil Disobedience against Operation Streamline.

=== Senate Resolution by Jeff Flake and John McCain ===

United States Senators [[Jeff Flake]] and [[John McCain]] introduced a Senate Resolution in March 2015 in the [[114th United States Congress]] calling on the Obama administration to immediately remove any directives or policies that would bar the prosecutions of first-time border crossers under this program.&lt;ref name=flake/&gt; The resolution was co-sponsored by Senators [[Chuck Grassley]] and [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]].{{Update-inline|date=June 2018|reason=Did the Senate approve the resolution?}}

== Reception ==

=== Primary aspects of criticism ===

Operation Streamline has received significant criticism from groups concerned about immigrant rights, civil rights, due process, and human rights. Some of the chief angles of criticism have been:

* Operation Streamline inappropriately treats violation of immigration laws as a criminal matter rather than an administrative matter, making it inconsistent with the rest of the immigration system.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref name=nmd/&gt;
* Referring asylum seekers for criminal prosecution via Operation Streamline violates U.S. obligations under Article 31(1) of the [[Refugee Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/28/joint-letter-attorney-general-lynch-calling-end-illegal-entry/reentry-prosecutions#_edn3|title=Joint letter to the Attorney General Lynch calling for end to illegal entry/reentry prosecutions at the border|website=www.hrw.org|date=July 28, 2015|access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="puhl-p96-97"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Emily Puhl|url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1263&amp;context=blrlj|title=Prosecuting the Persecuted: How Operation Streamline and Expedited Removal Violate Article 31 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol|volume=25|number=3|journal=La Raza L.J.|page=87–109|date=2015|access-date=July 16, 2018}} Section ''IV. Article 31 on the status of refugees prohibits states from penalising refugees'', page 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The rapid processing of cases in Operation Streamline goes against the spirit of [[due process]]. In many cases, individuals who are United States citizens or permanent residents, have legitimate claims to asylum, or have other valid reasons to be legally present in the United States do not get an opportunity to present their case.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref name=nmd/&gt;
* This lack of due process has a high impact on those who have a legitimate claim to asylum but undergo expedited removal, as the subsequent barr from re-entering the U.S. for five years also bars them from requesting asylum if they re-enter.&lt;ref name="puhl-p96-97"/&gt;
* Operation Streamline uses a lot of taxpayer resources, many of which go into funding private prison firms, without making a clear contribution to solving the problem (of reducing unauthorized border-crossing) that it was intended to solve.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt;
* Operation Streamline uses significant resources of the Border Patrol, the federal prison system, and the courts, thereby leaving fewer resources to combat drug trafficking and border violence.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt;

=== Defenses of the program ===

The [[United States Border Patrol]] and other branches of the US government have defended the program as a key component of a deterrent strategy that they believe has reduced overall rates of unauthorized border-crossing.&lt;ref name=grassroots/&gt;&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; [[Mark Krikorian]] of the [[Center for Immigration Studies]], a think tank that advocates reduced levels of immigration to the United States (both legal and illegal), also defended the program's necessity and importance in comments to ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; Legislators [[Jeff Flake]] and [[John McCain]], who have proposed the continuation and expansion of the program, have defended its importance in maintaining the national security of the United States.&lt;ref name=flake/&gt;

=== The Judge Brack exception ===

Judge Robert Brack, who has presided over a large number of Operation Streamline court cases in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], has expressed dissatisfaction over the system of laws he is required to enforce with Operation Streamline.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2014/0831/Behind-the-gavel-of-America-s-busiest-judge|title =  Behind the gavel of America's busiest judge.

* [[Expedited removal]] is a fast-track removal process where somebody who is present in the United States without authorization and arrived legally may be deported without formal removal proceedings. It applies to people who are already in the United States in addition to those caught at a border or denied entry at a designated port of entry. However, it does not involve any ''criminal'' charges against the person being removed. Also, it is not applied to people from Mexico or Canada unless they have a criminal history.
* [[Reinstatement of removal]] is a fast-track removal process where somebody who re-entered after having left the United States after a past order of removal is removed again by "reinstating" the previous order. This too is a purely administrative procedure and does not involve criminal charges.
* [[Credible fear]]: Anybody who expresses a fear of persecution or torture, or requests asylum, at any stage of the removal process, may appear for a credible fear interview where the interviewing officer attempts to assess whether the person's fear is credible. If so, the person cannot be subject to expedited removal and must go through formal removal proceedings.
* [[Secure Border Initiative]]
* [[Catch and release (U.S. immigration policy)]], a protocol historically followed by immigration enforcement agencies in the United States  where people caught for being in unlawful immigration status are released while they wait for a hearing with an immigration judge. The policy was officially ended in 2006.
*[[Trump administration family separation policy]]

The '''Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies''', founded in 1997, is a [[Recognised Independent Centre]] of the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indialink-online.com/index.php?id=367&amp;PHPSESSID=68e319a7042e53fd20b133d072d1f7e4|title=Dispatches &amp; Reports - Dispatches &amp; Reports - August - September 2006|date=|publisher=Indialink Online|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is engaged in developing academic programmes of education, research and publishing in the field of [[Hindu studies]]. The Centre also aims to encourage the Hindu community in the academic study of their own traditions and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotcurry.com/archive/news/2006/ochs.htm|title=News.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'This development in the field of Hindu Studies at Oxford is very exciting. It is an important addition to Oxford's wealth of resources on India and Indian religious traditions. It fits in well with our goal to attract more Indian students to come and study at Oxford.

== Naming of the Centre ==

When founded, the OCHS was for a short time known as the Oxford Centre for Vaishnava and Hindu Studies (OCVHS). The Centre's lean towards [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] traditions was reflective of the fact that its Founding Director, [[Shaunaka Rishi Das]], is a Vaishnava priest. As the Centre grew, it pivoted to become more inclusive and broader in scope regarding Hindu Studies, a decision which resulted in the current name of the OCHS.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aktor|first=Mikael|date=2015|title=Asymmetrical Religious Commitments? Religious Practice, Identity, and Self-Presentation among Western Scholars of Hinduism and Buddhism|url=|journal=Numen|volume=62|pages=265–300|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre started out in a suburban house on Divinity Road with only three students and a small library of donated books. It has since moved into a larger office in Madgalen Street, Oxford, with space for student facilities, scholars' rooms, administrative space, and a full-fledged library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://iskconnews.org/oxford-centre-for-hindu-studies-campaigns-for-new-home,3635|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Campaigns for New Home|work=ISKCON News|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the OCHS, according to Mikael Aktor, has successfully evolved into "a respected and well-known academic institution that hosts research within a broad spectrum of themes related to the study of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Educational programmes==
Most students of the OCHS are members of Oxford colleges and are studying for Oxford degrees from undergraduate to doctoral levels. Students are reading for degrees in the faculties of Theology and Religion, Oriental Studies, History and Anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectLevel/q593_01_textonly.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234019/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectLevel/q593_01_textonly.htm|date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the Centre has been inviting scholars to deliver lectures and tutorials at Oxford University.

One of the Centre's longest-standing exchange programs is with [[Aarhus University]], active nearly every term since October 2014. Dr Bjarne Wernicke-Olsen, an OCHS Fellow, established the [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] with the Aarhus University Department for the Study of Religion that enabled the exchange. Danish visiting students are hosted at the Centre for one or more terms as they further their Sanskrit studies. The Centre has also at times hosted large groups of visiting Aarhus students and served as their meeting place for lectures and readings. In Spring 2016, on one such visit, a group of students came to the OCHS for a two-day seminar on the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika|Haṭhayogapradīpikā]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Continuing Education Department===
Since 2003, the OCHS Continuing Education Department (CED) has facilitated access to Hindu Studies for adults in the UK - at various locations, and online for a more international audience, making a scholarly approach to the subject available to as wide an audience as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandir.org/news&amp;events/2008/11/OHC/index.htm|title=News &amp; Events – 'Understanding Hindu Identity' – Oxford Hinduism Course for BAPS Volunteers|date=2008-10-11|publisher=Mandir.org|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current research projects ===

==== Bengali Vaishnavism in the Modern Period ====
Project Director: [[Ferdinando Sardella]], Lucian Wong

This project undertakes an interdisciplinary survey of modern Bengali Vaishnavism from the mid-18th century to the mid-20th century. Part of this work involves the mapping, collection, and translation of relevant literature from this period. The six main areas of research in regards to Bengali Vaishnavism are: 1) theology and philosophy, 2) history, 3) transnational currents and the development of modern institutions, 4) case studies and biography, 5) human rights, gender, family, and caste, and 6) theoretical and methodological issues. The project was launched with a workshop at Worcester College (2015) on which a volume was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/bengali-vaishnavism-modern-period|title=Bengali Vaishnavism in the Modern Period|date=2012-03-23|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavata Purana Project ====
Project Directors: [[Radhika Ramana Dasa|Ravi M. Gupta]], [[Kenneth Valpey|Kenneth R. Valpey]]

This research project assesses the [[Bhagavata Purana]] together with its context and consolidates past scholarship on the text. It has been remarkably productive so far. Its first phase saw the publication of a volume of research articles entitled 'Bhagavata: The Bhāgavata Purāṇa: Sacred Text and Living Tradition' (2013) as well as the publication of an annotated and abridged translation of the Bhagavata Purana (2016), both by [[Columbia University Press]]. Phase two of the project was marked by a large international conference in Chennai with the University of Madras that brought together the network of scholars in the field. The [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|BORI]] in its partnership with the OCHS has compiled a database of Bhagavata Purana manuscripts and secondary literature and is assessing a critical edition of the text.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Annual Report 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/bhagavata-purana-research-project|title=Bhagavata Purana Research Project|date=2012-03-23|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/bori-ties-up-with-oxford-centre-for-review-of-bhagvata-purana-edition/|title=BORI ties up with Oxford Centre for review of Bhagvata Purana edition|date=2016-03-12|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shakta Traditions Project ====
Project Directors: Bjarne Wernicke-Olesen, Gavin Flood

The [[Shaktism|Shakta]] Traditions project takes an interdisciplinary approach to investigating Goddess (Devi) worship among the Brahmanical community, in Tantric practices, and at the village level. The project aims to carve out space for the tradition within the Indian religious context by defining its theology, textual lineage, historical evolution, and its relationship to parallel traditions such as [[Shaivism]]. It has produced several international conferences and symposia, such as the international Shakta Traditions conference (2011), as well as numerous conference volumes published by the Oxford University Press and Routledge. In 2018, Bjarne Oleson established a study and research centre for the project in Kathmandu with a focus on manuscript collection and preservation and fieldwork.&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2017–18|last=|first=|date=June 2018|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shakta Traditions project resulted from the Memorandum of Understanding between the OCHS and Aarhus University and is run as a collaboration between the two institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/projects-2/|title=Projects - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/sakta-traditions|title=The Sakta Traditions|date=2012-06-12|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Goswami Project ====

Project Managers: Kiyokazu Okita, Rembert Lutjeharms

This project investigates the formative period of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] through research into the Sanskrit writings of the [[Six Goswamis of Vrindavana|Goswamis]], a group of early followers of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Krishna Chaitanya]] whose works provided the theological underpinning of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. The core of the project involves preparing critical editions and translations of important Goswami texts. Other branches of the project involve study of early Gaudiya Vaishnavism's relation to contemporaneous Vaishnava schools, the theology of authors who inspired the Goswamis, how the Goswamis' teachings were developed by later Vaishnavas, and the material culture of the early Gaudiyas. The project was launched with a two-day workshop entitled 'The Building of Vrindavana' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/research/gosvami-era|title=The Gosvāmī Era: The Founding of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism in Early Modern South Asia|date=2013-04-04|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===
The OCHS has hosted a number of conferences and symposia characterised by their interdisciplinary approach. These gatherings have dealt with a wide range of topics including, the idea of Desire, Women in Hinduism, Philosophy, Archaeology, temple art and architecture, and Shakta Traditions.

The Shivdasani conferences synthesized the work being done in various projects. The first Shivdasani Conference (2007) was held in Trinity College and was titled ''Archaeology and Text: The Temple in South Asia –'' it helped launch the Centre's Archeology and Text Project. The proceedings of this conference were published by Oxford University Press, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Editor, Himanshu Prabha Ray, Archaeology and Text: The Temple in South Asia, Oxford University Press, India 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second Shivdasani Conference (2009) – ''Thinking Inside the Box: The Concept of a Category in Indian Philosophy''– took place at Somerville College. It explored linguistic, aesthetic, and ontological categories as they appear in Indian schools of philosophy, simultaneously bringing these ideas into dialogue with Western methods and launching the Categories in Indian Philosophy research project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/conference-2009.pdf|title=Shivdasani Conference 2009 - Thinking Inside the Box: The Concept of a Category in Indian Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCHS has held several conferences and symposia to help launch and progress the Shakta Traditions project. It held the first international Shakta Traditions conference (2011) with approximately fifty participants and twelve specialist scholars. The conference took an interdisciplinary survey of Shakta history, practice, and doctrine with the aim of exploring the tradition's uniqueness in the context of the Indian religious landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/first-international-sakta-traditions-conference/|title=First International Śākta Traditions Conference 2011 - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also held symposiums on Shakta Traditions in 2017 and in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/sakta-traditions-symposium/|title=Śākta Traditions Symposium - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://saktatraditions.org/sakta-traditions-symposium-ii/|title=Śākta Traditions Symposium II - Śākta Traditions|work=Śākta Traditions|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to further develop the Bhagavata Purana Project, the OCHS held a conference in Chennai co-hosted by the University of Madras and [[The C.

As discussed in the book, they take interest in the task of translating a conventionally Christian notion of Chaplaincy into Hindu terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hindu Chaplaincy: The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Guide|last=Chander|first=Vineet|last2=Sutton|first2=Nicholas|last3=Shaunaka Rishi Das|publisher=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|year=2017|isbn=1999764404|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Bhumi Project ====
The Bhumi Project is one of the OCHS's key outreach programs and aims to mobilize Hindus against climate change globally. It was launched by the OCHS in partnership with the [[Alliance of Religions and Conservation]] in 2009 and with input from the four largest Hindu temples in the UK. Its inauguration was held at Windsor Castle in the presence of Prince Philip and Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations. The project encourages Hindu communities to develop plans to transform their environmental practices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/bhumi_overview.pdf|title=The Bhumi Project|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhumi Project uniquely dialogues with these groups by making a case for environmentalism grounded in Hindu scripture, an approach exemplified in its published petition, the "Hindu Declaration on Climate Change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/murali-balaji/a-hindu-call-to-action-in_b_8631290.html|title=A Hindu Call to Action in Fighting Climate Change|last=Balaji|first=Murali|date=2015-11-23|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhumi Project then works with them by providing them with resources and the chance to take on over twenty projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Centre helped launch the Bhumi Pledge in 2015, in which it invited students worldwide to make a pledge to care for the environment and organize an environmental awareness event on their campus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Bhumi Project has also facilitated Hindu Environment Week for several years, in which events to raise awareness of environmental issues are held across the world (India, UK, US) - there were over 10,000 global participants in 2015.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Members of the Bhumi Project have participated in panels, conferences (such as the annual [[COP22]] UN climate change negotiations), and interfaith events (such as the 2017 interfaith talks in Delhi with [[Islamic Relief]] and EcoSikh).&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; The Centre has launched with GreenFaith for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hinduclimatedeclaration2015.org/launch_annoucement|title=Launch Annoucement|work=Bhumi Devi Ki Jai!|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Dow Jones Dharma Index ====

In October 2006, after being invited by the Emerging Markets Group (EMG), the OCHS began work with Dow Jones in creating the Dharma Index. This index serves as an investing guide for Hindu and Buddhist communities by integrating dharmic ethical considerations into its investment calculus. The OCHS brought together academics, financial experts, and religious leaders (both Hindu and Buddhist) to form three committees tasked with creating the Index. The final document contains five indices, one each for the global market, USA, India, UK, and Japan. It also contains an overview of dharmic ethical values along with guidelines for their practical application in investment. The Index was launched on 15 Jan 2008 at the Taj Hotel, Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/dj_report08.pdf|title=Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies &amp; The Dow Jones Dharma Index: A case study in bridge building|last=|first=|date=2008|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital Shikshapatri====

This project provides online access to an important part of the British Hindu cultural heritage. The [[Shikshapatri]] manuscript is part of the Sanskrit manuscript collection of Oxford's Bodleian Library. The text was written by [[Swaminarayan|Shree Swaminarayan]], founder of Swaminarayan Hinduism, and is a religious manual for daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Rae A. Earnshaw, John A. Vince, Digital convergence: libraries of the future, Springer-Verlag, London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The project aimed at helping people of all backgrounds to better understand the significance of this popular manuscript. The project also proved to be a good example of how scholars and community members successfully worked together for a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/2,6545,15.html|title=Hindu Press International - Vegetarian Journal Poll: Americans 2.3 Percent Vegetarian - Hindu Press International - Hinduism Today Magazine|date=|publisher=Hinduismtoday.com|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a collaborative venture between the OCHS, the Indian Institute Library, and the Refugee Studies Centre of Oxford University, was funded by The New Opportunities Fund, and lasted from 2001-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odl.ox.ac.uk/collections/shikshapatri.htm|title=ODL - Digital Initiatives at Oxford University|date=2004-02-23|publisher=Odl.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnerships with academic institutions ===

The OCHS has entered into partnerships and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with academic institutions across the world — from India, institutions such as the C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar Institute of Indological Research (CPRIIR), the [[University of Madras]], and the [[University of Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cpr-centre-ties-up-with-oxford-centre-for-hindu-studies/article6263511.ece|title=C.P.R. centre ties up with Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|date=2014-07-30|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-05-18|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 2014|title=|url=|journal=University of Madras Newsletter|volume=20|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

The relevance of such partnerships is exemplified by the Centre's partnership with [[Nepal Sanskrit University]] (NSU) and the [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]] (BORI). Through the MoU with Nepal Sanskrit University in 2014, the Centre gains access to the National Archive of Nepal's large selection of rare, unedited, and unpublished Sanskrit and Nepali manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/nsu-oxford-university-sign-agreement/|title=NSU, Oxford University sign agreement|date=2018-03-25|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, the BORI's partnership with the OCHS on the Bhagavata Purana Project has led to great strides in the project. The BORI is engaging in a lengthy assessment of the critical edition of the Bhagavata Purana published by the BJ Institute of Learning and Research. In collaboration with the OCHS, they are analyzing the methodology used to put together this critical edition, taking into consideration dozens of other manuscripts, and are finally assessing whether the BJ Institute's critical edition is the most genuine manuscript. Besides this, the team has also researched the living traditions of the Bhagavata Purana in Maharashtra and is creating a collection of data on the text of the Bhagavata Purana and related texts. This work has contributed much to the ongoing phase two of the Bhagavata Purana Project.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

The Centre has signed MoUs with places across the globe, including the [[University of Florida]] (UF), the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], and Aarhus University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/ochs-annual-report-2010.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2009–10|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UF's collaboration with the OCHS inspired the creation of a centre at the University of Florida called the Centre for the Study of Hindu Traditions (CHiTra), paralleling the OCHS in its aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/sites/default/files/ochs-annual-report-2007.pdf|title=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Board of Governors Report 2006–7|last=|first=|date=|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's MoU with Aarhus University resulted in a program allowing Sanskrit students at Aarhus to spend a semester at the Centre as visiting students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/news/aarhus-ochs-student-exchange-programme|title=Aarhus-OCHS Student Exchange Programme|date=2014-09-18|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Danish students have taken advantage of this opportunity. The MoU also led the establishment of a new research unit for South Asian Religion (SAR) at Aarhus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These collaborations have proven to be effective ways for the Centre to bring its ideas and approaches to other academic institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7619">The '''Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China''' ({{zh|c=中国文物古迹保护准则|p=Zhōngguó wénwù gǔjī bǎohù zhǔnzé}}) is a conservation charter promulgated in 2000 by China [[ICOMOS]] with the approval of [[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] (SACH {{zh|c=国家文物局|p=Guójiā wénwù jú}}). It provides a methodological approach to the [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] of [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] sites in [[China]].

==Background==
While sustained debate on approaches to conservation dates from the nineteenth century, only in the mid-twentieth century were the first international and national conservation charters drawn up.&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Foreword |pages=55–56 |author=Agnew, Neville |author2=Demas, Martha |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the development of modern conservation concepts and practice began in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Principles |pages=59–66 |author=Zhang Bai |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the [[People's Republic of China]] began a national inventory and assessment of the significance of its cultural sites.&lt;ref name="Afterword"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Afterword |pages=91–93 |author=Zhang Bai |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, over 400,000 heritage sites had been identified nationwide, with over 1,230 listed as being of national importance.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/field_projects/china/ |title=China Principles |publisher=Getty Conservation Institute |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Cultural Relics]], consolidating previous legislation, entrusted primary responsibility for the conservation of cultural heritage to the government, while regulating the actions of conservation professionals. In 1985 China ratified the UNESCO [[World Heritage Convention]]. In May 1997 SACH requested that the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] assist in drawing up China's first conservation charter, with the [[Burra Charter]] proposed as a model. A tripartite project with the [[Australian Heritage Commission]] was launched in October 1997.&lt;ref name="Afterword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt;

By involving foreign parties as well as drawing upon domestic experience, it was intended that international best practice should guide local heritage practitioners.&lt;ref name="Afterword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt; The Preface to the China Principles states 'China's magnificent sites are the heritage not only of the various [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups in China]] but are also the common [[World Heritage Site|wealth of all humanity]] … it is the responsibility of all to bequeath these sites to future generations in their full integrity and [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]].&lt;ref name="Principles"/&gt; [[Economic development]], [[Cultural tourism|mass tourism]], [[globalization]], and [[nationalism|national interests]] have all affected the country's historic legacy.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt; 

==Promulgation and publication==
The 38 articles of the China Principles, with accompanying commentary, were promulgated by China ICOMOS in late 2000 with the approval of SACH. The principles are grouped into five chapters: (1) General Principles; (2) The Conservation Process; (3) Conservation Principles; (4) Conservation Interventions; and (5) Additional Principles. An English-language translation was first published in July 2002 and a bilingual version with a Chinese-English and English-Chinese glossary was published in May 2004. It is recognised that, as use of the guidelines reveals the need for change, the Principles will be revised. A planned further document is to comprise illustrated examples of successful conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Afterword"/&gt;

==The 38 Articles==
(1) Definition of heritage sites
(2) Conservation to include both intervention and preventive measures
(3) Heritage values
(4) Benefit of society not short-term gain
(5) Conservation to comply with laws, regulations and standards; significance is the highest priority throughout
(6) Research
(7) Documentation
(8) Management and training
(9) Conservation process
(10) Survey and inventory
(11) Assessment of values, condition and management
(12) Listing and buffer zones
(13) Conservation plans
(14) Actions plans for conservation, interpretation and education
(15) Periodic review of conservation plans
(16) Peer review of conservation plans
(17) Day-to-day management
(18) Conservation in-situ
(19) Minimum intervention
(20) Maintenance programme
(21) Intervention must be reversible, 'unobtrusive' yet 'distinguishable', and disclosed to the public
(22) Conservation techniques and materials must be proven
(23) Aesthetic criteria, derived from historic authenticity
(24) Landscape and setting
(25) No reconstruction, except in special cases
(26) Excavation entails conservation
(27) Disaster plans
(28) Intervention should have clear objectives, use proven methods and materials, and be documented
(29) Regular maintenance
(30) Physical protection
(31) Minor restoration
(32) Any restoration should preserve traces of periods of significance
(33) No conjectural reconstruction
(34) Treatment of setting and landscaping should not adversely affect site
(35) Archaeological sites should typically be reburied to conserve and prevent theft
(36) Principles may also be applied to commemorative places
(37) Principles may also be drawn upon for cultural, historic, and submarine landscapes and historic cities
(38) Principles drafted and adopted by China ICOMOS and approved by SACH; amendments should follow similarly.&lt;ref name="Principles"/&gt;

==Commentary==
Extended commentary clarifies the way in which these principles should be interpreted and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Commentary |pages=69–88 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public bookcase''' is a cabinet which may be freely and anonymously used for the exchange and storage of books without the formalities associated with [[Library|libraries]]. When in public places these cabinets are of a robust and weatherproof design which are available at all times. However, cabinets installed in public or commercial buildings may be simple, unmodified book-shelves and may only be available during certain periods.

== Origin ==
Closely allied with the [[BookCrossing]] concept, the original public bookcases were conceived as artistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html ''Book Crossing: Offene Bücherschränke in Bonn'', reticon-Report von Martin Ragg, 2. April 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103044019/http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html |date=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early examples are the creations of performance artist duo Clegg &amp; Guttmann in 1991. Collections of bookcases were conceived as "free open-air libraries" in Darmstadt and Hannover in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ ''Die Geschichte der Offenen Bibliotheken'' auf hannover.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819054002/http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ |date=2011-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Bonn]] Community Foundation awarded Trixy Royeck funding for her idea "outdoor books&amp;nbsp;– books in the open" which she submitted while studying interior design in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerstiftung-bonn.de/cms/download/pressetexte/pressemeldung_031115.pdf ''Bürgerstiftung Bonn stellt offenen Bücherschrank auf'', Presseerklärung der Bürgerstiftung Bonn, 15. November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and since this time the concept has been widely replicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/aktuell/pressebox/archiv_volltext.shtml?arch_0806/nachricht3102.html ''Bücherwald&amp;nbsp;– erstes öffentliches Bücherregal im Berliner Straßenraum'', Presseerklärung Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung, 27. Juni 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A public bookcase opened in 2010 in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=offener Bücherschrank – Wien
 |url = http://www.offener-buecherschrank.at/ |date=2010 |access-date=8 February 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Basel, Switzerland, where many coffee shops and other venues host open bookshelves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.öffentliche-bücherregale.ch/ Öffentliche Bücherregale]&lt;/ref&gt; a public bookcase was unveiled in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 Medienmitteilung der [[Christoph Merian Stiftung]] vom 14. Juni 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108234709/http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 |date=2014-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://3landinfo.blogspot.com/2011/06/dies-das-ein-neuer-bucherschrank.html 3land.info: ''dies &amp; das &amp; ein neuer Bücherschrank'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Open bookcases are financed by a wide range of organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.das-juelicht.de/nachrichten/artikel/10465.php Das JüLichT: ''Jülich ganz „sozial“''] Beitrag 2. September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the bookcases decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or exchange borrowed books for others.

== Use and acceptance ==
If a public bookcase is centrally and accessibly located and is stocked with sufficient material, public bookcases are quickly and widely appreciated. Vandalism has occurred in some places and, in successful cases, is countered by "bookcase sponsors" or "godfathers" who devote their time and attention to care of the collection.

The acceptance, motivation and user-profile of public bookshelves was examined in 2008 by a study at the University of Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huk.uni-bonn.de/pdf-dateien/bonner-buecherschrank-artikel''Der Bonner Bücherschrank auf der PoppelsdorferAllee – Ein merkwürdiges Versorgungssystem . Kurzfassung der Ergebnisse des Projekts „Das Nutzungsverhalten am Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank“''] (pdf) Autoren: Prof. Dr. Michael-Burkhard Piorkowsky, Sandra Bichler, Kerstin Hilt, Olga Reger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uni-bonn.de/die-universitaet/publikationen/forsch/forsch-2-april-2009/lernen_und_lehren.pdf''Bonner "Gemeinschaftsmöbel" Studienobjekt: Offener Bücherschrank als soziales System'' (pdf) Autorin: Ulrike Klopp. In: forsch / Bonner Universitäts-Nachrichten 2/2009. (S.27)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the system had developed as a notable alternative to conventional bookstores. One cannot equate public bookcases with classic peer-to-peer exchange, but they certainly represent the voluntary transfer of goods. Surveyed users also indicated that they believed that regular use of public bookcases could function as an example for similar schemes for other desirable goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 ''Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank: Die Frauen geben, die Männer nehmen''; Bonner General-Anzeiger, 3. February 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825024252/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 |date=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceptance has led to a rapid dissemination of public bookshelves throughout Germany. It has been found that durable construction and storm-resistance promote sustained use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10490&amp;detailid=525497 ''Ein Schrank für ausgesetzte Bücher/Bürgerstiftung Bonn eröffnet in den kommenden Tagen zwei weitere Freiluft-Bibliotheken'', Bonner General-Anzeiger, 20.

== Variants ==
In Oerlinghausen there is a modified version of the public bookcase. A small bookcase has been installed in Simon Square by the Friends of The Public Library, in collaboration with the Cohabitation/Society/Culture group of the local Agenda 21. These groups stock the bookcase as needed from a so-called "book exchange", a larger public event which has taken place in the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Haus in Oerlingsausen-South every Saturday since 2007. One may also deposit book requests to be matched from stock by the operators of the exchange.

The Salbke Bookmark is a large, open-air construction which includes a number of public bookcases. Originally built on the site of a demolished library in a depopulated district of Magdeburg, the local civic association has moved much of the stock to a nearby vacant shop where more than 10000 donations are securely housed.

A cafe in Marburg includes a public bookcase. The city library now includes a cabinet of books which may be freely taken or exchanged by patrons rather than organising complex book disposal events. The operation of this variant combines the library's daily operations with community control. As the bookcase is located in a protected space it does not require sponsorship or weather protection.

== Catalogs and mapping ==
[[File:Pizza Hut themed Little Free Library in Gillette, Wyoming.jpg|upright|thumb|right|A [[Pizza Hut]] themed Little Free Library in [[Gillette, Wyoming]]]]

In the United States, small enclosed bookcases, usually in front of residences, have become a common sight in many cities. Some of these are officially registered with the [[Little Free Library]] network. In Europe many public bookcases are registered via the [[Open Book Case]] project. The Open source /crowdsourcing mapping project [[OpenStreetMap]] has a designated tag for registering the location types and more of public bookcases.

This head dates from 1200 to 900 BCE and is {{convert|2.9|m}} high and {{convert|2.1|m}} wide.]]
'''San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán''' (or '''San Lorenzo''') is the collective name for three related [[archaeological site]]s—San Lorenzo, Tenochtitlán and Potrero Nuevo—located in the southeast portion of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Veracruz]]. Along with [[La Venta]] and [[Tres Zapotes]], it was one of the three major cities of the [[Olmec]] (it was the major center of [[Olmec]] culture from 1200 [[Before common era|BCE]] to 900 [[Common era|BCE]]). San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán is best known today for the [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal stone heads]] unearthed there, the greatest of which weigh {{convert|28|MT}} or more and are {{convert|3|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site should not be confused with [[Tenochtitlan]], the [[Aztec]] site in [[Mexico City]].  Administrative names were translated into Aztec/Nahuatl and spread alongside Catholic names during the European conquest, replacing any original locality names (and often now lost to antiquity.)

==Description==
The earliest evidence for Olmec culture is found at nearby [[El Manatí]], a sacrificial bog with artifacts dating to 1600 BCE or earlier. Sedentary agriculturalists had lived in the area for centuries before San Lorenzo developed into a regional center.&lt;ref&gt;[[John E. Clark|Clark]], 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

San Lorenzo was the first Olmec site that demonstrates state level complexity. The site dominated the gulf coast lowlands, creating Olmec cultural diffusion throughout the rest of Mesoamerica. The iconic finds at the site are the famous colossal heads. The colossal heads stand up to {{convert|200|cm}} tall. According to archaeological finds, archaeologists have divided the Olmec history into four stages: Formation stage (1700–1300 BCE), Integration stage (1300–900 BCE) Expansion stage (900–300 BCE) and Disintegration stage (300 BCE – 200 CE). Another name archaeologists use is for categorizing the Olmecs is the Formative Period. Formative meaning, the pivotal years that laid the ground work for state level, complex societies. Formative Mesoamerica can be divided into three periods: Early Formative (1800–900 BCE), Middle Formative (900–400 BCE) and Late Formative (400 BCE – 200 AD). San Lorenzo was the largest city in Mesoamerica from roughly 1200 [[Before common era|BCE]] to 900 BCE, at which time it had begun to be overtaken by the Olmec center of [[La Venta]]. By 800 BCE, there was little or no population, although there was an important recolonization of the San Lorenzo plateau from 600 to 400 BCE and again from [[circa]] 800 to 1000 CE.

In contrast to La Venta's swamp-like environs, San Lorenzo was situated in the midst of a large agricultural area.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; San Lorenzo seems to have been largely a ceremonial site, a town without city walls, centered in the midst of a widespread medium-to-large agricultural population. The ceremonial center and attendant buildings could have housed 5,500 while the entire area, including hinterlands, could have reached 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that while San Lorenzo controlled much or all of the Coatzacoalcos basin, areas to the east (such as the area where La Venta would rise to prominence) and north-northwest (such as the [[Tuxtla Mountains]]) were home to independent polities.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Built on some {{convert|700|ha}} of high ground between then-active tributaries, the core of San Lorenzo covers {{convert|55|ha}}&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; that were further modified through extensive filling and leveling; by one estimate {{convert|500,000|to|2,000,000|m3}} of earthen fill were needed, moved by the basketload. The rulers of San Lorenzo played a crucial role in integrating a population that changed the natural environment into sacred and secular landscapes for the glorification of the San Lorenzo polity.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists Michael Coe and Richard Diehl calculated that the {{convert|77|km2}} area of San Lorenzo that they studied could produce approximately {{convert|500|MT}} of maize annually, enough to feed 5,556 people, more than the estimated population at the time. Residents of San Lorenzo also consumed domestic dog, snook, tarpon, mojarra, catfish, and turtles. Although some claim that manioc was cultivated here, no evidence for this has been found.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

San Lorenzo also boasted an elaborate drainage system which used buried, covered, channeled stones as a type of "pipe".&lt;ref&gt;Cyphers, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh spring water was available on the elevated lands, but not as available in the lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Long lines of U-shaped drain stones directed water to the edges of the plateau, which reflected how the rulers directed and controlled this precious resource.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have inferred that the purpose of this system was not only to provide drinking water for the population but for ritual purposes as well, and that the rulership was "intimately linked to the figure of a patron water supernatural".&lt;ref&gt;Cyphers, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological history==
[[Image:Olmec Heartland Overview 4.svg|right|thumb|350px|San Lorenzo and the [[Olmec heartland]].]]

[[Matthew Stirling]] was the first to begin excavations on the site after a visit in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Beck et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1946 and 1970, four archaeological projects were undertaken, including one Yale University study headed by Michael Coe and Richard Diehl conducted between 1966 and 1968, followed by a lull until 1990. Coe's research faced criticism from ecologically minded archaeologists, although his ecological study of San Lorenzo in the second volume of his book silenced his critics.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological work recommenced in 1990, putting emphasis on the establishment pattern of community and regional levels ("''en el patrón de asentamiento en los niveles de comunidad y de región''".&lt;ref&gt;[[INAH]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Olmec name of the area, like nearly all of the Olmec language, is unknown. The name "San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán" was coined by Stirling in 1955, taken from the nearby present-day villages, and refers to the entire complex of sites. Matthew Stirling gave the name San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan to a cluster of three settlements on an island in the swamps and marshes west of the Coatzacoalcos. San Lorenzo proper occupies the slopes and summit of a plateau that rises 50 m above the floodplain of the Coatzacoalcos River.
The archaeological site of Tenochtitlán lies within the modern village of the same name at the northern end of the island, and Potero Nuevo occupies a hill east of the plateau. Another large site occupies the Loma del Zapote, a long ridge extending southward from the plateau, which includes the locality known as El Azuzul at its southern tip.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological sites of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán can be visited Monday to Sunday, from 8:00 to 15:00 hours local time.

==Stone sculptures of San Lorenzo==
The San Lorenzo site is well known for the multitude of stone sculptures displayed. Some of these sculptures depict supernatural deities, while others the flesh-and-blood embodiments on earth. Up to 124 stone sculptures have been discovered, and it is suspected that many more remain buried. The sculptures range in size, with the gigantic Colossal Heads weighing up to 28 tons. All the basalt used in this artwork originated at the Cerro Cintepec volcano in the Tuxtla mountains. These sculptures were not only done for aesthetic beauty, but also symbolized the awe-inspiring way that the Olmec viewed their deities. It also showed the power the rulers had, because a successfully delivery of a stone or finished sculpture involved complex organization and the ability to order extreme amounts of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The eight major phases of occupation==
In the 1960s, [[Michael Coe]] and [[Richard Diehl]] conducted excavations on San Lorenzo and surrounding sites, and defined eight major phases of occupation.
The Ojochi (ca. 1750–1550 B.C.) and Bajío (ca. 1550–1450 B.C.) phases constituted the pre-Olmec Initial Formative sequence. In the Early Formative Chicharras phase (ca. 1450–1400 B.C.) more characteristically Olmec artifacts appear on the site. San Lorenzo rose to the height of its power in the San Lorenzo phase (ca. 1400–1000 B.C.).
However, it suffered a decline in the beginning of the Middle Formative period. This period encompasses the Nacaste (ca. 1000–800 B.C.) and the Palangana (ca. 800–400 B.C.) phases. Its population declined further in the Late Formative Remplás phase (ca. 300–50 B.C.), and while there was occupation during the Early &amp; Middle Classic periods, it was not reoccupied until late in the Villa Alta phase (A.D. 800–1000).&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
At the top of the plateau of San Lorenzo, massive thrones, colossal heads, and smaller sculptures of humans, felines, birds, and supernatural monsters proclaimed the power of its rulers and its sacred source. Most of these sculptures were carved from imported basalt.
The elites of San Lorenzo lived in large structures raised on low clay platforms amid the monuments that legitimized their authority. An elite residence named the "Red Palace" had earthen walls and floors, which were plastered with sand stained by hematite. Massive columns that were {{convert|4|m}} tall and carved out of basalt supported the structure's roof, and L-shaped basalt benches are thought to have been used as step coverings. Blocks of bentonite clay and limestone have been found in the debris, and may have been used in the walls. Several structures had walls that were made of thick mud and {{convert|40|cm}} thick, and lacked post-molds. They were evidently constructed using a rammed earth technique. Other structures employed bentonite masonry fixed with mud mortar. Floors were made of gravel or packed earth, or paved with bentonite blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The common folk lived on the slopes of the plateau, stepping down to a level 40 m below the summit. Their houses were thatched wattle–and-daub houses.
Impressive amounts of labor went into building the San Lorenzo terraces. One of these terraces was held in place by a {{convert|7|m|adj=on}} high retaining wall. It is unclear if these terraces and houses were ordered to be constructed by rulers, or initiated by a group of commoners.&lt;ref name="Pool-p102"&gt;Pool, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape modifications to the landscape around San Lorenzo also include causeways or dikes. The two largest ones bordered ancient river courses at Potrero Nuevo and El Azuzul, respectively. These may have provided some measure of floor control and possible served as wharfs for loading and unloading canoes.&lt;ref name="Pool-p102"/&gt;

Further archaeological study was conducted at the El Bajio section of El Remolino, a site in North San Lorenzo, by Carl J. Wendt. This, coupled with studies of more central San Lorenzo, revealed quite a bit about how houses were organized. Wendt studied refuse throughout the site, using that information to infer the layout of buildings. Clutter refuse, that is, refuse that is potentially valuable or hazardous, was studied and progressed through several stages of disposal: discarded along areas near house walls, then moved to dumps or pits.&lt;ref name="Wendt-p454"&gt;Wendt p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; When people abandon a house, they usually leave refuse that is out of mind: behind large furniture, in corners, or outside on the periphery. Using this information, Wendt determined the likely architectural organization of the site. The data suggested that the architectural organization most likely followed the solar pattern of highland Maya house-lots.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; The solar pattern is unrestricted in space and has separate areas designated for separate activities, i.e. sleeping, cooking, etc. All these detached structures are built around a central patio area.&lt;ref name="Wendt-p454"/&gt;

==Exports from San Lorenzo==
Various types of Olmec style pottery and figurines originating in San Lorenzo area were exported to other areas in Mesoamerica. For example, at the [[Mazatán, Chiapas#Canton Corralito|Canton Corralito]] site in coastal [[Chiapas]] state, very large numbers were found.

Over 5,000 objects produced in the early Olmec style were found at Canton Corralito. In fact, many more Initial Olmec (1250-1150 BCE) and Early Olmec (1150-1000 BCE) type objects were found at Canton Corralito  than at San Lorenzo area. For the Cuadros phase (Early Olmec horizon), 15 percent of the carved pottery (Calzadas Carved) and nine percent of the incised pottery (Limón Incised) was imported from San Lorenzo area. At the same time, none of the San Lorenzo objects examined so far were found to be imports from any other area.&lt;ref&gt;David Cheetham,  [http://www.famsi.org/reports/05021/05021Cheetham01.pdf ''Cantón Corralito: Objects from a Possible Gulf Olmec Colony.'' (PDF)] FAMSI, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall of San Lorenzo==
The cause of San Lorenzo's demise and later replacement with La Venta is unknown, although it most certainly occurred in the 10th century BCE. Coe and Diehl originally suggested internal revolt or external conquest, but Diehl has since changed his mind. He now believes that the monuments were frequently recarved and reused before the collapse and the "mutilation" was simply the middle of that process. Warfare, environmental changes, economic decline, and the emergence of rival centers have all been suggested as possible causes for the decline, although multiple causes were likely. Evidence shows that the rivers of the region did change course at the time; that may have initiated or exacerbated other problems at the site of San Lorenzo.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">'''Stig Wikander''', born 27 August 1908 in [[Norrtälje]], died 20 December 1983, was a Swedish [[Indology|indologist]], [[Iranian studies|iranologist]] and [[Religious studies|historian of religions]]. He was professor of [[Sanskrit]] and comparative Indo-European philology at [[Uppsala University]] from 1953 until his retirement in 1974. He wrote in German and Swedish. He was visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] in 1959-1960 and taught at [[El Colegio de México]] in Mexico City in 1967. Early in his career he befriended [[Georges Dumézil]] and he had an extensive correspondence with [[Mircea Eliade]].&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Utas|first1=Bo|authorlink1=Bo Utas|last2=Duchesne-Guillemin|first2=Jacques|date=2009|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/wikander-oscar-stig|title=Wikander, Oscar Stig|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His research on [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European religion]] became influential and was developed further by Dumézil and others. Together with the linguist Bertil Malmberg he founded the journal ''[[Studia Linguistica]]'' in 1947. His last monograph was a book on Arab accounts of Scandinavians in the [[Viking Age]], ''Araber, vikingar, väringar'' ("Arabs, Vikings, [[Varangians]]").&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1211">A '''synthetic personality''' is a [[Social construction|constructed]], friendly, approachable [[persona]], often used in [[Broadcasting|broadcast media]].  The term was initiated by Andrew Tolson, and is related to [[Face (self image)|face]] and [[politeness]] theory.

Tolson focuses upon how the speech genre of [[online chat|chat]] is found across many broadcasts, including interviews. He identifies three features:

#topical shift towards the 'personal'
#the shift may be accompanied by displays of wit
#opens up the possibility of transgression (the interview''ee'' asking the interview''er'' questions)

He describes an interview between [[Robin Day]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in which the discourse about the General Election shifts to the personal.

'''''The Black Hole of Auschwitz''''' is a collection of essays by the Italian author [[Primo Levi]]. Originally published under the Italian title ''Asymmetry and Life'' it has two distinct halves. The first half, ''The Black Hole of Auschwitz'' is a collection of essays, often prefaces to other books, which make a plea against [[holocaust denial]]. The second half ''Other People's Trades'' are a mixture of essays on a wide variety of subjects. All of these works were collected together in the production of Levi's Italian anthology of works ''Opere'' in 1997.

'''''The Fox Effect: How Roger Ailes Turned a Network into a Propaganda Machine''''' is a 2012 book written by [[David Brock]] and Ari Rabin-Havt. Brock heads the progressive media watchdog group ''[[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]]'', the stated mission of which is "to comprehensively monitor, analyze, and correct conservative misinformation in the U.S. media." The book details the numerous controversies of [[Fox News Channel controversies|Fox News]], with emphasis on its president, [[Roger Ailes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob|title=Right Face|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/books/review/the-fox-effect-by-david-brock-and-his-colleagues.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The idea of a "Fox effect" dates back to at least 2006 in a [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] working paper titled "The Fox News Effect: Media Bias and Voting," by [[Stefano DellaVigna]] and [[Ethan Kaplan]]. The working paper, which was subsequently published in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' in 2007, found "a significant effect of the introduction of Fox News on the vote share in Presidential elections between 1996 and 2000," as well as "a significant effect of Fox News on Senate vote share and on voter turnout."&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Economic Research: [http://www.international.ucla.edu/cms/files/dellavigna.pdf The Fox News Effect: Media Bias and Voting.] April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DellaVigna, Stefano, and Ethan Kaplan (20007) [https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/122/3/1187/1879517/The-Fox-News-Effect-Media-Bias-and-Voting The Fox News Effect: Media Bias and Voting], ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 122 (3) pp. 1187--1234,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050302299.html The Fox News Effect.]  May 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to publisher [[Random House]], the book  "follows the career of [Roger] Ailes..." and features "transcripts of leaked audio and memos from Fox News reporters and executives."&lt;ref&gt;Random House: [http://www.randomhouse.com/book/112829/the-fox-effect-by-david-brock-ari-rabin-havt-and-media-matters-for-america ''The Fox Effect'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' positively reviewed the book, noting the "diligently documented book... leave[s] us with the warning that 'the single most important player' in the upcoming election will be none other than Fox News."&lt;ref&gt;''Publishers Weekly'': [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-307-27958-3 The Fox Effect: How Roger Ailes Turned a Network into a Propaganda Machine.]  March 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kirkus Reviews]] called it a "thorough catalogue," but warned that those who are well-versed may believe that the "book feels like an exhaustively researched exercise in stating the obvious."&lt;ref&gt;''Kirkus'': [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-brock/fox-effect/ THE FOX EFFECT.]  January 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed by Erik Wemple at the ''[[Washington Post]]'', who criticized the book's lack of balance.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/media-matters-fox-effect-fair-and-balanced/2012/02/29/gIQAOmRsiR_blog.html Media Matters’ ‘Fox Effect’: Fair and balanced?]  February 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  A review at ''The New York Times'' praised it as a "close study" while questioning the book's success, noting the book "demonstrates not its reach but the limits of conservative jihadism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob|title=Right Face|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/books/review/the-fox-effect-by-david-brock-and-his-colleagues.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6019">'''Tom Moore Jr.''' (May 16, 1918 – April 16, 2017) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from 1967 to 1973 from [[McLennan County, Texas|McLennan County]]. Moore is most noted for an [[April Fool's Day]] prank he played to demonstrate that his fellow legislators often did not read the legislation they were approving and for being a member of the "Dirty Thirty."

==Biography==
Moore was born in Waco, Texas, May 16, 1918. He served in the [[U.S. Army]] from 1943 to 1946. From 1952-1959, as McLennan County [[district attorney]], Moore prosecuted "the first criminal trial to be televised in the United States."&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;!-- whole paragraph--&gt;

==Boston Strangler prank==
Moore introduced legislation on April 1, 1971 commending [[Albert de Salvo]]—more commonly known as the [[Boston Strangler]]—including this wording:

{{quote |This compassionate gentleman's dedication and devotion to his work has enabled the weak and the lonely throughout the nation to achieve and maintain a new degree of concern for their future. He has been officially recognized by the state of [[Massachusetts]] for his noted activities and unconventional techniques involving [[population control]] and [[applied psychology]].&lt;ref name="McNeel"/&gt;}}

After it was passed unanimously by the House, Moore later withdrew the legislation, explaining he had only offered it to prove an important point that his fellow legislators didn't read much of the legislation they voted on.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

==Dirty Thirty==

Moore, along with 29 other bipartisan members of the 1971 [[Texas House of Representatives]], became known as the "Dirty Thirty" after allying against the then-[[Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Gus Franklin Mutscher]] and other Texas officials who had been charged in a bribery-conspiracy investigation by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|United States Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The Dirty Thirty kept the [[Sharpstown Stock-Fraud Scandal]] alive as a political issue.  Even though Mutscher was still favored by a majority in the House, they called for a resolution to make Mutscher and his associates resign from leadership positions while the SEC investigation continued.  However, because of Mutscher's favored position, the measure failed in addition to another resolution, for the House to make itself a committee of the whole to study the SEC allegation. The Dirty Thirty's criticisms of Mutscher's system of controlling legislation eventually led Mutscher to agree to an investigation led by five of his closest House allies, all chairmen of other committees he had appointed, to do the job. On the next-to-last day of the session, Mutscher attacked the Dirty Thirty, accusing them of irresponsible, partisan politics and the Dirty Thirty called Mutscher a dictator of state politics, more concerned with private than public interests. This began the electoral battle, which Mutscher lost.

Mutscher, along with two other colleagues ([[Preston Smith (governor)|Governor Preston Smith]] and [[Ben Barnes (politician)|Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes]]), were indicted by a [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] [[grand jury]] in September 1971 for conspiracy to accept a bribe and accepting a bribe.  Mutscher was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to five years' probation. Mutscher's colleagues, though not brought to trial, saw their political careers effectively ended. The Dirty Thirty also paid a price - Mutscher blocked most of their legislation actions and they were isolated from other Texas legislators.&lt;ref name="TSHA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TexMo"/&gt; Moore died in April 2017 at the age of 98.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/thomas-moore-obituary?pid=185120380&amp;view=guestbook Thomas MOORE Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a sub-project of the [[Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project]] where the artists are growing a [[leather]] jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of [[garment]] by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.

__TOC__

==Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project==

The [[SymbioticA]] website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbiotica.uwa.edu.au/ Official SymbioticA website] Retrieved 03.20.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/ TC&amp;A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&amp;A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:

'''NoArk''' – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to [[Noah's Ark]]. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft’ for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/noark.html TC&amp;A – NoArk] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Worry Dolls''' – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan [[Worry doll]] were hand-crafted of degradable [[polymers]] and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/ars/main_frames.html TC&amp;A – Worry Dolls] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Disembodied Cuisine''' – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problemetizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/disembodied/dis.html TC&amp;A – Disembodied Cuisine] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Extra Ear – ¼ Scale''' – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist [[Stelarc]]'s ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html TC&amp;A – Extra Ear – ¼ Scale] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''The Pig Wings Project''' – This project bases its ideas on [[xenotransplantation]] and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/pig/pig_main.html TC&amp;A – The Pig Wings Project] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Idea==
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object."&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to [[bioscience]] and [[technology]]. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Genetologic Research] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&amp;A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

== The Victimless Leather project ==

===Growing the jacket===
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with [[3T3 cells|3T3]] mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human [[bone cells]] in order to create a stronger skin layer.

To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]]. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt; The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high and 1,4&amp;nbsp;inches wide and would just fit a mouse.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 Wired – Jacket Grows From Living Tissue] Retrieved 10.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 The technoscientific body] Retrieved 03.31.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth-based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Victimless Leather Jacket] Retrieved 05.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Killing the Jacket====
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], United States. [http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/index.html] [http://www.moma.org/] February 24 – May 12, 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/news.html TC&amp;A News] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/54636/ TheScientist – Victimless Jacket, R.I.P.] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===

Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning whether it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacebetween.org.au/ The Space Between] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

==Related work and ideas==
The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} seen different. An [[Inuit]] hunts the [[Pinniped|seal]] and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bambusspiele.de/spiele/nanuuk/e_nunavut.htm – Arctic hunters], Retrieved 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908170494.html – All Africa] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[archaeology]], '''waterlogging''' refers to the long-term exclusion of air by [[groundwater]], which creates an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment that can preserve artifacts perfectly. Such waterlogging preserves perishable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s. Thus, in a [[archaeological site|site]] which has been waterlogged since the [[archaeological horizon]] was deposited, exceptional insight may be obtained by study of artifacts made of [[leather]], [[wood]], [[textile]] or similar materials. 75-90% of the archaeological remains at [[wetland]] sites are found to be organic material. [[Tree ring]]s found from logs that have been preserved allow archaeologists to accurately date sites. Wetland sites include all those found in lakes, swamps, marshes, fens, and peat bogs.

[[Peat bog]]s, nearly all of which occur in northern latitudes, are some of the most important environments for wetland archaeology. Peat bogs have likewise preserved many wooden trackways, including the world's oldest road, which is a 6,000-year-old one-mile stretch of track.

[[Bog body|Bog bodies]] are the best-known finds from the peat bogs of northwest [[Europe]], with most of them dating from the [[Iron Age]]. Most corpses that were found were individuals that met a violent death and were probably either executed as criminals or killed as a sacrifice before thrown into the bog. For example, the [[Old Croghan Man]] was stabbed, decapitated, mutilated, and tied down to the bottom of a bog pool. His body is an amazing display of how splendidly waterlogging can preserve a body, as his hands, skin, fingernails, and stomach were amazingly intact. Another example of a waterlogging artifact or mummy was [[Ötzi]], found by two tourists near the border of [[Austria]] and [[Italy]]. Ötzi is now displayed in [[Bolzano]], Italy, in the [[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]].

Occasionally, waterlogged conditions can occur inside burial mounds. The oak-coffin burials of [[Bronze Age]] northern Europe, and most notably those of [[Denmark]], date to about 1000 BC. These coffins had an inner core of stones packed round the tree-trunk coffin, with a round [[tumulus|barrow]] built above. Water then infiltrated the inside of the mound and by combining with [[tannin]] exuding from the tree trunks, set up acidic conditions which destroyed the skeleton but preserved the skin, hair, ligaments, and clothing of the individuals.

Perhaps the most interesting wetland archaeological find was the [[Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site|Ozette site]]. In 1750, a huge [[mudslide]] buried a whale-hunting settlement on the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which protected the organic artifacts from the oxygen that would lead to their deterioration. Over 50,000 artifacts were found in a fine state of preservation, with almost half of them being wood or plant material. The most fascinating thing they found was a meter-high block of cedar that was carved in the shape of a whale's [[dorsal fin]].

The major archaeological problem with waterlogged finds, particularly wood, is that they deteriorate rapidly when they are uncovered, beginning to dry and crack almost at once. They therefore need to be kept wet until treated in a laboratory. Conservation measures explain why wet archaeology costs around four times as much as dry archaeology.
