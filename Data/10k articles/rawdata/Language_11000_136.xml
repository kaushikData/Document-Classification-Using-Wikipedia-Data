An '''amphora''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|f|ər|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀμφορεύς, ''amphoréus''; English plural: '''amphorae''' or '''amphoras''') is a type of container of a characteristic shape and size, descending from at least as early as the [[Neolithic]] Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often [[ceramic]], but examples in metals and other materials have been found.  Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in [[Ancient Greek vase painting]]. 

The amphora complements the large storage container, the [[pithos]], which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than 50 kilograms (100 lbs). The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive [[package handle|handles]] joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters.

Stoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the ''neck amphora'', in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the ''one-piece amphora'', in which the neck and body form a continuous curve. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward.

Most were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers.&lt;ref name=Adkins196&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Adkins | first=L. | last2=Adkins | first2=R.A. | year=1994 | title=Handbook to life in Ancient Rome | location=New York, N.Y. | publisher=Facts on File |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines.

Amphorae are of great use to [[Maritime archaeology|maritime archaeologists]], as they often indicate the age of a [[shipwreck]] and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, [[Testaccio]], close to the [[Tiber]], the fragments, later wetted with [[Calcium hydroxide]] (Calce viva), remained to create a hill now named [[Monte Testaccio]], {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and more than 1&amp;nbsp;kilometre in circumference.

==Etymology==
Amphora is a Greco-Roman word developed in [[ancient Greek]] during the [[Bronze Age]]. The Romans acquired it during the Hellenization that occurred in the [[Roman Republic]]. [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] is the first known literary person to use it. The Romans turned the Greek form into a standard -a declension noun, ''amphora'', pl. ''amphorae''.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{L&amp;S|amphora|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly, the word and the vase were introduced to Italy through the Greek settlements there, which traded extensively in Greek pottery.

It is remarkable that even though the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] imported, manufactured, and exported amphorae extensively in their wine industry, and other Greek vase names were Etruscanized, no Etruscan form of the word exists. There was perhaps an as yet unidentified native Etruscan word for the vase that pre-empted the adoption of ''amphora''.

[[File:Linear B Ideogram B209.svg|left]]
The Latin word derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''amphoreus'' ({{lang|grc|ἀμφορεύς}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)mforeu/s|ἀμφορεύς|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a shortened form of ''amphiphoreus'' ({{lang|grc|ἀμφιφορεύς}}), a compound word combining ''amphi-'' ("on both sides", "twain")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)mfi/|ἀμφί|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''phoreus'' ("carrier"), from ''pherein'' ("to carry"),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|foreu/s|φορεύς}}, {{LSJ|fe/rw|φέρειν|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the vessel's two carrying handles on opposite sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Göransson | first=Kristian | title=The transport amphorae from Euesperides: The maritime trade of a Cyrenaican city 400-250 BC | series=Acta Archaeologica Lundensia, Series in 4o No. 25 | publisher=Lund | location=Stockholm | year=2007 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amphora appears as {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀠𐀡𐀩𐀸}}, ''a-pi-po-re-we'', in the [[Linear B]] Bronze Age records of Knossos, {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀡𐀩𐀸}}, ''a-po-re-we'', at Mycenae, and the fragmentary '']-re-we'' at Pylos, designated by {{nowrap|Ideogram 209}} {{lang|gmy|𐃨}}, [[Emmett L. Bennett, Jr.|Bennett's]] AMPHORA, which has a number of scribal variants. The two spellings are transcriptions of amphiphorēwes (plural) and amphorēwe (dual) in Mycenaean Greek from which it may be seen that the short form prevailed on the mainland. Homer uses the long form for metrical reasons, and Herodotus has the short form. Ventris and Chadwick's translation is "carried on both sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Ventris | first2=John | last2=Chadwick | title=Documents in Mycenaean Greek | location=Cambridge | publisher=University Press | year=1973 | edition=2nd | pages=324, 328, 494, 532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weights and measures==
[[File:Amphora Dressel 1B.svg|thumb|right|260px|Dressel 1B type amphora&lt;br/&gt;''Key :'' 1 : rim - 2 : neck - 3 : handle - 4 : shoulder - 5 : belly ''or'' body - 6 : foot]]
{{Main|Amphora (unit)}}
Amphorae varied greatly in height. The largest stands as tall as 1.5 metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft) high, while some were less than 30 centimetres (12&amp;nbsp;in) high - the smallest were called amphoriskoi  (literally "little amphorae"). Most were around 45 centimetres (18&amp;nbsp;in) high.

There was a significant degree of standardisation in some variants; the wine amphora held a standard measure of about 39 litres (41 US qt), giving rise to the amphora quadrantal as a unit of measure in the Roman Empire. In all, approximately 66 distinct types of amphora have been identified.

Further, the term also stands for an ancient [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman unit of measurement]] for liquids. The volume of a Roman amphora was one cubic [[Foot (length)|foot]], c. 26.026 [[Litre|L]].

==Production==
Roman amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then left to dry partially.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"&gt;{{cite book | title=Amphorae and the Roman economy: an introductory guide | first=D P S | last=Peacock | first2=D F | last2=Williams | location=London; New York | publisher=Longman | year=1986 | series=Longman archaeology series |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then coils of clay were added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"/&gt; Once the amphora was complete, the maker then treated the interior with resin that would prevent permeation of stored liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo 2003, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on the study of modern amphora production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"/&gt;

Amphorae often were marked with a variety of stamps, [[sgraffito]], and inscriptions. They provided information on the production, content, and subsequent marketing. A stamp usually was applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage. It indicates the name of the ''figlina'' (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, ''[[tituli picti]]'', recorded the weight of the container and the contents, and were applied after the amphora was filled.

==Classification==
The first systematic classification of Roman amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar [[Heinrich Dressel]]. Following the exceptional amphora deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]''. In his studies of the amphora deposit he was the first to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called "Dressel table",&lt;ref&gt;Dressel 1879, Di un grande deposito di anfore rinvenuto nel nuovo quartiere del Castro Pretorio, in BullCom, VII, 36-112, 143-196.&lt;/ref&gt; which still is used today for many types.

Subsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications, which usually are named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Maña published in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Maña, Sobre tipologia de ánforas pùnicas, in ''VI Congreso Arqueologico del Sudeste Español'', Alcoy, 1950, Cartagena, 1951, 203-210&lt;/ref&gt; and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977-1978.&lt;ref&gt;Amphores de tradition punique à Uzita, in BaBesch 52-53, 171-200&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Laubenheimer, Les amphores gauloises sous l’empire: recherches nouvelles sur leur production et chronologie, in ''Amphores romaines et histoire économiqué: dis ans de recherche''. Actes du Colloque de Sienne (22-24 mai 1986), Rome, 105-138&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat.&lt;ref&gt;Marangou-Lerat, Le vin et les amphores de Crète de l’epoque classique à l’epoque impériale, in ''Etudes Cretoises'', 30, Paris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Beltràn studied the Spanish types in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Beltràn, ''Las anforas Romanas en Espana'', Zaragoza&lt;/ref&gt; Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;"Sulla cronologia delle anfore romane di età repubblicana" in ''Rivista Studi Liguri 21'', 252-60&lt;/ref&gt; For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella,{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=177-275|quote=Le anfore di età imperiale del Mediterraneo occidentale", in ''Céramiques hellénistiques et romaines III''}} and Peacock and Williams.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"/&gt;

==History==
===Prehistoric origins===
[[File:Banpo amphora.jpg|thumb|right|Amphora found in [[Banpo]], China. Yangshao culture (5000-3000 BC)]] 
Ceramics of shapes and uses falling within the range of amphorae, with or without handles, are of prehistoric heritage across Eurasia, from the Caucasus to China. For example, the [[kvevri]], common in the Republic of Georgia and the Caucasus, may be traced back to approximately 6000 BC. Amphorae dated to approximately 4800 BC have been found in [[Banpo]], a [[Neolithic]] site of the [[Yangshao culture]] in [[China]]. Amphorae first appeared on the [[Phoenicia]]n coast at approximately 3500 BC.

In the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae spread around the ancient [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] world, being used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as the principal means for transporting and storing [[grape]]s, [[olive oil]], [[wine]], [[Vegetable oil|oil]], [[olive]]s, [[cereal|grain]], [[fish]], and other [[Commodity|commodities]].&lt;ref name=Adkins196/&gt; They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. [[Barrel|Wooden]] and skin containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter.

They influenced [[Chinese ceramics]] and other East Asian ceramic cultures, especially as a fancy shape for high-quality decorative ceramics, and continued to be produced there long after they had ceased to be used further west.

===Ancient Greece: fancy shapes for painting===
[[File:Amphora Athens Louvre A512.jpg|thumb|Large late Geometric Attic amphora, c. 725–700 BC]]
{{further information|Ancient Greek vase painting|Pottery of ancient Greece}}

Besides coarse amphorae used for storage and transport, the vast majority, high-quality painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers for a variety of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs vastly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a ring base, with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. They normally have a firm base on which they can stand.  [[Panathenaic Amphorae|amphorae]] were used as prizes in  the [[Panathenaic Festival]]s held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC, filled with olive oil from a sacred grove.  Surviving examples bear the inscription "I am one of the prizes from Athens", and usually depict the particular event they were awarded for. 

Painted amphorae were also used for funerary purposes, often in special types such as the ''[[loutrophoros]]''. Especially in earlier periods, outsize vases were used as grave markers, while some amphorae were used as containers for the ashes of the dead. By the Roman period vase-painting had largely died out, and utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.

====Greek amphora types====
Various different types of amphorae were popular at different times:

=====Neck amphora (c. 6th-5th century BC)=====
On a neck amphora, the handles are attached to the neck, which is separated from the belly by an angular carination. There are two main types of neck amphorae:
* the [[Nolan amphora]] (late 5th century BC), named for its type site, [[Nola]] near [[Naples]], and
* the [[Tyrrhenian amphorae|Tyrrhenian amphora]].
There are also some rarer special types of neck amphora, distinguished by specific features, for example:
* the [[Pointed amphora]], with a notably pointed toe, sometimes ending in a knob-like protrusion
* the ''[[Loutrophoros]]'', used for storing water during  ritual ceremonies, such as marriages and funerals.

=====Belly amphora (c. 640-450 BC)=====
In contrast to the neck amphora, a belly amphora does not have a distinguished neck; instead the belly reaches the mouth in a continuous curve. After the mid-5th century BC, this type was rarely produced. The ''[[pelike]]'' is a special type of belly amphora, with the belly placed lower, so that the widest point of the vessel is near its bottom. The ''pelike'' was introduced around the end of the 6th century BC.

=====Panathenaic prize amphora=====
[[File:Terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora MET GR147.jpg|thumb|[[Panathenaic amphora|Panathenaic prize amphora]] for runners, c. 530 BC]]
Another special type is the [[Panathenaic amphora|Panathenaic prize amphora]], with [[black-figure vase painting|black-figure]] decoration, produced exclusively as prize vessels for the [[Panathenaia]] and retaining the black-figure technique for centuries after the introduction of [[red-figure vase painting]]. Some examples bear the inscription "ΤΩΝ ΑΘΗΝΗΘΕΝ ΑΘΛΩΝ" meaning "[I am one] of the prizes from [the goddess] Athena".  They contained the prize of oil from the sacred olive tree of the goddess [[Athena]] for the winners of the athletic contests held to honour the goddess, and were evidently kept thereafter, and perhaps used to store wine, before being buried with the prize-winner. They depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc.
[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia Antikensammlung Berlin 3.jpg|thumb|A Greek glass amphora, 2nd half of the 2nd century BC, from [[Olbia]], [[Corsica and Sardinia|Roman-era Sardinia]], now in the [[Altes Museum]]]]

===Ancient Rome===
By the Roman period utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.

The first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=177}} This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, although also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2-4 starts to become widely used.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=194}} This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6000 Dressel 2-4 in the same space.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=369|quote=La anfore da trasporto in La ceramica e i materiali di età romana a cura di D. Gandolfi, Bordighera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dressel 2-4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which quickly ceased to be used.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=194}}

At the same time in [[Cuma (Italy)|Cuma]] (southern Italy) the production of the ''cadii cumani'' type starts (Dressel 21-22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called [[Spello]] amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=369}}

In the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2-4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in [[Marseille]] during late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=194}} Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in late Republican times. The ''[[Hispania Baetica]]'' and ''[[Hispania Tarraconensis]]'' regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC due to the distribution of land to military veterans and the founding of new colonies. Spanish amphorae were widespread in the Mediterranean area during early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in Baetica and among these there were the Dressel 20, a typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7-13, for [[garum]] (fish sauce), and the Haltern 70, for [[defrutum]] (fruit sauce). In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped on the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2-4.

North-African production was based on an ancient tradition which may be traced back to the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]].{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=207}} Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions, which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in [[Tripolitania]] and Northern Tunisia are the Maña C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Werff 1977-78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aegean area the types from the island of [[Rhodes]] were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC due to local wine production which flourished over a long period. These types developed into the ''Camulodunum'' 184, an amphora used for the transportation of Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2-4 were produced on the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th century BC until middle imperial times.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=374}} Cretan containers also were popular for the transportation of wine and can be found around the Mediterranean from Augustan times until the 3rd century AD.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=375}} During the late empire period, north-African types dominated amphora production. The so-called African I and II types were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased.

==Modern use==
Some modern winemakers and [[brewer]]s are using amphoras to provide a different palate and tastes to their products than are available with other aging methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to the future|url=http://www.cantillon.be/br/3_22|website=Cantillon.be/br/|publisher=Brasserie Cantillon|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106192624/http://www.cantillon.be/br/3_22|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''''' is a 2001 American [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[science fantasy]] [[action film|action]] [[adventure film]] created by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]]—the first [[science fiction film]] in [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney's animated features canon]] and the 41st overall. Written by [[Tab Murphy]], directed by [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], and produced by [[Don Hahn]], the film features an ensemble cast with the voices of [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Cree Summer]], [[James Garner]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Don Novello]], [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]], [[Claudia Christian]], [[Jacqueline Obradors]], [[Jim Varney]] (in his final role before his death), [[Florence Stanley]], [[John Mahoney]], [[David Ogden Stiers]] and [[Corey Burton]]. Set in 1914, the film tells the story of a young man who gains possession of a sacred book, which he believes will guide him and a crew of mercenaries to the lost city of [[Atlantis]].

Development of the film began after production had finished on ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1996). Instead of another [[Musical film|musical]], the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of [[Jules Verne]]. ''Atlantis'' was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator [[Mike Mignola]]. At the time of its release, the film had made greater use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to have been shot in [[anamorphic format]]. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[Marc Okrand]] created a [[Atlantean language|language]] specifically for use in ''Atlantis'', with [[James Newton Howard]] providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from [[hand-drawn animation]] toward films with full CGI.

''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California]] on June 3, 2001, and went into general release on June 15. Released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], ''Atlantis'' performed modestly at the box office. Budgeted at around {{Nowrap|$90-120 million}}, the film grossed over {{Nowrap|$186 million}} worldwide, {{Nowrap|$84 million}} of which was earned in North America. Due to the film's lackluster box office performance, Disney quietly canceled both a spin-off television series and an underwater attraction at its [[Disneyland]] theme park. Some critics praised it as a unique departure from typical Disney animated features, while others disliked it due to the unclear target audience and absence of songs. ''Atlantis'' was nominated for a number of awards, including seven [[Annie Award]]s, and won Best Sound Editing at the 2002 [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Golden Reel Awards]]. The film was released on VHS and DVD on January 29, 2002; the [[Blu-ray]] released on June 11, 2013. ''Atlantis'' is considered to be a [[Cult film|cult favorite]], due in part to Mignola's unique artistic influence. A direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]]'', was released in 2003.

==Plot==
&lt;!--Plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words according to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, so please do not add more to this section, and instead adjust what is already present. The plot summary is an overview of the film's main events, so avoid minute details such as dialogue, scene-by-scene breakdowns, and technical detail.--&gt;

Many centuries ago, a [[tsunami]] threatens to drown the island of [[Atlantis]]. In the midst of an evacuation from the capital city, the Queen of Atlantis is caught by a strange, hypnotic blue light and lifted up into the "Heart of Atlantis", a powerful crystal protecting the city. The crystal consumes her and creates a dome barrier that protects the city's innermost district. She leaves behind her young daughter, Princess Kida, as the island sinks beneath the ocean.

In 1914, Milo Thatch, a cartographer and linguist at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] who is marginalized for his research on Atlantis, believes that he has found The Shepherd's Journal, an ancient manuscript that contains directions to the lost island. Though the museum board declines his proposal to search for the journal, a mysterious woman, Helga Sinclair, introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's grandfather, recruiting Milo to lead an expedition to Atlantis, as soon as he receives it.

The expedition departs with a team of specialists led by Commander Lyle Rourke, who also led the journal recovery expedition. They set out in the ''Ulysses'', a massive [[submarine]]. During the journey, they are attacked by the monstrous [[Leviathan]], a robotic lobster-like creature that guards Atlantis' entrance. The ''Ulysses'' is subsequently destroyed, but Milo, Rourke, and part of the crew escape to an underground cavern, described in the journal as the entrance to Atlantis.

After traveling through a network of caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis, where they are greeted by Kida. However, Kida's father, the King of Atlantis, is not pleased with the team's visit, but agrees with Rourke for a one-night stay. Kida enlists Milo in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By diving deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.

Returning to the surface with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, intending to bring the crystal to the surface and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds it himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat and merges with Kida, whom Rourke and the mercenaries lock in a crate, and then prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates the crew for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted to use it as a weapon of war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Milo rallies the crew and Atlanteans to stop Rourke.

In the ensuing battle inside the volcano, Helga, and the accomplices die, while Rourke is destroyed after turning into a rock monster and being chopped by the propeller. Milo and the others successfully fly the crystal back to the city, as the volcano erupts. With lava flowing towards the city, Kida (in her crystal form) rises into the air and creates a [[Force field (fiction)|protective shield]]. The lava freezes and breaks away harmlessly, showing a restored Atlantis, and the crystal returns Kida to Milo. The surviving crew members return to the surface and promise to keep the discovery of Atlantis a secret. Having fallen in love with Kida, Milo becomes the new king of Atlantis, along with Kida as the new queen, and stays behind to help her rebuild the lost empire.

Milo's character design was based in part on sketches of the film's language consultant, [[Marc Okrand]].]]
* [[Michael J. Fox]] as Milo James Thatch, a [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Cartography|cartographer]] at the Smithsonian who was recruited to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing an expedition to Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action because he did not have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 0:20–0:56]]&lt;/ref&gt; The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for ''[[Titan A.E.]]''; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,106688,00.html|title=Movie Preview: ''Atlantis'' (2001)|date=May 14, 2001|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116184524/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C106688%2C00.html|archivedate=January 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, [[Marc Okrand]], who developed the [[Atlantean language]] used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, [[John Pomeroy]], sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.&lt;ref name="Language"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-05-24-atlantis-lingo.htm|title=New Movie Trek for Wordsmith|first=Susan|last=Wloszczyna|date=May 24, 2001|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514011113/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-05-24-atlantis-lingo.htm|archivedate=May 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James Garner]] as Commander Lyle Tiberius Rourke, the leader of the band of mercenaries, for the Atlantean expedition. Wise chose Garner because of his previous experience with [[action film]]s, especially [[War film|war]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] films, and said the role "fits him like a glove". When asked if he would be interested in the role, Garner replied: "I'd do it in a heartbeat."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 3:50–4:31]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cree Summer]] as Kidagakash "Kida" Nedakh, the Princess of Atlantis. Kida's supervising animator, Randy Haycock, stated that Summer was very "intimidating" when he first met her; this influenced how he wanted Kida to look and act on screen when she meets Milo.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 2:32–2:50]]&lt;/ref&gt; Natalie Strom provided dialogue for Kida as a young child.
* [[Don Novello]] as Vincenzo "Vinny" Santorini, an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Demolition|demolitions expert]]. Kirk Wise and [[Russ Edmonds]], Vinny's supervising animator, noted Novello's unique ability to [[improvisation|improvise]] dialogue. Edmonds recalled, "[Novello] would look at the sheet, and he would read the line that was written once, and he would never read it again! And we never used a written line, it was improvs, the whole movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 7:18–7:47]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] as Doctor Joshua Strongbear Sweet, a [[medic]] of [[African American]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent. Sweet's supervising animator, [[Ron Husband]], indicated that one of the challenges was animating Sweet in sync with Morris' rapid line delivery while keeping him believable. Morris stated that this character was extreme, with "no middle ground"; he mentioned, "When he was happy, he was ''really'' happy, and when he's solemn, he's ''real'' solemn."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 8:20–9:13]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Claudia Christian]] as Lieutenant Helga Sinclair, Rourke's German second-in-command and lieutenant. Christian described her character as "sensual" and "striking". She was relieved when she finally saw what her character looked like, joking, "I'd hate to, you know, go through all this and find out my character is a toad."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 10:18–10:39]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacqueline Obradors]] as Audrey Rocio Ramirez, a teenage [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[mechanic]] and the youngest member of the expedition. Obradors said her character made her "feel like a little kid again" and she always hoped her sessions would last longer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 5:59–6:07]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Florence Stanley]] as Wilhelmina Bertha Packard: an elderly, sarcastic, chain-smoking [[Radio|radio operator]]. Stanley felt that Packard was very "cynical" and "secure": "She does her job and when she is not busy she does anything she wants."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 9:38–9:51]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Fenton Q. Harcourt, a board member of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] who dismisses Milo's belief in the existence of Atlantis. Stiers previously worked with Michael J. Fox in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]''. He earlier voice-acted for Disney in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' as Cogsworth, ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' as Governor Ratcliffe, and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' as the Archdeacon and would do so again in ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'' as Jumba.
* [[John Mahoney]] as Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire who funds the expedition to Atlantis. [[Lloyd Bridges]] was originally cast and recorded as Whitmore, but he died before completing the film. Mahoney's zest and vigor led to Whitmore's personality being reworked for the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, p. 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mahoney stated that doing voice work was "freeing" and allowed him to be "big" and "outrageous" with his character.&lt;ref name="Cast"&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 4:55–5:07]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jim Varney]] as Jebidiah Allardyce "Cookie" Farnsworth, a Western-style [[chuckwagon]] chef. Varney died of lung cancer in February 2000, before the production ended, and the film was dedicated to his memory. Producer Don Hahn was saddened that Varney never saw the finished film, but mentioned that he was shown clips of his character's performance during his site sessions and said, "He loved it." Shawn Keller, supervising animator for Cookie, stated, "It was kind of a sad fact that [Varney] knew that he was not going to be able to see this film before he passed away. He did a bang-up job doing the voice work, knowing the fact that he was never gonna see his last performance."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 10:45–11:31]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corey Burton]] as Gaëtan "Mole" Molière, a French [[geologist]] who acts like a [[mole (animal)|mole]]. Burton mentioned that finding his performance as Mole was by allowing the character to "leap out" of him while making funny voices. To get into character during his recording sessions, he stated that he would "throw myself into the scene and feel like I'm in this make-believe world".&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 6:55–7:10]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Kashekim Nedakh, the King of Atlantis and Kida's father. Michael Cedeno, supervising animator for King Nedakh, was astounded at Nimoy's voice talent, stating that he had "so much rich character" in his performance. As he spoke his lines, Cadeno said the crew would sit there and watch Nimoy in astonishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: The Voices of Atlantis'' at 3:00–3:43]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jennifer Seguin]] as Kashem Nedakh, the Queen of Atlantis and Kida's mother.

The idea for ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' was conceived in October 1996 when [[Don Hahn]], [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]], and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in [[Burbank, California]]. Having recently completed ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''&lt;ref name="Kurtti-9"&gt;[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, p. 9.]]&lt;/ref&gt; the producer and directors wanted to keep the ''Hunchback'' crew together for another film with an [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: History: The Journey Begins'' at 0:08–3:05]]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing inspiration from [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[A Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (1864), they set out to make a film which would fully explore [[Atlantis]] (compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne's novel).&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Story and Editorial: Finding the Story'' at 3:24–3:57]]&lt;/ref&gt; While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis,&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: History: Creating Mythology'' at 0:30–1:10]]&lt;/ref&gt; the filmmakers became interested in the [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] readings of [[Edgar Cayce]] and decided to incorporate some of his ideas—notably that of a mother-crystal which provides power, healing, and longevity to the Atlanteans—into the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: History: Creating Mythology'' at 3:48–4:20]]&lt;/ref&gt; They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century (the film's time period), and traveled 800&amp;nbsp;feet underground in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would serve as a model for the approach to Atlantis in the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Art Direction: Designing Atlantis'' at 5:42–9:18]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers wanted to avoid the common depiction of Atlantis as "crumbled Greek columns underwater", said Wise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Art Direction: Designing Atlantis'' at 9:30–9:33]]&lt;/ref&gt; "From the get-go, we were committed to designing it top to bottom. Let's get the architectural style, clothing, heritage, customs, how they would sleep, and how they would speak. So we brought people on board who would help us develop those ideas."&lt;ref name="FilmJournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000692578|title=Finding ''Atlantis''|first=Peter|last=Henn|date=June 1, 2001|work=[[Film Journal International]]|accessdate=August 30, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116180317/http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000692578|archivedate=January 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art director David Goetz stated, "We looked at [[Mayan architecture]], styles of ancient, unusual architecture from around the world, and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Art Direction: Designing Atlantis'' at 9:50–10:02]]&lt;/ref&gt; The team later took ideas from other architectural forms, including [[Cambodian architecture|Cambodian]], [[Indian architecture|Indian]], and [[Architecture in Tibet|Tibetan]] works.&lt;ref name="Kurtti-55"&gt;[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, p. 55.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hahn added, "If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary, that's what our Atlantis looks like."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Art Direction: Designing Atlantis'' at 10:37–10:44]]&lt;/ref&gt; The overall design and [[concentric circles|circular]] layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of [[Plato]],&lt;ref name="Kurtti-55"/&gt; and his quote "in a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plato|Plato c. 360 BCE]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0180:text=Tim.:section=25c ''Timaeus'', Sections 25c–d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317203053/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Asection%3D25c |date=March 17, 2013 }}.

==== Language ====
[[Image:AtlanteanA.png|thumb|right|alt=A drawing of the Atlantean letter A which is a swirl with a dot in the center.|The Atlantean letter ''A'', created by artist John Emerson. Kirk Wise noted that its design was a treasure map showing the path to the crystal, "The Heart of Atlantis".]]
{{Main|Atlantean language}}
[[Marc Okrand]], who developed the [[Klingon language]] for the ''[[Star Trek]]'' films, was hired to devise the Atlantean language for ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''. Guided by the directors' initial concept for it to be a "[[Proto-language|mother-language]]", Okrand employed an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word stock with its own [[Grammar|grammatical structure]]. He would change the words if they began to sound too much like an actual, spoken language.&lt;ref name="FilmJournal"/&gt; John Emerson designed the written component, making hundreds of random sketches of individual letters from among which the directors chose the best to represent the Atlantean alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: History: Creating Mythology'' at 5:20–5:47]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, p. 40.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The written language was [[boustrophedon]]: designed to be read left-to-right on the first line, then right-to-left on the second, continuing in a zigzag pattern to simulate the flow of water.&lt;ref name="Language"/&gt;

{{quote|text=The Atlantean [A] is a shape developed by John Emerson. It is a miniature map of the city of Atlantis (i.e., the outside of the swirl is the cave, the inside shape is the silhouette of the city, and the dot is the location of the crystal). It's a treasure map.|sign=Kirk Wise, director&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, p. 82.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Writing===
[[Joss Whedon]] was the first writer to be involved with the film but soon left to work on other Disney projects. According to him, he "had not a shred" in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lavery11|Lavery 2011, p. 91.]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tab Murphy]] completed the screenplay, stating that the time from initially discussing the story to producing a script that satisfied the film crew was "about three to four months".&lt;ref name="Writing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID502790-502791.asp|title=An Interview Tab Murphy—''Atlantis'' Screenwriter|work=Theme Park Adventure Magazine|first=Rick|last=West|date=June 14, 2001|publisher=LaughingPlace.com|accessdate=September 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116183959/http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID502790-502791.asp|archivedate=January 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial draft was 155 pages, much longer than a typical Disney film script (which usually runs 90 pages). When the first two acts were timed at 120 minutes, the directors cut characters and sequences and focused more on Milo. Murphy said that he created the centuries-old ''Shepherd's Journal'' because he needed a map for the characters to follow throughout their journey.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: History: Creating Mythology'' at 5:58–6:18]]&lt;/ref&gt; A revised version of the script eliminated the trials encountered by the explorers as they navigated the underground caves to Atlantis. This gave the film a faster pace because Atlantis is discovered earlier in the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Story and Editorial: Finding the Story'' at 3:58–7:40]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=The directors often described the Atlanteans using [[Egypt]] as an example. When [[Napoleon]] wandered into Egypt, the people had lost track of their once-great civilization. They were surrounded by artifacts of their former greatness but somehow unaware of what they meant.|source= —Don Hahn, producer&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, p. 50.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The character of Milo J. Thatch was originally supposed to be a descendant of Edward Teach, otherwise known as [[Blackbeard]] the pirate. The directors later related him to an explorer so he would discover his inner talent for exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Story and Editorial: Finding the Story'' at 2:55–3:24]]&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Molière was originally intended to be "professorial" but Chris Ure, a story artist, changed the concept to that of a "horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs", said Wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/The-Disney-Industrial-Complex-and-Atlantis-The-Lost-Empire|title=The Disney Industrial Complex and ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|last=Messier|first=Max|date=June 12, 2001 |work=FilmCritic.com|publisher=[[AMC Networks|AMC]]|accessdate=September 1, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310214029/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/95a45e26914c25ff862562bb006a85f2/dd49aab98adead3a88256a69005c9fe2?OpenDocument|archivedate=March 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD1|''Audio Commentary'' at 17:12–18.00]]&lt;/ref&gt; Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals, as solely action scenes would have to carry the film. Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on-screen character development: "We had more screen time available to do a scene like where Milo and the explorers are camping out and learning about one another's histories. An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed. That is not typically something we would have the luxury of doing."&lt;ref name="FilmJournal"/&gt;

Hahn stated that the first animated sequence completed during production was the film's [[prologue]]. The original version featured a [[Viking]] war party using ''The Shepherd's Journal'' to find Atlantis and being swiftly dispatched by the Leviathan. Near the end of production, story supervisor Jon Sanford told the directors that he felt this prologue did not give viewers enough emotional involvement with the Atlanteans. Despite knowing that the Viking prologue was finished and it would cost additional time and money to alter the scene, the directors agreed with Sanford. Trousdale went home and completed the [[storyboards]] later that evening. The opening was replaced by a sequence depicting the destruction of Atlantis, which introduced the film from the perspective of the Atlanteans and Princess Kida.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Story and Editorial: Finding the Story'' at 7:40–10:25]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Viking prologue is included as an extra feature on the [[Atlantis: The Lost Empire#Home media|DVD release]].&lt;ref name="Story2"&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Story and Editorial: Four Deleted Scenes—"The Viking Prologue"']]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animation===

At the peak of its production, 350 animators, artists and technicians were working on ''Atlantis''&lt;ref name="Raugust 2004"&gt;[[#Raugust04|Raugust 2004, n.p.]]&lt;/ref&gt; at all three Disney animation studios: [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] ([[Burbank, California]]), [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Disney Feature Animation Florida]] ([[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]), and [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Disney Animation France|Disney Animation France]] (Paris).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-06-15/entertainment/0106140377_1_atlantis-explorers-ordnance-museum|title=The Art of ''Atlantis'' Doesn't Just Imitate Life, It Goes It One Better|first=Roger|last=Moore|date=June 15, 2001|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=August 9, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116201606/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-06-15/entertainment/0106140377_1_atlantis-explorers-ordnance-museum|archivedate=January 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was one of the few Disney animated features produced and shot in [[70 mm film|70mm]] [[anamorphic format]]. The directors felt that a widescreen image was crucial, as a nostalgic reference to old action-adventure films presented in the [[CinemaScope]] format (2.35:1), noting ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' as an inspiration.&lt;ref name="Widescreen" /&gt; Because switching to the format would require animation desks and equipment designed for widescreen to be purchased, Disney executives were at first reluctant about the idea.&lt;ref name="FilmJournal"/&gt;  The production team found a simple solution by drawing within a smaller frame on the same paper and equipment used for standard [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] (1.66:1) Disney-animated films.&lt;ref name="Widescreen"&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: Setting the Scene'' at 1:10–2:28]]&lt;/ref&gt; Layout supervisor Ed Ghertner wrote a guide to the widescreen format for use by the layout artists and mentioned that one advantage of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer because of additional space to walk within the frame.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: Setting the Scene'' at 2:30–3:17]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wise drew further inspiration for the format from filmmakers [[David Lean]] and [[Akira Kurosawa]].&lt;ref name="FilmJournal"/&gt;

The film's visual style was strongly based upon that of [[Mike Mignola]], the comic book artist behind ''[[Hellboy]]''. Mignola was one of four production designers (along with Matt Codd, Jim Martin, and [[Ricardo Delgado (comics)|Ricardo Delgado]]) hired by the Disney studio for the film. Accordingly, he provided style guides, preliminary character and background designs, and story ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Art Direction: Designing Atlantis'' at 0:50–4:33]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Mignola's graphic, angular style was a key influence on the 'look' of the characters," stated Wise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kurtti01|Kurtti 2001, ap. 27.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mignola was surprised when first contacted by the studio to work on ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref name="Mignola" /&gt; His artistic influence on the film would later contribute to a [[cult following]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/disneys-best-movies-animated-features/|title=Disney's 50 Finest: In Order of Awesome|first=Scott|last=Harris|date=November 29, 2010|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=January 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101113344/http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/disneys-best-movies-animated-features/|archivedate=January 1, 2011|quote=On the other hand, the movie does feature a great cast, including Michael J.

The final pull-out scene of the movie, immediately before the end-title card, was described by the directors as the most difficult scene in the history of Disney animation. They said that the pullout attempt on their prior film, ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'', "struggled" and "lacked depth"; however, after making advances in the process of [[Multiplane camera|multiplaning]], they tried the technique again in ''Atlantis''. The scene begins with one 16-inch (40.5&amp;nbsp;cm) piece of paper showing a close-up of Milo and Kida. As the camera pulls away from them to reveal the newly restored Atlantis, it reaches the equivalent of an 18,000-inch (45,720&amp;nbsp;cm) piece of paper composed of many individual pieces of paper (24&amp;nbsp;inches [61&amp;nbsp;cm] or smaller). Each piece was carefully drawn and combined with animated vehicles simultaneously flying across the scene to make the viewer see a complete, integrated image.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Animation Production: Setting the Scene'' at 9:44–11:26]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its release, ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' was notable for using more [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) than any other Disney traditionally animated feature. To increase productivity, the directors had the digital artists work with the [[traditional animation|traditional animators]] throughout the production. Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation: the Leviathan, the ''Ulysses'' submarine and sub-pods, the Heart of Atlantis, and the Stone Giants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Digital Production'' at 0:09–4:45]]&lt;/ref&gt; During production, after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the ''Ulysses'' on paper, Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine, to be used as a reference for drawing the 3D ''Ulysses''.&lt;ref name="SubModel"/&gt; The final film included 362 digital-effects shots, and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the 2D and 3D artwork.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/enter/movies/2001-06-07-atlantis.htm|title=Disney Domain Is Under Siege|first=Susan|last=Wloszczyna|date=June 14, 2001|work=USA Today|accessdate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010810032020/http://www.usatoday.com/life/enter/movies/2001-06-07-atlantis.htm|archivedate=August 10, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scene that took advantage of this was the "sub-drop" scene, where the 3D ''Ulysses'' was dropped from its docking bay into the water. As the camera floated toward it, a 2D Milo was drawn to appear inside, tracking the camera. The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the 2D and 3D drawings when they were merged.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Digital Production'' at 8:15–9:33]]&lt;/ref&gt; The digital production also gave the directors a unique "[[virtual camera]]" for complicated shots within the film. With the ability to operate in the z-plane, this camera moved through a digital [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame set]]; the background and details were later hand-drawn over the wire frames. This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Digital Production'' at 5:00–6:20]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and sound===
Since the film would not feature any songs, the directors hired [[James Newton Howard]] to compose the [[Film score|score]]. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard decided to have different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an [[Gamelan|Indonesian orchestral sound]] incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would have a number of key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Music and Sound'' at 5:00–8:45]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Rydstrom]] and his team at [[Skywalker Sound]] were hired for the film's [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound production]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD1|''Audio Commentary'' at 1:50–2:10]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Howard, Rydstrom employed different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, he felt that the Atlanteans should have a "more organic" sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-truck]] drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the [[harmonic]] chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a [[Oral irrigator|water pick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: Music and Sound'' at 0:05–4:48]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Promotion===
''Atlantis'' was among Disney's first major attempts to utilize [[internet marketing]]. The film was promoted through [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], which created a website with mini-games and a movie-based video game give-away for UPC labels from specially marked packages of ''Atlantis'' breakfast cereal.&lt;ref name="Raugust 2004"/&gt; The film was one of Disney's first marketing attempts through [[mobile network operator]]s, and allowed users to download games based on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinbock |first=Dan|title=The Mobile Revolution: The Making of Mobile Services Worldwide|year=2007|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=|isbn=978-0-7494-4850-9|pages=158, 304|ref=Steinbock07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] (which had an exclusive licensing agreement on all Disney releases) promoted the film with [[Happy Meal]] toys, food packaging and in-store decor.

===Box office===
Before the film's release, reporters speculated that it would have a difficult run due to competition from [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]]' ''[[Shrek]]'' (a wholly CGI feature) and ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (an action-adventure film from [[Paramount Pictures]]). Regarding the market's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films, Kirk Wise said, "Any traditional animator, including myself, can't help but feel a twinge.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 49% of 141 professional critics have given ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' a positive review; the average rating is 5.5/10.&lt;ref name="RotTom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlantis_the_lost_empire/|title=''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's consensus is: "''Atlantis'' provides a fast-paced spectacle, but stints on such things as character development and a coherent plot".&lt;ref name="RotTom"/&gt; [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 29 reviews from mainstream critics; this was considered "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/atlantis-the-lost-empire|title=''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=July 3, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424141313/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/atlantis-the-lost-empire|archivedate=April 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinema-goers gave ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' was an "A" on an A+-to-F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=717 |title=Box Office Analysis: ''Lara Croft'' Raids the Box Office |last=Drysdale |first=Rob |date=June 19, 2001 |publisher=The Trades |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |quote=Not surprisingly ''Atlantis'' scored a very nice set of A's from both men and women under 21 as well as men and women age 21 to 34. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309071540/http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=717 |archivedate=March 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While critics had mixed reactions to the film in general, some praised it for its visuals, action-adventure elements, and its attempt to appeal to an older audience. [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''Atlantis'' three-and-half stars out of four. He praised the animation's "clean bright visual look" and the "classic energy of the comic book style", crediting this to the work of Mike Mignola. Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote, "The story of ''Atlantis'' is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way, but the climactic scene transcends the rest, and stands by itself as one of the great animated action sequences."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010615/REVIEWS/106150301/1023|title=''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|first=Roger|last=Ebert|date=June 15, 2001|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=August 13, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605233148/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20010615%2FREVIEWS%2F106150301%2F1023|archivedate=June 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}} {{Rating|3.5|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Elvis Mitchell]] gave high praise to the film, calling it "a monumental treat", and stated, "''Atlantis'' is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9404E6DB1F3FF93BA35755C0A9679C8B63|title=''Atlantis: the Lost Empire'' (2001) FILM REVIEW; Under the Sea, Damp Hakuna Matata|first=Elvis|last=Mitchell|date=June 8, 2001|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}{{Rating|4|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet film critic [[James Berardinelli]] wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars. He wrote, "On the whole, ''Atlantis'' offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment, once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies, they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/atlantis.html|title=''Atlantis'' Review|last=Berardinelli|first=James|date=June 2001|publisher=ReelViews.net|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}{{Rating|3|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wesley Morris]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote positively of the film's approach for an older audience: "But just beneath the surface, ''Atlantis'' brims with adult possibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/15/DD217251.DTL|title=''Atlantis'' Is a Find, Disney Emphasizes Adventure over Cuteness, Romance and Song|first=Wesley|last=Morris|date=June 15, 2001|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=August 13, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210195313/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2001%2F06%2F15%2FDD217251.DTL|archivedate=February 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}{{Rating|3|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics felt that the film was mediocre in regards to its story and characters, and that it failed to deliver as a non-musical to Disney's traditional audience. [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the film a C+ rating, writing that the film had "gee-whiz formulaic character" and was "the essence of craft without dream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,129378~1~0~atlantislostempire,00.html |title=''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |date=June 6, 2001 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527035031/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C129378~1~0~atlantislostempire%2C00.html |archivedate=May 27, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the storyline and characterizations were "old-fashioned" and the film had the retrograde look of a Saturday-morning cartoon, but these deficiencies were offset by its "brisk action" and frantic pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/08/entertainment/ca-7799|title=''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|first=Kenneth|last=Turan|date=July 8, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234428/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/08/entertainment/ca-7799|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}{{Rating|3.5|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Disney pushes into all-talking, no-singing, no-dancing and, in the end, no-fun animated territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117798244?refcatid=31|title=''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|date=June 7, 2001|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108151325/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117798244?refcatid=31|archivedate=November 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Zacharek of ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' wrote of Disney's attempt to make the film for an adult audience, "The big problem with Disney's latest animated feature, ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'', is that it doesn't seem geared to kids at all: It's so adult that it's massively boring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/06/15/atlantis/|title=''Atlantis''—Disney's finally made a cartoon for grown-ups.

===Themes and interpretations===
Several critics and scholars have noted that ''Atlantis'' plays strongly on themes of [[anti-capitalism]] and [[anti-imperialism]]. M. Keith Booker, academic and author of studies about the implicit messages conveyed by media, views the character of Rourke as being motivated by "capitalist greed" when he pursues "his own financial gain" in spite of the knowledge that "his theft [of the crystal] will lead to the destruction of [Atlantis]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Booker09|Booker 2009, p. 68.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Religion journalist Mark Pinsky, in his exploration of moral and spiritual themes in popular Disney films, says that "it is impossible to read the movie ... any other way" than as "a devastating, unrelenting attack on capitalism and [[American imperialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pinsky04|Pinsky 2004, p. 202.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Max Messier of [[AMC Networks|FilmCritic.com]] observes, "Disney even manages to lambast the capitalist lifestyle of the adventurers intent on uncovering the lost city. Damn the imperialists!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/2001/atlantis-the-lost-empire/ |title=''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' |first=Max |last=Messier |date=June 12, 2001 |work=FilmCritic.com |publisher=[[AMC Networks]] |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206131254/http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/2001/atlantis-the-lost-empire/ |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Booker, the film also "delivers a rather [[segregationist]] moral" by concluding with the discovery of the Atlanteans kept secret from other surface-dwellers in order to maintain a separation between the two highly divergent cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Booker09|Booker 2009, p. 69.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Others saw ''Atlantis'' as an interesting look at [[utopia]]n philosophy of the sort found in classic works of science fiction by [[H. G. Wells]] and Jules Verne.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Montalbano10|Montalbano 2010, p. 183.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the film was released, some viewers noticed that ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' bore a number of similarities to the 1990–1991 Japanese anime television program ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]'' and the 1986 film ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' from [[Studio Ghibli]], particularly in its character design, setting, and story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2001-05-15|title=Probing the ''Atlantis'' Mystery|first=Lee|last=Zion|date=May 15, 2001|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629004303/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2001-05-15|archivedate=June 29, 2011|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Disney never responded formally to claims of [[plagiarism]], co-director Kirk Wise posted on a Disney animation [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]] in May 2001, "Never heard of ''Nadia'' till it was mentioned in this [newsgroup]. Long after we'd finished production, I might add."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Patten04|Patten 2004, p. 187.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Atlantis'' and ''Nadia'' were inspired, in part, by the 1870 Jules Verne novel ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', of which Lee Zion (reporting for [[Anime News Network]]) wrote, "There are too many similarities ''not'' connected with ''20,000 Leagues'' for the whole thing to be coincidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2001-07-19|title=''Nadia'' vs. ''Atlantis'', Revisited!|first=Lee|last=Zion|date=July 19, 2001|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629004315/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2001-07-19|archivedate=June 29, 2011|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also saw parallels with the 1994 film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. Milo's characteristics were said to resemble those of [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]], the protagonist of ''Stargate'' and its spinoff television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''—which coincidentally launched its own spinoff, titled ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/opinion/columns/gatewatch/review_atlantis_the_lost_e.shtml|title=Review: ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|first=Darren|last=Sumner|publisher=Gateworld|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723134310/http://www.gateworld.net/opinion/columns/gatewatch/review_atlantis_the_lost_e.shtml|archivedate=July 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=July 15, 2012|quote=In 1994, Dr. Daniel Jackson decoded an ancient language and unlocked the secrets of the Stargate, sending him and a military unit across the universe to a lost colony of humans.

''Atlantis: the Lost Empire'' was meant to provide a springboard for an animated television series entitled ''Team Atlantis'', which would have presented the further adventures of its characters. However, because of the film's under-performance at the box office, the series was not produced. On May 20, 2003, Disney released a [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[Atlantis: Milo's Return]]'', consisting of three episodes planned for the aborted series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/atlantis2.php |title=Atlantis: Milo's Return |first=Michael |last=Rankins |date=July 31, 2003 |publisher=[[DVD Verdict]] |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822064947/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/atlantis2.php |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Disneyland]] planned to revive its [[Submarine Voyage]] ride with an ''Atlantis'' theme with elements from the movie and the ride was promoted with a meet-and-greet by the movie's characters. These plans were canceled and the attraction was re-opened in 2007 as the [[Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage]], its theme based on the 2003 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]·[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-trw-nemo11jun11,0,841709,full.story|title=Disney Brings Submarine Ride Back from the Depths|first=Kimi|last=Yoshino|date=June 11, 2007|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=July 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105202736/http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-trw-nemo11jun11,0,841709,full.story|archivedate=November 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
{{main|Atlantis: The Lost Empire (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack to ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire'' was released on May 22, 2001. It consists primarily of James Newton Howard's score and includes "[[Where the Dream Takes You]]", written by Howard and [[Diane Warren]] and performed by [[Mýa]]. It was also available in a limited edition of 20,000 numbered copies with a unique [[Lenticular printing|3D album cover]] insert depicting the Leviathan from the film. A rare promotional edition (featuring 73 minutes of material, compared to the 53 minutes on standard commercial editions) was intended only for [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] voters but was [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] and distributed with fan-created artwork. Concerning the promotional edition, [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] said, "Outside of about five minutes of superior additional material (including the massive opening, "Atlantis Destroyed"), the complete presentation is mostly redundant. Still, ''Atlantis'' is an accomplished work for its genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/atlantis.html|title=Filmtracks: ''Atlantis: The Lost Empire''|date=May 21, 2001|publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]]|accessdate=August 8, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710121111/http://filmtracks.com/titles/atlantis.html|archivedate=July 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}{{Rating|4|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaumont, ''A French-English Dictionary of Technical Terms Used in Classical Ballet'' (London: Beaumont, 1959), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical in the [[Romantic ballet|Romantic style]] of ballet from the nineteenth century, ''ballets blancs'' are usually populated by ghosts, dryads, naiads, enchanted maidens, fairies, and other supernatural creatures and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Guest, ''The Romantic Ballet in Paris'' (Alton, Hampshire: Dance Books, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A precursor of the genre was ''[[Ballet of the Nuns]]'', an episode in act 3 of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera ''Robert le Diable''. The ghosts of cloistered nuns who, in life, were unfaithful to their vows are summoned from their graves to tempt the hero, Robert, with dancing, gambling, drink, and love making.&lt;ref&gt;"Robert le Diable," in ''The New Kobbé Opera Book'', 11th ed., edited by the Earl of Harewood and Antony Pettie (New York: Putnam's, 2000), p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; Choreographed by [[Filippo Taglioni]] and first presented in Paris in November 1831, it starred his daughter, [[Marie Taglioni]], as Helena, the abbess of the ruined convent of Saint Rosalia. Costumes in modern productions are usually white dresses with black sashes and headpieces.

The next year, 1832, Marie Taglioni appeared in the title role of ''[[La Sylphide]]'', the story of a wood nymph (a sylphide) who tempts a Scottish farmer, James, to abandon his rural sweetheart and follow her into the woods, in pursuit of ethereal beauty. Dance historians consider this work, as the first fully-fledged ''ballet blanc'', to be the beginning of the Romantic movement in ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Koegler, "Sylphide, La," in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet'', 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the genre is derived from the white costume designed by Eugène Lami for Taglioni, which became the recognized dress for dancers of the academic school. The [[ballerina skirt|skirt]] of the Romantic [[tutu (clothing)|tutu]] is either mid-calf or ankle length in design.&lt;ref&gt;A knee-length "bell tutu" was often depicted by [[Edgar Degas]] in his paintings of Parisian ballet dancers of the 1870s. See Richard Kendall, ''Degas Dancers'' (New York: Universe/Vendome, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the introduction of Romantic elements of otherworldly spirits, the dancing in ''La Sylphide'' was of the purely classical school.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, ''A French-English Dictionary'' (1959), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghosts, shades, shadows, spirits, and other elemental beings dominated ballet stages for decades after ''La Sylphide''. Famous ''ballets blancs'' were staged in act 2 of ''[[Giselle]]'' (1842), in acts 2 and 4 of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (1877/1895), in act 2 of ''[[La Bayadère]]'' (1877), and in act 1 of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' (1892). In modern productions, dancers in the lakeside scenes of ''Swan Lake'' and the Kingdom of the Shades scene of ''La Bayadère'' sometimes wear short, classical tutus rather than the traditional calf-length or ankle-length ballet dresses, but the visually stunning effect of the ''ballet blanc'' is undiminished. In 1908, [[Michel Fokine]] revived the genre in a ballet set to the music of Frédéric Chopin that he entitled ''Chopiniana''. When a revised version was presented in Paris in 1909 by the Ballets Russes of [[Sergei Diaghilev]], it was given the more Romantic title of ''[[Les Sylphides]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Balanchine and Francis Mason, ''101 Stories of the Great Ballets'' (New York: Doubleday, 1954), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained a popular staple of the ballet repertory for the past century and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11084">A '''biological target''' is anything within a living organism to which some other entity (like an endogenous [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] or a [[drug]]) is directed and/or binds, resulting in a change in its behavior or function. Examples of common classes of biological targets are [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s. The definition is context-dependent, and can refer to the biological target of a  [[pharmacological activity|pharmacologically active]] [[drug]] [[Chemical compound|compound]], the receptor target of a [[hormone]] (like [[insulin]]), or some other target of an external stimulus.  Biological targets are most commonly proteins such as [[enzyme]]s, [[ion channel]]s, and [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s.

== Mechanism ==
The external stimulus (''i.e.'', the drug or ligand) physically binds to ("hits") the biological target.&lt;ref name="pmid2536880"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raffa RB, Porreca F | title = Thermodynamic analysis of the drug-receptor interaction | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–58 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2536880 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(89)90182-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7939660"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moy VT, Florin EL, Gaub HE | title = Intermolecular forces and energies between ligands and receptors | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5183 | pages = 257–9 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7939660 | doi = 10.1126/science.7939660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between the substance and the target may be:
* [[noncovalent bonding|noncovalent]] – A relatively weak interaction between the stimulus and the target where no chemical bond is formed between the two interacting partners and hence the interaction is completely reversible.
* reversible [[covalent bond|covalent]] – A chemical reaction occurs between the stimulus and target in which the stimulus becomes chemically bonded to the target, but the reverse reaction also readily occurs in which the bond can be broken.
* irreversible covalent – The stimulus is permanently bound to the target through irreversible chemical bond formation.

Depending on the nature of the stimulus, the following can occur:&lt;ref name = "Rang_Dale_2012_Chp_3"&gt;{{Cite book  |vauthors=Rang HP, Dale MM, Ritter JM, Flower RJ, Henderson G | title = Rang and Dale's Pharmacology | date = 2012 | publisher = Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone | location = Edinburgh; New York | isbn = 0-7020-3471-1 | chapter = Chapter 3: How drugs act: molecular aspects | pages = 20–48 | chapterurl =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no direct change in the biological target, but the binding of the substance prevents other [[endogenous#Biology|endogenous]] substances (such as activating hormones) from binding to the target.  Depending on the nature of the target, this effect is referred as [[receptor antagonist|receptor antagonism]], [[enzyme inhibitor|enzyme inhibition]], or [[channel blockers|ion channel blockade]].
* A [[protein structure|conformational]] change in the target is induced by the stimulus which results in a change in target function.  This change in function can mimic the effect of the endogenous substance in which case the effect is referred to as [[agonist|receptor agonism]] (or channel or [[enzyme activator|enzyme activation]]) or be the opposite of the endogenous substance which in the case of receptors is referred to as [[inverse agonist|inverse agonism]].

== Drug targets ==
The term "biological target" is frequently used in [[pharmaceutical]] research to describe the native protein in the body whose activity is modified by a drug resulting in a specific effect, which may be a desirable [[therapeutic effect]] or an unwanted [[adverse effect]].  In this context, the biological target is often referred to as a '''drug target'''. The most common drug targets of currently marketed drugs include:&lt;ref name = "Rang_Dale_2012_Chp_2"&gt;{{Cite book  |vauthors=Rang HP, Dale MM, Ritter JM, Flower RJ, Henderson G | title = Rang and Dale's Pharmacology | date = 2012 | publisher = Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone | location = Edinburgh; New York | isbn = 0-7020-3471-1 | chapter = Chapter 2: How drugs act: general principles | pages = 6–19 | chapterurl = http://www.inkling.com/read/rang-dale-pharmacology-ritter-flower-henderson-7th/chapter-2/protein-targets-for-drug-binding }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17139284"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Overington JP, Al-Lazikani B, Hopkins AL | title = How many drug targets are there? | journal = Nature Reviews.

== Drug target identification ==

Identifying the biological origin of a disease, and the potential targets for intervention, is the first step in the discovery of a medicine using the [[reverse pharmacology]] approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9191">{{about|a demonym for the Bengalis of [[West Bengal]]||Bong (disambiguation)}}

'''Bong''' is a [[neologism]] that originated in cosmopolitan India in the 1980s as a slightly pejorative [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] for the educated middle-class Bengalis from the Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. In the 21st century, the term became a self-appellation of pride through the use of satire and self-reflexive irony by the Bengali blogging community, which came to stand for the [[Bengali Hindus|Bengali Hindu people]] as a whole. Bong has been noted as a word of [[Indian English]], used in the Indian newspapers.

== Origin ==
The usage of Bong as an ethnic quip has been noted in the [[India Today]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ethnic-quips-become-popular-as-indians-learn-to-make-fun-of-themselves/1/323834.html|title=Indiana jokes|last1=Rajghatta|first1=Chidan|last2=Tripathi|first2=Salil|date=31 August 1989|work=India Today|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Prasanta Roy has noted that the word was used in [[New Delhi]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1071028/asp/calcutta/story_8479891.asp|title=The dinner Bong|last1=Banerjee|first1=Malini|last2=Kohli|first2=Diya|date=28 October 2007|work=The Telegraph|publisher=ABP Group|accessdate=4 February 2017|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to lexicographer Ashoke Mukhopadhyay, Bong is a distortion of the word Bengali that originated among the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRIs]].&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; Writer [[Nabarun Bhattacharya]] believed that the term originated either in the [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]] or some other pan-Indian educational institutes.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; According to a 1999 report in [[The Indian Express]], the gradual extinction of Bengali language and culture and the growing cosmopolitanism in Kolkata have resulted in Bengalis called Bongs by the non-Bengalis.&lt;ref name="ie01071999"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/Storyold/106923/|title=Bongs? No, we're Bengalis from Kolkata|last=Chakrabarti|first=Ashis|date=1 July 1999|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to blogger [[Arnab Ray]], the Bengalis were traditionally reluctant to leave [[West Bengal]] for livelihood. However, in the 1980s, the political scenario changed in West Bengal and the Bengalis were forced to leave the state in search of better career options. This led to the development of Bong identity, which is characterized by their emotional attachment towards [[West Bengal]] and at the same time well integrated with the cosmopolitan environment of [[India]] and abroad.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt;

== Usage ==
Lexicographer Ashoke Mukhopadhyay believes that the term is slightly pejorative. It has a similar pejorative term as the Hindi term 'Bongali babu' (literally meaning educated Bengali gentleman).&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; According to sociologist Prasanta Roy, the term conveys hostility, prejudice, political and intellectual dislike.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; [[Nabarun Bhattacharya]] believed that the term was used to tease the Bengalis, who themselves harboured chauvinistic attitude towards others.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; According to the 1999 report in [[The Indian Express]], the Bengalis disliked the term.&lt;ref name="ie01071999"/&gt;

In the 21st century, the use of Bong has gained currency among the young generation of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref name="purkayastha"&gt;{{cite book|last=Purkayastha|first=Prarthana|title=Indian Modern Dance, Feminism and Transnationalism|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MMKpBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=4 February 2017|date=29 October 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn= 9781137375179|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengali bloggers re-invented their social identity as Bongs.&lt;ref name="sarkar2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Sucharita|title=Blogging across Borders – Memories, Recipes and Identity in the Diaspora|url=https://www.academia.edu/5108171/Blogging_Across_Borders_Memories_Recipes_and_Identity_in_the_Diaspora|accessdate=4 February 2017|series=Problematics on Ethnicity, Identity and Literature|volume=Pre-Conference Proceeding Volume|year=2012|publisher=SPS Education|isbn=978-81-924140-5-8|pages=851–858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through satire they have turned the derisive term as a marker of their own ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="sarkar2012"/&gt; Filmmaker [[Anjan Dutt]] believes that Bengalis are okay with calling themselves Bongs.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; He used the term Bong instead of Bengali for the title of his 2006 film [[The Bong Connection]] because it was something that can be used with jest just like [[Yankee|Yank]]. According to him terms like Bong or Yank stand for certain quirks and attributes of the person coming from a particular region.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; According to [[New Delhi]]-based writer Samit Basu, the people who identify themselves as Bong should fight against the age-old stereotypes of the Bengalis.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; Bengalis had become proud to be known as Bong, as it was no longer an offensive parochial label.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt;

Bong is generally perceived to stand for the global cosmopolitan Bengali.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; Blogger [[Arnab Ray]] believes that Bong stands for the globalized Bengali.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; According to a Bengali civil servant who blogs as Sadoldbong, Bong stands for the Bengali in exile.&lt;ref name="sarkar2012"/&gt; However, according to [[Anjan Dutt]], there is no cultural or generation gap between the Bong and the Bengali identity.Blogger Sandeepa Mukherjee Datta who blogs as Bong Mom in Bong Mom's Cook Book describes Bong as an identity limited to the Bengali people of West Bengal.&lt;ref name="sarkar2012"/&gt; Durga Puja has been described as a Bong festival.&lt;ref name="tt28102007"/&gt; The prohibition on eating the seasonal [[Ziziphus mauritiana|Indian plum]] before the [[Saraswati Puja]] has been referred to as Bong cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maamatimanush.tv/articles.php?aid=1125|title=Saraswati Puja – The Bengali tradition|last=Niyogi|first=Agnivo|date=13 February 2016|work=Maa Mati Manush|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stereotypes ==
The Bengali Hindus as Bongs are often stereotyped especially in [[Bollywood]] and the [[Internet]]. A popular Internet joke goes like this. One Bengali is a poet, two Bengalis are a film society, three Bengalis are a political party and four Bengalis are two political parties!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaudhuri|first=Diptakirti|title=Kitnay Aadmi Thay|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CeVeKRFzEt0C|accessdate=1 August 2017|year=2012|publisher=Westland|isbn=9789381626191}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common stereotype is that Bongs are invariably fish eaters and often referred to as ''Machher Jhol'', literally meaning fish curry in [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToPrint_EDU&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=TOIM/2012/06/11&amp;ID=Ar02102|title=Stereotyping could now mean a jail term!|last=D'Costa|first=Melissa|date=11 June 2012|work=The Times of India|publisher=Benett Coleman &amp; Co.|accessdate=1 August 2017|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''competent authority''' is any [[person]] or [[organization]] that has the legally delegated or invested authority, capacity, or power to perform a designated function. Similarly, once an authority is delegated to perform a certain act, only the competent authority is entitled to take accounts therefrom and no one else.

'''Borrowing authority '''when the services of a certain [[Class (social)|class]] of individuals are entrusted to one of the authority other than the appointing authority, the former will be the borrowing authority.
Borrowing Authority will be authorised to look into the performance of individuals with respect to the task so assigned to them.

'''Borrowing authority''', '''service conduct'''
when it appears to the borrowing authority the conduct of the individuals not in accordance with the standard prescribed, it will move in writing to the appointing authority the conduct so observed with the evidence so brought on record for proceedings therein.

'''Appointing authority''', however, is not [[Competence (law)|competent]] to proceed against the individual without such sort of complaint in writing by the authority which delegated the task. Such proceedings if so initiated without any formal complaint will be ''[[coram non judice]]''.

Based on the [[Basel Convention]], it is any national [[Government agency|agency]] responsible under its [[national law]] for the control or regulation of a particular aspect of the transportation of hazardous materials (dangerous goods). The term ''appropriate authority'', as used in the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) Technical Instructions, has the same meaning as competent authority.

'''Echo complement''' is a syntactic constituent that has either an [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] or a [[Metonymy|metonymic]] relation with another constituent in the same sentence.

==Definition==
The term seems to have been first used by Guillet and Leclère (1981, pp.&amp;nbsp;116–117),&lt;ref&gt;GUILLET, A. AND LECLÈRE, C. 1981. Restructuration du groupe nominal. Langages 63, 99–125.&lt;/ref&gt; in the setting of the operation of ''NP restructuring'', that is, a transformation linking the sentence types: ''N1 of N2 V'' = ''N2 V Prep N1'', e.g. ‘The style/architecture of this house is very impressive’ = ‘This house is very impressive by/for its style/architecture’. 
The concept implies that the notion of ''appropriation'' (Harris 1976:113-115)&lt;ref&gt;HARRIS, Z. S. 1991. A Theory of Language and Information. A Mathematical Approach. Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; between N1 (v.g. ‘style/architecture’), on one hand, and N2 as argument of V (v.g.) ‘house’ and ‘(be) impressive’, on the other hand, which results from the metonymy between N1 and N2.

Though briefly noted, the term was then used to designate a type of [[preposition]]al complement that renders more “precise” while recovering, at least partially, the meaning of the utterance (our translation). Even then, the authors considered the notion could be extended to other types of prepositional complements such as: 
- ''moi-même'' ‘myself’ in ''J’ai fait ça (de/par) moi-même'' ‘I have done this myself’, where a redundant reflexive pronoun reinstates the subject NP; or
- in ''J’ai un apartment à moi'' ‘I have my own apartment/I have an apartment of my own’, where a redundant/emphatic oblique pronoun (in French) recovers both the subject NP and the possession relation of avoir ‘to have’. The same term and analysis are more recently retaken by Laporte (2004).&lt;ref&gt;LAPORTE, É . 2004. Restructuration and the subject of adjectives. Linguisticae Investigationes Supplementa Series, vol. Syntax, Lexis and Lexicon-Grammar. Papers in honour of Maurice Gross. John Benjamins Publishing Co., Amsterdam/Philadelphia, 373–388.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another work (Guillet and Leclère 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;109),&lt;ref&gt;GUILLET, A. AND LECLÈRE, C. 1992. La structure des phrases simples en français: 2-Les constructions transitives locatives. Droz, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; the authors use the term in yet another syntactic setting, v.g. ''mettre du beurre sur'' = ''beurrer'' ‘to put butter over/on = to butter’, where ''mettre'' 'put' is analysed as a support-verb. This relation, however, could correspond to the ''Fusion'' operation.&lt;ref&gt;GROSS, M. 1981. Les bases empiriques de la notion de prédicat sémantique. Langages 63, 7–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical considerations apart, the relevant observation is that the verbal sentence allows a prepositional complement with the noun whence the verb is derived (V-n). This complements usually zeroed unless it is given a specifying modifier, e.g. ''Max beurre sa tar tine de de beurre (salé/de ferme)'' ‘Max buttered his toast with salted/farm butter’.

==Use in Portuguese==
The term has been adopted for Portuguese by Baptista (2005b, pp.&amp;nbsp;157–162),&lt;ref&gt;BAPTISTA, J. 2005b. Sintaxe dos Nomes Predicativos com verbo-suporte SER DE. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisboa.&lt;/ref&gt; to name apparently facultative human complements introduced by compound preposition ''para com'' ‘towards’ (lit:‘for with’), in support verb constructions, e.g. ''O gesto do Pedro para com o João foi de uma grande delicadeza'' = ''O gesto do Pedro foi de uma grande delicadeza para com o João'' ‘Peter’s gesture towards John was of great delicacy = Peter’s gesture was of great delicacy towards John’. 
Nevertheless, in the same work (Baptista 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;165),&lt;ref&gt;BAPTISTA, J. 2005b. Sintaxe dos Nomes Predicativos com verbo-suporte SER DE. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisboa.&lt;/ref&gt; when referring to the distinction between symmetrical and reciprocal constructions, calls the type of complement here addressed, ''pronominal copy''.

==Other uses==
While other authors, namely Guillet and Leclère (1992),&lt;ref&gt;GUILLET, A. AND LECLÈRE, C. 1992. La structure des phrases simples en français: 2-Les constructions transitives locatives. Droz, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Laporte (2004),&lt;ref&gt;LAPORTE, É . 2004. Restructuration and the subject of adjectives. Linguisticae Investigationes Supplementa Series, vol. Syntax, Lexis and Lexicon-Grammar. Papers in honour of Maurice Gross. John Benjamins Publishing Co., Amsterdam/Philadelphia, 373–388.&lt;/ref&gt; and Baptista (2005a,b),&lt;ref&gt;BAPTISTA, J. 2005a. Construções simétricas: argumentos e complementos. In Estudos de homenagem a Mário Vilela, O.Figueiredo, G.Rio-Torto, and F.Silva, Eds.Fac.Letras-U. Porto, pp. 353–367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BAPTISTA, J. 2005b. Sintaxe dos Nomes Predicativos com verbo-suporte SER DE. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisboa.&lt;/ref&gt; may have used the term ''echo complement'' to describe different linguistic phenomena, and apparently have not used it for the specific type of complement here addressed, the term could fit the first definition provided by Guillet and Leclère (1981, pp.&amp;nbsp;116–117).&lt;ref&gt;GUILLET, A. AND LECLÈRE, C. 1981. Restructuration du groupe nominal. Langages 63, 99–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Though briefly noted, the term was then used to designate a type of prepositional complement that “renders more “precise” while recovering, at least partially, the meaning of the utterance” (our translation).

More recently (Baptista 2005a),&lt;ref&gt;BAPTISTA, J. 2005a. Construções simétricas: argumentos e complementos. In Estudos de homenagem a Mário Vilela, O.Figueiredo, G.Rio-Torto, and F.Silva, Eds.Fac.Letras-U. Porto, pp. 353–367.&lt;/ref&gt; the term was used for anaphoric expressions in reciprocal constructions, analysable as the result of the reduction of two coordinated sentences with same predicate but with two constituents in symmetrical position:

''Peter talked with John and John talked with Peter'' → ''Peter and John talked with each other''

'''Esmeralda''', or ''Esmeraldeño'' (also called ''Takame'' or ''Atacame''), is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[language isolate]] formerly spoken in the coastal region of [[Ecuador]]. It has been proposed that the language is connected to the still-spoken [[Yaruro language]] of [[Venezuela]]. It also has some lexical similarities with the extinct [[Yurumanguí language]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Adelaar| first1 = William F.

'''Franciszka Arnsztajnowa''' ({{IPAc-pl|f|r|a|ń|'|ć|i|sz|k|a|-|a|r|n|sz|t|a|j|'|n|o|w|a}}; in full: ''Franciszka Hanna Arnsztajnowa''; 19 February 1865 – August 1942) was a Polish poet, playwright, and translator of Jewish descent.&lt;ref name="SBML"&gt;So ''Słownik biograficzny miasta Lublina'' (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Much of her creative ''oeuvre'' falls within the [[Young Poland]] period, stylistically encompassing the twilight of [[neo-romanticism]].  She is called "the legend of [[Lublin]]".&lt;ref name="JSP109"&gt;Aleksander B. Skotnicki, ''et al.'', ''Jewish Society in Poland: Customs and Participation in the Fight for Independence: Many Faces of Cracovian Jewry'', tr. J.&amp;nbsp;Niedbal &amp; K.&amp;nbsp;Baran, [[Kraków]], Wydawnictwo, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;109.  {{ISBN|9788361060765}}, {{ISBN|8361060766}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Franciszka Arnsztajnowa was the daughter of the [[Lublin]]-based novelist [[Malwina Meyerson]] (real name, Małka Meyerson, ''née'' Horowicz (Horowitz); 1839{{ndash}}1921), a Lublin native, and Bernard (Berek, or Ber) Meyerson (b. 1837), a native of [[Tykocin]], an international trader and a major Lublin financier.&lt;ref name="SBML" /&gt; Her brother was the French philosopher, [[Émile Meyerson]], based in Paris.  She attended high school for girls in Lublin, and went to Germany for higher studies in biology, travelling extensively in Europe.  On 7 January 1885 she married [[Marek Arnsztein]] (alternative spellings: Arnsztejn, Arnsztajn, Arnstein; 1855{{ndash}}1930), a physician educated in [[Warsaw]], Vienna, Berlin, and Paris, and a political and social activist, a native of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] based in Lublin from 1884.&lt;ref name="JAT26III2010" /&gt; They had a daughter, Stefanja Arnsztajnówna (''c.''1890{{ndash}}1942; married name Mieczysławska), and a son, Jan Arnsztajn (1897{{ndash}}1934), much beloved of Arnsztajnowa and whose death from [[tuberculosis]] left her devastated.

==Life and work==
As a poet Arnsztajnowa debuted at the age of 23 with the poem "Na okręcie" (On Board a Ship) published in the newspaper ''[[Kuryer Codzienny]]'' of 1 October 1888.  She issued her first collection of poetry in book form in 1895 under the title ''Poezye'', a volume which she dedicated to her mother, the novelist Malwina Meyerson.&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Poezye'', [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1895. (88 pp.)&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into six distinct sections under such headings as "Sonety" (Sonnets), "Melodye" (Melodies), "Historye" (Histories), and "Z gór Tyrolu" (From the Mountains of [[South Tyrol|Tyrol]]).  The opening poem, untitled but beginning with the words "O nie płacz..." (Weep thou not...; p.&amp;nbsp;7), sets the tone for the entire collection as she tries, with uncommon tenderness and filial piety, to soothe her mother's pain at having her own songs dispersed by the winds of time to the farthermost recesses of the soul: the implication is that the poems in this collection will become her mother's own, which the daughter will now sing for her, the lute in hand, sitting at her feet.  (In the very last poem of the collection the poet again addresses her mother directly, "O mother, why give me a heart so | Tender...")&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, [untitled poem]; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Poezye'', [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1895, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The chief characteristic of the collection, thematically speaking, was however the preoccupation and love she evinced for the people living close to the land, their ordinary lives and [[Folklore|folkloric customs]].  At the same time she delicately touched upon the social questions of the day employing language in the balladic-melancholic key.&lt;ref name="FA115"&gt;Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; The volume will instantly establish Arnsztajnowa as a major voice in Polish poetry among those exploring the nation's [[Folk culture|folk themes]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Stanisław Zdziarski]], ''Pierwiastek ludowy w poezji polskiej XIX wieku: studja porównawczo-literackie'', [[Warsaw]], E. Wende, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her next collection appeared in 1899 under the title ''Poezye: serya druga'' ("Verses: Second Series"; 2nd ed., 1911).&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Poezye: serya druga'', [[Kraków]], G. Gebethner i Spółka, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter volume contains the poem "Z nocy bezsennych" (Out of the Sleepless Nights) dedicated to her husband, Marek Arnsztein, as well as the memorable "Wspomnienie Meranu" (A&amp;nbsp;Remembrance of [[Merano]]) that evokes her travels in the [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] region of Italy, and which begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Meran… pamiętam… nieraz dziś w zimy rozgwarze,
''Mroźnem tchnieniem owiana, nagle zamknę oczy,
''I o błogosławionej dolinie zamarzę.''&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, “Wspomnienie Meranu” (A&amp;nbsp;Remembrance of [[Merano]]; lines 1{{ndash}}3); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Poezye: serya druga'', 2nd ed., [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1911, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;
__________________________________

Meran… I recall… as nowadays oft by winter's clamorous decree
Frosty gusts me shroud, I soon close my eyes asudden
And slip down the blessed valley into reverie.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Wacław Gralewski]] (1900{{ndash}}1972), a poet and prominent Lublin ''[[littérateur]]'', cites a report (which he qualifies as uncorroborated) that Arnsztajnowa was supposed to undergo a (successful) therapy for [[tuberculosis]] at Merano, an option open only to the very rich.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wacław Gralewski]], ''Stalowa tęcza: wspomnienia o [[Józef Czechowicz|Józefie Czechowiczu]]'', [[Warsaw]], Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1968, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: right; font-size: 85%;" | '''"O Dniu Jutrzejszy" (O, Thou Day of the Morrow!; 1914)''' &lt;br/&gt; {{mdash}} from ''Archanioł jutra'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, "O Dniu Jutrzejszy" (O, Thou Day of the Morrow!); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Archanioł jutra'', [[Lublin]], Spółdzielnia Wydawawnicza Placówka Lubelska, 1924, p.&amp;nbsp;13.  Exceptionally, in contravention of Polish typographic conventions, all words of the poem's title are capitalized in the original to indicate [[pathos]].&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
During the [[First World War]] Arnsztajnowa (''[[nom de guerre]]'' Ara) participated in armed struggle for the independence of Poland as a member of the secret [[Polish Military Organisation]] in Lublin (her town house in the Old Town of Lublin served as a secret archive of the [[Polish Military Organisation|POW]] and a hub for other organizations, such as the [[Union of Armed Struggle]] and the [[Scouting and Guiding in Poland|clandestine Polish boy scout movement]]; the expansive basement served as an arsenal).  Some of the patriotic feelings and motivations that actuated her participation in the freedom struggle will later find an echo in her collection of poetry entitled ''Archanioł jutra'' ("The Archangel of the Morrow"), comprising verses written during the war, which she will publish in 1924 dedicating it to the alumni of the Lublin schools who had fallen in that struggle.&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Archanioł jutra'', [[Lublin]], Spółdzielnia Wydawawnicza Placówka Lubelska, 1924. (31 pp.)&lt;/ref&gt; With two compositions included in the volume Arnsztajnowa paid tribute to the luminaries of Polish literature, [[Maria Konopnicka|Marja Konopnicka]] and [[Bolesław Prus]], both recently deceased then.  However, it is to [[Stefan Żeromski]] (after ''his'' death in 1925) that Arnsztajnowa will in the latter part of her life acknowledge her indebtedness for the general character of her ''oeuvre'' and the direction she followed in creating it.&lt;ref name="FA119"&gt;Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Archanioł jutra'' contains verses of great strength and incisiveness, unparalleled in her prior work, the composition "O Dniu Jutrzejszy" (O, Thou Day of the Morrow!), written in 1914, belonging to the most beautiful among them in the opinion of the [[history of literature|historian]] of [[Polish literature|literature]], [[Feliks Araszkiewicz]].&lt;ref name="FA117"&gt;So Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem speaks of the brethren's (comrades-in-arms') blood shed in the struggle, whose rising vapours conceal the mystery of tomorrow (the day is [[personification|personified]] in the poem, addressed as "you", and conceived of as a day of reckoning, indeed, as a [[metonymy]] for [[retributive justice]] itself): the mystery of tomorrow will be revealed once we tear down your deadly veil to look you directly in the face, without the sort of fear that makes the victim bow his head before the executioner: for tomorrow we know full well will be the day of payback for today.  (The poem, heavily dependent on stylized linguistics and medieval vocabulary (e.g., ''gzło'', line 3, a medieval term for a kind of female garment, here used figuratively in the sense of "veil"), does not lend itself easily to verse translation but is reproduced in the original to the left.)  Thus the archangel of the title of the entire collection, ''Archanioł jutra'' (“The Archangel of the Morrow”), can easily be construed as the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|avenging angel]].

Another composition belonging to this period is the poem entitled "Powrót" (The Return) published in a literary journal in April 1916.  Comprising five ''[[ottava rima]]'' stanzas, the 40-line poem brought her the Silver Laurel of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]], a (now historical) body awarding the most prestigious literary honours of the land at the time.&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, "Powrót", ''Sprawa Polska'' ([[Lublin]]), No. 13, 18 April 1916, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The interwar period===
During the [[Interbellum]] Arnsztajnowa collaborated with the newspapers and [[literary magazine]]s ''[[Dziennik Lubelski]]'', ''[[Kamena (magazine)|Kamena]]'', and ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]''; she was the editor-in-chief of the literary supplement ''Dodatek Literacki'' to the newspaper ''[[Ziemia Lubelska]]''.  At the same time she was the moving spirit of the literary life of the city of Lublin, a fact recognized by outside observers,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Jan Szczawiej]], "Życie literackie w Lubelszczyźnie", ''[[Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny|Ilustrowany Kuryer Codzienny]]'' ([[Kraków]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;25, No.&amp;nbsp;28, 28 January 1934, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; co-founding in 1932, together with the poet [[Józef Czechowicz]], the Lublin section of the writers' union, the Związek Literatów (see [[Polish Writers' Union]]), of which she served as the president.  To this period, in addition to the aforementioned collection ''Archanioł jutra'' (1924), belong also her volumes of poetry entitled ''Odloty'' ("Flying Away"; 1932),&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, ''Odloty'', [[Lublin]], Związek Literatów w Lublinie, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; a compilation of verses published in [[literary magazine|literary journals]] between 1902 and 1926, and the collection produced jointly with Józef Czechowicz, ''Stare kamienie'' ("Old Stones"; 1934) which was at once a tribute to her beloved Lublin, a city in which she continued to reside until 1934, epitomized in the poem "Tobie śpiewam, Lublinie" (To You do I Sing, O Lublin!), and a form of a literary farewell.&lt;ref&gt;Franciszka Arnsztajnowa &amp; [[Józef Czechowicz]], ''Stare kamienie: [poezye]'', [[Lublin]], [n.p.], 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary critics observed that the unspecified nature of the collaboration between the two famous poets gave the publication an anonymous tinge,&lt;ref&gt;K. W. Zawodziński, "Liryka" (Lyric Poetry); in ''Rocznik Literacki za rok 1934'', ed. Z. Szmydtowa, [[Warsaw]], Instytut Literacki, 1935, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and although subsequent scholarship clearly differentiated between the pieces written by Arnsztajnowa and those written by Czechowicz mistakes of attribution did occur in succeeding years and decades.&lt;ref name="The Author 2001"&gt;[[Tadeusz Kłak]], ''Miasto poetów: poezja lubelska, 1918{{ndash}}1939'', [[Tarnów]], The Author; [[Lublin]], Wojewódzki Dom Kultury, 2001. {{ISBN|8391501825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Odloty'' represents a continuation of the [[Modernism|modernist]] esthetics that dominated the first phase of Arnsztajnowa's literary life, as evidenced in the imagery employed and in the method of shaping of the lyrical persona, as well as in the return of the [[Fairy tale|fairy-tale]] [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] favoured by the [[Young Poland]] poets, such as lakes, mirrors, and shadows.  Although on occasion she adopts a new cadence closer to the spirit of the [[Skamander]] circle then gaining an ascendancy over [[Polish poetry|Polish poetics]], such diversions are rare.&lt;ref name="The Author 2001"/&gt; The title poem, "Odloty" (Flying Away), first printed in a literary magazine in 1905, is a mystical allegory on the inevitability of the departure, of parting despite the ties thereby shattered.&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, "Odloty", ''Ateneum'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 3, No. 9, September 1905, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnsztajnowa was co-founder of the historically important [[Kraków]] periodical ''[[Życie]]'' famously associated with the artistic avant-garde and with the person of [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]], for which she wrote a programmatic poem,&lt;ref name="FA115" /&gt; and had close ties to the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Kamena (magazine)|Kamena]]'' (see [[:pl:Kamena (czasopismo)|''Kamena'']]), founded and edited by [[Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski|K. A. Jaworski]]: the journal began publication in 1933 with a poem by Arnsztajnowa, "Na Olejnej" (In Olejna Street), on the first page of the first issue.&lt;ref&gt;Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, "Na Olejnej (z cyklu ''Stare kamienie'')" (In Olejna Street {{mdash}} from the ''Stare kamienie'' Cycle), ''Kamena'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol. 1, No. 1, September 1933, p. 1. [http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/dlibra/doccontent?id=24463 See online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-wing critics (such as [[Julian Babiński|Juljan Babiński]], 1900{{ndash}}1943) accused Arnsztajnowa of left-wing bias against the ''[[szlachta]]'', in favour of the common people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Babiński|Juljan Babiński]], "Na marginesie", ''Tęcza: ilustrowany miesięcznik'' ([[Poznań]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;11, No.&amp;nbsp;5, May 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prose====
Arnsztajnowa's innumerable writings in prose, strewn across innumerable journals and magazines, frequently published under pseudonyms that even Arnsztajnowa could not keep track of during her lifetime, present an impossible task for a compiler wishing to present a reasonably comprehensive picture of her bibliography {{mdash}} as observed by the historian of literature and her contemporary, [[#Bibliography|Feliks Araszkiewicz]] (1895{{ndash}}1966).&lt;ref&gt;Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the pen-names she is known to have used are '''J.&amp;nbsp;Górecka''', and '''Stefan Orlik'''.

====Dramatic works====
Arnsztajnowa's dramatic works remain largely confined to manuscript, including her award-winning play ''Na wyżynach (Krystyna)'' ("On the Heights: Christina") which was staged to great acclaim in [[Lviv|Lvov]] in 1899.  Her other plays which were seen on the stages of [[Kraków]] and [[Łódź]], in addition to those of Lublin and Lvov, but which remain unpublished, are (with dates of theatre production) ''Na kuracji'' ("A&amp;nbsp;Stay at a Spa"; 1894), ''Perkun'' ("[[Perkūnas]]"; 1896), and ''W stojącej wodzie'' ("In the Stagnant Water"; 1901).  Only two one-act plays have been published (in [[literary magazine|literary journals]]), ''Widmo: Ballada w I&amp;nbsp;akcie'' ("The Spectre: A&amp;nbsp;[[Ballad]] in One Act"; published in ''[[Ateneum (magazine)|Ateneum]]'' in 1905, a dialogue between two characters identified only as male and female),&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, "Widmo: Ballada w I akcie", ''[[Ateneum (magazine)|Ateneum]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), Year&amp;nbsp;III, vol.&amp;nbsp;1, Nos.&amp;nbsp;1{{ndash}}3, January{{ndash}}March 1905, pp.&amp;nbsp;104{{ndash}}109.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Luxoniolo'' (published in the ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'' in 1911).&lt;ref&gt;Julian Krzyżanowski, ''Neoromantyzm polski, 1890{{ndash}}1918'', 3rd ed., ed. T.&amp;nbsp;Brzozowska-Komorowska &amp; M.&amp;nbsp;Bokszczanin, [[Wrocław]], Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;347.  {{ISBN|8304003902}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The play ''Córka'' ("The Daughter") has never been staged or published.

====Translatorial work and other avocations====
Arnsztajnowa participated in the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]], supporting with readings from her poems the meetings and events of organizations involved in the movement, including the [[Związek Równouprawnienia Kobiet Polskich]] (Union for the Equal Rights of Polish Women) founded in 1907 by [[Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit]] (1859{{ndash}}1921).&lt;ref&gt;"Z życia prowincji" (From the Life of the Provinces), ''[[Głos Warszawski]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;2, No.&amp;nbsp;92, 2 April 1909, p.&amp;nbsp;2. (See also [[:pl:Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit|Paulina Kuczalska-Reinschmit]].)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 Arnsztajnowa participated in a feminist exhibition mounted by Polish women writers in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;''Památník výstavy práce ženy polské v Praze 1912'', comp., ed. &amp; tr. Pavla Maternová, [[Prague]], Ústřední spolek českých žen, 1912.  Cf. Helena Rzepecka, "Zbiorowy głos doraźny" (The Collective Voice of the Moment), ''Literatura i Sztuka'' ([[Poznań]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;4, No.&amp;nbsp;36, 8 September 1912, pp.&amp;nbsp;563{{ndash}}567.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from her own extensive poetic ''oeuvre'', Arnsztajnowa produced several translations from English literature. Her translation of [[Douglas Jerrold]]'s famous ''[[:s:Mrs. Caudle's curtain lectures|Mrs Caudle's Curtain Lectures]]'', published in 1923 as ''Nauki małżeńskie pani Caudle'', was issued with the name of the translator concealed under a pseudonym (Stefan Orlik) as she did not wish to lend the [[Reputation|prestige]] that her name enjoyed in the domain of poetry to what she considered to be her [[avocation]]. Her translations of [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Sea Lady|The Sea Lady: A Tissue of Moonshine]]'' (published as ''Syrena: księżycowa opowieść'' in 1927), and of [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s novel ''The Painted Veil'' (published as ''Malowana zasłona'' in 1935, 2 vols.), were issued with the name of the translator fully identified. She also collaborated with [[Helena Niemirowska]] in the translation of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' (published as ''Puk'' in 1924) for which she provided verse translations.  Despite their being overshadowed by the larger translations of whole novels, [[#Bibliography|Professor Araszkiewicz]] considered Arnsztajnowa's translations of those relatively small poetic fragments {{mdash}} and not the large bodies of prose translation {{mdash}} to be among her most notable achievements in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Feliks Araszkiewicz (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Her versions of Kipling's "Cities and Thrones and Powers" and "Harp Song of the Dane Women" (poems from ''Puck of Pook's Hill'') were published separately in [[literary magazine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudyard Kipling]], "Grody i Trony w obliczu czasu..." (Cities and Thrones and Powers), tr. Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, ''Kamena'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol. 1, No. 4, December 1933, p. 68.  Rudyard Kipling, "Pieśń harfiarska duńskich niewiast" (Harp Song of the Dane Women), tr. Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, ''Kamena'', vol. 2, No. 7 (17), March 1935, p.&amp;nbsp;134.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, her 1932 translation of a 12-verse excerpt from the French of ''[[Les Stances]]'' by [[Jean Moréas|Jean&amp;nbsp;Moréas]] (Book&amp;nbsp;3; XII), beginning
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''O toi qui sur mes jours de tristesse et d'épreuve
                        ''Seule reluis encor...''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
reads better than the original:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''O, ty, co dni mych smutkom i zmaganiom
''blaskiem przyświecasz wytrwałym...''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Moréas]], "Przekłady z poezyj J. Moréasa" (Translations of J. Moréas's Verses), ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'' ([[Lublin]]), vol. 10, No. 4, 4 January 1932, p. 2. Includes two poems from ''Les Stances'' by Moréas in Arnsztajnowa's translation: Book 2, VII; and Book 3, XII.  The latter poem reprinted in Jean Moréas, "Ze ''Stanc'' * * *" (From ''Les Stances'' * * *), tr. Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, ''Kamena'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol. 3, No. 4 (24), December 1935, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Always respectful of and ready to honour others for their achievement in their field, in 1899 Arnsztajnowa contributed to the ''[[Festschrift|liber amicorum]]'' for [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his editorial work, a sumptuously produced volume that opens with her poem "Grajek" (The Fiddler; from the ''Poezye'' of 1895).&lt;ref&gt;Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, "Grajek" (The Fiddler); in: ''"Prawda": książka zbiorowa dla uczczenia dwudziestopięcioletniej działalności Aleksandra Świętochowskiego, 1870{{ndash}}1895'', [[Lviv|Lvov]], Księgarnia H. Altenberga [etc.], 1899, pp. 1{{ndash}}8.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her tributes in verse, even when marked by a high level of artistic accomplishment, were entirely private, meant solely for the honouree.  Her poem composed in tribute to the Polish geographer, [[Wacław Nałkowski]] (1851{{ndash}}1911), the father of the writer [[Zofia Nałkowska|Zofja Nałkowska]], on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his scholarly work in January 1903, did not come to light until 55 years later, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Rosiak, "Franciszka Arnsztajnowa w hołdzie Wacławowi Nałkowskiemu" (Arnsztajnowa's Tribute to Wacław Nałkowski), ''Kamena'' ([[Lublin]]), vol. 25, No. 19 (161), 15 October 1958, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Her patriotic feelings found expression in the contribution she made to the collective volume published by the Teachers' Union to commemorate the [[Września#Września school strike of 1901|school strikes]] in [[Partitions of Poland|Partitioned Poland]] mounted in protest against marginalization of Polish culture by the occupying powers;&lt;ref&gt;''Walka o szkołę polską: w 25-lecie strajku szkolnego'', ed. S. Drzewiecki, ''et al.'', [[Warsaw]], [n.p.; ''but under the imprint of the'' Związki Nauczycielstwa Polskich Szkół Powszechnych i Średnich], 1930, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1935 Arnsztajnowa served on the editorial board of a commemorative volume for the [[Polish Military Organisation]], to which she contributed the keynote poem (on the theme of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier]]) serving as a motto for the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, [untitled poem]; in ''Pod sztandarem P.O.W.: szkice i wspomnienia zebrane dla uczczenia uroczystości poświęcenia sztandaru, odsłonięcia tablicy pamiątkowej ś.p. płk. Mieczysława Więckowskiego i połączenia okręgu siedleckiego Związku Peowiaków z okręgiem lubelskim: Lublin w marcu 1935 roku'', ed. F. Arnsztajnowa, ''et al.'', [[Lublin]], Zarząd Okręgu i Koło Związku Peowiaków, 1935, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnsztajnowa's patriotic fervour carried her so far as to contribute three technically accomplished, genuinely high-calibre poems {{mdash}} "Jego Imię" (His Name), "O, Wodzu!" (O Leader!), and "Wodzowi-twórcy" (To the Leader-Creator) {{mdash}} to the collection of panegyrics in honour of [[Józef Piłsudski]] published in 1924, two years before his [[May Coup (Poland)|''coup d'état'' of May 1926]].&lt;ref&gt;Franciszka Arnsztejnowa [''[[sic]]'', not "Arnsztajnowa"], "Jego Imię" (His Name); in ''Józef Piłsudski w poezji: antologja'', [[Lublin]], Dom Wydawniczy Franciszek Głowiński i S-ka, 1924, pp.&amp;nbsp;3{{ndash}}4.  ''[[Id.]]'', "O, Wodzu!" (O Leader!), in: ''[[ibid.]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;5.  ''[[Id.]]'', "Wodzowi-twórcy" (To the Leader-Creator), in: ''[[ibid.]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 33 contributors to the collection (some of them not established poets), only the names of [[Józef Czechowicz]], [[Jan Lechoń]] and [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer|Kazimierz Tetmajer]] stand in the same rank with Arnsztajnowa's.  After the ''coup d'état'' of May 1926, during a visit to Lublin in June 1931 of Piłsudski's [[List of heads of state of Poland|figurehead president]], [[Ignacy Mościcki]], she wrote in poetic prose a fulsome welcome for him in a local newspaper ("whole streets are running out to Him with open arms while ancient city walls silvered by age reverberate with the Good News: hail Thou the visible manifestation of the Independence!", etc.).&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, "Dostojnemu Gościowi na powitanie" (Welcoming the Distinguished Guest), ''Ziemia Lubelska'' ([[Lublin]]), vol. 27, No. 148, 3 June 1931, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antisemitic attacks on Arnsztajnowa====
In 1910 and 1911 Arnsztajnowa was the object of a book boycott motivated by antisemitic sentiment and spearheaded by the [[Endecja]] circles.&lt;ref name="HMO"&gt;[[Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa]] (see [[:pl:Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa|Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa]]), "Na pięterku" (Up the Little Flight of Stairs), ''[[Kamena (magazine)|Kamena]]'' ([[Lublin]]), vol. 27, No. 18 (208), 30 September 1960, pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;4.  As a first-hand testimonial, this is one of the major primary sources for the biography of Arnsztajnowa.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1937 Arnsztajnowa, then a 72-year-old ''[[grande dame]]'' of [[Polish literature]] (a recipient of the Silver Laurel of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] and a decorated veteran of the Polish war of independence), was the victim of [[antisemitic]] attacks from the Endecja literary circles connected with the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Prosto z mostu]]'' of [[Warsaw]], a publication billing itself in the masthead as an artistic-literary weekly, edited and published by [[Stanisław Piasecki]] (1900{{ndash}}1941).  In its edition of 25 July 1937 the magazine in question carried a quasi-anonymous racist and in parts [[Vulgarism|scurrilously]] [[Poetaster|versified]] polemic signed only "(st. p.)" (which would have been universally understood by readers to refer to Piasecki) in which Arnsztajnowa was called, sarcastically, the "erector of the edifice of the [[Polish language]]" (''[[sc.]]'', one of the primary forces shaping the mother tongue) without being Polish.  Although other Polish writers of Jewish descent were held up to ridicule by name as well, Arnsztajnowa was selected for special treatment. "Consider this efflorescence of Polish speech from under the ''aegis'' of Arnsztajnowa", jeered the writer of the article, presenting his readers with a sentence taken out of context from one of Arnsztajnowa's articles (on the complex subject of the phenomenology of contemporary French culture), which was supposed to offend against linguistic norm (it had, in fact, a [[typographical error]] involving the omission of a single letter).  The attack on Arnsztajnowa continued under the guise of an attack on [[Ludwik Fryde]] (1912{{ndash}}1942), despite his young age already a distinguished literary critic of Jewish descent, whose surname was altered to "frydek" so that it might rhyme with ''żydek'' ("the little jew", the lower-case initials employed for their added insulting value) while the author went on: "so it is among us that every common-or-garden pederast, if he has talent, he bandies it about", etc.&lt;ref&gt;(st. p.) [''[[sic]]'': lower-case initials in parentheses], "Wycinanki" (Newspaper Cuttings), ''[[Prosto z mostu]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Prosto z Mostu|Prosto z mostu]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 3, No. 34 (142), 25 July 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;5.  The title of the periodical, ''Prosto z mostu'', is a Polish [[idiomatic]] expression meaning "without beating about the bush", "straightforwardly", "point-blank".&lt;/ref&gt; The incident generated a groundswell of support for her from the Polish [[reading public]], including an open letter signed by many writers and poets,&lt;ref name="HMO" /&gt; some of whom also published individual expressions of support {{mdash}} as did, for example, [[Józef Łobodowski]], calling the attack "outrageous and revolting".&lt;ref&gt;[[Józef Łobodowski]], "W obronie zasługi" (In Defence of Merit), letter to the editor, ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 14, No. 32 (718), 1 August 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Łobodowski's protest published in the most prestigious literary journal of the [[Interbellum|interbellum epoch]], the ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'', Piasecki remained unrepentant, and a fresh antisemitic attack on Arnsztajnowa was printed with additional vitriol in the ''Prosto z mostu'' edition of 8 August 1937.&lt;ref&gt;st. p.) [''[[sic]]'': lower-case initials in parentheses, with the left parenthesis missing], "Wycinanki" (Newspaper Cuttings), ''[[Prosto z mostu]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Prosto z Mostu|Prosto z mostu]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;37 (145), 8 August 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[antisemitic]] and [[homophobic]] attack on Arnsztajnowa and others was originally authored by [[Jerzy Pietrkiewicz]] and published in the ultra-nationalist and antisemitic periodical ''[[Myśl Narodowa]]'' ("National Thought"), but ''Prosto z mostu'' went beyond the text of the original racist [[pasquinade]] in its attempt to disseminate, defend and justify it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Pietrkiewicz]], "W rozmównicy" (In the Chat Room), ''[[Myśl Narodowa]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol. 17, No.&amp;nbsp;29, 18 July 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;458. [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/publication?id=144548 (See online.)]&lt;/ref&gt; For its part ''Myśl Narodowa'' will continue its attack on Arnsztajnowa on other fronts, bemoaning (in its issue of 29 August 1937) "the pernicious Jewish dispensation (''gospodarka żydów'') in the field of literature" for which the evidence was to be the supposed falsification by Niemirowska and Arnsztajnowa of Kipling (through their alleged toning down or expurgation of antisemitic passages in the works of this author).&lt;ref&gt;T. R. [''[[sic]]'': anonymous article], "Nauka i literatura: ''Rocznik Literacki''" (Sciences and Literature: ''The Literary Annual''), ''[[Myśl Narodowa]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;17, No.&amp;nbsp;35, 29 August 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;552. [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/publication?id=144548 (See online.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Published sources differ on the circumstances of her death, but there is a consensus that she did not die in Lublin, all the sources citing the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] {{mdash}} a place where she had gone proudly ''and of her own accord'', "to be with everybody"&lt;ref name="JSP109" /&gt; {{mdash}} as either the place of her death or the place of her [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportation]] immediately before her death. In some accounts she would have died in the Warsaw Ghetto of an infectious disease ([[typhus]]);&lt;ref&gt;So, for example, [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]], ''Marginalia'', ed. M. Iwaszkiewicz, ''et al. '', [[Warsaw]], Interim, 1993, p. 11.  {{ISBN|8385083286}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to other accounts she would have been violently murdered there by the [[Nazis]], or have taken poison out of despair after seeing her daughter, Stefanja (who in all accounts accompanied her in the Warsaw Ghetto), shot dead by the Nazis. In some sources she would have been murdered after having been deported from the Warsaw Ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] (the most common narrative, but not invested with greater evidentiary credibility than the other versions).&lt;ref&gt;So, for example, [[Julian Krzyżanowski]], ''Neoromantyzm polski: 1890{{ndash}}1918'', [[Wrocław]], Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1963, p. 343.  Cf. August Grychowski, ''Lublin i Lubelszczyzna w życiu i twórczości pisarzy polskich: od średniowiecza do 1968&amp;nbsp;r.'', [[Lublin]], Wydawnictwo Lubelskie, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;266.  	''Rozkwitały pąki białych róż...: wiersze i pieśni z lat 1908{{ndash}}1918 o Polsce, o wojnie i o żołnierzach'', ed. A. Romanowski, vol.&amp;nbsp;1, [[Warsaw]], Czytelnik, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;145.  {{ISBN|8307019141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most authorities agree that she died in 1942, at the age of&amp;nbsp;77, however one otherwise well informed writer cites 1943 as the year of her death.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Rosiak, "O Franciszce Arnsztajnowej" (About Franciszka Arnsztajnowa), ''Kamena'' ([[Lublin]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;27, No.&amp;nbsp;4 (194), 29 February 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;7.  The date of 1943 is again repeated in Tadeusz Kłak, "Poetka Ziemi Lubelskiej" (The Poetess of the Lublin Land), ''Kamena'', vol. 32, No. 8 (318), 1{{ndash}}15 May 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; In what is perhaps the most reliable eyewitness report, that of the poet [[Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa]] (1905{{ndash}}1968), at the moment of her death {{mdash}} during the mass murder of patients at a hospital near All Saints' Church in Warsaw where she lay ill {{mdash}} Arnsztajnowa had two books with her, Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' and her own collection of poetry published in 1932, ''Odloty'' ("Flying Away"), on the poetics of departure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa]] (see [[:pl:Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa|Hanna Mortkowicz-Olczakowa]]), "Na pięterku" (Up the Little Flight of Stairs), ''Kamena'' ([[Lublin]]), vol. 27, No.&amp;nbsp;18 (208), 30 September 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;4. (Mortkowicz-Olczakowa does not cite the date of Arnsztajnowa's death; she does state that Arnsztajnowa's daughter, Stefanja Mieczysławska, unlike her mother, died in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] of disease.) Cf.&amp;nbsp;[[Wacław Gralewski]], ''Ogniste koła'', [[Lublin]], Wydawnictwo Lubelskie, 1963, p. 37. [[Anna Kamieńska]], "Poetka Lublina: legenda, dwugłos pokoleń", ''[[Twórczość]]'' ([[Warsaw]]), No. 10, 1969, pp.&amp;nbsp;111{{ndash}}112.  Note: the Church of All Saints in the plac Grzybowski (Grzybowski Square) in Warsaw was one of the two Catholic churches within the Warsaw Ghetto limits [http://zmh.um.warszawa.pl/gg.htm (see "Historical Sites of Jewish Warsaw" online).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209080626/http://zmh.um.warszawa.pl/gg.htm |date=9 February 2013 }} Cf.

Arnsztajnowa's first book, ''Poezye'' (1895), published when she was 30, contains this reference to [[Dante Alighieri]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''I ja byłem w piekle… we śnie, czy na jawie
''Niewiem… lecz, zaprawdę, Danta piekieł kręgi
''Mąk takich nie mieszczą, nie szarpią tak krwawie…''&lt;ref&gt;F. Arnsztajnowa, [untitled poem] (lines 1{{ndash}}3); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Poezye'', [[Warsaw]], Gebethner i Wolff, 1895, p. 85.  Arnsztajnowa employs the [[I (pronoun)|authorial "I"]] in the masculine form ("ja byłem", not "ja byłam").&lt;/ref&gt;
___________________________

To hell I've also been… in dream or waking hours
Can't say… but, forsooth, Dante's [[Inferno (Dante)#The nine circles of Hell|infernal circles]]
Contain not such torment as bloodily overpowers…
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Postscript===

'''Hasmukh Jamnadas Baradi''' (23 December 1938 - 4 February 2017) was a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] playwright, theater artist and theater critic from [[India]].

==Biography==
Baradi was born on 23 December 1938 in [[Rajkot]]. After completing his primary and secondary education in Rajkot, he received a diploma in theater direction from Saurashtra Sangit Natak Academy in 1961. Afterwards, he joined the [[Gujarat University]], where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1964 in English literature and [[Sanskrit]]. He received a Master of Arts in Theater History from [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts|Lunacharsky State Institute for Theatre Arts]], [[Moscow]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="Gujarati Vishwakosh"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ગુજરાતી વિશ્વકોશ|trans-title=Gujarati Encyclopedia|first=Dhirubhai|last=Thaker|author-link=Dhirubhai Thaker|publisher=[[Gujarati Vishwakosh|Gujarati Vishwakosh Trust]]|location=Ahmedabad|year=2000|volume=13|pages=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1959 to 1964, he worked as a playwright at [[All India Radio|Aakashvani]] in [[Vadodara]] and Rajkot.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web | title=સવિશેષ પરિચય: હસમુખ બારાડી, ગુજરાતી સાહિત્ય પરિષદ | website=Gujarati Sahitya Parishad | url=http://www.gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/sarjako/savishesh/Savishesh-Hasmukh-Baradi.html | language=gu | access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Baradi attempted a fusion of tradition and modernity in his plays.&lt;ref name="ModiTrivedi2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chinu Modi|authorlink1=Chinu Modi|author2=Darshana Trivedi|title=Two Plays: Aurangzeb, Naishadhrai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CZnAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=[[Gujarat Sahitya Academy]]|location=Gandhinagar|page=V}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran the Garage Studio Theater, which performed in [[Bhavai]] theatrical style, a traditional folk theatrical form particularly common in Western India. He wrote many plays within the Bhavai form which delved on topics of social reforms.&lt;ref name="Sinha2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Biswajit Sinha|title=Folk theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzEbAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Raj Publications|isbn=978-81-86208-35-9|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baradi wrote ''Kalo Kamlo'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} Black Blanket), an experimental psychological play which he had published in 1975, and was translated into [[Hindi]] in 1980 as ''Kala Kambal''. He also wrote ''Raino Darpanrai,'' an adaptation of ''[[Raino Parvat]]'', as well as ''Baradina Be Natako'' (1984), ''Janardan Joseph'' (1985), ''Pachhi Shebaji Bolia'', ''Jashumati Kankuvati'', ''Eklu Aakash ane Bija Natako'', ''Tame Aanathi Ramtata'' and ''Akhu Aikhu Farithi''.

In 1983, Baradi wrote ''Natak Sarikho Nadar Hunnar'' (1983), a work of theater criticism.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; He also wrote ''Gujarati Theaterno Itihas'', a literary history of Gujarati theater, which was translated into English by Vinod Meghani as ''The History of Gujarati Theater'' in 2004.&lt;ref name="Kothari2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita Kothari|authorlink=Rita Kothari|title=Translating India: The Cultural Politics of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_Ceg7sfYIoC&amp;pg=PA91|date=20 December 2005|publisher=Foundation Books|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-7596-305-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Persian was in force as the official language of administration and writing but was supplemented by a mixture of the speech of the Delhi area ('Khari Boli', which had Sanksrit as its ultimate ancestor) together with many Persian loanwords as very general means of oral communication among different parts of the Muslim-controlled territories. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, this form of speech was patronized by the rulers of various southern kingdoms and resulted in the growth of an early literature in a language known as Dakhini or southern Hindi-Urdu.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~taj/abturdu.htm|title=About Hindi-Urdu|last=Taj|first=Afroz|year=1997|publisher=[[The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=Then, about seven centuries ago, the dialects of Hindi spoken in the region of Delhi began to undergo a linguistic change. In the villages, these dialects continued to be spoken much as they had been for centuries. But around Delhi and other urban areas, under the influence of the Persian-speaking Sultans and their military administration, a new dialect began to emerge which would be called Urdu. While Urdu retained the fundamental grammar and basic vocabulary of its Hindi parent dialects, it adopted the Persian writing system, "Nastaliq" and many additional Persian vocabulary words. Indeed, the great poet Amir Khusro (1253-1325) contributed to the early development of Urdu by writing poems with alternating lines of Persian and Hindi dialect written in Persian script. What began humbly as a hodge-podge language spoken by the Indian recruits in the camps of the Sultan's army, by the Eighteenth Century had developed into a sophisticated, poetic language. It is important to note that over the centuries, Urdu continued to develop side by side with the original Hindi dialects, and many poets have written comfortably in both. Thus the distinction between Hindi and Urdu was chiefly a question of style. A poet could draw upon Urdu's lexical richness to create an aura of elegant sophistication, or could use the simple rustic vocabulary of dialect Hindi to evoke the folk life of the village. Somewhere in the middle lay the day to day language spoken by the great majority of people. This day to day language was often referred to by the all-encompassing term "Hindustani."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Hindi dialects continued to develop alongside Urdu and according to Professor Afroz Taj, "the distinction between Hindi and Urdu was chiefly a question of style. A poet could draw upon Urdu's lexical richness to create an aura of elegant sophistication, or could use the simple rustic vocabulary of dialect Hindi to evoke the folk life of the village. Somewhere in the middle lay the day to day language spoken by the great majority of people. This day to day language was often referred to by the all-encompassing term ''Hindustani''."&lt;ref name=Taj/&gt; In [[Colonial India]], Hindi-Urdu acquired vocabulary introduced by [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missionaries]] from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romanic languages]], e.g. ''pādrī'' (Devanagari: पादरी, Nastaleeq: پادری) from ''[[wikt:padre|padre]]'', meaning [[pastor]].&lt;ref name="Shackle1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shackle|first=C.|title=Hindi and Urdu Since 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X1jAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=1 January 1990|publisher=Heritage Publishers|isbn=9788170261629|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When describing the state of Hindi-Urdu under the [[British Raj]], Professor Śekhara Bandyopādhyāẏa stated that "Truly speaking, Hindi and Urdu, spoken by a great majority of people in north India, were the same language written in two scripts; Hindi was written in Devanagari script and therefore had a greater sprinkling of Sanskrit words, while Urdu was written in Persian script and thus had more Persian and Arabic words in it. At the more colloquial level, however, the two languages were mutually intelligible."&lt;ref name="Bandyopādhyāẏa2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandyopādhyāẏa|first=Śekhara|title=From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oVra0ulQ3QC&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788125025962|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[partition of India]], political forces within [[India]] tried to further Sanskritize Hindi,&lt;ref name="George2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Rosemary Marangoly|title=Indian English and the Fiction of National Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RtdGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=21 November 2013|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9781107729551|page=213|quote==Elsewhere Gandhi advocated for both Hindi and Hindustani (an amalgam of Hindi and Persianized Urdu that was in use in the north and could be written in either Nagri or Urdu/Persian script). In 1945, Gandhi resigned from the Hindi Sahitya when it advocated that Hindi was to be written exclusively in the Devanagri script. Over time, as both Hindi and Urdu became increasingly linked with Hindu and Muslim identity respectively, Hindustani had few advocates in India with voices powerful enough to drown out the opposition to it, especially after the trauma of partition. Hindi was deliberately Sanskritized to underline its Hindu roots and to create a purer etymology for the language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political forces in [[Pakistan]] campaigned to remove Prakit/Sanksrit derived words from Urdu and supplant them with Persian and Arabic words.&lt;ref name="Everaert2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Everaert|first=Christine|title=Tracing the Boundaries Between Hindi and Urdu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqZ-6QRKc7wC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=21 November 2014|year=2010|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004177314|page=268|quote=According to some, Pakistani Urdu has been following the path of religious fanatics in the last twenty-five to thirty years, removing Hindi words from Urdu and replacing them by Persian and Arabic words. The [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], where Pakistanis go in huge numbers to work during several years of their lives and who sponsor the conservative ''madaris'', are taking the blame for this evolution. The foreign labourers returning to Pakistan after several years in Saudi Arabic and neighbouring countries are said to have been indoctrinated by their Arab hosts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these government efforts, the film industry, [[Bollywood]] continues to release its films in the original Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) language, easily understood and enjoyed by speakers of both registers;&lt;ref name="Simpson2007b"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Andrew|title=Language and National Identity in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3XvBbdWCKYC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=30 August 2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780191533082|page=62|quote=In their formal spoken and written forms, Hindi and Urdu share a common grammar and much basic vocabulary. When Hindi and Urdu are spoken ''informally'' by most of the population, the differences present and clearly discernible in formal language tend to disappear to a very significant extent, and the two varieties become both mutually intelligible and often difficult to tell apart. This frequently used, colloquial form of Hindi and Urdu used in everyday conversation by the majority of speakers has in the past regularly been referred to with the term 'Hindustani'. It is also the form of language standardly used in Bollywood films, which are widely enjoyed by speakers of both Hindi and Urdu.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition many of the same television channels are viewed across the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/kids-have-it-right-boundaries-of-urdu-and-hindi-are-blurred-579088.html|title=Kids have it right: boundaries of Urdu and Hindi are blurred|last=Patel|first=Aakar|work=[[Firstpost]]|publisher=[[Network 18]]|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=Cartoon Network, Pogo and the rest were available in English also, of course. However, according to a cable operator from Allama Iqbal Town also quoted in the story, Pakistani children preferred their cartoons in Hindi. This is true of India also, where children including those studying in English schools, watch their cartoons only in Hindi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic classification==
[[Hindi language|Hindi]] (हिन्दी ''Hindi'') is one of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The core of Hindi vocabulary is thus [[etymology|etymologically]] Indo-European. However, centuries of [[loanword|borrowing]] has led to the adoption of a wide range of words with foreign origins.

==Classifications of origin types==
The typical Hindi dictionary lists 75,000 separate words, of which 50,000 (30%) are considered तत्सम ''tatsama'' (words directly reborrowed from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]), 21,100 (28%) are तद्भव ''tadbhav'' (native Hindi vocabulary with Sanskrit cognates), and the rest being borrowings from देशज ''deshaj'' "indigenous" (i.e. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]) or विदेशी ''Videshi'' "foreign" sources.

However, these figures do not take into account the fact that a huge chunk of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimizing their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of native ''tadbhabo'' words, while ''tatshamo'' reborrowings only make up 25% of the total. ''Deshaj'' and ''Videshi'' borrowings together make up the remaining 15% of the vocabulary used in modern Hindi literature.

==Examples of borrowed words==
Due to centuries of contact with [[European ethnic groups|European]]s, [[Turkic peoples]], [[Arabs]], [[Persia]]ns, and [[East Asians]], Hindi has absorbed countless words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these [[Loanword|borrowings]] into the core vocabulary. The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. Close contact with neighboring peoples facilitated the borrowing of words from [[Languages of India|other Indian languages]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and several indigenous [[Austroasiatic languages]] of North India. After centuries of invasions from [[Persia]] and the [[Middle East]], particularly under the [[Mughal Empire]], numerous [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] words were absorbed and fully integrated into the lexicon. Later, [[Europe]]an [[colonialism]] brought words from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and most significantly [[English language|English]]. Some very common borrowings are shown below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">'''Interpretivism''' is a school of thought in contemporary [[jurisprudence]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:Ronald Dworkin at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ronald Dworkin]] is often associated with interpretivism.]]
The main claims of interpretivism are that 
*Law is not a set of given data, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or physical facts, but what [[lawyer]]s aim to construct or obtain in their [[Practice_of_law|practice]]. This marks a first difference between interpretivism and [[legal positivism]]. But the refusal that law be a set of ''given'' entities opposes interpretivism to [[natural law]] too.
*There is no separation between law and [[morality]], although there are differences. This is not in accordance with the main claim of legal positivism.
*Law is not [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature nor do legal values and principles exist independently and outside of the legal practice itself. This is the opposite of the main claim of natural law theory.

In the [[English language|English]] speaking world, interpretivism is usually identified with [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s thesis on the nature of [[law]] as discussed in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', which is sometimes seen as a third way between natural law and legal positivism. 

The concept also includes continental [[legal hermeneutics]] and authors such as [[Helmut Coing]] and [[Emilio Betti]]. Legal hermeneutics can be seen as a branch of philosophical [[hermeneutics]], whose main authors in the 20th century are [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]], both drawing on [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Hermeneutics has now expanded to many varied areas of research in the [[social sciences]] as an alternative to a conventionalist approach.

In a wider sense, interpretivism includes even the theses of, in chronological order, [[Josef Esser]], [[Theodor Viehweg]], [[Chaim Perelman]], [[Wolfgang Fikentscher]], [[António Castanheira Neves|Castanheira Neves]], [[Friedrich Müller (jurist)|Friedrich Müller]], [[Aulis Aarnio]] and [[Robert Alexy]].

'''Janardan Swami''' (or Janardana) was an [[India]]n scholar, a [[Deshpande]] or [[Deshastha Brahmin]], born in 1504 at [[Chalisgaon]]. Janardan Swami was a devotee of [[Dattatreya]]. He moved to Devagiri, renamed as [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] by the Muslim rulers of the time. The Muslim king appointed Janardan as chief in charge of the fort. There in a cave, he held a conversation with Dattatreya in human form. He made disciples from among all castes including Muslims and Arabs. On one of his tours to [[Ankalakopa]], while resting in a temple, he had the vision of Lord Dattatreya who came to him in the form of [[Narasimha Saraswati]], a great saint lived in [[Narsobawadi]] near [[Gangapur, Maharashtra|Gangapur]]. Narasimha Saraswati initiated him in the spiritual life, under an [[Ficus racemosa|audumbar]] tree. Janardan Swami composed beautiful [[Abhanga]]s. His very presence used to bring peace of mind to those who came to him. Of his three main disciples, [[Eknath| Sant Eknath Maharaj]] is the most wellknown; the others were Ramajanardana and Janijanardana.

Janardan Swami asked Eknath to go on a pilgrimage.He himself accompanied Eknath up to [[Nasik]]-[[Tryambakeshwar]]. He took [[Mahasamadhi]] in 1575.

A '''kakistocracy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|k|ɪ|s|ˈ|t|ɒ|k|ɹ|ə|s|i|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɒ|k|-}}) is a system of government which is run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewitt|first1=Michael|title=Investing In A Kakistocracy|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellewitt/2016/10/13/investing-in-a-kakistocracy/#216ff3d479c1|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Forbes|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiske|first1=Robert Hartwell|title=The Best Words|date=2011|publisher=Marion Street Press|isbn=9781933338828|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=az5IE6Tu8OkC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was coined as early as the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="mw2962017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trending: When Government Is Just The Worst|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/news-trend-watch/when-government-is-just-the-worst-20170629|accessdate=22 August 2017|work=Merriam Webster|date=29 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also was used by English author [[Thomas Love Peacock]] in 1829, but gained significant use in the first decades of the twenty-first century to criticize populist governments emerging in different democracies around the world.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from two Greek words, ''kakistos'' ({{lang|grc|κάκιστος}}; worst) and ''kratos'' ({{lang|grc|κράτος}}; rule), with a literal meaning of government by the worst people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Rod L|title=Thingamajigs and Whatchamacallits: Unfamiliar Terms for Familiar Things|date=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101515921|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hWqD8iG0n4C&amp;pg=PT87|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic equivalents of the English word ''kakistocracy'' are as follows:  its Greek equivalent is ''kakistokratia'' ({{lang|grc|κακιστοκρατία}}), Catalan ''caquistocràcia'', Spanish ''kakistocracia'', French ''kakistocratie'', German ''Kakistokratie'', and Russian ''kakistokratiya'' ({{lang|ru|какистократия}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charalambidis|first1=Michalis|title=Μια άλλη Ελλάδα μπορεί να ανοίξει τη συζήτηση για την Ευρώπη|url=http://www.tovima.gr/opinions/article/?aid=478892|accessdate=8 December 2016|work=Tovima|date=11 October 2012|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Froelich|first1=Thomas J.|title=Anàlisi no tan breu de l'estat actual de l'ètica de la informació: ètica de la ignorància, informació incompleta, falsa i falsejada i altres formes d'engany i incompetència|url=http://bid.ub.edu/39/froehlich.htm|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=ca, en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dimopoulos|first1=Carlos|title=La kakistocracia: El gobierno de los peores - El Impulso|url=http://www.elimpulso.com/apartado-de-lectores/la-kakistocracia-el-gobierno-de-los-peores|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=El Impulso|date=10 August 2013|language=es-es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lavoie|first1=Gilbert|title=» La coalition de Legault restera "caquiste"|url=http://blogues.lapresse.ca/gilbertlavoie/2011/11/01/la-coalition-de-legault-restera-%C2%ABcaquiste%C2%BB/|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Blogues de La Presse|date=1 November 2011|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Какистократия переходного периода|url=http://politikan.com.ua/2/12/0/17150.htm|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Politikan|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest use of the word dates to the seventeenth century, in Paul Gosnold's ''A sermon Preached at the Publique Fast the ninth day of Aug. 1644 at St. Maries:''&lt;ref name="mw2962017"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore we need not make any scruple of praying against such: against those Sanctimonious Incendiaries, who have fetched fire from heaven to set their Country in combustion, have pretended Religion to raise and maintaine a most wicked rebellion: against those Nero's, who have ripped up the wombe of the mother that bare them, and wounded the breasts that gave them sucke: against those Cannibal's who feed upon the flesh and are drunke with the bloud of their own brethren: against those Catiline's who seeke their private ends in the publicke disturbance, and have set the Kingdome on fire to rost their owne egges: against those tempests of the State, those restlesse spirits who can no longer live, then be stickling and medling; who are stung with a perpetuall itch of changing and innovating, transforming our old Hierarchy into a new Presbytery, and this againe into a newer Independency; and our well-temperd Monarchy into a mad kinde of Kakistocracy. Good Lord!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gosnold|first1=Paul|title=A sermon preached at the publique fast the ninth day of Aug. 1644 at St. Maries, Oxford, before the honorable members of the two Houses of Parliament there assembled by Paul Gosnold ... ; and published by authority. |url=http://tei.it.ox.ac.uk/tcp/Texts-HTML/free/A41/A41582.html|publisher=University of Oxford Text Archive|accessdate=22 August 2017|language=en|date=1644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English author [[Thomas Love Peacock]] later used the term in his 1829 novel ''[[The Misfortunes of Elphin]]'', in which he explains kakistocracy represents the opposite of [[aristocracy]], as  ''aristos'' (ἄριστος) means "excellent" in Greek.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kakistocracy|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/kakistocracy|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1838 ''Memoir on Slavery'' (which he supported), U.S. Senator [[William Harper (South Carolina)|William Harper]] compared kakistocracy to [[anarchy]], and said it had seldom occurred:&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper|first1=William|title=Memoir on Slavery: Read Before the Society for the Advancement of Learning, of South Carolina, at its annual meeting at Columbia, 1837|date=1838|publisher=J. S. Burges|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=27 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Anarchy is not so much the absence of government as the government of the worst—not aristocracy but kakistocracy—a state of things, which to the honor of our nature, has seldom obtained amongst men, and which perhaps was only fully exemplified during the worst times of the [[French revolution]], when that horrid hell burnt with its most horrid flame. In such a state of things, to be accused is to be condemned—to protect the innocent is to be guilty; and what perhaps is the worst effect, even men of better nature, to whom their own deeds are abhorrent, are goaded by terror to be forward and emulous in deeds of guilt and violence.}}

American poet [[James Russell Lowell]] used the term in 1876, in a letter to [[Joel Benton]], writing, "What fills me with doubt and dismay is the degradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of Democracy? Is ours a 'government of the people by the people for the people,' or a Kakistocracy rather, for the benefit of knaves at the cost of fools?"&lt;ref name="fiske" /&gt;

==Usage==
{{Forms of government}}
Use of the word was rare in the early part of the 20th century, but it regained popularity in 1981 with criticism of the [[Reagan administration]]. Since then it has been employed to negatively describe various governments around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let's dump this kakistocracy for good |url=http://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/lets-dump-this-kakistocracy-for-good-2084926|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Sunday Independent|date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently used by conservative commentator [[Glenn Beck]] to describe the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Amro|title=Kakistocracy: a word we need to revive|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/arab-awakening/amro-ali/kakistocracy-word-we-need-to-revive|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=openDemocracy|date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word returned to use during the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], particularly by opponents and critics of Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cay Johnston|first1=David|title=Kakistocracy|url=http://www.nationalmemo.com/kakistocracy/|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=[[The National Memo]]|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, academic and blogger Amro Ali{{who|date=May 2018}} argued that kakistocracy was a word that needed to be revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=Amro|title=Kakistocracy: A word we need to revive|url=http://amroali.com/2016/05/kakistocracy-rule-by-the-stupid-unqualified/|website=amroali.com|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' would later credit Ali's blog post with initiating a wider conversation on the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/12/17/degeneration-nation-it-takes-a-village-of-idiots-to-raise-a-kakistocracy-like-donald-trumps/|title=Degeneration nation: It takes a village of idiots to raise a kakistocracy like Donald Trump’s|last=McClennen|first=Sophia A.|website=Salon|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Dan Leger of the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] newspaper ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'' suggested that a Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election would require renewed use of the term "kakistocracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leger|first1=Dan|title=LEGER: Trump’s America would be a 'kakistocracy, ruled by most corrupt or incompetent|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/opinion/1390469-leger-trump%E2%80%99s-america-would-be-a-%E2%80%98kakistocracy%E2%80%99-ruled-by-most-corrupt-or-incompetent|work=[[The Chronicle Herald]]|date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 2016, the word has been used to describe the Trump administration by critics of that administration on multiple occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bouie|first1=Jamelle|title=Government by the Worst Men| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/donald_trump_is_bringing_america_government_by_the_worst_men.html|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Slate|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Del Signore|first1=John|title=Stay Tuned For Trump's Reality Show 'American Kakistocracy'|url=http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/will_america_fire_itself.php|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Gothamist|date=17 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120114818/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/will_america_fire_itself.php|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marsden|first1=Harriet|title=Kakistocracy may just be the perfect word to describe the Trump government|url=https://www.indy100.com/article/donald-trump-us-president-new-government-white-house-kakistocracy-7422706|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=The Independent|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lizza|first1=Ryan|title=Donald Trump's First, Alarming Week as President-Elect|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trumps-first-alarming-week-as-president-elect|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=The New Yorker|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/opinion/sunday/the-trump-tweets-i-want-to-read.html|title=The Trump Tweets I Want to Read|last=Mandvi|first=Aasif|date=2016-12-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolf|first1=Stephen|title=Trump's presidency is shaping up to be a kakistocracy: government by the worst possible people|url=http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/11/25/1602547/-Trump-s-presidency-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-kakistocracy-government-by-the-worst-possible-people|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=Daily Kos|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|title=With All Due Disrespect|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/opinion/with-all-due-disrespect.html|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasan|first1=Mehdi|title=Donald Trump ushers in a new era of kakistocracy: government by the worst people|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2017/01/donald-trump-ushers-new-era-kakistocracy-government-worst-people|accessdate=20 January 2017|work=[[The New Statesman]]|date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ornstein|first1=Norm|title=There's a Word for the State of American Democracy: Kakistocracy|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/american-kakistocracy/542391/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=johnbrennan|author=John Brennan|number=984803286006951936|date=13 April 2018|title=Your kakistocracy is collapsing after its lamentable journey.

The '''language tax''' is an [[economics|economic]] concept proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] economist [[Philippe Van Parijs]].&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Van Parijs, [http://www1.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf Europe's three language problems], in: Multilingualism in Law and Politics {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511222928/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf |date=May 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to compensate countries with a less widespread language for their expenses for teaching and translation.

Van Parijs points out that [[Jonathan Pool]] had proposed this kind of taxation in 1991 but criticizes Pool's proposal to distribute the cost of language learning on a [[per capita]] basis.

An analogous concept is found in the work of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] economist [[François Grin]],&lt;ref&gt;François Grin, [http://cisad.adc.education.fr/hcee/documents/rapport_Grin.pdf L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010075147/http://cisad.adc.education.fr/hcee/documents/rapport_Grin.pdf |date=2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that such countries are implicitly paying an ''impôt linguistique'' (literally also meaning "language tax") to countries with a "strong" language. In a similar sense, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Partito Radicale|Radical Party]] speaks of a ''tassa inglese''&lt;ref&gt;[http://coranet.radicalparty.org/pressreleases/press_release.php?func=detail&amp;par=7817 I costi della tassa "inglese"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310194941/http://coranet.radicalparty.org/pressreleases/press_release.php?func=detail&amp;par=7817 |date=2007-03-10 }}, press release 2005/21/10&lt;/ref&gt; ("English tax").

Most [[language]]s of [[Europe]] belong to the '''[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]''' [[language family]]. 
Out of a [[demographics of Europe|total population]] of 744 million (as of 2018), some 94% are native speakers of an Indo-European language;
within Indo-European, the three largest phyla are '''[[Slavic languages|Slavic]]''', '''[[Romance languages|Romance]]''' and '''[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]''', with more than 200 million speakers each, between them accounting for close to 90% of Europeans. Smaller phyla of Indo-European found in Europe include [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]], c. 10 million), [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] (c. 7 million), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (c. 5 million), [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Romani language|Romani]], c. 1.5 million) and [[Celtic language|Celtic]] (including Welsh, c. 1 million). 

Of c. 45 million Europeans speaking non-Indo-European languages, around 20 million each fall within the '''[[Uralic languages|Uralic]]''' and '''[[Turkic languages|Turkic]]''' families. Still smaller groups (such as [[Basque language|Basque]] and various [[languages of the Caucasus]]) account for less than 1% of European population between them. Immigration has added sizeable communities of speakers of African and Asian languages, amounting to about 4% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International migrant stock: By destination and origin|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimatesorigin.shtml|publisher=United Nations}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Arabic]] being the most widely spoken of them.
Five languages have more than 50 million native speakers in Europe: [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]]. While Russian has the largest number of native speakers (more than 100 million in Europe), [[English language in Europe|English in Europe]] has the largest number of speakers in total, including some 200 million speakers of [[English as a second language]].

== Indo-European languages ==
{{See also|List of Indo-European languages}}

The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]] is descended from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], which is believed to have been spoken thousands of years ago. Early speakers of Indo-European daughter languages most likely expanded into Europe with the incipient [[European Bronze Age|Bronze Age]], around 4,000 years ago ([[Bell-Beaker culture]]). 

=== Slavic ===
{{See also|Slavic languages|Slavs}}
[[File:SlavicEurope.png|thumb|300px|Distribution of Slavic-speaking populations in Europe
{{legend|#005500|Official Slavic language used by the majority}}
{{legend|#00AA00|Significant unofficial / co-official / historical Slavic language usage}}
{{legend|#55FF55|Significant non-Slavic language usage or bilingual}}]]
[[Slavic languages]] are spoken in large areas of [[Central Europe]], [[Southern Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. An estimated 250 million Europeans are native speakers of Slavic languages, the largest groups being 
[[Russian language|Russian]] (c. 110 million in [[European Russia]] and adjacient parts of Eastern Europe, Russian forming the largest linguistic community in Europe), 
[[Polish language|Polish]] (c. 55 million),
[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (c. 40 million), 
[[Serbo-Croatian]] (c. 21 million),&lt;!--includes Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin--&gt;
[[Czech language|Czech]] (c. 11 million),
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (c. 9 million), 
[[Slovak language|Slovak]] (c. 5 million)
[[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (c. 3 million each)
and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (c. 2 million).

Phylogenetically, Slavic is divided into three subgroups:
* '''[[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]]''' includes [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]], [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]] and [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]].
* '''[[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]]''' includes [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]].
* '''[[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]]''' is divided into Southeast Slavic and Southwest Slavic groups: ''Southwest Slavic languages'' include [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], each with numerous distinctive dialects. Serbo-Croatian boasts four distinct national standards, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], all based on the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]]; ''Southeast Slavic languages'' include [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]] (a [[liturgical language]]).

=== Romance ===
{{see|Romance languages|Italic languages}}
[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Romance languages, 20th century]]
Roughly 225 million Europeans (primarily in Southern and Western Europe) are native speakers of [[Romance languages]], the largest groups including
[[French language|French]] (c. 76 million),
[[Italian language|Italian]] (c. 65 million),
[[Spanish language|Spanish (Castilian)]] (c. 40 million), 
[[Romanian language|Romanian]] (c. 25 million),
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (c. 10 million),
[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] (c. 5 million, also subsumed under Italian),
[[Catalan language|Catalan]] (c. 4 million),
[[Galician language|Galician]] (c. 2 million),
[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (c. 1 million),
[[Occitan language|Occitan]] (c. 500,000),
besides numerous smaller communities.

The Romance languages are descended from varieties of [[Vulgar Latin]] spoken in the various parts of the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Latin]] was itself part of the (otherwise extinct) [[Italic languages|Italic]] branch of Indo-European.
Romance is divided phylogenetically into '''[[Italo-Western languages|Italo-Western]]''', '''[[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance]]''' (including [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) and '''[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]'''. The Romance-speaking area in Europe is often referred to as [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friedman |first1=Lawrence |last2=Perez-Perdomo |first2=Rogelio |date=2003 |title=Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEMUKyPTE9AC |location= |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page= |isbn=0804766959 |author-link1=Lawrence M.

Italo-Western in turn has the sub-branches '''[[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]]''' (sometimes grouped with Eastern Romance), including Tuscan-derived [[Italian language|Italian]] and numerous [[Languages of Italy|local Romance lects in Italy]] as well as [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]], and the '''[[Western Romance languages]]'''.

The Western Romance languages in turn separate into:
* '''[[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]]''', including [[French language|French]] and its varieties ([[Langues d'oïl]]), the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], and the [[Gallo-Italic languages]],
* '''[[Occitano-Romance languages|Occito-Romance (East Iberian)]]''', grouped with either Gallo-Romance or West Iberian, including [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]],
* '''[[West Iberian languages|West Iberian]] (Spanish-Portuguese)''', including [[Astur-Leonese languages]], [[Galician-Portuguese]] and [[Castilian languages|Castilian]].

The [[Germanic languages]] make up the predominant language family in [[northwestern Europe]].
An estimated 200 million Europeans are native speakers of Germanic languages, the largest groups being [[German-speaking Europe|German]] (c. 95 million), [[English language in Europe|English]] (c. 65 million) and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (c. 24 million), [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (c. 10 million), [[Danish language|Danish]] (c. 6 million) and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (c. 5 million). 

There are two extant major sub-divisions: [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] and [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]. A third group, [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], is now extinct; the only known surviving East Germanic texts are written in the [[Gothic language]].
West Germanic is divided into [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] (including [[English language|English]]), [[Low German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (including [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[High German]] (including [[Standard German]]).

;German and Low Franconian
{{Main article|German language|German-speaking Europe|Low Franconian|Dutch-speaking Europe}}
[[German language|German]] is spoken throughout [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[East Cantons of Belgium]], much of [[Switzerland]] (including the northeast areas bordering on Germany and Austria) and northern [[Italy]] ([[South Tyrol]]).

There are several groups of German dialects:
* [[High German]] include several dialect families:
** [[German language|Standard German]]
** [[Central German]] dialects, spoken in central Germany and include [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]]
** [[High Franconian]], a family of transitional dialects between Central and Upper High German
** [[Upper German]], including [[Austro-Bavarian]] and [[Swiss German]]
** [[Yiddish]] is a [[Jewish language]] developed in Germany and shares many features of High German dialects and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

[[Low German]] (including Low Saxon) is spoken in various regions throughout Northern Germany and the North and East of the Netherlands. It is an official language in Germany. 
It may be separated into [[West Low German|Low Saxon (West Low German)]] and [[East Low German]].

[[Dutch language|Dutch]] is spoken throughout the [[Netherlands]], northern [[Belgium]], as well as the [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] region of [[France]], and around [[Düsseldorf]] in Germany. In Belgian and French contexts, Dutch is sometimes referred to as [[Flemish]]. [[Dutch dialects]] are varied and cut across national borders. 

;'''Anglo-Frisian'''
{{Main article|Anglo-Frisian languages|English-speaking Europe}}
The [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian language family]] is now mostly represented by [[English languages|English (Anglic)]], descended from the [[Old English language]] spoken by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]:
* [[English language|English]], the main language of the [[United Kingdom]], also used in [[English-speaking Europe]]
* [[Scots language|Scots]], spoken in [[Scotland]] and [[Ulster]].
The [[Frisian languages]] are spoken by about 500,000 [[Frisians]], who live on the southern coast of the [[North Sea]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]. These languages include [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], [[Saterlandic]], and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]].

;North Germanic (Scandinavian) 
The '''[[North Germanic languages]]''' are spoken in [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] and include [[Danish language|Danish]] ([[Denmark]]), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ([[Norway]]), [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ([[Sweden]] and parts of [[Finland]]), or [[Elfdalian]] (in a small part of central Sweden), [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ([[Faroe Islands]]), and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ([[Iceland]]).

English has a long history of contact with Scandinavian languages, given the immigration of Scandinavians early in the history of Britain, and has similar structure with Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121127094111.htm|title=Linguist makes sensational claim: English is a Scandinavian language|website=ScienceDaily|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Indo-European languages ==

=== Uralic ===
{{Main article|Uralic languages}}
[[File:Oeraals verspreiding-af.svg|bélyegkép|thumb|right|350px|Distribution of Uralic languages in Eurasia]]

Uralic is native to northern Eurasia. [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] groups the Uralic languages other than [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]. 
[[Finnic languages]] include [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. The [[Sami languages]] are closely related to Finnic.

The [[Ugric languages]] are represented in Europe with the [[Hungarian language]], historically introduced with the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] of the 9th century.

The Samoyedic [[Nenets language]] is spoken in [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] in the far northeastern corner of Europe (as [[Extreme_points_of_Europe#Mainland_Europe|delimited]] by the [[Ural Mountains]]).

* The [[Basque language]] (or ''Euskara'') is a [[language isolate]] and the ancestral language of the [[Basque people]] who inhabit the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region in the western [[Pyrenees]] mountains mostly in northeastern [[Spain]] and partly in southwestern [[France]] of about 3&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants, where it is spoken fluently by about 750,000 and understood by more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people. Basque is directly related to [[Aquitanian language|ancient Aquitanian]], and it is likely that an early form of the Basque language was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages in the area in the [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]].

* [[North Caucasian languages]] is a geographical blanket term for two unrelated [[Language family|language families]] spoken chiefly in the north [[Caucasus]] and [[Turkey]]—the [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]] family (including [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and [[Adyghe language|Circassian]]) and the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] family, spoken mainly in the border area of the southern [[Russian Federation]] (including [[Dagestan]], [[Chechnya]], and [[Ingushetia]]).

It is also the smallest official language of the [[European Union|EU]] in terms of speakers, and the only official Semitic language within the EU. [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]] (also known as Cypriot Arabic) is a [[varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] spoken by [[Maronite]]s in [[Cyprus]]. Most speakers live in [[Nicosia]], but others are in the communities of [[Kormakiti]] and [[Limassol|Lemesos]]. Brought to the island by Maronites fleeing [[Lebanon]] over 700 years ago, this variety of Arabic has been influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]] in both [[phonology]] and [[vocabulary]], while retaining certain unusually archaic features in other respects.

== History of standardization ==
{{see|Ethnic groups in Europe#History|Vernacular|De vulgari eloquentia}}

=== Language and identity, standardization processes ===
In the Middle Ages the two most important defining elements of Europe were ''Christianitas'' and ''Latinitas''. Thus language—at least the supranational language—played an elementary role{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}.
The earliest dictionaries were glossaries, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) ''[[Abrogans]]'' was among the first. A new wave of [[lexicography]] can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the printing press, with the growing interest in standardizing languages).

The concept of the [[nation state]] begins to emerge in the [[early modern period]]. Nations adopted particular dialects as their national language. This, together with improved communications, led to official efforts to standardise the [[national language]], and a number of language academies were established (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;1582 ''[[Accademia della Crusca]]'' in Florence, 1617 ''[[Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft]]'' in Weimar, 1635 ''[[Académie française]]'' in Paris, 1713 ''[[Real Academia Española]]'' in Madrid). Language became increasingly linked to nation as opposed to culture, and was also used to promote religious and ethnic identity (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;different [[Bible translations]] in the same language for Catholics and Protestants).

The first languages for which standardisation was promoted included Italian (''questione della lingua'': Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian → Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (the standard is based on Parisian), English (the standard is based on the London dialect) and (High) German (based on the dialects of the chancellery of Meissen in Saxony, Middle German, and the chancellery of Prague in Bohemia ("Common German")). But several other nations also began to develop a standard variety in the 16th century.

=== Lingua franca ===
Europe has had a number of languages that were considered [[linguae francae]] over some ranges for some periods according to some historians. Typically in the rise of a national language the new language becomes a lingua franca to peoples in the range of the future nation until the consolidation and unification phases. If the nation becomes internationally influential, its language may become a lingua franca among nations that speak their own national languages. Europe has had no lingua franca ranging over its entire territory spoken by all or most of its populations during any historical period. Some linguae francae of past and present over some of its regions for some of its populations are:

=== Linguistic minorities ===
Historical attitudes towards linguistic diversity are illustrated by two French laws: the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts|Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] (1539), which said that every document in France should be written in French (neither in Latin nor in Occitan) and the [[Toubon Law|Loi Toubon]] (1994), which aimed to eliminate anglicisms from official documents. States and populations within a state have often resorted to war to settle their differences. There have been attempts to prevent such hostilities: two such initiatives were promoted by the [[Council of Europe]], founded in 1949, which affirms the right of minority language speakers to use their language fully and freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: Strasbourg, 5.XI.1992|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|publisher=Council of Europe|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe is committed to protecting linguistic diversity. Currently all European countries except [[France]], [[Andorra]] and [[Turkey]] have signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], while [[Greece]], [[Iceland]] and [[Luxembourg]] have signed it, but have not ratified it; this framework entered into force in 1998. Another European treaty, the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], was adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]]: it entered into force in 1998, and while it is legally binding for 24 countries, [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]] and [[Russia]] have chosen to sign without ratifying the convention.

]]--&gt;
 
The main scripts used in Europe today are the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. 

The [[Greek alphabet]] was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and Latin was derived from the Greek via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]. In the Early Middle Ages, [[Ogham]] was used in Ireland and [[runes]] (derived the Old Italic script) in Scandinavia. Both were replaced in general use by the Latin alphabet by the Late Middle Ages. The Cyrillic script was derived from the Greek with the first texts appearing around 940&amp;nbsp;AD.

{{See also|Antiqua–Fraktur dispute}}
Around 1900 there were mainly two typeface variants of the [[Latin alphabet]] used in Europe: [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] and [[Fraktur]]. Fraktur was used most for German, Estonian, Latvian, Norwegian and Danish whereas Antiqua was used for Italian, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, English, Romanian, Swedish and Finnish. The Fraktur variant was banned by [[Hitler]] in 1941, having been described as "[[Schwabacher]] Jewish letters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]&lt;br /&gt;
The memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.&lt;br /&gt;"For general attention, on behalf of the Führer, I make the following announcement:&lt;br /&gt;It is wrong to regard or to describe the so‑called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so‑called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.&lt;br /&gt;Today the Führer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf Müller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.&lt;br /&gt;The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.&lt;br /&gt;On behalf of the Führer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script".&lt;/ref&gt; Other scripts have historically been in use in Europe, including Phoenician, from which modern Latin letters descend, Ancient [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] on Egyptian artefacts traded during Antiquity various runic systems used in Northern Europe preceding Christianisation, and Arabic during the era of the Ottoman Empire.

[[Old Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian rovás]] was used by the Hungarian people in the early Middle Ages, but it was gradually replaced with the Latin-based Hungarian alphabet when Hungary became a kingdom, though it was revived in the 20th century and has certain marginal, but growing area of usage since then.

=== European Union ===
{{main|Languages of the European Union}}
The [[European Union]] (as of 2016) had 28 member states accounting for a population of 510 million, or about 69% of the population of Europe. 

The European Union has designated by agreement with the member states 24 languages as "official and working:" Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages Policy: Linguistic diversity: Official languages of the EU|url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm|publisher=European Commission, European Union|date=4 June 2009|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This designation provides member states with two "entitlements:" the member state may communicate with the EU in the designated one of those languages and view "EU regulations and other legislative documents" in that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages of Europe: Official EU languages |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/languages-of-europe/doc135_en.htm |publisher=European Commission, European Union |year=2009 |accessdate=5 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202112407/http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/languages-of-europe/doc135_en.htm |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union and the [[Council of Europe]] have been collaborating in education of member populations in languages for "the promotion of plurilingualism" among EU member states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR) |url=http://www.coe.int/T/DG4/Linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=5 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030205032/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |archivedate=30 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint document, "[[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]]: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR)", is an educational standard defining "the competencies necessary for communication" and related knowledge for the benefit of educators in setting up educational programs. 
In a 2005 independent survey requested by the EU's [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Education and Culture]] regarding the extent to which major European languages were spoken in member states. The results were published in a 2006 document, "Europeans and Their Languages", or "Eurobarometer&amp;nbsp;243". In this study, statistically relevant samples of the population in each country were asked to fill out a survey form concerning the languages that they spoke with sufficient competency "to be able to have a conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeans and Their Languages|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=European Commission|year=2006|accessdate=November 5, 2009|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a table of European languages. The number of speakers as a first or second language (L1 and L2 speakers) listed are speakers in Europe only;{{refn|"Europe" is taken as a geographical term, [[Europe#Definition|defined]] by the conventional [[Europe-Asia boundary]] along the Caucasus and the Urals. Estimates for populations geographically in Europe are given for [[transcontinental countries]].|group=nb}} see [[list of languages by number of native speakers]] and [[list of languages by total number of speakers]] for global estimates on numbers of speakers.

The list includes any language or dialect with an [[ISO 639]] code; this means that some communities of speakers within a [[macrolanguage]] may be listed more than once, e.g. speakers of   [[Austro-Bavarian]]  listed both separately (under ''bar'') and subsumed in the total given under "German" (''de'').

==Immigrant communities==
Recent (post-1945) [[immigration to Europe]] introduced substantial communities of speakers of non-European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International migrant stock: By destination and origin|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimatesorigin.shtml|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest such communities include [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speakers  (see [[Arabs in Europe]])
and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] speakers (beyond [[European Turkey]] and the historical sphere of influence of the [[Ottoman Empire]], see [[Turks in Europe]]).&lt;ref name="Cole 2011 loc=367"&gt;{{citation |last=Cole|first=Jeffrey|year=2011|title=Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia|place=|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-59884-302-8|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Armenian diaspora|Armenians]], [[Berbers]] and [[Kurds]] have diaspora communities of c. 1&amp;ndash;2 million each. The various [[languages of Africa]] and [[languages of India]] form numerous smaller diaspora communities.

The '''Lawrence Campbell Oratory Competition'''  is an annual competition in impromptu public speaking between representatives of each of the [[Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales|Great Public Schools]] (GPS) and [[Combined Associated Schools]] (CAS) in [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was established in 1935, in honour of Lawrence Campbell, a famous teacher of elocution in various schools in Sydney, in the early twentieth century. Between 2006 and 2013, in all but one year (2009), the competition was won by a student in year 11. At the [[World University Debating Championship|2015 World University Debating Championships]] in Malaysia, three of the eight speakers in the Grand Final (representing Sydney, Oxford, and Harvard) were former Lawrence Campbell winners – a testament to the quality of the Lawrence Campbell competition.

== Format ==
The Lawrence Campbell Oratory is widely regarded as the most prestigious, and difficult of the New South Wales Public Speaking Competitions. Each candidate is required to give a speech of eight minutes length of one of three topics given to him or her 15 minutes beforehand. In this competition, the emphasis is on oratory, the art of speech, and so the manner of delivery counts at least equally with the subject matter. The emphasis is on giving a speech that combines humour with pathos, dramatic elements with more conversational moments, serious commentary with light-hearted asides, quotations drawn from a variety of sources, but all around a common thread based on the chosen topic, and showing the style of the candidate. Accordingly, the style of speech is very different from many other public speaking competitions in which candidates research and prepare speeches of their own in advance, often on questions of current affairs or public policy. With only fifteen minutes to prepare and without the aid of books or references, the content of the speech will test the candidates' general knowledge and ingenuity.

Each school is represented by one speaker.  Saint Ignatius’ College has the most distinguished history, with twenty-two winning candidates in the competition's history. In recent years, Sydney Grammar, Newington College and Barker College have been the most successful schools. Waverley College and The Armidale School have never fielded a winning candidate.

== Topics ==
Because of the emphasis on oratory, the topics usually admit of wide latitude for the candidates to be creative. Often, quotations from literature, public figures, and popular culture are chosen as topics, along with proverbs or even single words.  Past topics include:
* Assume a virtue if you have it not
* One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name
* I must follow them, for I am their leader
* He thinks too much – such men are dangerous
* Because it was there
* If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it
* The devil can recite scripture for his purpose
* When in disgrace...
* Hope
* Eureka
* The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in the stars
* Lyposuction
* Away
* I am Fate's lieutenant; I act under orders
* Couch Jumping
* Right as the world goes is only in issue between equals in power while the strong do as they will and the weak suffer as they must
* "Chaos Often Breeds Life When Order Breeds Habit" (1980)
* "Look at my works, you mighty, and despair" (2011)
* Born This Way (2011)
* Two cheers for Democracy (2011)
* Blood will have Blood (2013)
* The Usual Suspects (2013)
* The kindness of strangers (2013)

== Notable past winners ==
The Lawrence Campbell oratory competition has many distinguished previous winners, particularly in the areas of law, politics, and the arts. Famous past winners include:

* [[Nick Enright]] (Riverview, playwright)
* [[Charles Firth (comedian)|Charles Firth]] (Sydney Grammar, comedian and television personality from ''[[The Chaser]]'' team)
* [[Murray Gleeson]] (St. Joseph's, [[Chief Justice of Australia]])
* [[Nick Greiner]] (Riverview, former [[Premier of NSW]])
* [[John Hamilton (judge)|John Hamilton]] (Judge of the [[Supreme Court of NSW]])
* [[Clifton Hoeben]] (Riverview, judge of the [[Supreme Court of NSW]])
* [[Mungo Wentworth MacCallum|Mungo MacCallum]] (Cranbrook, journalist and member of the Wentworth squatocracy)
* [[Andrew O'Keefe]] (Riverview, comedian and television presenter)
* [[Adam Spencer]] (St. Aloysius', [[ABC Television]] and radio presenter)
* [[Malcolm Turnbull]] (Sydney Grammar, Prime Minister of Australia)
* [[Lloyd Waddy]] (monarchist, Judge of the Family Court)
* [[Anthony Whealy]] (Judge of the [[Supreme Court of NSW]])

The only people to have won the competition on two occasions are:

* RW Bowie (Sydney Grammar – 1939, 1940)
* [[Murray Gleeson]] (St Joseph's – 1953, 1955)
* Anthony Jones (Scots – 1999, 2000)
* Jeremy Raper (Sydney Grammar – 2001, 2002)
* Joseph Ware (Barker College – 2008, 2009)

== Controversies ==
There have been many controversies in the history of the competition. These usually arise out of allegations of plagiarism and the use of prepared material in the speech.

Often, the candidate is given the benefit of any doubt, if only because candidates train intensively for the competition and must necessarily think of themes, quotations, and one-liners that may emerge in the speech the candidate later gives at the competition.  However, the wholesale repetition of prepared material is strongly discouraged, and with enough proof, a winner may be stripped of the title if wholesale preparation is shown.

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}

'''Lethality''' (also called '''deadliness''' or '''perniciousness''') is how capable something is of causing [[death]]. Most often it is used when referring to [[chemical weapons]], [[biological weapons]], or their [[toxic]] chemical components.  The use of this term denotes the ability of these weapons to kill, but also the possibility that they may not kill.  Reasons for the lethality of a weapon to be inconsistent, or expressed by percentage, can be as varied as minimized exposure to the weapon, previous exposure to the weapon minimizing susceptibility, degradation of the weapon over time and/or distance, and incorrect deployment of a multi-component weapon.

This term can also refer to the after-effects of weapon use, such as [[nuclear fallout]], which has highest lethality nearest the deployment site, and in proportion to the subject's size and nature; e.g. a child or small animal.

Lethality can also refer to the after-effects of a chemical explosion.  A lethality curve can be developed for process safety reasons to protect people and equipment.  The impact is typically greatest closest to the explosion site and lessens to the outskirts of the impact zone.  Pressure, toxicity and location affect the lethality.

Lethality is also a term used by microbiologists and food scientists as a measure of the ability of a process to destroy bacteria. Lethality may be determined by enumeration of survivors after incremental exposures.

[[Internet slang]] prior to the popularization of the Internet in the late 1990's, defined a '''luser''' (sometimes expanded to '''local user'''; also '''luzer''' or '''luzzer''') as a painfully annoying, stupid, or irritating [[computer user]].&lt;ref name="McFedries"&gt;{{cite book

}}p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]], the word ''luser'' takes on a broad meaning, referring to any normal [[user (computing)|user]] (in other words, not a "[[Expert|guru]]"), with the implication the person is also a [[Loser (person)|loser]]. The term is partially interchangeable with the hacker term ''[[lamer]]''. 

It can also signify a [[layman]] with only [[user (computing)|user]] account [[Privilege (computing)|privileges]], as opposed to a [[power user]] or [[Superuser|administrator]], who has knowledge of, and access to, [[superuser]] accounts; for example, an '''[[End-user (computer science)|end luser]]''' who cannot be trusted with a root account for [[system administration]]. This term is popular with technical support staff who have to deal with lusers as part of their job, often metaphorically employing a '''LART''' ('''Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool''', also known as a '''[[Dimensional lumber|clue-by-four]]''', '''cluestick''', or '''cluebat'''), meaning turning off the user's access to computer resources and the like.

==History==

The [[Jargon File]] states that the word was coined around 1975 at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/L/luser.html|title=luser|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]], when a user first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed [[control-Z]] to get the computer's attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer. A patch to the system was then written to print "14 losers" instead of "14 users", as a joke. For a while, several [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] who disagreed on the appropriateness of the change struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the backs of the others; any time a user logged into the computer it was equally probable that a user would see, say, "users" or "losers". Finally, someone tried the compromise "lusers", and it stuck. Later, ITS also had the command "luser", which attempted to summon assistance from a list of designated helpers.

Although ITS ceased to be used in the mid-1990s,  use of the term continued to spread, partly because in [[Unix]]-style computer operating systems, "[[User (computing)|user]]" designates all unprivileged accounts, while the [[superuser]], or root, is the special user account used for system administration. "root" is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes (single- or multi-user). The usage lives on, however, and the term "luser" is often seen in program comments and on [[Usenet]].

On [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], &lt;tt&gt;/lusers&lt;/tt&gt; (which abbreviates "list users") is a common command to get the number of users connected to a server or network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/misc/ccosmos.html#Heading852|title=irchelp.org|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Windows operating systems, lusrmgr.msc is the [[Microsoft Management Console|MMC]] snap-in used to manage local users.

'''Maltralian''' (in Maltese: '''Il-Maltraljan'''), is the [[Maltese language]] of [[Australia]], spoken by Maltese [[emigrant]]s in the continent.

The development of the Maltese language in a country far removed from Malta continued, in an environment that maintained a sense of origin and culture. It is essential to look to the history of this development in order to appreciate the Maltese dialect spoken in Australia.

==History of Maltese emigrants to Australia==
{{main|Maltese Australians}}
{{off topic}}

As a sailor nation, the Maltese began to travel many centuries ago. Many Maltese found work in the navy of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of St. John]]. Pre-dating this, the Maltese people were known as good sailors in the [[Mediterranean]] region. However, modern forms of transportation and sudden economic changes prompted mass emigration from Malta.

In 1882 Australia welcomed the first official group of immigrants from Malta, 8 immigrants sent there as part of an experiment conducted by the Maltese Imperial Government. 40 years after that first emigration to Australia, emigration began on a larger scale. Between 1911 and 1939 6,000 Maltese people emigrated to Australia and in the ten years between 1940 and 1949 numbers rose to 8,000. In the twenty years after 1949 Australia welcomed over 61,000 emigrants. 1956 saw 10,300 emigrants from Malta enter Australia. Later numbers of emigrants decreased until, in the early 1970s, the Australian authorities closed the doors for all European emigrants.

==Origins of a new Maltese dialect==

The first trace of a change in the Maltese language in Australia was evidenced in 1929 with the publication of Charles Parnis's books, the first Maltese journalist in Australia. These writings included various expressions and vocabulary not included in standard Maltese. This documentation of an Australian-Maltese dialect in journals suggest that its origins go back before 1929.

After these first publications in Maltese by Charles Parnis and some other writers who wrote from 1929 to 1935, there was a pause in work published by Australian-Maltese authors, due to the Second World War. Publication of Australian-Maltese works resumed (in the Maltese language) after 1949, in Melbourne.

==Some Maltralian Characteristics==

The Maltese language in Australia developed a different style from the Standard Maltese, in part due to the Australian social environment.

Maltralian divergences from standard Maltese include:

*The word ''blaġa'' (bludger), a masculine and feminine noun, with the verb ''ibblaġġja'', neither of which occur in Standard Maltese.
*Maltese words developed a new format like ''iddmanda'' (to demand) from the Maltese word ''tiddomanda''.
*Words like ''kejn''/''kejna'' rather than ''kannamieli'' or ''blinka'' (blinker) but not the Standard ''indikejter'' (indicator).
*Standard Maltese uses ''appoġġa'' for help, but Maltralian uses ''rifed''.
*Standard Maltese uses ''bank'' for bank, but Maltralian uses ''mislef''.
*There is a lack of Italian influence in the Maltralian dialect, unlike Standard Maltese, for example ''ċaw'' (bye) is not used but ''saħħa'' is, ''awguri'' is not used but ''nifraħlek'' or ''nixtieqlek ir-risq'' are. However, these Semitic expressions are still present in Standard Maltese.
*For ''futbol'' (football) in Maltralian use ''soker'', not traditionally used in Standard Maltese.
*The plural of ''dar'' (home) in Maltese is ''djar'' (homes) but in Maltralian the plural of ''dar'' is ''djars'', ''darsijiet'' or ''djarsijiet''. For ''buttuna'' (button) the Standard plural ''buttuni'' in not used, in favour of ''btaten''. ''Tifla'' (girl) does not take the Standard plural ''bniet'' but ''tifliet''.
*The word 'cheap' in Maltese is ''irħis'' (cheap) and ''irħas'' (cheaper), but in Maltralian ''iċep'' and ''iċjep'' are used.

'''Mashco Puro''' is a [[Maipurean language]] spoken in [[Peru]]. It is also called Cujareño. It is very similar to the [[Piro language (Peru)|Piro]], with an estimated 60% inherent intelligibility.&lt;ref name=e15/&gt; Kaufman considered it a dialect of Piro; Aikhenvald suggests it may rather be a dialect of otherwise extinct [[Iñapari language|Iñapari]].

Language documentation is limited, since the [[Mascho Piro]] are highly nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]]&lt;ref name=e15/&gt; who avoid contact with outsiders. The name Cujareño has been associated with the [[Panoan languages]], though without much evidence.

'''''Miguxês''''' ({{IPA-pt|miɡuˈʃes}} or {{IPA-pt|miɣuˈʃeʃ|}}), also known in [[Portugal]] as '''''pita talk''''' or '''''pita script''''' (&lt;small&gt;pronounced &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|ˈpitɐ|}}), is an [[Internet slang]] of the [[Portuguese language]], commonly used by mostly [[Brazil]]ian teenagers in [[Internet]] and other electronic media, such as messages written in [[cell phone]].

==Brief history==

Its name derives from ''miguxo'', a corruption from ''amiguxo'', turn a term used for ''amiguinho'', or "buddy" in Portuguese. This [[sociolect]] of Vernacular [[Brazilian Portuguese]] brings possible simplifications in the grammatical structures, since the vehicles in which ''miguxês'' is used are nearly universally colloquial, often space-delimited (such as [[SMS message]]s, [[instant messenger]]s or [[social network]]s). It also tends to have "simpler" orthography in comparison to standard Portuguese orthography, which leads to the most strong criticism to it (''miguxês'' without its common alternative spellings is associated with the just normal Internet and/or youth slang).

There are identitarian and orthographic differences between the so-called [[leet]]speak, ''miguxês'', ''tiopês'' and ''internetês'' — Brazilian Portuguese for [[netspeak]], which is by far the one that most closely resembles standard Portuguese —, all common sociolects found in the Portuguese-speaking digital network community, the three latter ones created in it.

Basically, the use of each category depends on the individual choice and the environment in which people are interacting. While in the Internet, in a general manner, there is a handful of a different phenomenon in which users communicate with abbreviations to simplify writing, ''miguxês'' carries with it an effective intention, that is, to express an infantile language in a conversation between friends, or even satirize this style of communication. In certain subcultures in Brazil, especially in the case of what is called '[[emo]]' there, ''miguxês'' is an item of group identification. So it would not be unusual for someone which opposes such subcultures to also develop a distaste for ''miguxês''. Brazilian '[[Emo#Backlash|anti-emo]]' groups usually satirize 'emo' teenagers with use of ''miguxês''.

Together with the cited urban tribes, they started to fell out of the mainstream in the early 2010s, so that they have much lower popularity with the following teen generation that did not see its spreading as a frequent Internet meme.

==Spelling==

Although orthography rules of ''miguxês'' may vary individually, and also in each region and in different [[urban tribe]]s since it is plain broken Portuguese, there are certain characteristics often commonly found as:

* Replacement of ''s'' and ''c'' for ''x'', simulating the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of native Portuguese-speaking children's speech through their language acquisition: ''você'' (Second person singular), ''vocês'' (Second person plural) &gt; ''vuxeh'', ''vuxeix'';
* Omission or replacement of [[diacritics]], notably by replacing an acute accent over a vowel with the letter ''h'' after the vowel as in ''é'' ("is") &gt; ''eh'' (to distinguish it from the word ''e'' meaning "and") or ''será'' ("will be") &gt; ''serah''. Or replacing the [[tilde]] with ''n''/''m'' to indicate nasalization: ''não'' ("no") &gt; ''nawn''/''naum''
* Replacement of ''i'' by ''ee'', influenced by [[English language]] orthography: ''gatinha'' (female kitten, also a slang for pretty girl) &gt; ''gateenha'';
* Replacement of ''o'' and ''e'' by ''u'' and ''i'' respectively, specially in non-tonic syllables: ''quero'' (I want) &gt; ''keru''.
* Replacing the digraph ''qu'' and the letter ''c'' as ''k'' both for brevity and as a form of [[sensational spelling]], and deleting the ''u'' of these environments: ''quem'' (who), ''escreveu'' (wrote) &gt; ''kem'', ''ixkrevew''

==Tiopês==
[[2010s in fashion#Youth fashion|Brazilian indie and scene kids]] use a related Internet sociolect, the ''tiopês'' (from ''tiop'', which is a corruption of Portuguese ''tipo'', or equivalent to English "like, totally", in ''tiopês''), which mainly uses [[ingroup]] [[Internet meme|meme]]s as well purposeful ridiculous-sounding [[Spelling#Misspellings|misspellings]] to add humor or irony to the message and bring group identification, much like [[teh]] of English-derived leetspeak.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ The origin of "tiopês" – memepedia – youPIX, people + pixels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010130045/http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is common for the ''miguxês'', there are detractors of ''tiopês'', although much less numbered and for different reasons (usually, people which are detractors at the same time of different youth subcultures deemed as alienated, including 'emo' teenagers, [[2000–2009 in fashion#Youth fashion|scene kids]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]). ''Tiopês'' is also much less common in the Portuguese-speaking Internet community, and is said to be a phenomenon limited to Brazil.

===Example===
* Tiopês: amiogs, eo tiop a~mo a dercycolpëdya, rsrsrs1!!11! o artigo deels sorb noës indys eh tuod mas asi~m meninës nein toads os saitys de parödjas soa lezgaus tiop augums pormoven ~polëmicas~ conmo precomseiots e eu noa asho iso valiod un boa~m eggzenpel ~master no ingreis AEAEAEAE~ seriä a tau da emceeclopëdia dramatchyca q aepzar do noem noa shorem leëtros pro sel fin11!11!
* Rough colloquial Brazilian Portuguese translation of the ''tiopês'' piece: Gente, eu absolutamente adoro a Desciclopédia, hahahaha, o artigo deles sobre nós indies é tudo, mas tenho algo a dizer a vocês, nem todos os ''sites'' de paródia são legais, alguns deles promovem coisas controversas como preconceitos, e eu não acho esse tipo de coisa válida, um bom exemplo seria uma certa Encyclopedia Dramatica que apesar do nome, não é de se sofrer um drama por seu fim.
* English, literal translation of the Portuguese piece: You guys, I [have to tell that I] absolutely love/adore [[Uncyclopedia]], hahahaha, their [Portuguese] article on us indie kids is awesome, but I have something to say [to you], not every parody site is cool, some of them promote controversial things such as [a number of] prejudices, and I am reticent of [all] this kind of thing, a good example would be a so-called [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] that in spite of its name, would not be worth of a drama because of its end.

In [[linguistics]], the '''minimalist program''' ('''MP''') is a major line of inquiry that has been developing inside [[generative grammar]] since the early 1990s, starting with a 1993 paper by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1993. ''A minimalist program for linguistic theory''. MIT occasional papers in linguistics no. 1. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Distributed by MIT Working Papers in Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky presents MP as a [[research program|program]], not as a theory, following [[Imre Lakatos]]'s distinction.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough discussion of this distinction in the context of linguistics, see Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism: Origins, Concepts, Methods, and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The MP seeks to be a mode of inquiry characterized by the flexibility of the multiple directions that its minimalism enables. Ultimately, the MP provides a conceptual framework used to guide the development of linguistic theory. In minimalism, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] attempts to approach [[universal grammar]] from below—that is, proposing the question "what would be the optimal answer to what the theory of [[i-Language]] should be?"

For Chomsky, there are [[Minimalist grammar|minimalist]] questions, but the answers can be framed in any theory. Of all these questions, the two that play the most crucial role are:&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims'', pp. 84 and 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*What is language?
*Why does it have the properties it has?

== Theoretical goals ==

=== Perfection ===

The MP appeals to the idea that the language ability in humans shows signs of being incorporated under an optimal design with exquisite organization, which seems to suggest that the inner workings conform to a very simple computational law or a particular mental organ. In other words, the MP works on the assumption that [[universal grammar]] constitutes a perfect design in the sense that it contains only what is necessary to meet humans' conceptual and physical (phonological) needs.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theoretical standpoint, and in the context of [[generative grammar]], the MP draws on the minimalist approach of the [[principles and parameters]] program, considered to be the ultimate standard theoretical model that generative linguistics has developed since the 1980s. What this approach suggests is the existence of a fixed set of principles valid for all languages, which, when combined with settings for a finite set of binary switches (parameters), may describe the specific properties that characterize the language system a child eventually comes to attain.&lt;ref&gt;There are many introductions to Principle and Parameters. Two that align PP in such a way that make the transition to MP smooth are Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell, and Cook, Vivian J. and Newson, Mark. 2007. ''Chomsky's Universal Grammar: An Introduction''. Third Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP aims to get to know how much of the [[principles and parameters]] model can be taken as a result of this hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty. In turn, more developed versions of the [[Principles and Parameters]] approach provide technical principles from which the MP can be seen to follow.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed introductory discussion between the transition of the technicalities from PP to MP see, among others, Gert Webelhuth. 1995. ''Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program: Principles and Parameters in Syntactic Theory''. Wiley-Blackwell; Uriagereka, Juan. 1998. ''Rhyme and Reason. An Introduction to Minimalist Syntax''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]; Hornstein, Norbert, Jairo Nunes and Kleanthes K. Grohmann. 2005. ''Understanding Minimalism''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; and Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===

The MP aims at the further development of ideas involving ''economy of derivation'' and ''economy of representation'', which had started to become significant in the early 1990s, but were still peripheral aspects of [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;For a full description of the checking mechanism see Adger, David. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economy of derivation is a principle stating that movements (i.e., transformations) only occur in order to match ''interpretable features'' with ''uninterpretable features''. An example of an interpretable feature is the plural [[inflection]] on regular English nouns, e.g., ''dog'''s'''''. The word ''dogs'' can only be used to refer to several dogs, not a single dog, and so this inflection contributes to meaning, making it ''interpretable''. English verbs are inflected according to the [[grammatical number|number]] of their subject (e.g., "Dogs bite" vs. "A dog bite'''''s'''''"), but this information is only interpretable once a relationship is formed between the subject and the verb, so movement of the subject is required.
* Economy of representation is the principle that grammatical structures must exist for a purpose, i.e., the structure of a sentence should be no larger or more complex than required to satisfy constraints on grammaticality, which are equivalent to constraints on the mapping between the conceptual/intentional and sensori-motor interfaces in the optimal system that minimalism seeks to explore.

== Technical innovations ==

The exploration of minimalist questions has led to several radical changes in the technical apparatus of transformational generative grammatical theory. Some of the most important are:&lt;ref&gt;For some conceptual and empirical advantages of the MP over the traditional view see: Bošković, Željko. 1994. D-Structure, Θ-Criterion, and Movement into Θ-Positions. Linguistic Analysis 24: 247–286, and for more detailed discussions Bošković, Željko and Howard Lasnik (eds). 2006. ''Minimalist Syntax: The Essential Readings''. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The generalization of [[X-bar theory]] into bare phrase structure (see below).
* The simplification of representational levels in the grammatical model, eliminating the distinction between [[deep structure and surface structure]] in favor of a more explicitly derivational approach.
* The elimination of the notion of [[Government (linguistics)|government]].
* The inclusion of a two new points of interaction, namely, a "spell-out" point between syntax and the interface with the phonological form, and an additional point of interaction with the logical form.
* The idea that syntactic derivations proceed by clearly delineated stages called "phases" (see below).

=== Bare phrase structure ===

A major development of MP inquiry is bare phrase structure (BPS), a theory of [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]] (sentence building prior to movement) developed by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chomsky, Noam. 1995. Bare Phrase Structure. In ''Evolution and Revolution in Linguistic Theory. Essays in honor of Carlos Otero''., eds. Hector Campos and Paula Kempchinsky, 51–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of BPS has moved the Chomskyan tradition toward the [[dependency grammar]] tradition, which operates with significantly less structure than most [[phrase structure grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Timothy, Michael Putnam, and Thomas Gross 2011. Bare phrase structure, label-less structures, and specifier-less syntax: Is Minimalism becoming a dependency grammar? The Linguistic Review 28: 315–364&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory contrasts with [[X-bar theory]], which preceded it, in four important ways:

# BPS is explicitly derivational. That is, it is built from the bottom up, bit by bit. In contrast, X-bar theory is representational—a structure for a given construction is built in one fell swoop, and [[lexical items]] are inserted into the structure.
# BPS does not have a preconceived phrasal structure, while in X-bar theory every phrase has a [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]], a [[head (linguistics)|head]], and a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]].
# BPS permits only binary branching, while X-bar theory permits both binary and unary branching.
# BPS does not distinguish between a "head" and a "terminal", while some versions of X-bar theory require such a distinction.

BPS incorporates two basic operations: "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]" and "[[Move α|move]]". Although there is active debate on exactly how "move" should be formulated, the differences between the current proposals are relatively minute. The following description follows Chomsky's original proposal.&lt;!--so where is the discussion of move, then? The rest of this section only describes merge. Is move unimportant, or has it been forgotten?--&gt;

Merge is a function that takes two objects (say α and β) and merges them into an unordered set with a label (either α or β, in this case α). The label identifies the properties of the phrase.

Merge (α, β) → {α, {α, β} }

For example, "merge" can operate on the lexical items "drink" and "water" to give "drink water". Note that the phrase "drink water" behaves more like the [[verb]] ''drink'' than like the [[noun]] ''water''. That is, wherever the verb ''drink'' can be put, so too can the phrase "drink water":

I like to _____________ (drink)/(drink water).&lt;br&gt;
(Drinking/Drinking water) __________ is fun.

Furthermore, the phrase "drink water" can not typically be put in the same places as the noun ''water'':

It can be said, "There's some ''water'' on the table", but not "There's some ''drink water'' on the table".

So, the phrase is identified with a label. In the case of "drink water", the label is ''drink'' since the phrase acts as a verb. For simplicity, this phrase is called a verb phrase (VP). If "cold" and "water" were merged to get "cold water", this would be a noun phrase (NP) with the label "water"; it follows that the phrase "cold water" can appear in the same environments as the noun ''water'' in the three test sentences above. So, for ''drink water'', there is the following:

Merge (drink, water) → {drink, {drink, water} }

This can be represented in a typical [[concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] as follows:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree Drink Water.png|150px]]

or, with more technical terms, as:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree VP.png|150px]]

Merge can also operate on structures already built. If it could not, then such a system would predict only two-word utterances to be grammatical. If a new head is merged with a previously formed object (a phrase), the function has the form

Merge &lt;code&gt;(γ, {α, {α, β}}) → {γ, {γ, {α, {α, β}}}}&lt;/code&gt;

Here, γ is the label, so that γ "projects" from the label of the head. This corresponds to the following tree structure:

[[Image:Minimalist Syntax Tree 1.png|150px]]

Merge operates blindly, projecting labels in all possible combinations. The [[subcategorization]] features of the head then license certain label projections and eliminate all derivations with alternate projections.

=== Phases ===
A "'''phase'''" is a syntactic domain first hypothesized by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1998). "Minimalist Inquiries: The Framework" MIT Occasional Papers in Linguistics 15. Republished in 2000 in R. Martin, D. Michaels, &amp; J. Uriagereka (eds.). ''Step By Step: Essays In Syntax in Honor of [[Howard Lasnik]]''. 89–155. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple sentence is often decomposed into two phases, CP and ''v''P (see [[X-bar theory]]). Movement of a constituent out of a phase is (in the general case) only permitted if the constituent has first moved to the left edge of the phase. This condition is described in the ''phase impenetrability condition'', which has been variously formulated within the literature. In its original conception, only the ''v''P in transitive and [[unergative verb]]s constitute phases. The ''v''P in passives and [[unaccusative verb]]s (if even present) are not phases. This topic is, however, currently under debate in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;See, among others, Legate, Julie Anne. 2003. Some Interface Properties of the phrase. Linguistic Inquiry 34: 506–516 and Chomsky, Noam. 2008. On Phases. In ''Foundational Issues in Linguistic Theory. Essays in Honor of Jean-Roger Vergnaud''. eds. Robert Freidin, Carlos Peregrín Otero and Maria Luisa Zubizarreta, 133–166. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
In the late 1990s, [[David E. Johnson]] and Shalom Lappin published the first detailed critiques of Chomsky's minimalist program.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1997), "A Critique of the Minimalist Program" in ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 20, 273–333, and Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1999). ''Local Constraints vs Economy.'' Stanford: CSLI&lt;/ref&gt; This technical work was followed by a lively debate with proponents of minimalism on the scientific status of the program.&lt;ref&gt;*Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000a). "The Structure of Unscientific Revolutions." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 665–771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000b). "The Revolution Confused: A Reply to our Critics." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 873–890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2001). "The Revolution Maximally Confused." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 19, 901–919&lt;/ref&gt; The original article provoked several replies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Am I Unscientific? A Reply to Lappin, Levine, and Johnson| year=2000 | last=Holmberg| first=Anders | journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=837–842 | doi=10.1023/A:1006425604798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Revolution, Discovery, and an Elementary Principle of Logic| year=2000 | last=Reuland| first=Eric | journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=843–848 | doi=10.1023/A:1006404305706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Caricaturing Dissent| year=2000 | last=Roberts| first=Ian| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=849–857 | doi=10.1023/A:1006408422545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Metric of Open-Mindedness| year=2000 | last=Piattelli-Palmarini| first=Massimo| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=859–862 | doi=10.1023/A:1006460406615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Emptiness of 'Design' Polemics| year=2000 | last=Uriagereka| first=Juan| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=863–871 | doi=10.1023/A:1006412507524}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two further rounds of replies and counter-replies in subsequent issues of the same journal.

Lappin et al. argue that the minimalist program is a radical departure from earlier Chomskyan linguistic practice that is not motivated by any new empirical discoveries, but rather by a general appeal to ''perfection'', which is both empirically unmotivated and so vague as to be unfalsifiable. They compare the adoption of this paradigm by linguistic researchers to other historical paradigm shifts in natural sciences and conclude that of the minimalist program has been an "unscientific revolution", driven primarily by Chomsky's authority in linguistics. The several replies to the article in ''Natural Language and Linguistic Theory'' Volume 18 number 4 (2000) make a number of different defenses of the minimalist program. Some claim that it is not in fact revolutionary or not in fact widely adopted, while others agree with Lappin and Johnson on these points, but defend the vagueness of its formulation as not problematic in light of its status as a research program rather than a theory (see above).

'''Northwest Germanic''' is a proposed grouping of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages, representing the current consensus among Germanic historical linguists. It does not challenge the late 19th-century tri-partite division of the Germanic dialects into [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], but proposes additionally that North and West Germanic (i.e. all surviving Germanic languages today) remained as a subgroup after the southward migration of the East Germanic tribes, only splitting into North and West Germanic later. Whether this subgroup constituted a unified [[proto-language]], or simply represents a group of dialects that remained in contact and close geographical proximity, is a matter of debate, but the formulation of Ringe and Taylor probably enjoys widespread support:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is some evidence that North and West Germanic developed as a single
language, Proto-Northwest Germanic, after East Germanic had begun to
diverge. However, changes unproblematically datable to the PNWGmc period
are few, suggesting that that period of linguistic unity did not last long. On the
other hand, there are some indications that North and West Germanic
remained in contact, exchanging and thus partly sharing further innovations,
after they had begun to diverge, and perhaps even after West Germanic had
itself begun to diversify.{{sfn|Ringe|Taylor|2014|p=10}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==History and terminology==
This grouping was proposed by Hans Kuhn as an alternative to the older view of a [[Gotho-Nordic]] versus West Germanic division. This older view is represented by mid 20th-century proposals to assume the existence by 250 BC of five general groups to be distinguishable: North Germanic in Southern Scandinavia excluding Jutland; [[North Sea Germanic]] along the middle Rhine and Jutland; Rhine-Weser Germanic; Elbe Germanic; and East Germanic.{{sfn|Moulton|Buccini|}} The Northwest Germanic theory challenges these proposals, since it is strongly tied to runic inscriptions dated from AD 200 onwards.
==Dating==
Most scholars agree that [[East Germanic]] broke up from the rest of the languages in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC. The Runic Inscriptions (being written from the 2nd century) may mean that the north and West broke up in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.  The [[Migration Period]] started around the 4th and 5th centuries; an event which probably help diversify the Northwest Germanic (maybe even the [[West Germanic]]) languages even more.
The date by which such a grouping must have dissolved—in that innovations ceased to be shared—is also contentious, though it seems unlikely to have persisted after 500 AD, by which time the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had migrated to England and the [[Elbe Germanic]] tribes had settled in Southern Germany.

==Evidence==
The evidence for Northwest Germanic is constituted by a range of common linguistic innovations in [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[word formation]] and [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] in North and West Germanic, though in fact there is considerable debate about which innovations are significant. An additional problem is that [[Gothic language|Gothic]], which provides almost the sole evidence of the East Germanic dialects, is attested much earlier than the other Germanic languages, with the exception of a few [[runes|runic]] [[inscription]]s. This means that direct comparisons between Gothic and the other Germanic languages are not necessarily good evidence for subgroupings, since the distance in time must also be taken into account.

Among the common innovations cited as evidence for Northwest Germanic are:
* Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/z/}} &gt; {{IPA|/r/}} (e.g. Gothic ''dius''; ON ''dȳr'', OHG ''tior'', OE ''dēor'', "wild animal")
* The use of *ē₂ in the [[preterite]] of Class VII [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]]s in North and West Germanic, whereas Gothic uses [[reduplication]] (e.g. Gothic ''haihait''; ON, OE ''hēt'', preterite of the Gmc verb ''*haitan'' "to be called")
* The conversion of *ē₁ into ''ā'' (vs. Gothic ''ē'').

==Alternative groupings==
Postulated common innovations in North Germanic and Gothic, which therefore challenge the Northwest Germanic hypothesis, include:
* Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/jj/}}, {{IPA|/ww/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ddj/}}, {{IPA|/ggw/}} (e.g. Gothic ''triggwa'', ON ''tryggva'', OHG ''triuwe'', "loyalty", see [[Holtzmann's Law]])

A minority opinion is able to harmonize these two hypotheses by denying the genetic reality of both Northwest Germanic and Gotho-Nordic, seeing them rather as mere cover terms indicating close areal contacts. (Such areal contacts would have been quite strong among the early Germanic languages, given their close geographic position over a long period of time.) Under such an assumption, an early close relationship between Nordic and Gothic dialects does not exclude a later similar relationship between remaining North and West Germanic groups, once the Gothic migration had started in the 2nd or 3rd century.

There are also common innovations in [[Old High German]] and Gothic, which would appear to challenge both the Northwest Germanic and the Gotho-Nordic groupings. However, these are standardly taken to be the result of late areal contacts, based the cultural contacts across the [[Alps]] in the 5th and 6th centuries, reflected in the [[Christian]] [[loanword]]s from Gothic into Old High German.

'''Pragmatic mapping''' — a term  in current use in [[linguistics]], computing, [[cognitive psychology]], and related fields — is the process by which a given abstract predicate (a [[symbol]]) comes to be associated through action (a dynamic index) with some particular logical object (an [[icon]]). The logical object may be a thing, person, relation, event, situation, or a string of these at any conceivable level of [[complexity]]. A relatively simple example is the [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] — successful, appropriate, and mundanely “true” — linking of a proper name to the person of whom it is a conventional [[wikt:designation|designation]].

There are three parts to this process when it succeeds. &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Pragmatic Mapping diagram.jpg]] --&gt;There is the abstract symbol which is used to [[wikt:represent|represent]] something else (the name or the entire signifying predication, for instance); there is the something else that is represented by that symbol (whatever is signified); and there is the act of using the symbol in a conventional way to represent whatever it usually represents (the act of signifying). [[wikt:pragmatic|Pragmatic]] mapping is the process by which any material argument, or any imagined one, comes to be associated with a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]] that purports to be and succeeds in being about it. That is the predicate must be appropriate ("true" in the most [[wikt:mundane|mundane]] sense [[wikt:relative|relative]]) to its logical object. The predication may be as simple as a naming act or as complex as a representation consisting of many distinct [[proposition]]s  with many associated [[wikt:clause|clauses]].

For instance, if we say "Jesse James was an [[Outlaw|American outlaw]]" the name "[[Jesse James]]" purports to be about a certain historical person whom we may know to have been shot by another individual named Robert Ford. We may know that a movie featuring Brad Pitt as Jesse James was released in September 2007 in select theaters across America. If the pragmatic mapping of the name "Jesse James" is complete, i.e., if it succeeds, it is mapped onto that certain individual that was actually shot by [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert Ford]].

Nothing of importance changes in the pragmatic mapping process if it turns out that Jesse James and Robert Ford are [[wikt:figment|figments]] of someone’s [[imagination]], excepting, of course, the [[truth value]] of the propositions that include the logical object of the name, Jesse James. In ordinary conversation and [[Communication#Human communication|human communication]] in general, it has been demonstrated [[logic]]ally and mathematically that meaning is utterly dependent on the true and appropriate pragmatic mapping of symbols to their conventional logical objects. [[Infant]]s depend on [[exemplification]] of such mapping relations to acquire languages and all meaningful [[Linguistics|linguistic]] representations have been proved to depend on such mappings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4564">[[File:Classical orders from the Encyclopedie.png|thumb|In [[classical architecture]], proportions were set by the radii of columns.]]

'''Proportion''' is a central principle of [[architectural theory]] and an important connection between [[mathematics and art]]. It is the visual effect of the relationships of the various objects and spaces that make up a structure to one another and to the whole. These relationships are often governed by multiples of a standard unit of length known as a "module".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Stevens Curl]] (ed.), ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture'', 2nd ed. (Oxford, 2006), 606-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proportion in architecture was discussed by [[Vitruvius]], [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]], [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Le Corbusier]] among others.

== Proportion in Roman Architecture ==

=== Vitruvius' Theory ===
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The [[Vitruvian Man]] developed by Leonardo da Vinci based on the description of Vitruvius' ideal ratio  of the  human body.]]
Architecture in Roman antiquity was rarely documented except in the writings of [[Vitruvius]]' treatise ''[[De architectura|De Architectura]]''. Vitruvius served as an engineer under Julius Caesar during the first Gallic Wars (58-50 BC). The treatise was dedicated to Emperor Augustus. As Vitruvius defined the concept in the first chapters of the treatise, he mentioned the three prerequisites of architecture are firmness (''firmitas''), commodity (''utilitas''), and delight (''vernustas''), which require the architects to be equipped with a varied kind of learning and knowledge of many branches. Moreover, Vitruvius identified the "Six Principles of Design" as order (''ordinatio''), arrangement (''dispositio''), proportion (''eurythmia''), symmetry (''symmetria''), propriety (''decor'') and economy (''distributio''). Among the six principles, proportion interrelates and supports all the other factors in geometrical forms and arithmetical ratios.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Roman Architecture|last = Jones|first = Mark Wilson|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-300-08138-1|location = New Haven and London|pages = 33-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''symmetria'', usually translated to "symmetry" in modern renderings, in ancient times meant something more closely related to "mathematical harmony"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Roman Architecture|last = Jones|first = Mark Wilson|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-300-08138-1|location = New Haven and London|pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and measurable proportions. Vitruvius tried to describe his theory in the makeup of the human body,  which he referred to as the perfect or golden ratio. The principles of measurement units digit, foot, and cubit also came from the dimensions of a Vitruvian Man. More specifically, Vitruvius used the total height of 6 feet of a person, and each part of the body takes up a different ratio. For example, the face is about 1/10 of the total height, and the head is about 1/8 of the total height.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vitruvius used these ratios to prove that the composition of classical orders mimicked the human body, thereby ensuring aesthetic harmonization when people viewed architectural columns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Classical architecture==

In [[classical architecture]], the module was established as the radius of the lower shaft of a classical column, with proportions expressed as a fraction or multiple of that module.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Stevens Curl]] (ed.), ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture'', 2nd ed. (Oxford, 2006), 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Le Corbusier==

[[File:Swiss-Commemorative-Coin-1987-CHF-5-obverse.png|thumb|Commemorative coin illustrating [[Le Corbusier]]'s [[Modulor]]]]
In his ''[[modulor|Le Modulor]]'' (1948), Le Corbusier presented a system of proportions which took the [[golden ratio]] and a man with a raised arm as the scalable modules of proportion.

==Etymology==
The word 'pyrokinesis' was coined by horror novelist [[Stephen King]] in his 1980 novel ''[[Firestarter (novel)|Firestarter]]'' to describe the ability to create and control fire with the mind.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt; The word is intended to be parallel to [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]], with [[S. T. Joshi]] describing it as a "singularly unfortunate coinage" and noting that the correct analogy to telekinesis would "not be “pyrokinesis” but “telepyrosis” (fire from a distance)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joshi|first1=S. T.|title=The Modern Weird Tale|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786409860|page=75|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvyM5NgXopAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Modern+Weird+Tale&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bbNnVbSXMPSP7AaAloOIBg&amp;ved=0CCMQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pyrokinesis&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; King is the first person to give the idea a name as neither the term pyrokinesis nor any other term describing the idea have been found in prior works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=An Analytical Guide to Television's One Step Beyond, 1959-1961|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786409693|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCrossan|first1=John A.|title=Books and Reading in the Lives of Notable Americans: A Biographical Sourcebook|date=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0313303762|page=144|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parapsychologists describe pyrokinesis as the ability to excite the atoms within an object until they generate enough energy to burst into flame.&lt;ref name="Gresh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gresh|first1=Lois H.|last2=Weinberg|first2=Robert|title=The Science of Stephen King: From Carrie to Cell, The Terrifying Truth Behind the Horror Masters Fiction|date=2007|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780471782476|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ns5kJxqNcUUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=pyrokinetic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3LBnVb34Mum57gbxrICADQ&amp;ved=0CCQQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pyrokinetic&amp;f=false |pages=38–39|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science fiction]] works define pyrokinesis as speeding up the movement of molecules in order to increase temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westfahl|first1=Gary|last2=Gaiman|first2=Neil|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=9780313329524|page=637|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3JXnz9x9sO4C&amp;pg=PA637&amp;dq=pyrokinesis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FDlzVYLfJau67gbVmICgAg&amp;ved=0CDoQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=pyrokinesis&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[A. W. Underwood]], a 19th-century [[African-American]], achieved minor celebrity status with the purported ability to set items ablaze. Magicians and scientists have suggested concealed pieces of [[phosphorus]] may have instead been responsible. The phosphorus could be readily ignited by breath or rubbing. Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that Underwood may have used a "chemical-combustion technique, and still other means. Whatever the exact method — and the phosphorus trick might be the most likely — the possibilities of deception far outweigh any occult powers hinted at by [[Charles Fort]] or others."&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt;

The medium [[Daniel Dunglas Home]] was known for performing fire feats and handling a heated lump of coal taken from a fire. The magician [[Henry R. Evans]] wrote that the coal handling was a juggling trick, performed by Home using a hidden piece of platinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Henry R.|authorlink=Henry R. Evans|title=Hours With the Ghosts Or Nineteenth Century Witchcraft|date=1897|publisher=Laird &amp; Lee|pages=106-107|quote=The "coal" is a piece of spongy platinum which bears a close resemblance to a lump of half burnt coal, and is palmed in the hand, as a prestidigitateur conceals a coin, a pack of cards, an egg, or a small lemon. The medium or magician advances to the grate and pretends to take a genuine lump of coal from the fire but brings up instead at the tops of his fingers, the piece of platinum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hereward Carrington]] described Evans hypothesis as "certainly ingenious" but pointed out [[William Crookes]], an experienced chemist, was present at a séance whilst Home performed the feat and would have known how to distinguish the difference between coal and platinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrington|first1=Hereward|authorlink=Hereward Carrington|title=The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism|date=1907|publisher=Herbet B. Turner &amp; Co|page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Podmore]] wrote that most of the fire feats could have easily be performed by conjuring tricks and [[sleight of hand]] but [[hallucination]] and sense-deception may have explained Crookes' claim about observing flames from Home's fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Podmore|first1=Frank|authorlink=Frank Podmore|title=The Newer Spiritualism|date=1910|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|pages=55-86|chapter=Levitation and the Fire Ordeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph McCabe]] has written that Home's alleged feats of pyrokinesis were weak and unsatisfactory, he noted that they were performed in dark conditions amongst unreliable witnesses. McCabe suggested the coal handling was probably a "piece of asbestos from Home's pocket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph McCabe|title=Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? the Evidence Given by Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined|date=1920|publisher=London Watts &amp; Co.|pages=78-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, a three-year-old girl in Antique Province, Philippines gained media attention for the supposed supernatural power to predict or create fires. The town mayor said he witnessed a pillow ignite after the girl said "fire... pillow." Others claimed to have witnessed the girl either predicting or causing fire without any physical contact with the objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110309-324430/Fire-seer-draws-hundreds-to-Antique-village |title=Fire 'seer' draws hundreds to Antique village |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204005323/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110309-324430/Fire-seer-draws-hundreds-to-Antique-village |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes claims of pyrokinesis are published in the context of fire ghosts, such as [[Canneto di Caronia fires]] and earlier Italian case of young nanny, Carole Compton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/sicilian-fires-recall-nanny-s-witch-ordeal-1-513557 |title=Sicilian fires recall nanny's 'witch' ordeal |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2004-02-12 |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no scientifically plausible method for the brain to trigger explosions or fires.&lt;ref name="Gresh"/&gt;

'''Round-robin''' is a document signed by multiple parties in a circle to make it more difficult to determine the order in which it was signed, thus preventing a ringleader from being identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=round+robin Online Etymology Dictionary: Round Robin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Round Robin image.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jessé de Forest]]'s Round Robin from 1621]]
The term dates from the 17th-century [[French language|French]] ''ruban rond'' (''round [[ribbon]]'').&lt;ref name="Bartleby"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/81/14554.html Brewer, E. Cobham. Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable: Round Robin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/15/messages/643.html Re: Round Robin], Oxford English Dictionary cited at The Phrase Finder, September 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This described the practice of signatories to petitions against authority (usually Government officials petitioning the [[The Crown|Crown]]) appending their names on a document in a non-hierarchical circle or ribbon pattern (and so disguising the order in which they have signed) so that none may be identified as a [[leader|ringleader]].

This practice was adopted by sailors petitioning officers in the [[Royal Navy]] (first recorded 1731).

==Spanish–American War==
{{main|Round-Robin Letter (Spanish–American War)}}
A round robin letter was authored in Cuba after the cessation of hostilities in 1898 by a committee of 10 brigade commanders of the American Army's V Corps including acting brigade commander [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the [[Spanish–American War]], to accelerate the departure of the American Army back to the United States during the rainy disease-plagued summer season. This letter was leaked to the press and embarrassed the administration of US President [[William McKinley]].

In [[linguistics]], '''semantic overload''' occurs when a word or phrase has more than one meaning, and is used in ways that convey meaning based on its divergent constituent concepts. Semantic overload is related to the linguistic concept of [[polysemy]]. Overloading is related to the psychological concept of [[information overload]], and the computer science concept of an [[overloaded expression]]. A term that is semantically overloaded is a kind of "overloaded expression" in language that causes a certain small degree of "information overload" in the receiving audience.

An example of this is the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''herri'' which can be translated as ''nation; country, land; people, population''; and ''town, village, settlement'',&lt;ref name=Aulestia&gt;Aulestia, G. ''Basque-English Dictionary'' (1989) [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] Press {{ISBN|0-87417-126-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst other things leading to difficulties in translating the indigenous term [[Euskal herria#Etymology|Euskal Herria]]. Another example is the term ''memory'', especially as used in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David C.|date=2005-02-15|title=The Abuses of Memory: Reflections on the Memory Boom in Anthropology|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/178196|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=78|issue=1|pages=197–211|doi=10.1353/anq.2005.0001|issn=1534-1518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Profanity|Expletive]]s are also notable for this quality, and conversely this quality is also a contributor to why such terms may be regarded as crude or inappropriate.

Meanings associated with a semantically overloaded word have different qualities: those the word itself [[reference|refers directly]] to, and other meanings [[Inference|inferred]] from its use in [[Context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolinger|first=Dwight|date=1971-01-01|title=Semantic Overloading: A Restudy of the Verb Remind|jstor=412376|journal=Language|volume=47|issue=3|pages=522–547|doi=10.2307/412376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language planning==
Minority languages that spread into new domains frequently suffer from semantic overloading by attempting to adapt existing terms to cover new concepts. One such example from [[Scottish Gaelic]] is the over-use of the word ''comhairle'' (originally "advice, counsel") for concepts such as ''committee'', ''council'', and ''consultation'' as exemplified by Donald MacAulay in ''dh'iarr a' chomhairle comhairle air a’ chomhairle chomhairleachaidh'': "The committee sought advice from the consultative council"—a sentence that is opaque in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Wilson ''Faclair na Pàrlamaid, a critical evaluation'' (2001) Department of Celtic and Scottish Studies, University of Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacAulay, Donald ''New Gaelic'' (1986) Scottish Language, 5, 120-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''semisoft sign''' (Ҍ&amp;nbsp;ҍ; italics: &lt;span style="font-family: times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: larger"&gt;''Ҍ&amp;nbsp;ҍ''&lt;/span&gt;) is a letter of the [[Cyrillic script]].&lt;ref name=Unicode/&gt;

The semisoft sign is used in the alphabet of the [[Kildin Sami language]], where it indicates [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] (sometimes also called "half-palatalization") of the preceding stop, {{IPA|/nʲ/, /tʲ/, or /dʲ/}}.

====Phonetic realization====
* The close and mid vowels are typically peripheral, but they can at times be somewhat centralized.{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=93–95}}
* {{IPA|/i, iː, u, uː/}} are typically near-close {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i̞}}, {{IPA link|i̞ː}}, {{IPA link|u̞}}, {{IPA link|u̞ː}}]}}, but sometimes they can be close {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|iː}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|uː}}]}} instead.{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=93, 95}}
* {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː, ɔ, ɔː/}} are typically mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɛ̝ː}}, {{IPA link|ɔ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɔ̝ː}}]}}. {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː/}} are slightly higher than {{IPA|/ɔ, ɔː/}} - this can be transcribed in narrow transcription as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e̞}}, {{IPA link|e̞ː}}]}} vs. {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɔ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɔ̝ː}}]}}. At times, {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː/}} can be as close as close-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|eː}}]}} and {{IPA|/ɔ, ɔː/}} as open as open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɔ}}, {{IPA link|ɔː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=94–95}}
* Speakers often fail at attempts to pronounce {{IPA|/æ/}}, pronouncing a vowel that is phonetically too close to either {{IPA|/ɛ/}} or {{IPA|/a/}}.{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|p=55}}
* {{IPA|/a, aː/}} are typically open central {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ä}}, {{IPA link|äː}}]}}, but at times they can be somewhat fronted {{IPA|[{{IPA link|a|a̠}}, {{IPA link|a|a̠ː}}]}}, retracted {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɑ|ɑ̟}}, {{IPA link|ɑ|ɑ̟ː}}]}} or raised {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɐ}}, {{IPA link|ɐː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=94–95}}
* Under Hungarian influence, some speakers realize {{IPA|/ɛː, ɔː/}} as close-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|eː}}, {{IPA link|oː}}]}} and {{IPA|/a/}} as open back rounded {{IPAblink|ɒ}}. The close-mid realizations of {{IPA|/ɛː, ɔː/}} occur also in southern dialects spoken near the river [[Ipeľ]].{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|pp=54, 92}}

====Other notes====
* Vowel length is not phonemic in Eastern dialects,{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=375}} which have only five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/i, u, ɛ, ɔ, a/}}, some speakers also have {{IPA|/æ/}}).
* In Western dialects, vowels that are short due to the rhythmical rule{{Explain|date=September 2018}} are often realized as long, and thus violating the rule.{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=376}}
* {{IPA|/y, yː, œ, œː, ɔː/}} occur only in loanwords.{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=375}}{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|pp=64–65}} Just as other mid vowels, {{IPA|/œ, œː/}} are phonetically true-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|œ̝}}, {{IPA link|œ̝ː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|p=64}} Among these vowels, only {{IPA|/ɔː/}} is consistently realized in the correct manner, whereas the occurrence of the front rounded vowels {{IPA|/y, yː, œ, œː/}} has been reported only by {{Harvcoltxt|Kráľ|1988}}, who states that the front rounded vowels appear only in the high register and medium register. However, in the medium register, {{IPA|/y, yː/}} and {{IPA|/œ, œː/}} are often either too back, which results in realizations that are phonetically too close to, respectively, {{IPA|/u, uː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ, ɔː/}}, or too weakly rounded, yielding vowels that are phonetically too close to, respectively, {{IPA|/i, iː/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː/}}.{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|pp=57, 64–65, 103}}
* {{IPA|/uː, ɛː/}} do not occur after soft consonants, where they are replaced by the corresponding diphthongs {{IPA|/ɪ̯u, ɪ̯ɛ/}}. The same is generally true for {{IPA|/aː/}} ({{IPA|/ɪ̯a/}} after soft consonants), but the sequence {{IPA|/jaː/}} may occur in some cases.{{sfnp|Short|2002|pp=534–535}}
* Long {{IPA|/ɛː/}} occurs only in loanwords, one native word (''dcéra'') and in adjective endings.{{sfnp|Short|2002|p=535}}
* {{IPA|/æ/}} can only be short, and occurs only after {{IPA|/m, p, b, v/}}.{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=375}}{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|p=55}} There is not a full agreement about its status in the standard language:
** {{Harvcoltxt|Kráľ|1988}} states that the correct pronunciation of {{IPA|/æ/}} is an important part of the high register, but in medium and low registers, {{IPA|/æ/}} merges with {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, or, in some cases, with {{IPA|/a/}}.{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|p=55}}
** {{Harvcoltxt|Short|2002}} states that only about 5% of speakers have {{IPA|/æ/}} as a distinct phoneme, and that even when it is used in formal contexts, it is most often a dialect feature.{{sfnp|Short|2002|p=534}}
** {{Harvcoltxt|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010}} state that the use of {{IPA|/æ/}} is becoming rare, and that it often merges with {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=375}}

* The phonetic quality of Slovak diphthongs is as follows:
** {{IPA|/ɪ̯ɛ/}} is typically a glide from {{IPA|/i/}} to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} ({{IPA|[ȋ̞ɛ̝]}}).{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=96–97}}
** {{IPA|/ɪ̯a/}} is typically a glide from the position below {{IPA|/i/}} to {{IPA|/æ/}} ({{IPA|[ȇ̝æ̠]}}).{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=95, 97}}
** {{IPA|/ɪ̯u/}} is typically a glide from {{IPA|/i/}} to the position more front than {{IPA|/u/}} ({{IPA|[ȋ̞ʊ]}}).{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=96–97}}
** {{IPA|/ʊ̯ɔ/}} is typically a glide from {{IPA|/u/}} to the position above {{IPA|/ɔ/}} ({{IPA|[ȗ̞o̞]}}).{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|pp=96–97}}
* There are many more phonetic diphthongs, such as {{IPA|[aʊ̯]}} in ''Miroslav'' {{IPA|[ˈmirɔslaʊ̯]}} and {{IPA|[ɔʊ̯]}} in ''Prešov'' {{IPA|[ˈprɛʃɔʊ̯]}}. Phonemically, these are interpreted as sequences of {{IPA|/v/}} preceded by a vowel. This {{IPA|[ʊ̯]}} is phonetically {{IPA|[ȗ̞]}} and it is very similar to the first element of {{IPA|/ʊ̯ɔ/}}.{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|p=105}}{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=374}}

** {{Harvcoltxt|Pavlík|2004}} describes an additional realization, namely a weakly palatalized apical alveolar approximant {{IPA|[l̺ʲ]}}. According to this scholar, the palatal realization {{IPA|[ʎ]}} is actually alveolo-palatal {{IPAblink|ʎ̟}}.{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|p=105}}
* The {{IPA|/ʎ–l/}} contrast is neutralized before front vowels, where only {{IPA|/l/}} occurs. This neutralization is taken further in western dialects, in which {{IPA|/ʎ/}} merges with {{IPA|/l/}} in all environments.{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=374}}
* {{IPA|/l, r/}} are apical alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|l|l̺}}, {{IPA link|r|r̺}}]}}.{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|pp=78–79}}
** {{IPA|/l/}} is either neutral {{IPAblink|l}} or velarized {{IPAblink|ɫ}}.{{sfnp|Kráľ|1988|p=80}}

** {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} occurs mainly in loanwords.{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=374}}
* {{IPA|/v/}} is realized as:
** Voiced fricative {{IPAblink|v}} in onsets before voiced obstruents;{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=374}}
** Voiceless fricative {{IPAblink|f}} in onsets before voiceless obstruents;{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|pp=374, 376}}
** Variably as an approximant {{IPAblink|ʋ}} or a glide {{IPA|[ʊ̯]}} in [[Syllable#Coda|coda]];{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=374}}
** Approximant {{IPAblink|ʋ}} in all other cases.{{sfnp|Hanulíková|Hamann|2010|p=374}}
* {{IPA|/j/}} is an approximant, either palatal or alveolo-palatal.{{sfnp|Recasens|2013|p=15}} Between close front vowels, it can be realized as a fricative {{IPAblink|ʝ}}, whereas between open central vowels, it can be a quite lax approximant {{IPA|[j˕]}}.{{sfnp|Pavlík|2004|p=106}}

Some additional notes includes the following (transcriptions in IPA unless otherwise stated):
* {{IPA|/r, l/}} can be syllabic: {{IPA|/r̩, l̩/}}. When they are long (indicated in the spelling with the acute accent: '''ŕ''' and '''ĺ'''), they are always syllabic, e.g. ''vlk'' (wolf), ''prst'' (finger), ''štvrť'' (quarter), ''krk'' (neck), bisyllabic ''vĺča''—''vĺ-ča'' (wolfling), ''vŕba''—''vŕ-ba'' (willow-tree), etc.
* {{IPA|/m/}} has the allophone {{IPA|[ɱ]}} in front of the labiodental fricatives {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}}.
* {{IPA|/n/}} in front of (post)alveolar fricatives has a postalveolar allophone {{IPA|[n̠]}}.
* {{IPA|/n/}} can be {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in front of the velar plosives {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.

==Stress==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
In the standard language, the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is always on the first syllable of a word (or on the preceding preposition, see below). This is not the case in certain dialects. Eastern dialects have penultimate stress (as in [[Polish phonology|Polish]]), which at times makes them difficult to understand for speakers of standard Slovak. Some of the north-central dialects have a weak stress on the first syllable, which becomes stronger and moves to the penultimate in certain cases. Monosyllabic conjunctions, monosyllabic short personal pronouns and auxiliary verb forms of the verb ''byť'' (to be) are usually unstressed.

[[Preposition]]s form a single [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] unit with the following word, unless the word is long (four syllables or more) or the preposition stands at the beginning of a sentence.

==Official transcriptions==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Slovak linguists do not usually use IPA for phonetic transcription of their own language or others, but have their own system based on the Slovak alphabet. Many English language textbooks make use of this  alternative transcription system.
In the following table, pronunciation of each grapheme is given in this system as well as in the IPA.

In [[zoological nomenclature]], a '''subphylum''' is a [[taxonomic rank]] below the rank of [[phylum]]. 

The taxonomic rank of "[[subdivision (rank)|subdivision]]" in [[fungi ]] and [[plant taxonomy]] is equivalent to "subphylum" in zoological taxonomy. 

== Taxonomic rank ==
Subphylum is:
#subordinate to the [[phylum]] 
#superordinate to the '''infraphylum'''.

Where convenient, subphyla in turn may be divided into '''infraphyla'''; in turn such an '''infraphylum''' also would be superordinate to any classes or superclasses in the [[hierarchy]].

== Examples ==
Not all fauna phyla are divided into subphyla. Those that are include: 
*[[Arthropod]]a: divided into subphyla [[Trilobitomorpha]], [[Chelicerata]], [[Myriapoda]], [[Hexapoda]] and [[Crustacean|Crustacea]],
*[[Brachiopoda]]: divided into subphyla [[Linguliformea]], [[Craniformea]] and [[Rhynchonelliformea]],
*[[Chordata]]: divided into [[Tunicate|Tunicata]], [[Lancelet|Cephalochordata]], and its largest subphylum [[Vertebrata]].

Examples of '''infraphyla''' include the [[Mycetozoa]] and the [[Gnathostomata]].

[[File:Telo de Mascarenhas in 1940s.jpg|thumb|alt=Telo de Mascarenhas in the 1940s|Mascarenhas as a young man]]

'''Telo de Mascarenhas''' (born 23 March 1899 at [[Mormugao]] Harbour, Goa 1899, died 1979) was an author, a poet, a journalist and eminent freedom-fighter from [[Goa]].

==Biography==

In 1920 he travelled to Portugal to study, graduating in law from the [[University of Coimbra]] in 1930 (where he was taught by [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] amongst others). During this period he founded Lisbon's [[Centro Nacionalista Hindu]] (in 1926) and the periodical ''[[Índia Nova]]'' (alongside [[Adeodato Barreto]] and other émigré Goan intellectuals). Through the 1930s and 1940s, Mascerenhas worked in the Portuguese judicial system, first in the [[Algarve]] and then in the [[Alentejo]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

After India's independence from Britain in 1948, Mascerenhas returned to the Subcontinent and actively participated in [[Goa Liberation Movement]]. Although he spent some time in Goa, he was forced into exile and spent the years 1950-58 in [[Bombay]]. During his years of exile in [[Bombay]], he published clandestinely ''Ressurge Goa'', a political newspaper from 1950 to 1959. Returning to Goa in 1959, he was arrested, and the Portuguese rulers deported him to [[Portugal]] where he was jailed, first in [[Aljube]] and then in [[Caxias, Oeiras|Caxias]]. Some years after the [[Indian annexation of Portuguese India|liberation of Goa]] he was released by the Government of Portugal in 1970 in exchange for the release of the Goan [[Chico Monteiro|Padre Francisco 'Chico' Monteiro]], who had been placed under house arrest by the Indian authorities for refusing to give up his Portuguese nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Goa from Portugal in 1970, he founded the [[Círculo de Amizade Indo-Portuguesa]] (the Indo-Portuguese Friendship Society)&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and restarted ''Ressurge Goa'' as a cultural and political paper.

==Works==

Mascerenhas was a prolific poet in Portuguese and also did a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] translation of the autobiography of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and of many novels by [[Tagore]].

=== Poetry in Portuguese ===

Mascerenhas published two volumes of poetry: ''Poemas de Desespero e Concolação'' (Poems of Despair and Consolation, 1971) and ''Ciclo Goês'' (Goan Cycle, 1973).

===Prose Writing in Portuguese===

Mascarenhas published an English-language autobiography, ''When the Mango-Trees Blossomed'', in 1975. In it Mascarenhas claims to have written a novel and a novella during his incarceration in Portugal. The novel, ''Jogos Malabares'' (Malarbar Games), which he had to hide from the prison authorities, appears to have been lost. The novella was his ''Sinfonia Goesa'', written in 1962 while Mascerenhas was imprisoned in [[Cadeia do Aljube|Aljube gaol]]. Though it was never published in its entirety, several fragments saw the light of day in the post-Liberation Portuguese-language press. Some of Mascarenhas's writing has been published in English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro, ''Lengthening Shadows'', 2 vols (Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016), I pp. 27-28 (quoting p. 28); II pp. 5-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ToneLoc''''' was a popular [[war dialing]] computer program for [[MS-DOS]] written in the early to mid-1990s by two programmers known by the [[pseudonym]]s Minor Threat ([[Chris Lamprecht]]) and Mucho Maas.  The name ToneLoc was short for "Tone Locator" and was a [[word play]] on the name of the [[rapping|rap]] artist known as [[Tone Lōc]]. 

ToneLoc took advantage of the extended return codes available on [[US Robotics]] modems (e.g., ATX6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5637 58K Users' Guide|url=http://www.usr.com/support/5637/5637-ug/ref_data.html|publisher=3COM|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to detect dial tones upon dialing a number and to detect when a human answered the phone in addition to scanning for other modems. Detection of voice numbers sped up the scanning process by disconnecting upon detecting a human instead of timing out waiting for a modem carrier signal. The detection of a [[dial tone]] after dialing a number allowed for users to search for poorly secured extenders which could be used to divert calls through. 

On April 17, 2005, the [[source code]] for ''ToneLoc'' was released.

'''Juan Victor Séjour Marcou et Ferrand''' (2 June 1817 – 20 September 1874) was an American expatriate writer who worked in France. Though mostly unknown to later American writers, his [[short story]] "[[Le Mulâtre]]" ("The [[Mulatto]]") is the earliest known work of fiction by a Creole author.&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;Victor Séjour, Philip Barnard (translator). "The Mulatto." In [[Nellie Y. McKay]] and [[Henry Louis Gates]] (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of African American Literature'', Second edition, Norton, 2004. {{ISBN|0-393-97778-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
On 2 June 1817 Juan Victor Séjour was born in [[New Orleans]] to François Marcou, a free mulatto father from [[Saint-Domingue]] (Haiti), and Eloisa Philippe Ferrand, a New Orleans [[quadroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCQJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Victor+Sejour+saint-domingue&amp;dq=Victor+Sejour+saint-domingue&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEuMfrlLXJAhXGRyYKHSKKD8EQ6AEINDAE |title=Presence and Prestige: Africans in Europe : a History of Africans in Europe Before 1918 |page=194 |editor=Debrunner, Hans Werner |year=1979 |accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were wealthy, and had him educated in a private school. At the age of nineteen he moved to [[Paris]] to continue his education and find work. There he met members of the Parisian literary elite, including [[Cyrille Bissette]], publisher of the black-owned journal ''La Revue des Colonies''. Bisette published "[[Le Mulâtre]]", Séjour's first work, in 1837. The story of a loyal slave exacting revenge on his cruel master/father for the death of his wife, "Le Mulâtre" contains an indictment of [[New World]] [[slavery]] that is found in none of Séjour's subsequent work.&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;

Séjour then turned away from written fiction, and composed an ode to [[Napoleon]] in 1841 and the verse drama ''[[The Jew of Seville]]'' in 1844. The latter cemented his reputation as a [[playwright]]; he went on to write ''[[Richard III (1852 play)|Richard III]]'', a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]-inspired costume drama about [[Richard III of England]], that became Séjour's most acclaimed work. Towards the end of his life, however, Séjour's plays fell out of favor, resulting in a decline in his status.

Written in French, "Le Mulâtre" had little effect on American literature, and was not even translated into [[English language|English]] until the late 20th century. Its condemnation of slavery, however, anticipates the work of later African-American writers such as [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[William Wells Brown]].&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;

==''The Brown Overcoat'' (1858)==
Séjour tended to leave racism discussions out of his plays, as exemplified by his play ''The Brown Overcoat''. It was a typical artificial comedy of the time period with witty comments and puns; however, it has nothing to do with race or greater issues of the world. This being so, Séjour is still known as a great African-American playwright who led a successful career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Theatre USA Revised and Expanded Edition, Vol. 1: Plays by African Americans, The Early Period 1847 to 1938|last=Shine|first=Ted|publisher=Free Press|year=1974|isbn=0-684-82308-X|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waziristani''' ({{lang-ps|وزیرستانۍ}}), also known as '''Wazirwola''' ({{lang-ps|وزیرواله}}, meaning "of the [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazirs]]"), '''Waziri''', '''Dawari''', or '''Maseedwola''', is an east-central [[Pashto dialect]] spoken in [[North Waziristan]], [[South Waziristan]], and parts of [[Bannu District|Bannu]] and [[Tank District|Tank]] in [[Pakistan]], and in certain adjacent districts of [[Paktika Province|Paktika]], [[Khost Province|Khost]] and [[Paktia Province|Paktia]] provinces of [[Afghanistan]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Waziristani dialect is almost identical to the dialect spoken around [[Urgun]] (eastern [[Paktika province]]) and the Bannuchi dialect of [[Bannu]], and somewhat resembles the dialect spoken by [[Khattak]]s in [[Karak, Pakistan|Karak]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The dialects of [[Loya Paktia]] like Zadrani are also very closely related, except that they are of the harsh northern variety.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Waziristani differs significantly in pronunciation and grammar from the standard literary Pashto based on the larger [[Kandahar]], [[Kabul]] and [[Yousafzai]] dialects.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The vowels [a], [ɑ], [u] and [o] of standard Pashto yield [ɑ], [o], [i] and [e] respectively, so [paʂto] becomes [pɑɕte] in Waziristani.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} A special feature of Waziristani is that the phonemes [ʃ] and [ʂ], along with their voiced counterparts, [ʒ] and [ʐ], have merged into the phonemes [ɕ] and [ʑ],{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} both of which also exist in the nearby [[Ormuri]] language of [[Kaniguram]], South Waziristan.&lt;ref&gt;Rozi Khan Burki. [http://www.khyber.org/publications/016-020/ormuri.shtml "Dying Languages; Special Focus on Ormuri"]. Originally published in ''Pakistan Journal of Public Administration; Volume 6. No. 2'' in December 2001. ''Khyber.ORG''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pashto alphabet]] has no symbol for their expression and the regular symbols of ژ and ش may be used.

The standard Pashto word for "boy", "هلک" [halək], is rarely heard in Waziristani, instead, "وېړکی" [weɻkai] meaning "little one" is used. The word "ləshki" [ləɕki] is used instead of the standard "لږ" [ləʐ], "a little bit". The pronoun موږ ([muʐ] or [mung]), meaning "we", is pronounced [miʑ] in Waziristani.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Waziristani, like many other obscure Pashto dialects, is almost never written and its speakers may use standard Pashto as a literary language. Waziristani Pashto is spoken by various tribes, and it is also called ''Maseedwola'' by the [[Mahsuds]] and ''Dawarwola'' by the [[Dawari]]. There are slight differences in pronunciation, for example, the phonemes [t͡s] and [d͡z] can become [s] and [z], or even [t͡ʃ] and [d͡ʒ], depending on the tribe or area the speaker is from.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī''' (160-210 AH/777-825 CE) was an [[Abbasid]] princess, noted for her legacy as a poet and musician.

==Biography==

‘Ulayya was one of the daughters of the third [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Mahdi|al-Mahdi bi-'llah]] (r. 775–85), who reigned from 775 to his death in 785, and was noted for promoting poetry and music in his realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hilary |last=Kilpatrick |chapter=''Mawālī'' and Music |title=Patronate and Patronage in Early and Classical Islam |editor1=Monique Bernards |editor2=John Nawas |place=Leiden |publisher=Brill |year=2005 |pages=326–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was a singer and concubine called Maknūna (herself the ''jāriya'' of one al-Marwānīya). It appears that, with her father dying early in her life, ‘Ulayya was brought up by her half-brother [[Harun al-Rashid]] (r. 786-809).

‘Ulayya was a princess, and, like her half-brother [[Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi]] (779–839), a noted musician, and poet. It has been claimed that she surpassed her brother in skills and while 'not the only princess known to have composed poetry and songs', nonetheless 'the most gifted'.&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick1998&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Hilary |last=Kilpatrick |title=‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī (160-210/777-825) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature |editor1=Julie Scott Meisami |editor2=Paul Starkey |place=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |volume=II |page=791}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Much of her poetry consists of short pieces designed to be sung; in the ''muḥdath'' style, it treats of love, friendship and longing for home, but also includes praise of Hārūn, the caliph, celebration of wine and sharp attacks on enemies.'&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick1998/&gt;

The main source for ‘Ulayya's life is the tenth-century ''[[Kitab al-Aghani|Kitāb al-Aghānī]]'' of [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani|Abū ’l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī]].&lt;ref&gt;al-Iṣfahīnī, Abu l-Faraj, ''Kitāb al-aghānī'', Dār al-Fikr, 21 parts and Index in 9 vols., equivalent to the edition Kairo 1322/1905–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This and other sources tend to portray ‘Ulayya as an accomplished woman who could readily hold her own in court society, but who tended to shy from too prominent a role in public life. She was wealthy and clearly possessed slave-girls, and had an intimate relationship with her powerful brothers; although there is little evidence of her communing with religious scholars, 'various reports in ‘Ulayya's ''tarājim'' refer to her piety and adherence to ritual obligations'.&lt;ref name=Gordon2002&gt;{{cite journal|first=Matthew S. |last=Gordon |title=The Place of Competition: The Careers of ‘Arīb al-Ma’mūnīya and ‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī, Sisters in Song |journal=‘Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of ‘Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6–10 July 2002 |editor-first=James E. |editor-last=Montgomery |place=Leuven |publisher=Peeters |year=2004 |pages=61–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66–68, 74}}

‘Ulayya was married to an ‘Abbāsid prince, but 'love-poems of her addressed to two slaves have been preserved'.&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick1998/&gt; One of the best known anecdotes about her concerns

&lt;blockquote&gt;her relationship with a member of al-Rashīd's palace staff, a ''khādim'' named Ṭall, with whom she would correspond in verse. When al-Rashīd forbids her from uttering his name, she follows his order to the letter even when it precludes her from uttering a line of ''[[Al-Baqara|Sūrat al-Baqara]]'' in which the term ''ṭall'' occurs. When the caliph learns of this, he is swayed and presents Ṭall to her as a gift. In this case, her piety become the means to winning a quite worldly reward.&lt;ref name=Gordon2002/&gt;{{rp|77}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Poetry==

As example of ‘Ulayya's poetry is:

::I held back my love's name and kept repeating it to myself.
::Oh how I long for an empty space to call out the name I love.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah al-Udhari, ''Classical Poems by Arab Women'' (London: Saqi, 1999), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;
