'''163''' ('''one hundred [and] sixty-three''') is the [[natural number]] following [[162 (number)|162]] and preceding [[164 (number)|164]].

==In mathematics==
163 is a [[strong prime]] in the sense that it is greater than the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes.

163 is a [[lucky prime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A031157|2=Numbers that are both lucky and prime|accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[fortunate number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A005235|2=Fortunate numbers|accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

163 is a [[strictly non-palindromic number]], since it is not palindromic in any [[base (exponentiation)|base]] between [[binary number|base 2]] and base 161.

Given 163, the [[Mertens function]] returns 0, it is the fourth prime with this property, the first three such primes are [[2 (number)|2]], [[101 (number)|101]] and [[149 (number)|149]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A100669|2=Zeros of the Mertens function that are also prime|accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

163 figures in an approximation of π, in which &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx {2^9 \over 163} \approx 3.1411&lt;/math&gt;.

163 figures in an approximation of ''e'', in which &lt;math&gt;e \approx {163 \over 3\cdot4\cdot5} \approx 2.7166\dots&lt;/math&gt;.

163 is a [[Heegner number]], the largest of the nine such numbers. That is, the [[ring of integers]] of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-a})&lt;/math&gt; has [[unique factorization domain|unique factorization]] for &lt;math&gt;a=163&lt;/math&gt;. The only other such integers are
&lt;math&gt;a = 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67&lt;/math&gt;. {{OEIS|id=A003173}}

163 is the number of {{math|'''Z'''}}-independent McKay-Thompson series for the [[monster group]]. This fact about 163 might be a clue for understanding [[monstrous moonshine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|author=He, Yang-Hui|author2=McKay, John|title=Sporadic and exceptional|eprint=1505.06742|year=2015|pages=1–49|class=math.AG}} (See p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

163 is a [[permutable prime]] in [[duodecimal|base 12]], which it is written as 117, the [[permutation]]s of its [[Numerical digit|digits]] are 171 and 711, the two numbers in base 12 is [[229 (number)|229]] and [[1021 (number)|1021]] in base 10, both of them are primes.

The function &lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^2 + n + 41&lt;/math&gt; gives prime values for all values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 39, and for &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 10^7&lt;/math&gt; approximately half of all values are prime. 163 appears as a result of solving &lt;math&gt;f(n)=0&lt;/math&gt;, which gives &lt;math&gt;n = (-1+ \sqrt{-163} ) / 2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{163}&lt;/math&gt;
appears in the [[Ramanujan constant]], since -163 is a [[quadratic nonresidue]] to modulo all the primes 3, 5, 7, ..., 37. In which &lt;math&gt;e^{\pi \sqrt{163}}&lt;/math&gt; almost equals the integer 262537412640768744 = 640320&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 744. [[Martin Gardner]] famously asserted that this identity was exact in a 1975 April Fools' hoax in ''[[Scientific American]]''; in fact the value is 262537412640768743.99999999999925007259...

'''Abstraction''' in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying [[essence]] of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent [[phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], in ''The Principles of Mathematics'' Volume 1 (pg 219), refers to "the [[principle of abstraction]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Ash. A Primer of Abstract Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Jan 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary. Edited by Edward Thomas Roe, Le Roy Hooker, Thomas W. Handford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=KhQLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most highly abstract areas of modern mathematics are [[category theory]] and [[model theory]].

==Description==

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of real world problems, before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as [[abstract structure]]s. For example, geometry has its origins in the calculation of distances and areas in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in [[arithmetic]].

Abstraction is an ongoing process in mathematics and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Take the historical development of geometry as an example; the first steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks, with [[Euclid's Elements]] being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry—though Proclus tells of an earlier [[Axiomatic system|axiomatisation]] by [[Hippocrates of Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html Proclus' Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923114020/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century [[Descartes]] introduced [[Cartesian co-ordinates]] which allowed the development of [[analytic geometry]]. Further steps in abstraction were taken by [[Lobachevsky]], [[Bolyai]], [[Riemann]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] who generalised the concepts of geometry to develop [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]. Later in the 19th century mathematicians generalised geometry even further, developing such areas as geometry in [[N-dimensional space|n dimension]]s, [[projective geometry]], [[affine geometry]] and [[finite geometry]]. Finally [[Felix Klein]]'s "[[Erlangen program]]" identified the underlying theme of all of these geometries, defining each of them as the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|properties invariant]] under a given group of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and [[abstract algebra]].

The advantages of abstraction are :

* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics.
* Known results in one area can suggest conjectures in a related area.
* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in a related area.

One disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts can be difficult to learn.&lt;ref&gt;"... introducing pupils to abstract mathematics is not an easy task and requires a long-term effort that must take into account the variety of the contexts in which mathematics is used", P.L. Ferrari, ''Abstraction in Mathematics'', Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 29 July 2003 vol. 358 no. 1435 1225-1230&lt;/ref&gt; A degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience may be needed for [[Assimilation (psychology)|conceptual assimilation]] of abstractions. One of the underlying principles of the [[Montessori education|Montessori]] approach to mathematics education is encouraging children to move from concrete examples to abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://montessoritraining.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/montessori-philosophy-moving-from.html Montessori Philosophy: Moving from Concrete to Abstract], North American Montessori Center&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in ''The Scientific Outlook'' (1931), writes that "Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say."

'''Bacterial growth''' is the [[asexual reproduction]], or [[cell division]], of a [[Bacteria|bacterium]] into two daughter cells, in a process called [[binary fission]]. Providing no mutational event occurs, the resulting daughter cells are genetically identical to the original cell. Hence, bacterial growth occurs. Both daughter cells from the division do not necessarily survive.  However, if the number surviving exceeds unity on average, the bacterial population undergoes [[exponential growth]]. The measurement of an exponential bacterial growth curve in batch culture was traditionally a part of the training of all microbiologists; the basic means requires bacterial enumeration (cell counting) by direct and individual (microscopic, flow cytometry&lt;ref name="pmid6341358"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Skarstad K, Steen HB, Boye E |title=Cell cycle parameters of slowly growing Escherichia coli B/r studied by flow cytometry |journal=[[J. Bacteriol.]] |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=656–62 |year=1983 |pmid=6341358 |doi= |pmc=217513}}&lt;/ref&gt;), direct and bulk (biomass), indirect and individual (colony counting), or indirect and bulk (most probable number, [[turbidity]], nutrient uptake) methods.  Models reconcile theory with the measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |year=1990 |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1875–1881 |title=Modeling of the Bacterial Growth Curve |vauthors=Zwietering MH, Jongenburger I, Rombouts FM, van 'T Riet K |pmid=16348228 |pmc=184525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==

[[image:Bacterial growth en.svg|250px|right|thumb|Bacterial growth curve\Kinetic Curve]]
In [[population ecology|autecological]] studies, the growth of bacteria (or other microorganisms, as [[protozoa]], [[microalgae]] or [[yeast]]s) in batch culture can be modeled with four different phases: '''lag phase''' (A), '''log phase''' or '''exponential phase''' (B), '''stationary phase''' (C), and '''death phase''' (D).&lt;ref name="Fankhauser"&gt;{{cite web

# During '''lag phase''', [[bacterium|bacteria]] adapt themselves to growth conditions. It is the period where the individual [[bacterium|bacteria]] are maturing and not yet able to divide. During the lag phase of the bacterial growth cycle, synthesis of RNA, enzymes and other molecules occurs.  During the lag phase cells change very little because the cells do not immediately reproduce in a new medium. This period of little to no cell division is called the lag phase and can last for 1 hour to several days. During this phase cells are not dormant.&lt;ref&gt;Case, Christine; Funke, Berdell; Tortora, Gerard. ''Microbiology An Introduction''''Italic text'' (Tenth Edition).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The '''log phase''' (sometimes called the logarithmic phase or the ''exponential phase'') is a period characterized by cell doubling.&lt;ref name="Bacanova2008"&gt;"http://www.ifr.ac.uk/bacanova/project_backg.html". Retrieved on May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The number of new bacteria appearing per unit time is proportional to the present population.  If growth is not limited, doubling will continue at a constant rate so both the number of cells and the rate of population increase doubles with each consecutive time period. For this type of exponential growth, plotting the natural logarithm of cell number against time produces a straight line. The slope of this line is the specific growth rate of the organism, which is a measure of the number of divisions per cell per unit time.&lt;ref name="Bacanova2008"/&gt; The actual rate of this growth (i.e. the slope of the line in the figure) depends upon the growth conditions, which affect the frequency of cell division events and the probability of both daughter cells surviving. Under controlled conditions, [[cyanobacteria]] can double their population four times a day and then they can triple their population.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://members.optusnet.com.au/exponentialist/Savage.htm "Marshall T. Savage - An Exponentialist View"]
&lt;/ref&gt; Exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely, however, because the medium is soon depleted of nutrients and enriched with wastes. 
# The '''stationary phase''' is often due to a growth-limiting factor such as the depletion of an essential nutrient, and/or the formation of an inhibitory product such as an organic acid. Stationary phase results from a situation in which growth rate and death rate are equal. The number of new cells created is limited by the growth factor and as a result the rate of cell growth matches the rate of cell death. The result is a “smooth,” horizontal linear part of the curve during the stationary phase. [[Mutation]]s can occur during [[Stationary phase (biology)|stationary phase]]. Bridges et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="pmid11166030"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bridges BA, Foster PL, Timms AR |title=Effect of endogenous carotenoids on "adaptive" mutation in Escherichia coli FC40 |journal=Mutat. Res. |volume=473 |issue=1 |pages=109–19 |year=2001 |pmid=11166030 |pmc=2929247 |doi= 10.1016/s0027-5107(00)00144-5|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented evidence that [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] is responsible for many of the mutations arising in the genomes of stationary phase or starving bacteria.  Endogenously generated [[reactive oxygen species]] appear to be a major source of such damages.&lt;ref name="pmid11166030" /&gt;
#At '''death phase''' (decline phase), bacteria die. This could be caused by lack of nutrients, environmental temperature above or below the tolerance band for the species, or other injurious conditions.
This basic batch culture growth model draws out and emphasizes aspects of bacterial growth which may differ from the growth of macrofauna.  It emphasizes clonality, asexual binary division, the short development time relative to replication itself, the seemingly low death rate, the need to move from a dormant state to a reproductive state or to condition the media, and finally, the tendency of lab adapted strains to exhaust their nutrients. In reality, even in batch culture, the four phases are not well defined. The cells do not reproduce in synchrony without explicit and continual prompting (as in experiments with stalked bacteria &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Novick A |year=1955 |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |title=Growth of Bacteria |volume=9 |pages=97–110 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.09.100155.000525 |pmid=13259461}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and their exponential phase growth is often not ever a constant rate, but instead a slowly decaying rate, a constant stochastic response to pressures both  to reproduce and to go dormant in the face of declining nutrient concentrations and increasing waste concentrations.

Near the end of the logarithmic phase of a batch culture, competence for [[transformation (genetics)|natural genetic transformation]] may be induced, as in ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''&lt;ref name="pmid16561900"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anagnostopoulos C, Spizizen J |title=REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFORMATION IN BACILLUS SUBTILIS |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=741–6 |year=1961 |pmid=16561900 |pmc=279084 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other bacteria.  Natural genetic transformation is a form of DNA transfer that appears to be an adaptation for repairing DNA damages.

Batch culture is the most common laboratory growth method in which bacterial growth is studied, but it is only one of many.  It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally structured.  The bacterial culture is incubated in a closed vessel with a single batch of medium.  In some experimental regimes, some of the bacterial culture is periodically removed and added to fresh sterile medium.  In the extreme case, this leads to the continual renewal of the nutrients.  This is a [[chemostat]], also known as continuous culture.  It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally unstructured, in a steady state defined by the rates of nutrient supply and bacterial growth. In comparison to batch culture, bacteria are maintained in exponential growth phase, and the growth rate of the bacteria is known.  Related devices include [[turbidostat]]s and [[auxostat]]s.  When ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is growing very slowly with a doubling time of 16 hours in a chemostat most cells have a single chromosome.&lt;ref name="pmid6341358"/&gt;

Bacterial growth can be suppressed with [[bacteriostat]]s, without necessarily killing the bacteria. In a [[community ecology|synecological]], true-to-nature situation in which more than one bacterial species is present, the growth of microbes is more dynamic and continual.

Liquid is not the only laboratory environment for bacterial growth.  Spatially structured environments such as biofilms or [[agar]] surfaces present additional complex growth models.

==Environmental conditions==
{{Expand section|date=October 2016}}
&lt;!-- Section needs to be completed or more well rounded and reviewed by someone knowledgeable in the field so it's not missing any key important points. (2016-10-08) --&gt;

Environmental factors influence rate of bacterial growth such as acidity (pH), temperature, water activity, macro and micro nutrients, oxygen levels, and toxins. Conditions tend to be relatively consistent between bacteria with the exception of [[extremophiles]]. Bacterium have optimal growth conditions under which they thrive, but once outside of those conditions the stress can result in either reduced or stalled growth, dormancy (such as formation [[bacterial spore|spores]]), or death.
Maintaining sub-optimal growth conditions is a key principle to [[food preservation]].

===Temperature===
Low temperatures tend to reduce growth rates which has led to refrigeration being instrumental in food preservation. Depending on temperature, bacteria can be classified as:
* '''Psychrophiles'''
[[Psychrophile]]s are extremophilic cold-loving bacteria or archaea with an optimal temperature for growth at about 15&amp;nbsp;°C or lower (maximal temperature for growth at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, minimal temperature for growth at 0&amp;nbsp;°C or lower). Psychrophiles are typically found in Earth's extremely cold ecosystems, such as polar ice-cap regions, permafrost, polar surface, and deep oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0000402.html|title=Psychrophiles and Psychrotrophs|website=www.els.net|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mesophiles'''
[[Mesophile]]s are bacteria that thrive at moderate temperatures, growing best between 20° and 45&amp;nbsp;°C. These temperatures align with the natural body temperatures of humans, which is why many human pathogens are mesophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Mesophile|title=Mesophile - Biology-Online Dictionary|website=www.biology-online.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Thermophiles'''
Survive under temperatures of 45° - 60&amp;nbsp;°C

===Acidity===
Optimal acidity for bacteria tends to be around pH 6.5 to 7.0 with the exception of [[acidophiles]]. Some bacteria can change the pH such as by excreting acid resulting in sub-optimal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blamire|first1=John|title=Effect of pH on Growth Rate|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/CellBio/Growth/MGpH.html|website=Brooklyn College|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water activity===
{{See also|Water activity}}

===Oxygen===
Bacteria can be [[aerobes]] or [[anaerobes]].

===Micronutrients===
Ample nutrients

{{See also|Iron#Biological and pathological role}}

===Toxins===
Toxins such as [[ethanol]] can hinder or kill bacterial growth. This is used beneficially for [[disinfection]] and in [[preservative|food preservation]].

In [[graph theory]], a '''bound graph''' expresses which pairs of elements of some [[partially ordered set]] have an [[upper bound]].  Rigorously, any [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' is a bound graph if there exists a partial order ≤ on the [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of ''G'' with the property that for any vertices ''u'' and ''v'' of ''G'', ''uv'' is an [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] of ''G'' if and only if ''u'' ≠ ''v'' and there is a vertex ''w'' such that ''u'' ≤ ''w'' and ''v'' ≤ ''w''.

Bound graphs are sometimes referred to as ''upper bound graphs'', but the analogously defined '''lower bound graphs''' comprise exactly the same class—any lower bound for ≤ is easily seen to be an upper bound for the [[duality (order theory)|dual]] partial order ≥.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">In [[algebraic geometry]], given a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'', a '''categorical quotient''' of an object ''X'' with [[group action|action]] of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is a [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;\pi: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; that
:(i) is invariant; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\pi \circ \sigma = \pi \circ p_2 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma: G \times X \to X&lt;/math&gt; is the given group action and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the projection.
:(ii) satisfies the universal property: any morphism &lt;math&gt;X \to Z&lt;/math&gt; satisfying (i) uniquely factors through &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.
One of the main motivations for the development of [[geometric invariant theory]] was the construction of a categorical quotient for [[algebraic variety|varieties]] or [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s.

Note &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; need not be [[surjective]]. Also, if it exists, a categorical quotient is unique up to a canonical [[isomorphism]]. In practice, one takes ''C'' to be the category of varieties or the category of schemes over a fixed scheme. A categorical quotient &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a '''universal categorical quotient''' if it is stable under base change: for any &lt;math&gt;Y' \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi': X' = X \times_Y Y' \to Y'&lt;/math&gt; is a categorical quotient.

A basic result is that [[geometric quotient]]s (e.g., &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;) and [[GIT quotient]]s (e.g., &lt;math&gt;X/\!/G&lt;/math&gt;) are categorical quotients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11644">In mathematics, a '''Costas array''' can be regarded [[geometry|geometrically]] as a set of ''n'' points lying on the [[square]]s of a ''n''&amp;times;''n'' [[checkerboard]], such that each row or column contains only one point, and that all of the ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] between each pair of dots are distinct. This results in an ideal "thumbtack" auto-[[ambiguity function]], making the arrays useful in applications such as [[sonar]] and [[radar]]. Costas arrays can be regarded as two-dimensional cousins of the one-dimensional [[Golomb ruler]] construction, and, as well as being of mathematical interest, have similar applications in [[experimental design]] and [[phased array]] radar engineering.

Costas arrays are named after [[John P. Costas (engineer)|John P. Costas]], who first wrote about them in a 1965 technical report. Independently, [[Edgar Gilbert]] also wrote about them in the same year, publishing what is now known as the logarithmic Welch method of constructing Costas arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Costas|1965}}; {{harvtxt|Gilbert|1965}}; [http://nanoexplanations.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/an-independent-discovery-of-costas-arrays/ An independent discovery of Costas arrays], Aaron Sterling, October 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerical representation==
A Costas array may be represented numerically as an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' array of numbers, where each entry is either 1, for a point, or 0, for the absence of a point. When interpreted as [[Logical matrix|binary matrices]], these arrays of numbers have the property that, since each row and column has the constraint that it only has one point on it, they are therefore also [[permutation matrix|permutation matrices]]. Thus, the Costas arrays for any given ''n'' are a subset of the permutation matrices of order ''n''.

Arrays are usually described as a series of indices specifying the column for any row.  Since it is given that any column has only one point, it is possible to represent an array one-dimensionally.  For instance, the following is a valid Costas array of order ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4:

There are dots at coordinates: (1,2), (2,1), (3,3), (4,4)

Since the ''x''-coordinate increases linearly, we can write this in shorthand as the set of all ''y''-coordinates.  The position in the set would then be the ''x''-coordinate.  Observe: {2,1,3,4} would describe the aforementioned array.  This makes it easy to communicate the arrays for a given order of ''N''.

[Online]. Available: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/H21P42. Accessed: Sept. 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; are available.  Although these lists and databases of these Costas arrays are likely near complete, other Costas arrays with orders above 29 that are not in these lists may exist.

==Constructions==

===Welch===
A '''Welch–Costas array''', or just Welch array, is a Costas array generated using the following method, first discovered by [[Edgar Gilbert]] in 1965 and rediscovered in 1982 by [[Lloyd R. Welch]].
The Welch–Costas array is constructed by taking a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] ''g'' of a [[prime number]] ''p'' and defining the array ''A'' by &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j} = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;j \equiv g^i \bmod p&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise 0.  The result is a Costas array of size ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

Example:

3 is a primitive element modulo 5.

:3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 3
:3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 = 4 (mod 5)
:3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 27 = 2 (mod 5)
:3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 81 = 1 (mod 5)

Therefore, [3 4 2 1] is a Costas permutation. More specifically, this is an exponential Welch array. The transposition of the array is a logarithmic Welch array.

The number of Welch–Costas arrays which exist for a given size depends on the [[Euler's totient function|totient function]].

===Lempel–Golomb===
The Lempel–Golomb construction takes α and β to be [[primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]]s of the [[finite field]] GF(''q'') and similarly defines &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j} = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\alpha^i + \beta^j = 1&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise 0.  The result is a Costas array of size ''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2.  If ''α''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 then the first row and column may be deleted to form another Costas array of size ''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3: such a pair of primitive elements exists for every prime power ''q&gt;2''.

===Extensions by Taylor, Lempel, and Golomb===
Generation of new Costas arrays by adding or subtracting a row/column or two with a 1 or a pair of 1's in a corner were published in a paper focused on generation methods&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Golomb, ''Algebraic constructions for Costas arrays'', J. Comb. Theory Series A, volume 7 (1984), pp 1143–1163&lt;/ref&gt; and in Golomb and Taylor's landmark 1984 paper{{sfnp|Golomb|Taylor|1984}}

More sophisticated methods of generating new Costas arrays by deleting rows and columns of existing Costas arrays that were generated by the Welch, Lempel or Golomb generators were published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon W.

'''David Francis Barrow''' ([[Athens, Georgia]], November 14, 1888 – 1970) was an American mathematician who introduced [[Barrow's inequality]] in 1937.

Barrow's father, [[David Crenshaw Barrow Jr.]], was also a mathematician, and served as chancellor of the [[University of Georgia]] from 1906 to 1925. His son, David F. Barrow, did his undergraduate studies at the University of Georgia and then studied at [[Harvard University]], where he earned his Ph.D. in 1913. After a year abroad, he taught for two years at the [[University of Texas]], and then at the [[Sheffield Scientific School]]. After a brief stint in the U.S. armed services, he joined the faculty of his father's university in 1920. He became a full professor in 1923, and chaired the mathematics department in 1944–1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uga.edu/about_us/history.html The History of Mathematics at the  University of Georgia, Department of Mathematics, the University of Georgia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209161759/http://www.math.uga.edu/about_us/history.html |date=2008-02-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11294">In [[computer science]], '''formal specifications''' are mathematically based techniques whose purpose are to help with the implementation of systems and software. They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools.&lt;ref name="a9-hierons"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hierons | first1 = R.

== Motivation ==
In each passing decade computer systems have become increasingly more powerful and as a result they have become more impactful to society. Because of this, better techniques are needed to assist in the design and implementation of reliable software. Established engineering disciplines use mathematical analysis as the foundation of creating and validating product design. Formal specifications are one such way to achieve this in software engineering reliability as once predicted. Other methods such as  [[Software_testing|testing]] are more commonly used to enhance code quality.&lt;ref name=a9-hierons /&gt;

== Uses ==
Given such a [[specification]], it is possible to use [[formal verification]] techniques to demonstrate that a system design is correct with respect to its specification. This allows incorrect system designs to be revised before any major investments have been made into an actual implementation. Another approach is to use probably correct [[Program refinement|refinement]] steps to transform a specification into a design, which is ultimately transformed into an implementation that is ''correct by construction''.

It is important to note that a formal specification is ''not'' an implementation, but rather it may be used to develop an [[implementation]]. Formal specifications describe ''what'' a system should do, not ''how'' the system should do it.

A good specification must have some of the following attributes: adequate, internally consistent, unambiguous, complete, satisfied, minimal&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;

A good specification will have:&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Constructability, manageability and evolvability
* Usability
* Communicability
* Powerful and efficient analysis

One of the main reasons there is interest in formal specifications is that they will provide an ability to perform proofs on software implementations.&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt; These proofs may be used to validate a specification, verify correctness of design, or to prove that a program satisfies a specification.&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt;

== Limitations ==
A design (or implementation) cannot ever be declared “correct” on its own. It can only ever be “correct with respect to a given specification”. Whether the formal specification correctly describes the problem to be solved is a separate issue. It is also a difficult issue to address, since it ultimately concerns the problem constructing abstracted formal representations of an informal concrete [[problem domain]], and such an abstraction step is not amenable to formal proof. However, it is possible to [[verification and validation|validate]] a specification by proving “challenge” [[theorem]]s concerning properties that the specification is expected to exhibit. If correct, these theorems reinforce the specifier's understanding of the specification and its relationship with the underlying problem domain. If not, the specification probably needs to be changed to better reflect the domain understanding of those involved with producing (and implementing) the specification.

Formal methods of software development are not widely used in industry. Most companies do not consider it cost-effective to apply them in their software development processes.&lt;ref name=Ch_27_Formal_spec&gt;{{cite web|last=Sommerville|first=Ian|title=Formal Specification|url=http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ifs/Books/SE9/WebChapters/PDF/Ch_27_Formal_spec.pdf|work=Software Engineering|accessdate=3 February 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be for a variety of reasons, some of which are:

* Time
** High initial start up cost with low measurable returns
* Flexibility 
** A lot of software companies use [[Agile software development|agile methodologies]] that focus on flexibility. Doing a formal specification of the whole system up front is often perceived as being the opposite of flexible.  However, there is some research into the benefits of using formal specifications with "agile" development&lt;ref name="p14-nummenmaasen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nummenmaa|first=Timo|author2=Tiensuu, Aleksi |author3=Berki, Eleni |author4=Mikkonen, Tommi |author5=Kuittinen, Jussi |author6= Kultima, Annakaisa |title=Supporting agile development by facilitating natural user interaction with executable formal specifications|journal=ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes|date=4 August 2011|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1–10|doi=10.1145/1988997.2003643}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Complexity
** They require a high level of mathematical expertise and the analytical skills to understand and apply them effectively&lt;ref name=p14-nummenmaasen/&gt; 
** A solution to this would be to develop tools and models that allow for these techniques to be implemented but hide the underlying mathematics&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt;&lt;ref name=p14-nummenmaasen /&gt;
* Limited scope&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** They do not capture properties of interest for all [[Requirements_analysis#Stakeholder_identification|stakeholders]] in the project&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** They do not do a good job of specifying user interfaces and user interaction&lt;ref name=Ch_27_Formal_spec /&gt;
* Not cost-effective
** This is not entirely true, by limiting their use to only core parts of critical systems they have shown to be cost-effective&lt;ref name=Ch_27_Formal_spec /&gt;

Other limitations:&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Isolation
* Low-level ontologies
* Poor guidance
* Poor separation of concerns
* Poor tool feedback

== Paradigms ==
Formal specification techniques have existed in various domains and on various scales for quite some time.&lt;ref name="p179-vanderpoll"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Poll|first=John A.|author2=Paula Kotze|title=What design heuristics may enhance the utility of a formal specification?|journal=Proceedings of the 2002 annual research conference of the South African institute of computer scientists and information technologists on Enablement through technology|year=2002|series=SAICSIT '02|pages=179–194|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=581506.581533}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementations of formal specifications will differ depending on what kind of system they are attempting to model, how they are applied and at what point in the software life cycle they have been introduced.&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt; These types of models can be categorized into the following specification paradigms:

* History-based specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** behavior based on system histories
** assertions are interpreted over time
* State-based Specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** behavior based on system states
** series of sequential steps, (e.g. a financial transaction)
** languages such as [[Z notation|Z]], [[Vienna Development Method|VDM]] or [[B-Method|B]] rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Transition-based specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** behavior based on transitions from state-to-state of the system
** best used with a reactive system
** languages such as Statecharts, PROMELA, STeP-SPL, RSML or SCR rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Functional specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** specify a system as a structure of mathematical functions
** OBJ, ASL, PLUSS, LARCH, HOL or PVS rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Operational Specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** early languages such as [[Paisley (programming language)|Paisley]], GIST, Petri nets or process algebras rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;

In addition to the above paradigms there are ways to apply certain heuristics to help improve the creation of these specifications. The paper referenced here best discusses heuristics to use when designing a specification.&lt;ref name=p179-vanderpoll /&gt; They do so by applying a [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]] approach.

== Software tools ==
The [[Z notation]] is an example of a leading formal [[specification language]]. Others include the Specification Language(VDM-SL) of the [[Vienna Development Method]] and the [[Abstract Machine Notation]] (AMN) of the [[B-Method]]. In the [[Web services]] area, formal specification is often used to describe non-functional properties&lt;ref&gt;S-Cube Knowledge Model: [http://www.s-cube-network.eu/km/terms/f/formal-specification Formal Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; (Web services [[Quality of Service]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">In [[graph theory]], a '''fractional isomorphism of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s''' whose [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]] are denoted ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[doubly stochastic matrix]] ''D'' such that ''DA'' = ''BD''. If the doubly stochastic matrix is a [[permutation matrix]], then it constitutes a [[graph isomorphism]].

==Computational complexity==
Whereas the [[graph isomorphism problem]] is not known to be decidable in [[time complexity#polynomial time|polynomial time]] and not known to be [[NP-complete]], the fractional graph isomorphism problem is decidable in polynomial time because it is a special case of the [[linear programming]] problem, for which there is an efficient solution.

==Equivalence to coarsest equitable partition ==

Two graphs are also fractionally isomorphic if they have a common coarsest [[equitable partition]]. A [[partition of a set|partition]] of a graph is a collection of pairwise disjoint sets of vertices whose union is the vertex set of the graph. A partition is equitable if for any pair of vertices ''u'' and ''v'' in the same block of the partition and any block ''B'' of the partition, both ''u'' and ''v'' have the same number of neighbors in ''B''. An equitable partition ''P'' is coarsest if each block in any other equitable partition is a subset of a block in ''P''. Two coarsest equitable partitions ''P'' and ''Q'' are common if there is a [[bijection]] ''f'' from the blocks of ''P'' to the blocks of ''Q'' such for any blocks ''B'' and ''C'' in ''P'', the number of neighbors in ''C'' of any vertex in ''B'' equals the number of neighbors in ''f(C)'' of any vertex in ''f(B)''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">In [[graph theory]],''' Graph equations''' are [[equations]] in which the unknowns are [[Graph theory|graphs]]. One of the central questions of graph theory concerns the notion of [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphism]]. We ask: When are two graphs the same (i.e., [[graph isomorphism]])? The graphs in question may be expressed differently in terms of graph equations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/113386917/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0  Bibliography on Graph equations ]&lt;/ref&gt;

What are the graphs ([[root of a function|solutions]]) ''G'' and ''H'' such that the [[line graph]] of ''G'' is same as the [[total graph]] of ''H''? (What are ''G'' and ''H'' such that  ''L''(''G'') = '' T''( ''H'') ? ).

For example, ''G'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''H'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the solutions of the graph equation  ''L''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)  =  ''T''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''G'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''H'' = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the solutions of the graph equation ''L''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''T''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

'''Grigore Constantin Moisil''' ({{IPA-ro|ɡriˈɡore mo.iˈsil|lang}}; 10 January 1906 – 21 May 1973) was a [[Romania]]n [[mathematician]], [[computer]] pioneer, and [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]]. His research was mainly in the fields of [[mathematical logic]], ([[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra]]), [[algebraic logic]], [[MV-algebra]], and [[differential equations]]. He is viewed as the father of [[computer science]] in Romania.

Moisil was also a member of the [[Academy of Sciences of Bologna]] and of the International Institute of Philosophy.  In 1996, the [[IEEE Computer Society]] awarded him posthumously the ''Computer Pioneer'' Award.

==Biography==
Grigore Moisil was born in 1906 in Tulcea into an [[intellectual]] family. His great-grandfather, Grigore Moisil (1814–1891), a [[clergyman]], was one of the founders of the [[George Coșbuc National College (Năsăud)|first Romanian high school]] in [[Năsăud]]. His father, [[Constantin Moisil]] (1876–1958), was a history professor, [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[numismatics|numismatist]]; as a member of the [[Romanian Academy]], he filled the position of Director of the Numismatics Office of the Academy. His mother, Elena (1863–1949), was a teacher in Tulcea, later the director of "Maidanul Dulapului" school in [[Bucharest]] (now "[[Enăchiţă Văcărescu]]" school).

Grigore Moisil attended [[primary school]] in Bucharest, then high school in [[Vaslui]] and Bucharest (at "[[Spiru Haret]]" High School) between 1916 and 1922. In 1924 he was admitted to the Civil Engineering School of the [[Polytechnic University of Bucharest]], and also the Mathematics School of the [[University of Bucharest]]. He showed a stronger interest in mathematics, so he quit  the Polytechnic University in 1929, despite already having passed all the third-year exams. In  1929 he defended his [[Ph.D.]] thesis, ''La mécanique analytique des systemes continus'' (Analytical mechanics of continuous systems), before a commission led by [[Gheorghe Ţiţeica]], with [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]] and [[Anton Davidoglu]] as members. The thesis was published the same year by the Gauthier-Villars publishing house in [[Paris]], and received favourable comments from [[Vito Volterra]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], and [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]].

In 1930 Moisil went to the [[University of Paris]] for further study in mathematics, which he finalized the next year with the paper ''On a class of systems of equations with partial derivatives from mathematical physics''. In 1931 he returned to Romania,  where he was appointed in a teaching position at the Mathematics School of the [[University of Iaşi]]. Shortly after, he left for a one-year [[Rockefeller Foundation]] scholarship to study in [[Rome]].
In 1932 he returned to Iaşi, where he remained for almost 10 years, developing a close relationship with professor [[Alexandru Myller]]. He taught the first [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]] course in Romania, named ''Logic and theory of proof'', at the University of Iaşi. During that time, he started writing a series of papers based on the works of [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] in [[multi-valued logic]]. His research in mathematical logic laid the foundation for significant work done afterwards in Romania, as well as [[Argentina]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Hungary]]. While in Iaşi, he completed research remarkable for the many new ideas and for his way of finding and using new connections between concepts from different areas of mathematics. He was promoted to Full Professor in November 1939.

In 1941, a position of professor at the [[University of Bucharest]] opened up, and Moisil applied for it. However, [[Gheorghe Vrânceanu]], [[Ion Barbu|Dan Barbilian]], and [[Miron Nicolescu]] also applied for the position, and Vrânceanu got it.  Moisil approached the Ministry of Education, arguing that it would be a great opportunity for mathematics in Romania if all four could be appointed. As a result of his appeal, all four mathematicians were hired.  Moisil moved to [[Bucharest]], where he became a Professor in the School of Mathematics (later the School of Mathematics and Computer Science) at the University of Bucharest, on 30 December 1941.

From 1946 to 1948, Moisil took a leave of absence, being named [[plenipotentiary]] envoy to [[Ankara]]. While in [[Turkey]], he gave several series of mathematics lectures at [[Istanbul University]] and [[Istanbul Technical University]].

In 1948, he resumed teaching at the University of Bucharest. That same year, he was elected to the Romanian Academy, and a member of the [[Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy]]. After 1965, one of his outstanding students – ''George Georgescu'' – worked closely with him on multi-valued logics, and after the emergence of Romania from dictatorship in 1989, he became a Professor of Mathematics and Logic at the same university and department as Moisil in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060628152508/http://fmi.unibuc.ro/ro/catedre/funinf/georgescu_george/ Prof.dr. Georgescu George]. Department of Mathematics and Informatics of the Bucharest&lt;/ref&gt; His student also published extensive, original work on [[algebraic logic]], [[MV-algebra]], [[algebra]], [[algebraic topology]], categories of [[MV-algebra]]s, [[category theory]] and [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=253 Algebraic Mathematics and Logics]. 2009.

==Work==
Moisil published papers on [[mechanics]], [[mathematical analysis]], [[geometry]], [[algebra]] and [[mathematical logic]]. He developed a multi-dimensional extension of Pompeiu's [[areolar derivative]], and studied [[monogenic function]]s of one [[Hypercomplex number|hypercomplex]] variable with applications to mechanics. Moisil also introduced some [[MV-algebra|many-valued algebras]], which he called Łukasiewicz algebras (now also named [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras]]), and used them in logic and the study of [[automata theory]]. He created new methods to analyze [[Deterministic finite automaton|finite automata]], and had many contributions to the field of automata theory in algebra.

Moisil had important contributions in the creation of the first Romanian [[computer]]s. He played a fundamental role in the development of [[computer science]] in Romania, and in raising the first generations of Romanian computer scientists. In 1996, he was awarded by exception posthumously the [[Computer Pioneer Award]] by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] [[Computer Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">In [[numerical analysis]], one or more '''guard digits''' can be used to reduce the amount of [[Rounding|roundoff]] error.

For example, suppose that the final result of a long, multi-step calculation can be safely rounded off to ''N'' decimal places.  That is to say, the roundoff error introduced by this final roundoff makes a negligible contribution to the overall uncertainty.

However, it is quite likely that it is ''not'' safe to round off the intermediate steps in the calculation to the same number of digits.  Be aware that roundoff errors can accumulate.  If ''M'' decimal places are used in the intermediate calculation, we say there are ''M−N'' guard digits.

Guard digits are also used in floating point operations in most computer systems.  Given &lt;math&gt;2^1 \times 0.100_2 - 2^0 \times 0.111_2&lt;/math&gt; we have to line up the binary points.  This means we must add an extra digit to the first operand—a guard digit.  This gives us &lt;math&gt;2^1 \times 0.1000_2 - 2^1 \times 0.0111_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Performing this operation gives us &lt;math&gt;2^1 \times 0.0001_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{-2} \times 0.100_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Without using a guard digit we have &lt;math&gt;2^1 \times 0.100_2 - 2^1 \times 0.011_2&lt;/math&gt;, yielding &lt;math&gt;2^1 \times 0.001_2=&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{-1} \times 0.100_2&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives us a relative error of 1.  Therefore, we can see how important guard digits can be.

An example of the error caused by floating point roundoff is illustrated in the following [[C (programming language)|C]] code.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
int main(){
   double a;
   int i;

   a = 0.2; 
   a += 0.1; 
   a -= 0.3;

   for(i = 0; a &lt; 1.0; i++) 
       a += a;

   printf("i=%d, a=%f\n", i, a);

   return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
It appears that the program should not terminate. Yet the output is :  &lt;pre&gt;i=54, a=1.000000&lt;/pre&gt;

Another example is:

Take 2 numbers: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2.56*10^0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2.34*10^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

we bring the first number to the same power of &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt; as the second one: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0.0256*10^2&lt;/math&gt;

The addition of the 2 numbers is:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
0.0256*10^2 
2.3400*10^2 +  
____________ 
2.3656*10^2 
&lt;/pre&gt;

After padding the second number (i.e., &lt;math&gt;2.34*10^2 &lt;/math&gt;) with two &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;s, the bit after &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; is the guard digit, and the bit after is the round digit. The result after rounding is &lt;math&gt;2.37&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to &lt;math&gt;2.36&lt;/math&gt;, without the extra bits (guard and round bits), i.e., by considering only &lt;math&gt;0.02+2.34 = 2.36&lt;/math&gt;. The error therefore is &lt;math&gt;0.01&lt;/math&gt;.

'''ISO 128''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|international standard]] (ISO), about the general principles of [[presentation]] in [[technical drawing]]s, specifically the [[graphical representation]] of [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] on [[technical drawing]]s.&lt;ref name="ISO 128-1:2003"&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32462 ISO 128-1:2003 Abstract]. Accessed 1 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Since 2003 the ISO 128 standard contains twelve parts, which were initiated between 1996 and 2003. It starts with a summary of the general rules for the execution and structure of technical drawings. Further it describes basic conventions for [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[Graphical projection|view]]s, cuts and [[Cross section (geometry)|sections]], and different types of [[engineering drawing]]s, such as those for mechanical engineering, architecture, civil engineering, and shipbuilding. It is applicable to both manual and computer-based drawings, but it is not applicable to three-dimensional [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] models.&lt;ref name="ISO 128-1:2003"/&gt;

The ISO 128 replaced the previous DIN 6 standard for drawings, projections and views, which was first published in 1922 and updated in 1950 and 1968. ISO 128 itself was first published in 1982, contained 15 pages and "specified the general principles of presentation to be applied to [[technical drawings]] following the [[orthographic projection]] methods".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techstreet.com/cgi-bin/detail?product_id=23666 ISO 128] techstreet.com, 2009.){{dl|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several parts of this standard have been updated individually. The last parts and the standard as a whole were withdrawn by the ISO in 2001.

A thirteenth part was added in 2013.

[[File:Fract120705.jpg|thumb|A [[Mandelbrot set]] fractal]]
The '''invariant set postulate''' concerns the possible relationship between [[fractal|fractal geometry]] and [[quantum mechanics]] and in particular the hypothesis that the former can assist in resolving some of the challenges posed by the latter. It is underpinned by nonlinear [[dynamical systems theory]] and [[black hole thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=palm&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2009.0080|author=Palmer, T. N.|arxiv=0812.1148|title=The Invariant Set Postulate: a new geometric framework for the foundations of quantum theory and the role played by gravity|year=2009|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=465|pages=3165|issue=2110|bibcode = 2009RSPSA.465.3165P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
The proposer of the postulate is climate scientist and physicist [[Tim Palmer (physicist)|Tim Palmer]]. Palmer completed a PhD at the [[University of Oxford]] under [[Dennis Sciama]], the same supervisor that [[Stephen Hawking]] had and then worked with Hawking himself at the [[University of Cambridge]] on [[supergravity|supergravity theory]]. He later switched to [[meteorology]] and has established a reputation pioneering [[ensemble forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Buizza, R., &amp; Palmer, T. N., (1998) "Impact of ensemble size on the skill and the potential skill of an ensemble prediction system." Mon. Wea. Rev., '''126''', 9, pp. 2503-2518.&lt;/ref&gt; He now works at the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], England.&lt;ref name=Buch&gt;Buchanan, Mark (30 March 2009) “Can fractals make sense of the quantum world?” ''[[New Scientist]]''. No 2701. pp. 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biblio&gt;Buchanan, Mark (30 March 2009) [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_quantum03.htm “Can fractals make sense of the quantum world?: Quantum ambitions”] bibliotecapleyades.net. Retrieved 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Palmer argues that the postulate may help to resolve some of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics that have been discussed since the [[Bohr–Einstein debates]] of the 1920s and 30s and which remain unresolved. The idea backs [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] view that quantum theory is incomplete, but also agrees with [[Niels Bohr|Bohr's]] contention that quantum systems are not independent of the observer.
[[Image:Perimeter Institute.jpg|thumb|The [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]]]]

The key idea involved is that there exists a [[state space]] for the Universe, and that the state of the entire Universe can be expressed as a point in this state space. This state space can then be divided into "real" and "unreal" sets (parts), where, for example, the states where the Nazis lost WW2 are in the "real" set, and the states where the Nazis won WW2 are in the "unreal" set of points. The partition of state space into these two sets is unchanging, making the sets invariant.

If the Universe is a complex system affected by [[Chaos theory|chaos]] then its [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant set]] (a fixed state of rest) is likely to be a fractal. According to Palmer this could resolve problems posed by the [[Kochen–Specker theorem]], which appears to indicate that physics may have to abandon the idea of any kind of objective reality, and the apparent paradox of [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]. In a paper submitted to the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'' he indicates how the idea can account for quantum uncertainty and problems of "contextuality".&lt;ref name=Buch/&gt; For example, exploring the quantum problem of [[wave-particle duality]], one of the central mysteries of quantum theory, the author claims that "in terms of the Invariant Set Postulate, the paradox is easily resolved, in principle at least".&lt;ref name=palm/&gt; The paper and related talks given at the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics|Perimeter Institute]] and [[University of Oxford]] also explores the role of [[gravity]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name=palm/&gt;&lt;ref name=palmtalk1&gt;Palmer, T. N. (21 October 2008) [http://pirsa.org/08100022 “Hawking Boxes and Invariant Sets - A New Look at the Foundations of Quantum Theory and the Associated Role of Gravity”]. ''[[Perimeter Institute]]''. PIRSA:08100022.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=palmtalk2&gt;Palmer, T. N. (April 2009) [http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/talksarchive/talk/0904002.html “The invariant set hypothesis: a new geometric framework for the foundations of quantum theory and the role played by gravity”]. ''[[University of Oxford]]''. Quantum Physics and Logic 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[New Scientist]]'' quotes Bob Coeke of Oxford University as stating "What makes this really interesting is that it gets away from the usual debates over multiple universes and hidden variables and so on. It suggests there might be an underlying physical geometry that physics has just missed, which is radical and very positive". He added that "Palmer manages to explain some quantum phenomena, but he hasn't yet derived the whole rigid structure of the theory. This is really necessary."&lt;ref name=Buch/&gt;

Robert Spekkens of the Perimeter Institute has said: "I think his approach is really interesting and novel. Other physicists have shown how you can find a way out of the [[Kochen–Specker theorem]], but this work actually provides a mechanism to explain the theorem."&lt;ref name=biblio/&gt;

'''János Bolyai''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈjaːnoʃ ˈboːjɒi|lang}}; 15 December 1802 – 27 January 1860) or '''Johann Bolyai''',&lt;ref&gt;Tucker McElroy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MiZIWtX9AJUC&amp;pg=PA40 ''A to Z of Mathematicians'']&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]], one of the founders of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] — a geometry that differs from [[Euclidean geometry]] in its definition of parallel lines. The discovery of a consistent alternative geometry that might correspond to the structure of the universe helped to free mathematicians to study abstract concepts irrespective of any possible connection with the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/72441/Janos-Bolyai Encyclopædia Britannica: János Bolyai]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bolyai was born in the Hungarian town of Kolozsvár, [[Grand Principality of Transylvania]] (now [[Cluj-Napoca]] in [[Romania]]), the son of Zsuzsanna Benkő and the well-known mathematician [[Farkas Bolyai]].

[[File:Bolyai Janos szulohaza.jpg|right|thumb|The house where the mathematician János Bolyai was born]]
By the age of 13, he had mastered [[calculus]] and other forms of [[analytical mechanics]], receiving instruction from his father. He studied at the [[Theresian Military Academy|Imperial and Royal Military Academy]] (TherMilAk) in [[Vienna]] from 1818 to 1822.

==Career==
Bolyai became so obsessed with [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] that his father, who had pursued the same subject for many years, wrote to him in 1820: "You must not attempt this approach to parallels. I know this way to the very end. I have traversed this bottomless night, which extinguished all light and joy in my life. I entreat you, leave the science of parallels alone...Learn from my example."&lt;ref name=Ellenberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellenberg |first=Jordan| authorlink=Jordan Ellenberg |date=May 2014 |title=[[How Not to Be Wrong]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]] |publisher=Penguin Group |page=395 |isbn=978-0-14-312-753-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

János, however, persisted in his quest and eventually came to the conclusion that the postulate is independent of the other axioms of geometry and that different consistent geometries can be constructed on its negation. In 1823, he wrote to his father: "I have discovered such wonderful things that I was amazed...out of nothing I have created a strange new universe."&lt;ref name=Ellenberg/&gt; Between 1820 and 1823 he had prepared a treatise on a complete system of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Bolyai's work was published in 1832 as an appendix to a mathematics textbook by his father.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], on reading the Appendix, wrote to a friend saying "I regard this young [[geometer]] Bolyai as a genius of the first order."&lt;ref name="St Andrews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Bolyai.html &lt;!--alternate version of link: http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bolyai.html--&gt; |title=Boylai Biography |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=March 2004 |website=University of St Andrews |access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Bolyai, however, Gauss wrote: "To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work...coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years."&lt;ref name=Ellenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt; In 1848 Bolyai discovered that [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] had published a similar piece of work in 1829. Though Lobachevsky published his work a few years earlier than Bolyai, it contained only [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Bolyai and Lobachevsky did not know each other or each other's works.

In addition to his work in geometry, Bolyai developed a rigorous geometric concept of [[complex numbers]] as ordered pairs of [[real numbers]]. Although he never published more than the 24 pages of the Appendix, he left more than 20,000 pages of mathematical manuscripts when he died. These can now be found in the [[Teleki-Bolyai Library]] in Marosvásárhely (today [[Târgu Mureş]]), where Bolyai died.

==Personal life==
He was an accomplished [[Hyperpolyglot|polyglot]] speaking nine foreign [[language]]s, including [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Bolyai.html|title=Bolyai biography|website=www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned the violin and performed in Vienna. {{Cquote|It is related of him that he was challenged by thirteen officers of his garrison, a thing not unlikely to happen considering how differently he thought from everyone else. He fought them all in succession – making it his only condition that he should be allowed to play on his violin for an interval between meeting each opponent. He disarmed or wounded all his antagonists. It can be easily imagined that a temperament such as his was not one congenial to his military superiors. He was retired in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinton|first1=Charles Howard|authorlink1=Charles Howard Hinton|title=The Fourth Dimension|date=1912|orig-year=1904|publisher=G.

Entire chapter V, "The Second Chapter in the History of Four Space", pp. 41–60, provides accessible, illustrated, introduction to his life and work.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
No original portrait of Bolyai survives. An unauthentic picture appears in some encyclopedias and on a Hungarian postage stamp.&lt;ref name=amsNotices /&gt;

== Legacy ==
&lt;!-- see http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolyai_J%C3%A1nos#Bolyai-arck.C3.A9pek --&gt;
The [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]], that was established in 1959, bears his name, as does the crater [[Bolyai (crater)|Bolyai]] on the [[Moon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/printerready/science/geography_items/carters/craters_b.html NASA website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023083235/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/printerready/science/geography_items/carters/craters_b.html |date=23 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[János Bolyai Mathematical Institute]]  at the [[University of Szeged]]. Furthermore, [[1441 Bolyai]], a [[minor planet]] discovered in 1937, is named after him; and many{{Quantify|date=October 2013}} primary and secondary schools in the [[Carpathian Basin]] bear his name, e.g. Bolyai János Műszaki Szakközépiskola in [[Budapest]], Bolyai János Gyakorló Általános Iskola és Gimnázium in [[Szombathely]], Bolyai János Általános Iskola in [[Debrecen]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  A street in Budapest, Hungary and another one in Temesvár (now [[Timișoara]]), Romania is also named after him. The professional society of Hungarian mathematicians also bears his name. Bolyai is a minor character in the 1969 science-fiction/fantasy story [[Operation Chaos (novel)|"Operation Changeling"]], where his unique abilities allow the protagonists to navigate the non-Euclidean geometry of [[Hell]].

There is also a mathematical award given out every five years named the [[Bolyai Prize]].

In [[computability theory]],  '''Kleene's recursion theorems''' are a pair of fundamental results about the application of [[computable function]]s to their own descriptions.    The theorems were first proved by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] in 1938 and appear in his 1952 book ''Introduction to Metamathematics''. A related theorem which constructs fixed points of a computable function is known as '''Rogers's theorem''' and is due to [[Hartley Rogers, Jr.]] (1967).

The recursion theorems can be applied to construct [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of certain operations on [[computable function]]s, to generate [[quine (computing)|quines]], and to construct functions defined via [[recursive definition]]s.

== Notation ==

The statement of the theorems refers to an [[admissible numbering]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of the [[partial recursive function]]s, such that the function corresponding to index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\varphi_e&lt;/math&gt;.  In programming terms, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; represents a program and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_e&lt;/math&gt; represents the function computed by this program.

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are [[partial function]]s on the natural numbers, the notation &lt;math&gt;F \simeq G&lt;/math&gt; indicates that, for each ''n'', either &lt;math&gt;F(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(n)&lt;/math&gt; are both defined and are equal, or else &lt;math&gt;F(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(n)&lt;/math&gt; are both undefined.

== Rogers's fixed-point theorem ==
Given a function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, a '''fixed point''' of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_e \simeq \varphi_{F(e)}&lt;/math&gt;. Rogers (Rogers 1967: §11.2) describes the following result as "a simpler version" of Kleene's (second) recursion theorem.

:'''Rogers's fixed-point theorem'''. If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a total computable function, it has a fixed point.

=== Proof of the fixed-point theorem ===

The proof uses a particular total computable function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, defined as follows. Given a natural number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; outputs the index of the partial computable function that performs the following computation:
:Given an input  &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, first attempt to compute &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{x}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. If that computation returns an output &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, then compute &lt;math&gt;\varphi_e(y)&lt;/math&gt; and return its value, if any. 
Thus, for all indices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of partial computable functions, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{h(x)} \simeq \varphi_{\varphi_x(x)}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not defined, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{h(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is a function that is nowhere defined.   The function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed from the partial computable function &lt;math&gt;g(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; described above and the [[s-m-n theorem]]: for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the index of a program which computes the function &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto g(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

To complete the proof, let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be any total computable function, and construct &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; as above. Let &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; be an index of the composition &lt;math&gt;F \circ h&lt;/math&gt;, which is a total computable function.  Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{h(e)} \simeq \varphi_{\varphi_e(e)}&lt;/math&gt; by the definition of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.
But, because &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an index of &lt;math&gt;F \circ h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_e(e) = (F \circ h)(e)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\varphi_e(e)} \simeq \varphi_{F(h(e))}&lt;/math&gt;. By the transitivity of &lt;math&gt;\simeq&lt;/math&gt;, this means &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{h(e)} \simeq \varphi_{F(h(e))}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;\varphi_n \simeq \varphi_{F(n)}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n = h(e)&lt;/math&gt;.

This proof is a construction of a [[partial recursive function]] which implements the [[Fixed-point combinator|Y combinator]].

=== Fixed-point free functions ===

A function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \varphi_e \not \simeq \varphi_{F(e)}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is called '''fixed point free'''.  The fixed-point theorem shows that no computable function is fixed point free, but there are many non-computable fixed-point free functions. '''Arslanov's completeness criterion''' states that the only [[recursively enumerable]] [[Turing degree]] that computes a fixed point free function is '''0&amp;prime;''', the degree of the [[halting problem]] (Soare 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;88)

== Kleene's second recursion theorem ==

The second recursion theorem is a generalization of Rogers's theorem with a second input in the function. One informal interpretation of the second recursion theorem is that it is possible to construct self-referential programs; see "Application to quines" below.

:'''The second recursion theorem'''.  For any partial recursive function &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; there is an index &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_p \simeq \lambda y.Q(p,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem can be proved from Rogers's theorem by letting &lt;math&gt;F(p)&lt;/math&gt; be a function such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{F(p)}(y) = Q(p,y)&lt;/math&gt; (a construction described by the [[Smn theorem|S-m-n theorem]]). One can then verify that a fixed-point of this &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an index &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; as required. The theorem is constructive in the sense that a fixed computable function maps an index for ''Q'' into the index ''p''.

=== Comparison to Rogers's theorem ===
Kleene's second recursion theorem and Rogers's theorem can both be proved, rather simply, from each other (Jones, 1997: p.&amp;nbsp;229-230). However, a direct proof of Kleene's theorem (Kleene 1952: p.&amp;nbsp;352-353) does not make use of a universal program, which means that the theorem holds for certain subrecursive programming systems that do not have a universal program.

=== Application to quines ===

A classic example using the second recursion theorem is the function &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)=x&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding  index &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in this case yields a computable function that outputs its own index when applied to any value (Cutland 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;204). When expressed as computer programs, such indices are known as '''[[Quine (computing)|quine]]s'''.

The following example in [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] illustrates how the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in the corollary can be effectively produced from the function &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.   The function &lt;code&gt;s11&lt;/code&gt; in the code is the function of that name produced by the [[S-m-n theorem]].

&lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; can be changed to any two-argument function.
&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(setq Q '(lambda (x y) x))
(setq s11 '(lambda (f x) (list 'lambda '(y) (list f x 'y))))
(setq n (list 'lambda '(x y) (list Q (list s11 'x 'x) 'y)))
(setq p (eval (list s11 n n)))
&lt;/source&gt;

The results of the following expressions should be the same. &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;code&gt;p(nil)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(eval (list p nil))
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Q(p, nil)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(eval (list Q p nil))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Application to elimination of recursion ===
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are total computable functions that are used in a recursive definition for a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;f(0,y) \simeq g(y),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x+1,y) \simeq h(f(x,y),x,y),&lt;/math&gt;

The second recursion theorem can be used to show that such equations define a computable function, where the notion of computability does not have to allow, a priori, for recursive definitions (for example, it may be defined by [[M-recursive function|&amp;mu;-recursion]], or by [[Turing machine]]s). This recursive definition can be converted into a computable function &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{F}(e,x,y)&lt;/math&gt; that assumes &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an index to itself, to simulate recursion:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{F}(e,0,y) \simeq g(y),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{F}(e,x+1,y) \simeq h(\varphi_e(x,y),x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

The recursion theorem establishes the existence of a computable function &lt;math&gt;\varphi_f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_f(x,y) \simeq \varphi_{F}(f,x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the given recursive definition.

=== Reflexive programming ===
Reflexive, or [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflective]], programming refers to the usage of self-reference in programs. Jones (1997) presents a view of the second recursion theorem based on a reflexive language.
It is shown that the reflexive language defined is not stronger than a language without reflection (because an interpreter for the reflexive language can be implemented without using reflection); then, it is shown that the recursion theorem is almost trivial in the reflexive language.

== The first recursion theorem ==

While the second recursion theorem is about fixed points of computable functions, the first recursion theorem is related to fixed points determined by enumeration operators, which are a computable analogue of inductive definitions. An '''enumeration operator''' is a set of pairs (''A'',''n'') where ''A'' is a ([[Gödel number|code]] for a) finite set of numbers and ''n'' is a single natural number. Often, ''n'' will be viewed as a code for an ordered pair of natural numbers, particularly when functions are defined via enumeration operators. Enumeration operators are of central importance in the study of [[enumeration reducibility]].

Each enumeration operator Φ determines a function from sets of naturals to sets of naturals given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(X) = \{ n \mid \exists A \subseteq X [(A,n) \in \Phi]\}.&lt;/math&gt;
A '''recursive operator''' is an enumeration operator that, when given the graph of a partial recursive function, always returns the graph of a partial recursive function.

A fixed point of an enumeration operator Φ is a set ''F'' such that Φ(''F'') = ''F''. The first enumeration theorem shows that fixed points can be effectively obtained if the enumeration operator itself is computable.

:'''First recursion theorem'''. The following statements hold.
:# For any computable enumeration operator Φ there is a recursively enumerable set ''F'' such that Φ(''F'') = ''F'' and ''F'' is the smallest set with this property.
:# For any recursive operator Ψ there is a partial computable function φ such that Ψ(φ) = φ and φ is the smallest partial computable function with this property.

=== Example ===

Like the second recursion theorem, the first recursion theorem can be used to obtain functions satisfying systems of recursion equations. To apply the first recursion theorem, the recursion equations must first be recast as a recursive operator.

Consider the recursion equations for the [[factorial]] function ''f'':

&lt;math&gt;f(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(n+1) = (n + 1) \cdot f(n)&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding recursive operator Φ will have information that tells how to get to the next value of ''f'' from the previous value. However, the recursive operator will actually define the graph of ''f''. First, Φ will contain the pair &lt;math&gt;( \varnothing, (0, 1))&lt;/math&gt;. This indicates that ''f''(0) is unequivocally 1, and thus the pair (0,1) is in the graph of ''f''.

Next, for each ''n'' and ''m'', Φ will contain the pair &lt;math&gt;( \{ (n, m) \}, (n+1, (n+1)\cdot m))&lt;/math&gt;. This indicates that, if ''f''(''n'') is ''m'', then ''f''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) is (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''m'', so that the pair (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''m'') is in the graph of ''f''. Unlike the base case ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the recursive operator requires some information about ''f''(''n'') before it defines a value of ''f''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1).

The first recursion theorem (in particular, part 1) states that there is a set ''F'' such that Φ(''F'') = F. The set ''F'' will consist entirely of ordered pairs of natural numbers, and will be the graph of the factorial function ''f'', as desired.

The restriction to recursion equations that can be recast as recursive operators ensures that the recursion equations actually define a least fixed point. For example, consider the set of recursion equations:

&lt;math&gt;g(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g(n + 1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g(2n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

There is no function ''g'' satisfying these equations, because they imply ''g''(2) = 1 and also imply ''g''(2) = 0. Thus there is no fixed point ''g'' satisfying these recursion equations. It is possible to make an enumeration operator corresponding to these equations, but it will not be a recursive operator.

=== Proof sketch for the first recursion theorem ===

The proof of part 1 of the first recursion theorem is obtained by iterating the enumeration operator Φ beginning with the empty set. First, a sequence ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is constructed, for &lt;math&gt;k  = 0, 1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;.  Let ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the empty set. Proceeding inductively, for each ''k'', let ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; be &lt;math&gt;F_k \cup \Phi(F_k)&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, ''F'' is taken to be &lt;math&gt;\bigcup F_k&lt;/math&gt;.  The remainder of the proof consists of a verification that ''F'' is recursively enumerable and is the least fixed point of Φ.   The sequence ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; used in this proof corresponds to the Kleene chain in the proof of the [[Kleene fixed-point theorem]].

The second part of the first recursion theorem follows from the first part. The assumption that Φ is a recursive operator is used to show that the fixed point of Φ is the graph of a partial function. The key point is that if the fixed point ''F'' is not the graph of a function, then there is some ''k'' such that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is not the graph of a function.

=== Comparison to the second recursion theorem ===

Compared to the second recursion theorem, the first recursion theorem produces a stronger conclusion but only when narrower hypotheses are satisfied.  Rogers (1967) uses the term '''weak recursion theorem''' for the first recursion theorem and '''strong recursion theorem''' for the second recursion theorem.

One difference between the first and second recursion theorems is that the fixed points obtained by the first recursion theorem are guaranteed to be least fixed points, while those obtained from the second recursion theorem may not be least fixed points.

A second difference is that the first recursion theorem only applies to systems of equations that can be recast as recursive operators. This restriction is similar to the restriction to continuous operators in the [[Kleene fixed-point theorem]] of [[order theory]]. The second recursion theorem can be applied to any total recursive function.

== Generalized theorem ==
[[Anatoly Maltsev]] proved a generalized version of the recursion theorem for any set with a [[precomplete numbering]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. A Gödel numbering is a precomplete numbering on the set of computable functions so the generalized theorem yields the Kleene recursion theorem as a special case.

Given a precomplete numbering &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; then for any partial computable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with two parameters there exists a total computable function &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with one parameter such that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{N} : \nu \circ f(n,t(n)) = \nu \circ t(n).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7758">In [[algebra]], the '''Leibniz formula''', named in honor of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], expresses the [[determinant]] of a [[square matrix]] in terms of permutations of the matrix elements. If ''A'' is an ''n''×''n'' matrix, where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the entry in the ''i''th row and ''j''th column of ''A'', the formula is
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A) = \sum_{\tau \in S_n} \sgn(\tau) \prod_{i = 1}^n a_{i, \tau(i)} = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i = 1}^n a_{\sigma(i), i},&lt;/math&gt;
where sgn is the [[Even_and_odd_permutations|sign function]] of [[permutation]]s in the [[permutation group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, which returns +1 and −1 for [[even and odd permutations]], respectively.

Another common notation used for the formula is in terms of the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] and makes use of the [[Einstein summation notation]], where it becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A)=\epsilon_{i_1\cdots i_n}{a}_{1i_1}\cdots {a}_{ni_n},&lt;/math&gt;
which may be more familiar to physicists.

Directly evaluating the Leibniz formula from the definition requires &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n! \cdot n)&lt;/math&gt;  operations in general—that is, a number of operations asymptotically proportional to ''n'' [[factorial]]—because ''n''! is the number of order-''n'' permutations.  This is impractically difficult for large ''n''.  Instead, the determinant can be evaluated in O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) operations by forming the [[LU decomposition]] &lt;math&gt;A = LU&lt;/math&gt; (typically via [[Gaussian elimination]] or similar methods), in which case &lt;math&gt;\det A = (\det L) (\det U)&lt;/math&gt; and the determinants of the triangular matrices ''L'' and ''U'' are simply the products of their diagonal entries.  (In practical applications of numerical linear algebra, however, explicit computation of the determinant is rarely required.)  See, for example, {{harvtxt|Trefethen|Bau|1997}}.

== Formal statement and proof ==

'''Theorem.'''
There exists exactly one function
:&lt;math&gt; F : M_n (\mathbb K) \rightarrow \mathbb K &lt;/math&gt;
which is [[Alternatization|alternating]] [[Multilinear_map|multilinear]] w.r.t. columns and such that &lt;math&gt;F(I) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof.'''

'''Uniqueness:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be such a function, and let &lt;math&gt;A = (a_i^j)_{i = 1, \dots, n}^{j = 1, \dots , n}&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix. Call &lt;math&gt;A^j&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th column of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A^j = (a_i^j)_{i = 1, \dots , n}&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;A = \left(A^1, \dots, A^n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Also, let &lt;math&gt;E^k&lt;/math&gt; denote the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th column vector of the identity matrix.

Now one writes each of the &lt;math&gt;A^j&lt;/math&gt;'s in terms of the &lt;math&gt;E^k&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;A^j = \sum_{k = 1}^n a_k^j E^k&lt;/math&gt;.

As &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is multilinear, one has

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F(A)&amp; = F\left(\sum_{k_1 = 1}^n a_{k_1}^1 E^{k_1}, \dots, \sum_{k_n = 1}^n a_{k_n}^n E^{k_n}\right)\\
&amp; = \sum_{k_1, \dots, k_n = 1}^n \left(\prod_{i = 1}^n a_{k_i}^i\right) F\left(E^{k_1}, \dots, E^{k_n}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From alternation it follows that any term with repeated indices is zero. The sum can therefore be restricted to tuples with non-repeating indices, i.e. permutations:

:&lt;math&gt;F(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \left(\prod_{i = 1}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\right) F(E^{\sigma(1)}, \dots , E^{\sigma(n)}).&lt;/math&gt;

Because F is alternating, the columns &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; can be swapped until it becomes the identity.  The [[Even_and_odd_permutations|sign function]] &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to count the number of swaps necessary and account for the resulting sign change.  One finally gets:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F(A)&amp; = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \left(\prod_{i = 1}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\right) F(I)\\
&amp; = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i = 1}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;F(I)&lt;/math&gt; is required to be equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore no function besides the function defined by the Leibniz Formula can be a multilinear alternating function with &lt;math&gt;F\left(I\right)=1&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Existence:''' We now show that F, where F is the function defined by the Leibniz formula, has these three properties.

[[Multilinear]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F(A^1, \dots, cA^j, \dots) &amp; = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) ca_{\sigma(j)}^j\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\\
&amp; = c \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) a_{\sigma(j)}^j\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\\
&amp;=c F(A^1, \dots, A^j, \dots)\\
\\
F(A^1, \dots, b+A^j, \dots) &amp; = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma)\left(b_{\sigma(j)} + a_{\sigma(j)}^j\right)\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\\
&amp; = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma)
\left( \left(b_{\sigma(j)}\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\right) + \left(a_{\sigma(j)}^j\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\right)\right)\\
&amp; = \left(\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) b_{\sigma(j)}\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\right) 
  + \left(\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i = 1}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\right)\\
&amp;= F(A^1, \dots, b, \dots) + F(A^1, \dots, A^j, \dots)\\
\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[Alternating map|Alternating]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F(\dots, A^{j_1}, \dots, A^{j_2}, \dots)
&amp; = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \left(\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j_1, i\neq j_2}^n a_{\sigma(i)}^i\right) a_{\sigma(j_1)}^{j_1} a_{\sigma(j_2)}^{j_2}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
For any &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in S_n&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; be the tuple equal to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt;j_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j_2&lt;/math&gt; indices switched.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F(A) &amp; = \sum_{\sigma\in S_{n},\sigma(j_{1})&lt;\sigma(j_{2})}\left[\sgn(\sigma)\left(\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j_1, i\neq j_2}^na_{\sigma(i)}^{i}\right)a_{\sigma(j_{1})}^{j_{1}}a_{\sigma(j_{2})}^{j_{2}}+\sgn(\sigma')\left(\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j_1, i\neq j_2}^na_{\sigma'(i)}^{i}\right)a_{\sigma'(j_{1})}^{j_{1}}a_{\sigma'(j_{2})}^{j_{2}}\right]\\
&amp; =\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n},\sigma(j_{1})&lt;\sigma(j_{2})}\left[\sgn(\sigma)\left(\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j_1, i\neq j_2}^na_{\sigma(i)}^{i}\right)a_{\sigma(j_{1})}^{j_{1}}a_{\sigma(j_{2})}^{j_{2}}-\sgn(\sigma)\left(\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j_1, i\neq j_2}^na_{\sigma(i)}^{i}\right)a_{\sigma(j_{2})}^{j_{1}}a_{\sigma(j_{1})}^{j_{2}}\right]\\
&amp; =\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n},\sigma(j_{1})&lt;\sigma(j_{2})}\sgn(\sigma)\left(\prod_{i = 1, i \neq j_1, i\neq j_2}^na_{\sigma(i)}^{i}\right)\left(a_{\sigma(j_{1})}^{j_{1}}a_{\sigma(j_{2})}^{j_{2}}-a_{\sigma(j_{1})}^{j_{2}}a_{\sigma(j_{2})}^{j_{_{1}}}\right)\\
\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus if &lt;math&gt;A^{j_1} = A^{j_2}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;F(\dots, A^{j_1}, \dots, A^{j_2}, \dots)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, &lt;math&gt;F(I)=1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}\\
F(I) &amp; = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i = 1}^n I^i_{\sigma(i)}\\
&amp; = \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i = 1}^n I^i_{\sigma(i)}\qquad\text{where }\sigma = (1, 2, \ldots, n). \text{  For other choices of }\sigma, I^i_{\sigma(i)}=0.\\
&amp; = \prod_{i = 1}^n I_{i}^i\\
&amp; = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the only alternating multilinear functions with &lt;math&gt;F(I)=1&lt;/math&gt; are restricted to the function defined by the Leibniz formula, and it in fact also has these three properties. Hence the determinant can be defined as the only function

:&lt;math&gt; \det : M_n (\mathbb K) \rightarrow \mathbb K &lt;/math&gt;

with these three properties.

In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematics]], especially in the area of [[combinatorics on words]], the '''Levi lemma''' states that, for all [[string (computer science)|strings]] ''u'', ''v'', ''x'' and ''y'', if ''uv''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''xy'', then there exists a string ''w'' such that either

:''uw&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;x''  and ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''wy'' (if |''u''| ≤ |''x''|)

or 

:''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''xw'' and ''wv''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y'' (if |''u''| ≥ |''x''|)

That is, there is a string ''w'' that is "in the middle", and can be grouped to one side or the other.&lt;ref name="Petre"&gt;Elene Petre, "An Elementary Proof for the Non-parametrizability of the Equation ''xyz''=''zvx''" in Jiří Fiala, Václav Koubek, Jan Kratochvíl (eds.) ''Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science 2004'', {{isbn|978-3-540-22823-3}}, p. 810 (Lemma 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Levi's lemma is named after [[Friedrich Wilhelm Levi]], who published it in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | pages = 141–146
 | title = On semigroups
 | volume = 36
 | year = 1944}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Levi's lemma can be applied repeatedly in order to solve [[word equation]]s; in this context it is sometimes called the  '''Nielsen transformation''' by analogy with the [[Nielsen transformation|Nielsen transformation for groups]]. For example, starting with an equation ''xα'' = ''yβ'' where ''x'' and ''y'' are the unknowns, we can transform it (assuming ''|x| ≥ |y|'', so there exists ''t'' such that ''x''=''yt'') to ''ytα'' = ''yβ'', thus to ''tα'' = ''β''. This approach results in a graph of substitutions generated by repeatedly applying Levi's lemma. If each unknown appears at most twice, then word equation is called quadratic; in a quadratic word equation the graph obtained by repeatedly applying Levi's lemma is finite, so it is [[decision problem|decidable]] if a quadratic word equation [[satisfiability|has a solution]].&lt;ref name="Petre"/&gt; (A more general method for solving word equations is [[Makanin's algorithm]].)&lt;ref name="Petre"/&gt;

==Generalizations==
The above is known as the '''Levi lemma for strings'''; the lemma can occur in a more general form in [[graph theory]] and in [[monoid theory]]; for example, there is a more general Levi lemma for [[trace monoid|traces]].&lt;ref name=Messner1997&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monoid in which Levi's lemma holds is said to have the '''equidivisibility property'''.&lt;ref name="LucaVarricchio2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aldo de Luca|author2=Stefano Varricchio|title=Finiteness and Regularity in Semigroups and Formal Languages|year=1999|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-64150-3|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[free monoid]] of strings and string concatenation has this property (by Levi's lemma for strings), but by itself equidivisibility is not enough to guarantee that a monoid is free. However an equidivisibile monoid ''M'' is free if additionally there exists a [[homomorphism]] ''f'' from ''M'' to the [[Monogenic semigroup|monoid of natural numbers]] (free monoid on one generator) with the property that the [[preimage]] of 0 contains only the identity element of ''M'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(0) = \{1_M\}&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that ''f'' simply being a homomorhism does not guarantee this latter property, as there could be multiple elements of ''M'' mapped to 0.)&lt;ref name="Lothaire1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Lothaire|title=Combinatorics on Words|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59924-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monoid for which such a homorphims exists is also called ''graded'' (and the ''f'' is called a gradation).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Sakarovitch | first=Jacques | title=Elements of automata theory | others=Translated from the French by Reuben Thomas | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-521-84425-3 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6194">'''Machine learning control (MLC)''' is a subfield of [[machine learning]], [[intelligent control]] and [[control theory]]
which solves [[optimal control]] problems with methods of [[machine learning]].
Key applications are complex nonlinear systems
for which [[linear control theory]] methods are not applicable.

== Types of problems and tasks ==
Four types of problems are commonly encountered.
* Control parameter identification: MLC translates to a parameter identification&lt;ref name=Baeck1993&gt;Thomas Bäck &amp; Hans-Paul Schwefel (Spring 1993) [http://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1993.1.1.1 "An overview of evolutionary algorithms for parameter optimization"], [[Evolutionary Computation (journal)|Journal of Evolutionary Computation (MIT Press)]], vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; if the structure of the control law is given but the parameters are unknown. One example is the [[genetic algorithm]] for optimizing coefficients of a [[PID controller]]&lt;ref name=Benard2015aiaa&gt;N. Benard, J. Pons-Prats, J. Periaux, G. Bugeda, J.-P. Bonnet &amp; E. Moreau, (2015) [https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2015-2957 "Multi-Input Genetic Algorithm for Experimental Optimization of the Reattachment Downstream of a Backward-Facing Step with Surface Plasma Actuator"], Paper AIAA 2015-2957 at 46th AIAA Plasmadynamics and Lasers Conference, Dallas, TX, USA, pp. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt; or discrete-time optimal control.&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew Michalewicz, Cezary Z. Janikow &amp; Jacek B. Krawczyk (July 1992) [https://doi.org/10.1016/0898-1221(92)90094-X "A modified genetic algorithm for optimal control problems"], [Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications], vol. 23, no 12, pp. 83-94.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control design as regression problem of the first kind:  MLC approximates a general nonlinear mapping from sensor signals to actuation commands, if the sensor signals and the optimal actuation command are known for every state. One example is the computation of sensor feedback from a known [[full state feedback]]. A [[neural network]] is commonly used technique for this task.&lt;ref&gt;C. Lee, J. Kim, D. Babcock &amp; R. Goodman (1997) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.869290 "Application of neural networks to turbulence control for drag reduction"], [[Physics of Fluids]], vol. 6, no. 9, pp. 1740-1747&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control design as regression problem of the second kind: MLC may also identify arbitrary nonlinear control laws  which minimize the cost function of the plant. In this case, neither a model, nor the control law structure,  nor the optimizing actuation command needs to be known. The optimization is only based on the control performance (cost function) as measured in the plant. [[Genetic programming]] is a powerful regression technique for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Dracopoulos &amp; S. Kent (December 1997) [http://doi.org/10.1007/BF01501508 "Genetic programming for prediction and control"], Neural Computing &amp; Applications (Springer), vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 214-228.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reinforcement learning control: The control law may be continually updated over measured performance changes (rewards) using [[reinforcement learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Barto (December 1994) [http://doi.org/10.1016/0959-4388(94)90138-4 "Reinforcement learning control"], [[Current Opinion in Neurobiology]], vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 888–893&lt;/ref&gt;

MLC comprises, for instance, neural network control, 
genetic algorithm based control, 
genetic programming control,
reinforcement learning control, 
and has methodological overlaps with other data-driven control,
like [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robot control]].

== Applications ==
MLC has been successfully applied
to many nonlinear control problems,
exploring unknown and often unexpected actuation mechanisms.
Example applications include

* Attitude control of satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitris. C. Dracopoulos &amp; Antonia. J. Jones (1994)

* Building thermal control.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A. Wright, Heather A. Loosemore &amp; Raziyeh Farmani (2002) [http://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00071-3 "Optimization of building thermal design and control by multi-criterion genetic algorithm], [Energy and Buildings], vol. 34, no. 9, pp. 959-972.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Many more engineering MLC application are summarized in the review article of PJ Fleming &amp; RC Purshouse (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Fleming, R. C. Purshouse (2002 [http://doi.org/10.1016/S0967-0661(02)00081-3 "Evolutionary algorithms in control systems engineering: a survey"]
[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Engineering_Practice Control Engineering Practice], vol. 10, no. 11, pp. 1223-1241&lt;/ref&gt;

As for all general nonlinear methods,
MLC comes with no guaranteed convergence, 
optimality or robustness for a range of operating conditions.

In [[mathematics]], a '''minimal surface''' is a surface that locally minimizes its area. This is equivalent to having zero [[mean curvature]] (see definitions below).

The term "minimal surface" is used because these surfaces originally arose as surfaces that minimized total surface area subject to some constraint. Physical models of area-minimizing minimal surfaces can be made by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution, forming a [[soap film]], which is a minimal surface whose boundary is the wire frame. However, the term is used for more general surfaces that may [[Immersed submanifold#Immersed submanifolds|self-intersect]] or do not have constraints. For a given constraint there may also exist several minimal surfaces with different areas (for example, see [[minimal surface of revolution]]): the standard definitions only relate to a [[local optimum]], not a [[global optimum]].

==Definitions==
[[File:Saddle Tower Minimal Surfaces.png|thumb|[[Saddle tower]] minimal surface. While any small change of the surface increases its area, there exist other surfaces with the same boundary with a smaller total area.]]

Minimal surfaces can be defined in several equivalent ways in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The fact that they are equivalent serves to demonstrate how minimal surface theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical disciplines, especially [[differential geometry]], [[calculus of variations]], [[potential theory]], [[complex analysis]] and [[mathematical physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:'''Local least area definition''': A surface ''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is minimal if and only if every point ''p'' ∈ ''M'' has a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] with least-area relative to its boundary.

Note that this property is local: there might exist other surfaces that minimize area better with the same global boundary.

:'''Variational definition''': A surface ''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is minimal if and only if it is a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of the area [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] for all compactly supported [[Calculus of variations|variations]].

This definition makes minimal surfaces a 2-dimensional analogue to [[geodesics]].

:'''Soap film definition''': A surface ''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is minimal if and only if every point ''p'' ∈ ''M'' has a neighbourhood ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' which is equal to the unique idealized soap film with boundary ∂''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''

By the [[Young–Laplace equation]] the [[curvature]] of a soap film is proportional to the difference in pressure between the sides: if it is zero, the membrane has zero mean curvature. Note that spherical [[Soap bubble|bubbles]] are ''not'' minimal surfaces as per this definition: while they minimize total area subject to a constraint on internal volume, they have a positive pressure.

[[File:Minimal surface curvature planes-en.svg|thumb|Minimal surface curvature planes.  On a minimal surface, the curvature along the principal curvature planes are equal and opposite at every point. This makes the mean curvature zero.]]

:'''Mean curvature definition''': A surface ''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is minimal if and only if its [[mean curvature]] vanishes identically.

A direct implication of this definition is that every point on the surface is a [[saddle point]] with equal and opposite [[principal curvatures]].

:'''Differential equation definition''': A surface ''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is minimal if and only if it can be locally expressed as the graph of a solution of

::&lt;math&gt;(1+u_x^2)u_{yy} - 2u_xu_yu_{xy} + (1+u_y^2)u_{xx}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The partial differential equation in this definition was originally found in 1762 by [[Lagrange]],&lt;ref name="Lagrange1760"&gt;J. L. Lagrange. Essai d'une nouvelle methode pour determiner les maxima et les minima des formules integrales indefinies. Miscellanea Taurinensia 2, 325(1):173{199, 1760.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Baptiste Meusnier]] discovered in 1776 that it implied a vanishing mean curvature.&lt;ref name="Meusnier1785"&gt;J. B. Meusnier. Mémoire sur la courbure des surfaces. Mém. Mathém. Phys. Acad. Sci. Paris, prés. par div. Savans, 10:477–510, 1785. Presented in 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Energy definition''': A [[Conformal map|conformal]] immersion ''X'': ''M'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is minimal if and only if it is a critical point of the [[Dirichlet energy]] for all compactly supported variations, or equivalently if any point ''p'' ∈ ''M'' has a neighbourhood with least energy relative to its boundary.

This definition ties minimal surfaces to [[harmonic functions]] and [[potential theory]].

:'''Harmonic definition''': If ''X'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): ''M'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is an [[Isometry|isometric]] [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] of a [[Riemann surface]] into 3-space, then ''X'' is said to be minimal whenever ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[harmonic function]] on ''M'' for each ''i''.

A direct implication of this definition and the [[Harmonic functions#Maximum principle|maximum principle for harmonic functions]] is that there are no [[compact space|compact]] [[Complete metric space|complete]] minimal surfaces in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

:'''Gauss map definition''': A surface ''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is minimal if and only if its [[Stereographic projection|stereographically]] projected [[Gauss map]] ''g'': ''M'' → '''C''' ∪ {∞} is [[meromorphic]] with respect to the underlying [[Riemann surface]] structure, and ''M'' is not a piece of a sphere.

This definition uses that the mean curvature is half of the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the [[Shape operator#Shape operator|shape operator]], which is linked to the derivatives of the Gauss map. If the projected Gauss map obeys the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]] then either the trace vanishes or every point of ''M'' is [[Umbilical point|umbilic]], in which case it is a piece of a sphere.

:'''Mean curvature flow definition''': Minimal surfaces are the critical points for the [[mean curvature flow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Tobias H. | last1=Colding | first2=William P., II | last2=Minicozzi | title=The Space of Embedded Minimal Surfaces of Fixed Genus in a 3-manifold.

The local least area and variational definitions allow extending minimal surfaces to other [[Riemannian manifolds]] than '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==History==
Minimal surface theory originates with [[Lagrange]] who in 1762 considered the variational problem of finding the surface ''z'' = ''z''(''x'', ''y'') of least area stretched across a given closed contour. He derived the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] for the solution

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{z_x}{\sqrt{1+z_x^2+z_y^2}}\right ) + \frac{d}{dy}\left(\frac{z_y}{\sqrt{1+z_x^2+z_y^2}}\right )=0&lt;/math&gt;

He did not succeed in finding any solution beyond the plane. In 1776 [[Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier]] discovered that the [[helicoid]] and [[catenoid]] satisfy the equation and that the differential expression corresponds to twice the [[mean curvature]] of the surface, concluding that surfaces with zero mean curvature are area-minimizing.

By expanding Lagrange's equation to

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1 + z_x^2\right)z_{yy} - 2z_xz_yz_{xy} + \left(1 + z_y^2\right)z_{xx} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

[[Gaspard Monge]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] in 1795 derived representation formulas for the solution surfaces. While these were successfully used by [[Heinrich Scherk]] in 1830 to derive his [[Scherk surface|surfaces]], they were generally regarded as practically unusable. [[Eugène Charles Catalan|Catalan]] proved in 1842/43 that the helicoid is the only [[ruled surface|ruled]] minimal surface.

Progress had been fairly slow until the middle of the century when the [[Björling problem]] was solved using complex methods. The "first golden age" of minimal surfaces began. [[Hermann Schwarz|Schwarz]] found the solution of the [[Plateau problem]] for a regular quadrilateral in 1865 and for a general quadrilateral in 1867 (allowing the construction of his periodic [[Schwarz minimal surface|surface families]]) using complex methods. [[Weierstrass]] and [[Alfred Enneper|Enneper]] developed more useful [[Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization|representation formulas]], firmly linking minimal surfaces to [[complex analysis]] and [[harmonic functions]]. Other important contributions came from Beltrami, Bonnet, Darboux, Lie, Riemann, Serret and Weingarten.

Between 1925 and 1950 minimal surface theory revived, now mainly aimed at nonparametric minimal surfaces. The complete solution of the Plateau problem by [[Jesse Douglas]] and [[Tibor Radó]] was a major milestone. [[Bernstein's problem]] and [[Robert Osserman]]'s work on complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature were also important.

Another revival began in the 1980s. One cause was the discovery in 1982 by Celso Costa of [[Costa's minimal surface|a surface]] that disproved the conjecture that the plane, the catenoid, and the helicoid are the only complete embedded minimal surfaces in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of finite topological type. This not only stimulated new work on using the old parametric methods, but also demonstrated the importance of computer graphics to visualise the studied surfaces and numerical methods to solve the "period problem" (when using the [[Associate family|conjugate surface method]] to determine surface patches that can be assembled into a larger symmetric surface, certain parameters need to be numerically matched to produce an embedded surface). Another cause was the verification by H. Karcher that the [[triply periodic minimal surface]]s originally described empirically by Alan Schoen in 1970 actually exist. This has led to a rich menagerie of surface families and methods of deriving new surfaces from old, for example by adding handles or distorting them.

Currently the theory of minimal surfaces has diversified to minimal submanifolds in other ambient geometries, becoming relevant to mathematical physics (e.g. the [[positive mass conjecture]], the [[Riemannian Penrose inequality|Penrose conjecture]]) and three-manifold geometry (e.g. the [[Smith conjecture]], the [[Poincaré conjecture]], the [[Thurston Geometrization Conjecture]]).

==Examples==
[[File:Costa's Minimal Surface.png|thumb|[[Costa's Minimal Surface]]]]

Classical examples of minimal surfaces include:
* the [[plane (geometry)|plane]], which is a [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] case
* [[catenoid]]s: minimal surfaces made by rotating a [[catenary]] once around its directrix
* [[helicoid]]s: A surface swept out by a line rotating with uniform velocity around an axis perpendicular to the line and simultaneously moving along the axis with uniform velocity

Surfaces from the 19th century golden age include:
* [[Schwarz minimal surface]]s: [[Triply periodic minimal surface|triply periodic surfaces]] that fill '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Riemann's minimal surface]]: A posthumously described periodic surface
* the [[Enneper surface]]
* the [[Henneberg surface]]: the first non-orientable minimal surface
* [[Bour's minimal surface]]

Modern surfaces include:
* the [[Gyroid]]: One of Schoen's 1970 surfaces, a triply periodic surface of particular interest for liquid crystal structure
* the [[Saddle tower]] family: generalisations of [[Scherk surface|Scherk's second surface]]
* [[Costa's minimal surface]]: Famous conjecture disproof. Described in 1982 by [[Celso Costa]] and later visualized by [[Jim Hoffman]]. Jim Hoffman, David Hoffman and William Meeks III then extended the definition to produce a family of surfaces with different rotational symmetries.
* the [[Chen–Gackstatter surface]] family, adding handles to the Enneper surface.

==Generalisations and links to other fields==
Minimal surfaces can be defined in other [[manifolds]] than '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, such as [[hyperbolic space]], higher-dimensional spaces or [[Riemannian manifolds]].

The definition of minimal surfaces can be generalized/extended to cover [[constant-mean-curvature surface]]s: surfaces with a constant mean curvature, which need not equal zero.

In [[discrete differential geometry]] discrete minimal surfaces are studied: [[simplicial complex]]es of triangles that minimize their area under small perturbations of their vertex positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Ulrich | last1=Pinkall | first2=Konrad | last2=Polthier | title=Computing Discrete Minimal Surfaces and Their Conjugates | journal=[[Experimental Mathematics (journal)|Experimental Mathematics]] | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=15–36 | year=1993 | mr=1246481 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1062620735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such discretizations are often used to approximate minimal surfaces numerically, even if no closed form expressions are known.

[[Wiener process|Brownian motion]] on a minimal surface leads to probabilistic proofs of several theorems on minimal surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Robert | last=Neel | year=2009 | arxiv=0805.0556 | title=A martingale approach to minimal surfaces | journal=Journal of Functional Analysis | volume=256 | issue=8 | pages=2440–2472 | doi=10.1016/j.jfa.2008.06.033 | mr=2502522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal surfaces have become an area of intense scientific study, especially in the areas of [[molecular engineering]] and [[materials science]], due to their anticipated applications in [[self-assembly]] of complex materials.

Minimal surfaces play a role in [[general relativity]]. The [[apparent horizon]] (marginally outer trapped surface) is a minimal hypersurface, linking the theory of [[black holes]] to minimal surfaces and the [[Plateau problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Piotr T. | last1=Chruściel | first2=Gregory J. | last2=Galloway | first3=Daniel | last3=Pollack | title=Mathematical general relativity: a sampler | journal=[[Bull.

Minimal surfaces are part of the [[Generative Design|generative design]] toolbox used by modern designers. In architecture there has been much interest in [[tensile structure]]s, which are closely related to minimal surfaces. A famous example is the [[Olympiapark, Munich|Olympiapark in Münich]] by [[Frei Otto]], inspired by soap surfaces.

In the art world, minimal surfaces have been extensively explored in the sculpture of [[Robert Engman]] (1927– ), [[Robert Longhurst]] (1949– ), and [[Charles O. Perry]] (1929–2011), among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">{{merge to|Dose–response relationship|date=October 2017}}
In statistics, in particular in the [[design of experiments]], a '''multi-valued treatment''' is a treatment that can take on more than two values. It is related to the [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response model]] in the medical literature. Generally speaking, treatment levels may be finite or infinite as well as ordinal or cardinal, which leads to a large collection of possible treatment effects to be studied in applications.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Multi-valued Treatment Effects. Encyclopedia of Research Design, ed. By N. J. Salkind, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the effect of different levels of program participation (e.g. full-time and part-time) in a job training program.&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assume there exists a finite collection of multi-valued treatment status &lt;math&gt;T=\{0,1,2,\ldots,J,\}&lt;/math&gt; with J some fixed integer. As in the potential outcomes framework, denote  &lt;math&gt;Y (j) \subset R&lt;/math&gt; the collection of potential outcomes under the treatment ''J'', and &lt;math&gt;Y=\textstyle \sum_{j=0}^J \displaystyle D_j Y(j)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the observed outcome and &lt;math&gt;D_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator that equals '''1''' when the treatment equals ''j'' and '''0''' when it does not equal '''''j''''', leading to a fundamental problem of causal inference.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Multi-Valued Treatment Effects under Ignorability. Journal of Econometrics 155(2), pp. 138–154.&lt;/ref&gt;  A general framework that analyzes ordered choice models in terms of marginal treatment effects and average treatment effects has been extensively discussed by Heckman and Vytlacil.&lt;ref&gt;Heckman, J. J., and E. J. Vytlacil (2007): Econometric Evaluation of Social Programs, Part II: Using the Marginal Treatment Effect to Organize Alternative Econometric Estimators to Evaluate Social Programs, and to Forecast the Effects in New Environments. Handbook of Econometrics, Vol 6, ed. by J. J. Heckman and E. E. Leamer. North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work in the econometrics and statistics literature has focused on estimation and inference for multivalued treatments and ignorability conditions for identifying the treatment effects. In the context of program evaluation, the propensity score has been generalized to allow for multi-valued treatments,&lt;ref&gt;Imbens, G. (2000): The Role of the Propensity Score in Estimating Dose-Response Functions. Biometrika 87(3), pp. 706–710.&lt;/ref&gt; while other work has also focused on the role of the conditional mean independence assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, M. (2001): Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects of Multiple Treatments under the Conditional Independence Assumption. Econometric Evaluation of Labour Market Policies, ed. by M. Lechner and F. Pfeiffer, pp. 43–58. Physica/Springer, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other recent work has focused more on the large sample properties of an estimator of the marginal mean treatment effect conditional on a treatment level in the context of a difference-in-differences model,&lt;ref&gt;Abadie, A. (2005): Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators. Review of Economic Studies 72(1), pp. 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the efficient estimation of multi-valued treatment effects in a semiparametric framework.&lt;ref&gt;Cattaneo, M. D. (2010): Efficient Semiparametric Estimation of Multi-Valued Treatment Effects under Ignorability. Journal of Econometrics 155(2), pp. 138–154&lt;/ref&gt;

Because NPV accounts for the [[time value of money]] NPV provides a method for evaluating and comparing products with cash flows spread over many years, as in loans, investments, payouts from insurance contracts plus many other applications. 

[[Time value of money]] dictates that time affects the value of cash flows. For example, a lender may offer 99 cents for the promise of receiving $1.00 a month from now, but the promise to receive that same dollar 20 years in the future would be worth much less today to that same person (lender), even if the payback in both cases was equally certain. This decrease in the current value of future cash flows is based on a chosen [[rate of return]] (or [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp discount rate]).  If for example there exists a [[time series]] of identical cash flows, the cash flow in the present is the most valuable, with each future cash flow becoming less valuable than the previous cash flow. A cash flow today is more valuable than an identical cash flow in the future&lt;ref name="Berk, DeMarzo p. 94"&gt;Berk, DeMarzo, and Stangeland, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; because a present flow can be invested immediately and begin earning returns, while a future flow cannot.

Net present value (NPV) is determined by calculating the costs (negative cash flows) and benefits (positive cash flows) for each period of an investment.  The period is typically one year, but could be measured in quarter-years, half-years or months.  After the cash flow for each period is calculated, the present value (PV) of each one is achieved by discounting its future value (see [[Net present value#Formula|Formula]]) at a periodic rate of return (the rate of return dictated by the market). NPV is the sum of all the discounted future cash flows.  Because of its simplicity, NPV is a useful tool to determine whether a project or investment will result in a net profit or a loss. A positive NPV results in profit, while a negative NPV results in a loss. The NPV measures the excess or shortfall of cash flows, in present value terms, above the cost of funds.&lt;ref&gt;erk, DeMarzo, and Stangeland, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In a theoretical situation of unlimited [[capital budgeting]] a company should pursue every investment with a positive NPV. However, in practical terms a company's capital constraints limit investments to projects with the highest NPV whose cost cash flows, or initial cash investment, do not exceed the company's capital. NPV is a central tool in [[discounted cash flow]] (DCF) analysis and is a standard method for using the [[time value of money]] to appraise long-term projects. It is widely used throughout [[economics]], [[finance]], and [[accounting]].

In the case when all future cash flows are positive, or incoming (such as the [[Bond (finance)#principal|principal]] and [[Coupon (bond)|coupon payment]] of a [[Bond (finance)|bond]])  the only outflow of cash is the purchase price, the NPV is simply the PV of future cash flows minus the purchase price (which is its own PV).  NPV can be described as the "difference amount" between the sums of discounted cash inflows and cash outflows. It compares the present value of money today to the present value of money in the future, taking inflation and returns into account.

The NPV of a sequence of cash flows takes as input the cash flows and a discount rate or discount curve and outputs a price. The converse process in DCF analysis—taking a sequence of cash flows and a price as input and inferring as output a discount rate (the discount rate which would yield the given price as NPV)—is called the [[yield (finance)|yield]] and is more widely used in bond trading.

Many computer-based [[spreadsheet]] programs have built-in formulae for PV and NPV.

== Formula ==
Each cash inflow/outflow is [[discounted]] back to its present value (PV). Then all are summed. Therefore, NPV is the sum of all terms,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_t}{(1+i)  ^{t}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; – the time of the cash flow
:&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; – the [[discount window|discount rate]], i.e. the [[rate of return|return]] that could be earned per unit of time on an [[opportunity cost|investment with similar risk]]
:&lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; – the net cash flow i.e. cash inflow&amp;nbsp;– cash outflow, at time ''t''. For educational purposes, &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is commonly placed to the left of the sum to emphasize its role as (minus) the investment.

The result of this formula is multiplied with the Annual Net cash in-flows and reduced by Initial Cash outlay the present value but in cases where the cash flows are not equal in amount, then the previous formula will be used to determine the present value of each cash flow separately. Any cash flow within 12 months will not be discounted for NPV purpose, nevertheless the usual initial investments during the first year ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are summed up a negative cash flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khan | first = M.Y. | title = Theory &amp; Problems in Financial Management | publisher = McGraw Hill Higher Education | location = Boston | year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-07-463683-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the (period, cash flow) pairs (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of periods, the net present value &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(i, N) = \sum_{t=0}^{N} \frac{R_t}{( 1+i)  ^{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

== The discount rate ==
{{Main article|Annual effective discount rate}}
The rate used to discount future cash flows to the present value is a key variable of this process.

A firm's [[weighted average cost of capital]] (after tax) is often used, but many people believe that it is appropriate to use higher discount rates to adjust for risk, opportunity cost, or other factors. A variable discount rate with higher rates applied to cash flows occurring further along the time span might be used to reflect the [[yield curve]] premium for long-term debt.

Another approach to choosing the discount rate factor is to decide the rate which the capital needed for the project could return if invested in an alternative venture. If, for example, the capital required for Project A can earn 5% elsewhere, use this discount rate in the NPV calculation to allow a direct comparison to be made between Project A and the alternative. Related to this concept is to use the firm's reinvestment rate. Re-investment rate can be defined as the rate of return for the firm's investments on average. When analyzing projects in a capital constrained environment, it may be appropriate to use the reinvestment rate rather than the firm's weighted average cost of capital as the discount factor. It reflects opportunity cost of investment, rather than the possibly lower cost of capital.

An NPV calculated using variable discount rates (if they are known for the duration of the investment) may better reflect the situation than one calculated from a constant discount rate for the entire investment duration. Refer to the tutorial article written by Samuel Baker&lt;ref name="slbaker"&gt;{{cite web | last = Baker | first = Samuel L. | title = Perils of the Internal Rate of Return | publisher = | year= 2000 | url = http://sambaker.com/econ/invest/invest.html | accessdate = January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for more detailed relationship between the NPV value and the discount rate.

For some professional investors, their investment funds are committed to target a specified rate of return. In such cases, that rate of return should be selected as the discount rate for the NPV calculation. In this way, a direct comparison can be made between the profitability of the project and the desired rate of return.

To some extent, the selection of the discount rate is dependent on the use to which it will be put. If the intent is simply to determine whether a project will add value to the company, using the firm's weighted average cost of capital may be appropriate. If trying to decide between alternative investments in order to maximize the value of the firm, the corporate reinvestment rate would probably be a better choice.

Using variable rates over time, or discounting "guaranteed" cash flows differently from "at risk" cash flows, may be a superior methodology but is seldom used in practice. Using the discount rate to adjust for risk is often difficult to do in practice (especially internationally) and is difficult to do well. An alternative to using discount factor to adjust for risk is to explicitly correct the cash flows for the risk elements using [[rNPV]] or a similar method, then discount at the firm's rate.

== Use in decision making ==
NPV is an indicator of how much value an investment or project adds to the firm. With a particular project, if &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; is a positive value, the project is in the status of positive cash inflow in the time of ''t''. If &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; is a negative value, the project is in the status of discounted cash outflow in the time of ''t''. Appropriately risked projects with a positive NPV could be accepted. This does not necessarily mean that they should be undertaken since NPV at the cost of capital may not account for [[opportunity cost]], i.e., comparison with other available investments. In financial theory, if there is a choice between two mutually exclusive alternatives, the one yielding the higher NPV should be selected. A positive net present value indicates that the projected earnings generated by a project or investment (in present dollars) exceeds the anticipated costs (also in present dollars). Generally, an investment with a positive NPV will be a profitable one and one with a negative NPV will result in a net loss. This concept is the basis for the Net Present Value Rule, which dictates that the only investments that should be made are those with positive NPV values.

|}

An alternative way of looking at Net Present Value is that at the given rate of Cost of Capital, whether the project can meet the cost of capital. For example, if the NPV is -$2.5 million (i.e. negative NPV) for a given project, it may mean that at the given [[Weighted Average Cost of Capital]] (WACC), the project fails to meet the expectations of the suppliers of capital for the project. On the other hand, the NPV of $2.5 million would add $2.5 million to the wealth of the suppliers of funds over and above their expected returns.

== Interpretation as integral transform ==
The time-discrete formula of the net present value
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(i,N) = \sum_{t=0}^{N} \frac{R_t}{ (1+i) ^{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

can also be written in a continuous variation
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(i) = \int_{t=0}^\infty (1+i)^{-t} \cdot r(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''r''(''t'') is the rate of flowing cash given in money per time, and ''r''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when the investment is over.

Net present value can be regarded as [[Laplace transform#Formal definition|Laplace-]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Imaginary parts of the [[complex number]] ''s'' describe the oscillating behaviour (compare with the [[pork cycle]], [[cobweb theorem]], and [[phase shift]] between commodity price and supply offer) whereas real parts are responsible for representing the effect of compound interest (compare with [[damping]]).

== Example ==
&lt;!-- People like to mess with this example. Please be 100% sure you are correct before you make a change to it!--&gt;
A corporation must decide whether to introduce a new product line. The company will have immediate costs of 100,000 at ''t = 0''. Recall, a cost is a negative for outgoing cash flow, thus this cash flow is represented as -100,000. The company assumes the product will provide equal benefits of 10,000 for each of 12 years beginning at ''t = 1''. For simplicity, assume the company will have no outgoing cash flows after the initial 100,000 cost. This also makes the simplifying assumption that the net cash received or paid is lumped into a single transaction occurring ''on the last day'' of each year. At the end of the 12 years the product no longer provides any cash flow and is discontinued without any additional costs. Assume that the effective annual discount rate is 10%.

The present value (value at ''t = 0'') can be calculated for each year:
{| class="wikitable" align="center" font-size="120%" border:"2px solid black;"

|}

The total present value of the incoming cash flows is 68,136.91.  The total present value of the outgoing cash flows is simply the 100,000 at time ''t = 0''.
Thus:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV} = PV(Benefits) - PV(Costs)&lt;/math&gt;

In this example:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm {NPV} =  68,136.91 - 100,000&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm {NPV} = -31,863.09&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that as ''t'' increases the present value of each cash flow at ''t'' decreases. For example, the final incoming cash flow has a future value of 10,000 at ''t = 12'' but has a present value (at ''t = 0'') of 3,186.31. The opposite of discounting is compounding. Taking the example in reverse, it is the equivalent of investing 3,186.31 at ''t = 0'' (the present value) at an interest rate of 10% compounded for 12 years, which results in a cash flow of 10,000 at ''t = 12'' (the future value).

The importance of NPV becomes clear in this instance. Although the incoming cash flows (10,000 x 12 = 120,000) appear to exceed the outgoing cash flow (100,000), the future cash flows are not adjusted using the discount rate. Thus, the project appears misleadingly profitable. When the cash flows are discounted however,  it indicates the project would result in a net loss of 31,863.09.  Thus, the NPV calculation indicates that this project should be disregarded because investing in this project is the equivalent of a loss of 31,863.09 at ''t = 0''. The concept of time value of money indicates that cash flows in different periods of time cannot be accurately compared unless they have been adjusted to reflect their value at the same period of time (in this instance, ''t = 0'').&lt;ref name="Berk, DeMarzo p. 94"/&gt; It is the present value of each future cash flow that must be determined in order to provide any meaningful comparison between cash flows at different periods of time.  There are a few inherent assumptions in this type of analysis:

# The ''investment horizon'' of all possible investment projects considered are equally acceptable to the investor (e.g. a 3-year project is not necessarily preferable vs. a 20-year project.)
# The 10% discount rate is the appropriate (and stable) rate to discount the expected cash flows from each project being considered. Each project is assumed equally speculative.
# The shareholders cannot get above a 10% return on their money if they were to directly assume an equivalent level of risk. (If the investor could do better elsewhere, no projects should be undertaken by the firm, and the excess capital should be turned over to the shareholder through dividends and stock repurchases.)

More realistic problems would also need to consider other factors, generally including: smaller time buckets, the calculation of taxes (including the cash flow timing), inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, hedged or unhedged commodity costs, risks of technical obsolescence, potential future competitive factors, uneven or unpredictable [[cash flow]]s, and a more realistic [[salvage value]] assumption, as well as many others.

A more simple example of the net present value of incoming cash flow over a set period of time, would be winning a Powerball lottery of $500 million.  If one does not select the "CASH" option they will be paid $25,000,000 per year for 20 years, a total of $500,000,000, however, if one does select the "CASH" option, they will receive a one-time lump sum payment of approximately $285 million, the NPV of $500,000,000 paid over time.  See "other factors" above that could affect the payment amount.  Both scenarios are before taxes.

== Common pitfalls ==
* If, for example, the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are generally negative late in the project (''e.g.'', an industrial or mining project might have clean-up and restoration costs), then at that stage the company owes money, so a high discount rate is not cautious but too optimistic. Some people see this as a problem with NPV. A way to avoid this problem is to include explicit provision for financing any losses after the initial investment, that is, explicitly calculate the cost of financing such losses.
* Another common pitfall is to adjust for risk by adding a premium to the discount rate. Whilst a bank might charge a higher rate of interest for a risky project, that does not mean that this is a valid approach to adjusting a net present value for risk, although it can be a reasonable approximation in some specific cases. One reason such an approach may not work well can be seen from the following: if some risk is incurred resulting in some losses, then a discount rate in the NPV will reduce the effect of such losses below their true financial cost. A rigorous approach to risk requires identifying and valuing risks explicitly, ''e.g.'', by actuarial or [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] techniques, and explicitly calculating the cost of financing any losses incurred.
* Yet another issue can result from the compounding of the risk premium. R is a composite of the risk free rate and the risk premium. As a result, future cash flows are discounted by both the [[risk-free rate]] as well as the risk premium and this effect is compounded by each subsequent cash flow. This compounding results in a much lower NPV than might be otherwise calculated. The [[certainty equivalent]] model can be used to account for the risk premium without compounding its effect on present value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
* Another issue with relying on NPV is that it does not provide an overall picture of the gain or loss of executing a certain project. To see a percentage gain relative to the investments for the project, usually, [[Internal rate of return]] or other efficiency measures are used as a complement to NPV.
* Non-specialist users frequently make the error of computing NPV based on cash flows after interest. This is wrong because it double counts the time value of money. Free cash flow should be used as the basis for NPV computations.

== History ==
Net present value as a valuation methodology dates at least to the 19th century. [[Karl Marx]] refers to NPV as [[fictitious capital]], and the calculation as "capitalising," writing:&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, [[Capital, Volume III|''Capital,'' Volume 3]], 1909 edition, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The forming of a fictitious capital is called capitalising. Every periodically repeated income is capitalised by calculating it on the average rate of interest, as an income which would be realised by a capital at this rate of interest.}}
In [[mainstream economics|mainstream]] [[neo-classical economics]], NPV was formalized and popularized by [[Irving Fisher]], in his 1907 ''The Rate of Interest'' and became included in textbooks from the 1950s onwards, starting in finance texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Systemic Fear, Modern Finance and the Future of Capitalism | first1 = Shimshon | last1 = Bichler | first2 = Jonathan | last2 = Nitzan | location = Jerusalem and Montreal | date = July 2010 | url = http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/289/03/20100700_bn_systemic_fear_modern_finance_future_of_capitalism.pdf | pages = 8–11 (for discussion of history of use of NPV as "capitalisation")}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Capital as Power.

== Alternative capital budgeting methods ==
* [[Adjusted present value]] (APV): adjusted present value, is the net present value of a project if financed solely by ownership equity plus the present value of all the benefits of financing.
* [[Accounting rate of return]] (ARR): a ratio similar to IRR and MIRR
* [[Cost-benefit analysis]]: which includes issues other than cash, such as time savings.
* [[Internal rate of return]] (IRR): which calculates the rate of return of a project while disregarding the absolute amount of money to be gained.
* [[Modified Internal Rate of Return|Modified internal rate of return]] (MIRR): similar to IRR, but it makes explicit assumptions about the reinvestment of the cash flows. Sometimes it is called Growth Rate of Return.
* [[Payback period]]: which measures the time required for the cash inflows to equal the original outlay. It measures risk, not return.
* [[Real option]]: which attempts to value managerial flexibility that is assumed away in NPV.
* [[Equivalent annual cost]] (EAC): a capital budgeting technique that is useful in comparing two or more projects with different lifespans.

==Career==
He was a lecturer at [[University of Southampton]], lecturer then reader at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], and Professor of Mathematics at the [[London School of Economics]]. He has been on the [[editorial board]] of a number of journals, including the ''[[Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics]]''. He has been a member of the Council of the [[London Mathematical Society]].

He has written 12 books and over 100 papers on mathematical topics, many of them in [[algebraic combinatorics]] and its applications. He became [[Emeritus Professor]] in 2006 and continue to teach History of Mathematics in Finance and Economics for undergraduates. He is also Vice-President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics.

==Family==
Biggs married Christine Mary Farmer in 1975 and has one daughter Clare Juliet born in 1980.

==Interests and Hobbies==
Biggs' interests include [[computational learning theory]], the [[history of mathematics]] and historical [[metrology]]. Since 2006, he has been an [[Emeritus Professor]] at the London School of Economics.

Biggs hobbies consist of writing about the history of weights and scales. He currently holds the position of Chair of the International Society of Antique Scale Collectors (Europe), and a member of the [[British Numismatic Society]].

==Work==

===Mathematics===
In 2002, Biggs wrote the second edition of ''Discrete Mathematics'' breaking down a wide range of topics into a clear and organised style. Biggs organised the book into four major sections; The Language of Mathematics, Techniques, [[Algorithms]] and [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|Graphs]], and Algebraic Methods. This book was an accumulation of ''Discrete Mathematics'', first edition, textbook published in 1985 which dealt with calculations involving a [[finite set|finite number]] of steps rather than limiting processes. The second edition added nine new introductory chapters; Fundamental language of mathematicians, [[Proposition|statements]] and [[Mathematical proof|proofs]], the logical framework, [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[functions (mathematics)|functions]], and [[number system]]. This book stresses the significance of simple [[logical reasoning]], shown by the exercises and examples given in the book. Each chapter contains modelled solutions, examples, exercises including hints and answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Biggs |first=Norman L. |authorlink=Norman L. Biggs |year=2002 |title=Discrete Mathematics |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algebraic Graph Theory===
In 1974, Biggs published ''Algebraic Graph Theory'' which articulates properties of graphs in algebraic terms, then works out theorems regarding them. In the first section, he tackles the applications of [[linear algebra]] and [[matrix theory]]; algebraic constructions such as [[adjacency matrix]] and the [[incidence matrix]] and their applications are discussed in depth. Next, there is and wide-ranging description of the theory of chromatic [[polynomials]]. The last section discusses [[symmetry]] and regularity properties. Biggs makes important connections with other branches of [[algebraic combinatorics]] and [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/discrete-mathematics-information-theory-and-coding/algebraic-graph-theory-2nd-edition?format=PB| title=Algebraic Graph Theory| publisher=[[Cambridge Mathematical Library]] | location=UK | accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational Learning Theory===
In 1997, N. Biggs and M. Anthony wrote a book titled ''Computational Learning Theory: an Introduction''. Both Biggs and Anthony focused on the necessary background material from [[logic]], [[probability]], and [[Complex systems|complex theory]]. This book is an introduction to computational learning.

===History of Mathematics===
Biggs contributed to thirteen journals and books developing topics such as the four-colour conjecture, the roots/history of [[combinatorics]], [[calculus]], Topology on the 19th century, and mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/norman/Personal.htm | title=Personal Details | publisher=[[London School of Economics]] | location=UK | accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Biggs examined the ideas of [[William Ludlam]], [[Thomas Harriot]], [[John Arbuthnot]], and [[Leonhard Euler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17498430.2013.721331#.U12LsvldWSo| title=Thomas Harriot | publisher=[[London School of Economics]] | location=UK | accessdate=15 April 2014 | doi=10.1080/17498430.2013.721331 | volume=28 | year=2013 | journal=BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics | pages=66–74 | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chip-Firing Game==
{{main|Chip-firing game}}

The chip-firing game has been around for less than 20 years. It has become an important part of the study of [[Combinatorics|structural combinatorics]]. The set of [[Configuration (geometry)|configurations]] that are stable and recurrent for this game can be given the structure of an [[abelian group]]. In addition, the order of the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] is equal to the [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] number of the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biggs|first=Norman L.|title=Chip-Firing and the Critical Group of a Graph|journal=Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics|date=25 June 1997|pages=25–45|url=ftp://ftp.math.ethz.ch/hg/EMIS/journals/JACO/Volume9_1/m6g7032786582625.fulltext.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=wikidot|title=Chip-firing references|url=http://chipfiring.wikidot.com/chip-firing-references|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2819">In two-player [[sequential game]]s, a '''ply''' is one turn taken by one of the players.  The word is used to clarify what is meant when one might otherwise say "turn".

The word "turn" can be a problem since it means different things in different traditions.  For example, in standard [[chess]] terminology, one ''move'' consists of a turn by each player; therefore a ply in chess is a ''half-move''. Thus, after 20 moves in a chess game, 40 plies have been completed—20 by white and 20 by black.  In the game of [[Go (game)|Go]], by contrast, a ply is the normal unit of counting moves; so for example to say that a game is ''250 moves long'' is to imply 250 plies.

The word "ply" used as a synonym for "layer" goes back to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ply Online Etymology Dictionary, "ply"] (cited 24 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Samuel]] first used the term in its game-theoretic sense in his seminal paper on [[machine learning]] in checkers in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;[https://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-beygel/samuel-checkers.pdf A.L. Samuel, March 3, 1959: ''Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers''] (cited 25 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; but with a slighty different meaning: the "ply", in Samuel's terminology, is actually the depth of analysis ("Certain expressions were  introduced  which we will find useful.  These are: Ply, defined as  the number of moves ahead, where a ply  of  two  consists of one  proposed move  by the machine and  one anticipated  reply by the opponent"&lt;ref&gt;[https://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-beygel/samuel-checkers.pdf A.L. Samuel, March 3, 1959: ''Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers''], p. 601 (cited 2 May 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;).

In computing, the concept of ply is important because one ply corresponds to one level of the [[game tree]].   The [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] [[chess computer]] which defeated [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and sixteen plies to a maximum of forty plies in some situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6TYF-43PHC49-2-2&amp;_cdi=5617&amp;_user=1493916&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2002&amp;_sk=998659998&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkWb&amp;md5=59c0021718f120c63acb8a100b30b9e1&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf Murray Campbell, et al. 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2344">In [[probability theory]], '''Popoviciu's inequality''', named after [[Tiberiu Popoviciu]], is an [[upper bound]] on the [[variance]] ''σ²'' of any bounded [[probability distribution]].  Let ''M'' and ''m'' be upper and lower bounds on the values of any [[random variable]] with a particular probability distribution.  Then Popoviciu's inequality states:&lt;ref name=Popoviciu&gt;{{cite journal|author=Popoviciu, T.|year=1935|title= Sur les équations algébriques ayant toutes leurs racines réelles|journal= Mathematica (Cluj) |volume=9|pages= 129–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 \le \frac14 ( M - m )^2. &lt;/math&gt;

This equality holds precisely when half of the probability is concentrated at each of the two bounds.

Sharma ''et al''. have sharpened Popoviciu's inequality:&lt;ref name="Sharma et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sharma, R., Gupta, M., Kapoor, G.|year=2010|title= Some better bound on variance with applications|journal= Journal of Mathematical Inequalities |volume=4|pages= 355–363 |doi=10.7153/jmi-04-32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; {\sigma^2 + \left( \frac \text {Third central moment} {2\sigma^2} \right)^2} \le \frac14 (M - m)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

If the sample size is finite then the [[von Szokefalvi Nagy inequality]]&lt;ref name=Nagy1918&gt;Nagy JVS (1918) Uber algebraische Gleichungen mit lauter reellen Wurzeln, Jahresbericht der deutschen mathematiker-Vereingung, 27:37–43&lt;/ref&gt; gives a lower bound to the variance

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 \ge \frac{ ( M - m )^2} { 2n }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the sample size.

Popoviciu's inequality is weaker than the [[Bhatia&amp;ndash;Davis inequality]] which states

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 \le ( M - \mu )( \mu - m ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ'' is the expectation of the random variable. 

A  lower bound for the variance based on the Bhatia&amp;ndash;Davis inequality has been found by Agarwal ''et al''&lt;ref name=Agarwal2005&gt;Agarwal RP, Barnett NS, Cerone P and Dragomir SS (2005) A survey on some inequalities for expectation and variance. Computers and mathematics with applications 49 (2005) 429-480&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; ( M - \mu )( \mu - m ) - \frac{ ( M - m )^3 }{ 6 }\le \sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>(1) added requirement of multi-photon-absorbing photoresist used by all cited proposals; (2) to go from lambda=600nm red light to lambda=12nm Xrays we need 50 entangled photons, not just 10</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">'''Quantum lithography''' is a type of [[photolithography]], which exploits non-classical properties of the photons, such as [[quantum entanglement]], in order to achieve superior performance over ordinary classical lithography. Quantum lithography is closely related to the fields of [[quantum imaging]], [[quantum metrology]], and [[Quantum sensor|quantum sensing]]. The effect exploits the quantum mechanical state of light called the [[NOON state]]. Quantum lithography was invented at [[Jonathan P. Dowling]]'s group at [[JPL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v85/p2733 |authors=A. N. Boto, et al. |title=Quantum Interferometric Optical Lithography: Exploiting Entanglement to Beat the Diffraction Limit |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=85 |page=2733 |year=2000 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.2733 |arxiv=quant-ph/9912052}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been studied by a number of groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v86/p4516  |authors=G. Björk, et al. |title=Entangled-State Lithography: Tailoring Any Pattern with a Single State |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=86 |pages=4516 |year=2001 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.4516 |arxiv=quant-ph/0011075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular importance, quantum lithography can beat the classical [[Rayleigh criterion]] for the [[diffraction]] limit. Classical [[photolithography]] has an [[optical imaging]] resolution that cannot be smaller than the wavelength of light used. For example, in the use of [[photolithography]] to mass-produce computer chips, it is desirable to produce smaller and smaller features on the chip, which classically requires moving to smaller and smaller wavelengths (ultraviolet and x-ray), which entails exponentially greater cost to produce the optical imaging systems at these extremely short optical wavelengths.

Quantum lithography exploits the [[quantum entanglement]] between specially prepared photons in the [[NOON state]] and special [[photoresist]]s, that display multi-photon absorption processes to achieve the smaller resolution without the requirement of shorter wavelengths. For example, a beam of red photons, entangled 50 at a time in the NOON state, would have the same resolving power as a beam of x-ray photons.

The field of quantum lithography is in its infancy, and although experimental proofs of principal have been carried out using the [[Hong–Ou–Mandel effect]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v87/e013602 |author=M. D'Angelo, et al. |title=Two-Photon Diffraction and Quantum Lithography |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=87 |page=013602 |year=2001 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.013602 |arxiv=quant-ph/0103035}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is still a long way from commercial application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17297">In [[mathematics]], '''quaternionic analysis''' is the study of functions with [[quaternion]]s as the domain and/or range. Such functions can be called '''functions of a quaternion variable''' just as functions of a [[Function of a real variable|real variable]] or a [[complex variable]] are called.

As with complex and real analysis, it is possible to study the concepts of [[analytic function|analyticity]], [[holomorphic function|holomorphy]], [[harmonic function|harmonicity]] and [[conformality]] in the context of quaternions. Unlike the complex numbers and like the reals, the four notions do not coincide.

==Properties==
The [[projection (linear algebra)|projections]] of a quaternion onto its scalar part or onto its vector part, as well as the modulus and [[versor]] functions, are examples that are basic to understanding quaternion structure.

An important example of a function of a quaternion variable is
:&lt;math&gt;f_1(q) = u q u^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
which [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotates the vector part of ''q'']] by twice the angle represented by ''u''.

The quaternion [[multiplicative inverse]] &lt;math&gt;f_2(q) = q^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is another fundamental function, but as with other number systems, &lt;math&gt;f_2(0)&lt;/math&gt; and related problems are generally discluded due to the nature of [[dividing by zero]].

[[Affine transformation]]s of quaternions have the form
:&lt;math&gt;f_3(q) = aq + b, \quad a, b, q \in \mathbb{H}.&lt;/math&gt;
[[Linear fractional transformation]]s of quaternions can be represented by elements of the [[matrix ring]] &lt;math&gt;M_2(\mathbb{H})&lt;/math&gt; operating on the [[projective line over a ring|projective line over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt;]]. For instance, the mappings &lt;math&gt;q \mapsto u q v,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are fixed [[versor]]s serve to produce the [[elliptic geometry#elliptic space|motions of elliptic space]].

Quaternion variable theory differs in some respects from complex variable theory. For example: The [[complex conjugate]] mapping of the complex plane is a central tool but requires the introduction of a non-arithmetic, [[Holomorphic function|non-analytic]] operation. Indeed, conjugation changes the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of plane figures, something that arithmetic functions do not change.

In contrast to the [[complex conjugate]], the quaternion conjugation can be expressed arithmetically, as &lt;math&gt;f_4(q) = - \tfrac{1}{2} (q + iqi + jqj + kqk)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be proven, starting with the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] {1, i, j, k}:
:&lt;math&gt;f_4(1) = -\tfrac{1}{2}(1 - 1 - 1 - 1) = 1, \quad
f_4(i) = -\tfrac{1}{2}(i - i + i + i) = -i, \quad
f_4(j) = -j, \quad
f_4(k) = -k &lt;/math&gt;.
Consequently, since &lt;math&gt;f_4&lt;/math&gt; is [[linear function|linear]],
:&lt;math&gt;f_4(q) = f_4(w + x i + y j + z k) = w f_4(1) + x f_4(i) + y f_4(j) + z f_4(k) = w - x i - y j - z k = q^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The success of [[complex analysis]] in providing a rich family of [[holomorphic function]]s for scientific work has engaged some workers in efforts to extend the planar theory, based on complex numbers, to a 4-space study with functions of a quaternion variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fueter|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were summarized in {{harvtxt|Deavours|1973}}.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Deavours|1973}} recalls a 1935 issue of ''[[Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici]]'' where an alternative theory of "regular functions" was initiated by {{harvtxt|Fueter|1936}} through the idea of [[Morera's theorem]]: quaternion function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is "left regular at &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;" when the integral of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; vanishes over any sufficiently small [[hypersurface]] containing &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Then the analogue of [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]] holds: The only regular quaternion function with bounded norm in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^4&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. One approach to construct regular functions is to use [[power series]] with real coefficients. Deavours also gives analogues for the [[Poisson integral]], the [[Cauchy integral formula]], and the presentation of [[Maxwell’s equations]] of electromagnetism with quaternion functions.}}

Though &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; [[quaternion#H as a union of complex planes|appears as a union of complex planes]], the following proposition shows that extending complex functions requires special care:

Let &lt;math&gt;f_5(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; be a function of a complex variable, &lt;math&gt;z = x + i y&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose also that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is an [[even function]] of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is an [[odd function]] of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f_5(q) = u(x,y) + rv(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of &lt;math&gt;f_5&lt;/math&gt; to a quaternion variable &lt;math&gt;q = x + yr&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, let &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; represent the conjugate of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;q = x - yr^*&lt;/math&gt;. The extension to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; will be complete when it is shown that &lt;math&gt;f_5(q) = f_5(x - yr^*)&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, by hypothesis
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,y) = u(x,-y), \quad v(x,y) = -v(x,-y) \quad&lt;/math&gt; one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;f_5(x - y r^*) = u(x,-y) + r^* v(x,-y) = u(x,y) + r v(x,y) = f_5(q).&lt;/math&gt;

==Homographies==
The [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation]] about axis ''r'' is a classical application of quaternions to [[space]] mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Cayley|1848|loc=especially page 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of a [[Homography#Over a ring|homography]], the rotation is expressed
:&lt;math&gt;U(q,1) \begin{pmatrix}u &amp; 0\\0 &amp; u \end{pmatrix} = U(qu,u) \thicksim U(u^{-1}qu, 1) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u = \exp(\theta r) = \cos \theta + r \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; is a [[versor]]. If ''p'' * = &amp;minus;''p'', then the translation &lt;math&gt;q \mapsto q + p&lt;/math&gt; is expressed by
:&lt;math&gt;U(q,1)\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ p &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} = U(q + p, 1).&lt;/math&gt;
Rotation and translation ''xr'' along the axis of rotation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;U(q,1)\begin{pmatrix}u &amp; 0 \\ uxr &amp; u \end{pmatrix} = U(qu + uxr, u) \thicksim U(u^{-1}qu + xr, 1).&lt;/math&gt;
Such a mapping is called a [[screw displacement]]. In classical [[kinematics]], [[Chasles' theorem (kinematics)|Chasles' theorem]] states that any rigid body motion can be displayed as a screw displacement. Just as the representation of a [[Euclidean plane isometry]] as a rotation is a matter of complex number arithmetic, so Chasles' theorem, and the [[screw axis]] required, is a matter of quaternion arithmetic with homographies: Let ''s'' be a right versor, or square root of minus one, perpendicular to ''r'', with ''t'' = ''rs''.

Consider the axis passing through ''s'' and parallel to ''r''. Rotation about it is expressed&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hamilton|1853|loc=§287 pp. 273,4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the homography composition
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ -s &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}u &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; u \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ s &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}u &amp; 0 \\ z &amp; u \end{pmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z = u s - s u = \sin \theta (rs - sr) = 2 t \sin \theta .&lt;/math&gt;

Now in the (''s,t'')-plane the parameter &amp;theta; traces out a circle &lt;math&gt;u^{-1} z = u^{-1}(2 t \sin \theta) = 2 \sin \theta ( t \cos \theta - s \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt; in the half-plane &lt;math&gt;\lbrace wt + xs : x &gt; 0 \rbrace .&lt;/math&gt; 

Any ''p'' in this half-plane lies on a ray from the origin through the circle &lt;math&gt;\lbrace u^{-1} z : 0 &lt; \theta &lt; \pi \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; and can be written &lt;math&gt;p = a u^{-1} z , \ \ a &gt; 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

Then up = az, with &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}u &amp; 0 \\ az &amp; u \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; as the homography expressing [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]] of a rotation by a translation p.

== Linear map ==
The map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb H\rightarrow \mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;
of quaternion algebra is called linear, if following equalities hold
: &lt;math&gt;f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(ax)=af(x)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x,y\in\mathbb H, a\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is real field.
Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is linear map of quaternion algebra,
then, for any &lt;math&gt;a, b\in\mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;, the map
: &lt;math&gt;(afb)(x)=af(x)b&lt;/math&gt;
is linear map.
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is identity map (&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;),
then, for any &lt;math&gt;a, b\in\mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;,
we identify tensor product &lt;math&gt;a\otimes b&lt;/math&gt; and the map
: &lt;math&gt;(a\otimes b)\circ x=axb&lt;/math&gt;
For any linear map
&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb H\rightarrow \mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;
there exists a tensor &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb H\otimes\mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;a=\sum_s a_{s0}\otimes a_{s1}&lt;/math&gt;,
such that
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=a\circ x=(\sum_s a_{s0}\otimes a_{s1})\circ x=\sum_s a_{s0}xa_{s1}&lt;/math&gt;
So we can identify the linear map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;
and the tensor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

== The derivative for quaternions ==
Since the time of Hamilton, it has been realized that requiring the independence of the derivative from the path that a differential follows toward zero is too restrictive: it excludes even &lt;math&gt;f(q) = q^2&lt;/math&gt; from differentiation. Therefore, a direction-dependent derivative is necessary for functions of a quaternion variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hamilton|1866|loc=Chapter II, On differentials and developments of functions of quaternions, pp. 391–495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Laisant|1881|loc=Chapitre 5: Différentiation des Quaternions, pp. 104–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Considering of the increment of polynomial function of quaternionic argument shows that the increment is linear map of increment of the argument. From this, a definition can be made:

Continuous map
&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb H\rightarrow \mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;
is called differentiable
on the set &lt;math&gt;U\subset \mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;,
if, at every point &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt;,
the increment of the map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as
: &lt;math&gt;f(x+h)-f(x)=\frac{d f(x)}{d x}\circ h+o(h)&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{d x}:\mathbb H\rightarrow\mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;
is linear map of quaternion algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;o:\mathbb H\rightarrow \mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;
is such continuous map that
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{|o(a)|}{|a|}=0&lt;/math&gt;
Linear map
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{d x}&lt;/math&gt;
is called derivative of the map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

On the quaternions, the derivative may be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{d x}=
\sum_s \frac{d_{s0} f(x)}{d x}
\otimes
\frac{d_{s1} f(x)}{d x}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the differential of the map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed as
/math  With Brackets on either side.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{d x}\circ dx=
\left(
\sum_s \frac{d_{s0} f(x)}{d x}
\otimes
\frac{d_{s1} f(x)}{d x}\right)\circ dx=
\sum_s \frac{d_{s0} f(x)}{d x}
dx
\frac{d_{s1} f(x)}{d x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The number of terms in the sum will depend on the function ''f''. The expressions 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{sp}d f(x)}{d x}, p=0,1&lt;/math&gt; are called
components of derivative.

The derivative of a quaternionic function holds the following equalities
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{df(x)}{d x}\circ h=\lim_{t\to 0}(t^{-1}(f(x+th)-f(x)))&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(f(x)+g(x))}{d x}
=\frac{df(x)}{d x}+\frac{dg(x)}{d x}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{df(x)g(x)}{d x}
=\frac{df(x)}{d x}\ g(x)+f(x)\ \frac{dg(x)}{d x}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{df(x)g(x)}{d x} \circ h
=\left(\frac{df(x)}{d x}\circ h\right )\ g(x)+f(x)\left(\frac{dg(x)}{d x}\circ h\right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{daf(x)b}{d x}
=a\ \frac{df(x)}{d x}\ b&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{daf(x)b}{d x}\circ h
=a\left(\frac{df(x)}{d x}\circ h\right) b&lt;/math&gt;

For the function ''f''(''x'') = ''axb'', the derivative is
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{daxb}{d x}=a\otimes b&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;dy=\frac{daxb}{d x}\circ dx=a\,dx\,b&lt;/math&gt;
|}

and so the components are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{10} axb}{d x}=a&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{11} axb}{d x}=b&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Similarly, for the function ''f''(''x'') = ''x^2''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the derivative is
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx^2}{d x}=x\otimes 1+1\otimes x&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;dy=\frac{dx^2}{d x}\circ dx=x\,dx+dx\,x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

and the components are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{10}x^2}{d x}=x&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{11}x^2}{d x}=1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{20}x^2}{d x}=1&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{21}x^2}{d x}=x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Finally, for the function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the derivative is
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx^{-1}}{d x}=-x^{-1}\otimes x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;dy=\frac{dx^{-1}}{d x}\circ dx=-x^{-1}dx\,x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

and the components are: 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{10}x^{-1}}{d x}=-x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_{11}x^{-1}}{d x}=x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2655">In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], Quillen's '''Theorem A''' gives a sufficient condition for the [[classifying space]]s of two [[Category (mathematics)|categories]] to be homotopy equivalent. Quillen's '''Theorem B''' gives a sufficient condition for a square consisting of classifying spaces of categories to be [[homotopy Cartesian]]. The two theorems play central roles in Quillen's [[Q-construction]] in [[algebraic K-theory]] and are named after [[Daniel Quillen]].

The precise statements of the theorems are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weibel|2013|loc=Ch. IV. Theorem 3.7 and Theorem 3.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{math_theorem
|If &lt;math&gt;f: C \to D&lt;/math&gt; is a functor such that the classifying space &lt;math&gt;B(d \downarrow f)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;d \downarrow f&lt;/math&gt; is contractible for any object ''d'' in ''D'', then ''f'' induces a homotopy equivalence &lt;math&gt;BC \to BD&lt;/math&gt;.| name = Quillen's Theorem A
}}

{{math_theorem
|If &lt;math&gt;f: C \to D&lt;/math&gt; is a functor that induces a homotopy equivalence &lt;math&gt;B (d' \downarrow f) \to B(d \downarrow f)&lt;/math&gt; for any morphism &lt;math&gt;d' \to d&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an induced long exact sequence:
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \to \pi_{i+1} BD \to \pi_i B(d \downarrow f) \to \pi_i BC \to \pi_i BD \to \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;| name = Quillen's Theorem B
}}

In general, the homotopy fiber of &lt;math&gt;Bf: BC \to BD&lt;/math&gt; is not naturally the classifying space of a category: there is no natural category &lt;math&gt;Ff&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;FBf = BFf&lt;/math&gt;. Theorem B constructs &lt;math&gt;Ff&lt;/math&gt; in a case when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is especially nice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5009">In [[elementary algebra]], '''root rationalisation''' is a process by which [[nth root|radical]]s in the [[denominator]] of an [[Fraction (mathematics)#Algebraic fractions|algebraic fraction]] are eliminated. 

If the denominator is a [[monomial]] in some radical, say &lt;math&gt;a{\sqrt[n]{x}}^k,&lt;/math&gt; with {{math|''k'' &lt; ''n''}}, rationalisation consists of multiplying the numerator and the denominator by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x}^{n - k},&lt;/math&gt; and replacing &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt[n]{x}}^n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\left|x\right|,&lt;/math&gt; if {{math|''n ''}}  is even or by {{math|'' x''}} if {{math|''n''}}  is odd  (if  {{math|''k'' ≥ ''n''}}, the same replacement allows us to reduce {{math|''k''}} until it becomes lower than {{math|''n''}}.

If the denominator is [[linear function|linear]] in some square root, say &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt{x},&lt;/math&gt; rationalisation consists of multiplying the numerator and the denominator by &lt;math&gt;a-b\sqrt{x},&lt;/math&gt; and expanding the product in the denominator.

This technique may be extended to any algebraic denominator, by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by all [[algebraic conjugate]]s of the denominator, and expanding the new denominator into the [[field norm|norm]] of the old denominator. However, except in special cases, the resulting fractions may have huge numerators and denominators, and, therefore, the technique is generally used only in the above elementary cases.

== Rationalisation of a monomial square root and cube root ==

For the fundamental technique, the numerator and denominator must be multiplied by the same factor.

Example 1:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{\sqrt{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

To rationalise this kind of [[monomial]], bring in the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{\sqrt{a}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{a}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{a}} = \frac{{10\sqrt{a}}}{\sqrt{a}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[square root]] disappears from the denominator, because it is squared:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{{10\sqrt{a}}}{\sqrt{a}^2} = \frac{10\sqrt{a}}{a}&lt;/math&gt; 

This gives the result, after simplification:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{{10\sqrt{a}}}{{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

Example 2:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{\sqrt[3]{b}}&lt;/math&gt;

To rationalise this radical, bring in the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{b}^2&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{\sqrt[3]{b}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt[3]{b}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{b}^2}{\sqrt[3]{b}^2} = \frac{{10\sqrt[3]{b}^2}}{\sqrt[3]{b}^3}&lt;/math&gt;

The cube root disappears from the denominator, because it is cubed:

:  &lt;math&gt;\frac{{10\sqrt[3]{b}^2}}{\sqrt[3]{b}^3} = \frac{10\sqrt[3]{b}^2}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the result, after simplification:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{{10\sqrt[3]{b}^2}}{{b}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Dealing with more square roots ==

For a denominator that is: 

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Rationalisation can be achieved by multiplying by the ''[[Conjugate (algebra)|Conjugate]]'':

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and applying the [[difference of two squares]] identity, which here will yield &amp;minus;1. To get this result, the entire fraction should be multiplied by 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3} }{\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This technique works much more generally. It can easily be adapted to remove one square root at a time, i.e. to rationalise

:&lt;math&gt;x +\sqrt{y}\,&lt;/math&gt;

by multiplication by

:&lt;math&gt;x -\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}}&lt;/math&gt;

The fraction must be multiplied by a quotient containing &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5})}{\sqrt{3}^2 - \sqrt{5}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can proceed to remove the square roots in the denominator:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{{3(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5}) }}{\sqrt{3}^2 - \sqrt{5}^2} = \frac{ 3 (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{5} ) }{ 3 - 5 } = \frac{ 3( \sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5} )  }{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Example 2:

This process also works with [[complex numbers]] with &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{1+\sqrt{-5}}&lt;/math&gt;

The fraction must be multiplied by a quotient containing &lt;math&gt;{1-\sqrt{-5}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{1+\sqrt{-5}} \cdot \frac{1-\sqrt{-5}}{1-\sqrt{-5}} = \frac{7(1-\sqrt{-5})}{1^2 - \sqrt{-5}^2} = \frac{ 7 (1 - \sqrt{-5} ) }{ 1 - (-5) } = \frac{ 7 -7\sqrt{5} i }{6}&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

Rationalisation can be extended to all [[algebraic number]]s and [[algebraic function]]s (as an application of [[norm form]]s). For example, to rationalise a [[cube root]], two linear factors involving [[cube roots of unity]] should be used, or equivalently a quadratic factor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[representation theory]] a '''real representation''' is usually a [[group representation|representation]] on a [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] ''U'', but it can also mean a representation on a [[complex number|complex]] vector space ''V'' with an invariant [[real structure]], i.e., an [[antilinear]] [[equivariant map]]
:&lt;math&gt;j\colon V\to V&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;j^2=+1.&lt;/math&gt;
The two viewpoints are equivalent because if ''U'' is a real vector space acted on by a group ''G'' (say), then ''V'' = ''U''&amp;otimes;'''C''' is a representation on a complex vector space with an antilinear equivariant map given by [[complex conjugation]]. Conversely, if ''V'' is such a complex representation, then ''U'' can be recovered as the [[fixed point set]] of ''j'' (the [[eigenspace]] with [[eigenvalue]] 1).

In [[physics]], where representations are often viewed concretely in terms of matrices, a real representation is one in which the entries of the matrices representing the group elements are real numbers. These matrices can act either on real or complex column vectors.

A real representation on a complex vector space is isomorphic to its [[complex conjugate representation]], but the converse is not true: a representation which is isomorphic to its complex conjugate but which is not real is called a [[pseudoreal representation]]. An irreducible pseudoreal representation ''V'' is necessarily a [[quaternionic representation]]: it admits an invariant [[quaternionic structure]], i.e., an antilinear equivariant map
:&lt;math&gt;j\colon V\to V&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;j^2=-1.&lt;/math&gt;
A [[direct sum of representations|direct sum]] of real and quaternionic representations is neither real nor quaternionic in general.

A representation on a complex vector space can also be isomorphic to the [[dual representation]] of its complex conjugate. This happens precisely when the representation admits a nondegenerate invariant [[sesquilinear form]], e.g. a [[hermitian form]]. Such representations are sometimes said to be complex or (pseudo-)hermitian.

==Frobenius-Schur indicator==
{{Main|Frobenius-Schur indicator}}

A criterion (for [[compact group]]s ''G'') for reality of irreducible representations in terms of [[character theory]] is based on the '''Frobenius-Schur indicator''' defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{g\in G}\chi(g^2)\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
where ''&amp;chi;'' is the character of the representation and ''μ'' is the [[Haar measure]] with μ(''G'') = 1. For a finite group, this is given by
:&lt;math&gt;{1\over |G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi(g^2).&lt;/math&gt;
The indicator may take the values 1, 0 or &amp;minus;1. If the indicator is 1, then the representation is real. If the indicator is zero, the representation is complex (hermitian),&lt;ref&gt;Any complex representation ''V'' of a compact group has an invariant hermitian form, so the significance of zero indicator is that there is no invariant nondegenerate complex bilinear form on ''V''.&lt;/ref&gt; and if the indicator is &amp;minus;1, the representation is quaternionic.

==Examples==

All representation of the [[symmetric group]]s are real (and in fact rational), since we can build a complete set of [[irreducible representations]] using [[Young tableaux]].

All representations of the [[special orthogonal group|rotation group]]s are real, since they all appear as subrepresentations of [[tensor products]] of copies of the fundamental representation, which is real.

Further examples of real representations are the [[spinor]] representations of the [[spin group]]s in 8''k''&amp;minus;1, 8''k'', and 1 + 8''k'' dimensions for ''k'' = 1, 2, 3 ... . This periodicity ''[[Modular arithmetic|modulo]]'' 8 is known in mathematics not only in the theory of [[Clifford algebra]]s, but also in [[algebraic topology]], in [[KO-theory]]; see [[spin representation]].

{{wiktionary|rigour}}

'''Rigour''' ([[British English]]) or '''rigor''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|see spelling differences]]) describes a condition of stiffness or strictness. Rigour frequently refers to a process of adhering absolutely to certain constraints, or the practice of maintaining strict consistency with certain predefined parameters. These constraints may be environmentally imposed, such as "the rigours of famine"; logically imposed, such as mathematical proofs which must maintain consistent answers; or socially imposed, such as the process of defining ethics and law.

== Etymology ==
''Rigour'' comes to English through old French (13th c., Modern French ''rigueur'') meaning "stiffness", which itself is based on the Latin ''rigorem'' (nominative ''rigor'') "numbness, stiffness, hardness, firmness; roughness, rudeness", from the verb ''rigere'' "to be stiff".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=rigor|title = Rigor - Etymology|date = 2001–2014|accessdate = 2015-01-10|website = etymonline.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun was frequently used to describe a condition of strictness or stiffness, which arises from a situation or constraint either chosen or experienced passively. For example, the title of the book ''Theologia Moralis Inter Rigorem et Laxitatem Medi'' roughly translates as "mediating theological morality between rigour and laxness". The book details, for the clergy, situations in which they are obligated to follow church law exactly, and in which situations they can be more forgiving yet still considered moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theologia Moralis Inter Rigorem et Laxitatem Medi|last = Amort|first = Eusebio|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rigor mortis]]'' translates directly as the stiffness (''rigor'') of death (''mortis''), again describing a condition which arises from a certain constraint (death).

== Intellectual rigour ==
'''Intellectual rigour''' is a process of thought which is consistent, does not contain self-contradiction, and takes into account the entire scope of available knowledge on the topic. It actively avoids [[logical fallacy]]. Furthermore, it requires a sceptical assessment of the available knowledge. If a topic or case is dealt with in a rigorous way, it means that it is dealt with in a comprehensive, thorough and complete way, leaving no room for inconsistencies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Scholarly method]] describes the different approaches or methods which may be taken to apply intellectual rigour on an institutional level to [[quality control|ensure the quality]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of information published. An example of intellectual rigour assisted by a methodical approach is the [[scientific method]], in which a person will produce a hypothesis based on what they believe to be true, then construct experiments in order to prove that hypothesis wrong. This method, when followed correctly, helps to prevent against [[circular reasoning]] and other fallacies which frequently plague conclusions within academia. Other disciplines, such as philosophy and mathematics, employ their own structures to ensure intellectual rigour. Each method requires close attention to criteria for logical consistency, as well as to all relevant evidence and possible differences of interpretation. At an institutional level, [[Peer review]] is used to validate intellectual rigour.

=== Intellectual honesty ===
Intellectual rigour is a subset of [[intellectual honesty]]—a practice of thought in which ones convictions are kept in proportion to [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, N. (1985). ''Intellectual honesty and the contemporary scientist''. In P. Masani (Ed.), ''Norbert Wiener: Collected works and commentary'' (pp. 725- 729).&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual honesty is an unbiased approach to the acquisition, analysis, and transmission of ideas. A person is being intellectually honest when he or she, knowing the truth, states that truth, regardless of outside social/environmental pressures. It is possible to doubt whether complete intellectual honesty exists—on the grounds that no one can entirely master his or her own presuppositions—without doubting that certain kinds of intellectual rigour are potentially available. The distinction certainly matters greatly in [[debate]], if one wishes to say that an argument is flawed in its [[premise]]s.

=== Politics and law ===
{{main article|Letter and spirit of the law}}

The setting for intellectual rigour does tend to assume a principled position from which to advance or argue. An opportunistic tendency to use any argument at hand is not very rigorous, although very common in [[politics]], for example. Arguing one way one day, and another later, can be defended by [[casuistry]], i.e. by saying the cases are different.

In the legal context, for practical purposes, the facts of cases do always differ. [[Case law]] can therefore be at odds with a principled approach; and intellectual rigour can seem to be defeated. This defines a [[judge]]'s problem with uncodified [[law]]. Codified law poses a different problem, of interpretation and adaptation of definite principles without losing the point; here applying the letter of the law, with all due rigour, may on occasion seem to undermine the ''principled approach''.

== In specific disciplines ==
'''Mathematical rigour''' can refer both to rigorous methods of mathematical proof and to rigorous methods of mathematical practice (thus relating to other interpretations of rigour).

Mathematical rigour is often cited as a kind of gold standard for [[mathematical proof]]. Its history traces back to [[Greek mathematics]], especially to [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.

Until the 19th century, the treatise was seen as extremely rigorous  and profound, but, during that century, it was realized the work assumed some conditions that were not stated and also could not be proved (e.g. two circles can intersect in a point, some point is within an angle, and figures can be superimposed on each other).{{Citation needed|reason=does not cite a discussion of flaws in the Elements|date=November 2016}} This was contrary to the idea of rigorous proof where all conditions need to be stated and nothing can be assumed. New [[foundations of geometry|foundations]] were developed using the [[axiomatic method]] to address the lack of rigour in the ''Elements''.

During the 19th century, the term 'rigorous' began to be used to describe decreasing levels of abstraction when dealing with [[calculus]] which eventually became known as [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. The works of [[Cauchy]] added rigour to the older works of [[Euler]] and [[Gauss]]. The works of [[Riemann]] added rigour to the works of Cauchy. The works of [[Weierstrass]] added rigour to the works of Riemann, eventually culminating in the [[arithmetization of analysis]]. Starting in the 1870s, the term gradually came to be associated with [[George Cantor|Cantor]]ian [[set theory]].

Mathematical rigour can be defined as amenability to algorithmic [[proof checking]]. Indeed, with the aid of computers, it is possible to check some proofs mechanically.&lt;ref&gt;''Hardware memory errors are caused by high-energy radiation from outer space, and can generally be expected to affect one bit of data per month, per gigabyte of DRAM.''[http://beginnersguide.com/computer-hardware/index.xml].&lt;/ref&gt; '''Formal rigour''' is the introduction of high degrees of completeness by means of a [[formal language]] where such proofs can be codified using set theories such as [[ZFC]] (see [[automated theorem proving]]).

Most mathematical arguments are presented as prototypes of formally rigorous proofs. The reason often cited for this is that completely rigorous proofs, which tend to be longer and more unwieldy, may obscure what is being demonstrated. Steps which are obvious to a human mind may have fairly long formal derivations from the axioms. Under this argument, there is a trade-off between rigour and comprehension. Some argue that the use of formal languages to institute complete mathematical rigour might make theories which are commonly disputed or misinterpreted completely unambiguous by revealing flaws in reasoning.

=== Physics ===

The role of mathematical rigour in relation to [[physics]] is twofold:

# First, there is the general question, sometimes called ''[[Wigner's Puzzle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;This refers to the 1960 paper ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'' by [[Eugene Wigner]].&lt;/ref&gt; "how it is that mathematics, quite generally, is applicable to nature?" However, scientists believe that its record of successful application to nature justifies the study of [[mathematical physics]].
# Second, there is the question regarding the role and status of mathematically rigorous results and relations{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}. This question is particularly vexing in relation to [[quantum field theory]], where computations often produce infinite values for which a variety of non-rigorous work-arounds have been devised.

Both aspects of mathematical rigour in physics have attracted considerable attention in [[philosophy of science]]. (See, for example, ref.&lt;ref&gt;Gelfert, Axel, 'Mathematical Rigor in Physics: Putting Exact Results in Their Place', Philosophy of Science, 72 (2005) 723-738.&lt;/ref&gt; and works quoted therein.)

=== Education ===

Rigour in the classroom is a hotly debated topic amongst educators.  Generally speaking, however, classroom rigour consists of multi-faceted, challenging instruction and correct placement of the student.  Students excelling in formal operational thought tend to excel in classes for gifted students{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.  Students who have not reached that final stage of [[cognitive development]], according to developmental psychologist [[Jean Piaget]], can build upon those skills with the help of a properly trained teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Forum: [http://www.uni.edu/universitas/fall05/default.htm Academic Rigor], in: ''UNIversitas: The University of Northern Iowa Journal of Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity'' 1.1 (Fall 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigour in the classroom is commonly referred to as ''rigorous instruction''. It is instruction that requires students to construct meaning for themselves, impose structure on information, integrate individual skills into processes, operate within but at the outer edge of their abilities, and apply what they learn in more than one context and to unpredictable situations &lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2011). How to Plan Rigorous Instruction. Alexandria, VA.: ASCD.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''self-avoiding walk''' ('''SAW''') is a [[sequence]] of moves on a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] (a [[lattice path]]) that does not visit the same point more than once. This is a special case of the [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] notion of a [[Path (graph theory)|path]]. A '''self-avoiding polygon''' ('''SAP''') is a closed self-avoiding walk on a lattice. SAWs were first introduced by the chemist [[Paul Flory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Paul Flory|P. Flory]]|title=Principles of Polymer Chemistry|year=1953|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn= 9780801401343|pages=672}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |Wrong usage of pages in citation |reason=Page 672 is last Page! Also the wrong book? |date=September 2016}}  in order to model the real-life behavior of chain-like entities such as [[solvent]]s and [[polymer]]s, whose physical volume prohibits multiple occupation of the same spatial point. Very little is known rigorously about the self-avoiding walk from a mathematical perspective, although physicists have provided numerous conjectures that are believed to be true and are strongly supported by numerical simulations.

In [[computational physics]] a self-avoiding walk is a chain-like path in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} with a certain number of nodes, typically a fixed step length and has the imperative property that it doesn't cross itself or another walk. A system of self-avoiding walks satisfies the so-called [[excluded volume]] condition. In higher dimensions, the self-avoiding walk is believed to behave much like the ordinary [[random walk]]. SAWs and SAPs play a central role in the  modelling of the [[topology|topological]] and [[knot theory|knot-theoretic]] behaviour of thread- and loop-like molecules such as [[protein]]s. SAW is a [[fractal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Shlomo Havlin|S. Havlin]], D. Ben-Avraham |year= 1982 |title= New approach to self-avoiding walks as a critical phenomenon|journal= J. Phys.

The dimension is called the upper [[critical dimension]] above which excluded volume is negligible. A SAW that does not satisfy the excluded volume condition was recently studied to model explicit surface geometry resulting from expansion of a SAW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. Bucksch, [[Greg Turk|G. Turk]], J.S. Weitz|title=The Fiber Walk: A Model of Tip-Driven Growth with Lateral Expansion|year=2014| journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=1|pages=e85585|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0085585#s6| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085585|pmid=24465607|pmc=3899046|arxiv=1304.3521|bibcode=2014PLoSO...985585B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties of SAWs cannot be calculated analytically, so numerical [[simulation]]s are employed. The [[pivot algorithm]] is a common method for [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] simulations for the uniform measure on {{mvar|n}}-step self-avoiding walks. The pivot algorithm works by taking a self-avoiding walk and randomly choosing a point on this walk, and then applying a symmetry operation (rotations and reflections) on the walk after the nth step to create a new walk. Calculating the number of self-avoiding walks in any given lattice is a common computational problem. There is currently no known formula for determining the number of self-avoiding walks, although there are rigorous methods for approximating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hayes B |title=How to Avoid Yourself |journal=American Scientist |volume=86 |issue=4 |page= 314|date=Jul–Aug 1998 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/how-to-avoid-yourself/ |doi=10.1511/1998.31.3301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liśkiewicz M |author2=Ogihara M |author3=Toda S |title=The complexity of counting self-avoiding walks in subgraphs of two-dimensional grids and hypercubes |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=304 |issue=1–3 |pages=129–56 |date=July 2003 | doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00080-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030439750300080X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding the number of such paths is [[mathematical conjecture|conjectured]] to be an [[NP-hard]] problem{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. For self-avoiding walks from one end of a diagonal to the other, with only moves in the positive direction, there are exactly

:&lt;math&gt;{m+n \choose m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

paths for an {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} rectangular lattice.

==Universality==
One of the phenomena associated with self-avoiding walks and {{math|2}}-dimensional statistical physics models in general is the notion of universality, that is, independence of macroscopic observables from microscopic details, such as the choice of the lattice. One important quantity that appears in conjectures for universal laws is the [[connective constant]], defined as follows. Let {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the number of {{mvar|n}}-step self-avoiding walks. Since every {{math|(''n'' + ''m'')}}-step self avoiding walk can be decomposed into an {{mvar|n}}-step self-avoiding walk and an {{mvar|m}}-step self-avoiding walk, it follows that {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Therefore, the sequence {{math|{log ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} }} is [[Subadditivity|subadditive]] and we can apply [[Fekete's lemma]] to show that the following limit exists:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \lim_{n \to \infty} c_n^{\frac{1}{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{mvar|μ}} is called the '''connective constant''', since {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} depends on the particular lattice chosen for the walk so does {{mvar|μ}}. The exact value of {{mvar|μ}} is only known for the hexagonal lattice, where it is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duminil-Copin|first1=Hugo|last2=Smirnov|first2=Stanislav|author2-link=Stanislav Smirnov|title=The connective constant of the honeycomb lattice equals sqrt(2+sqrt 2)|journal=Annals of Mathematics|date=1 May 2012|volume=175|issue=3|pages=1653–1665|doi=10.4007/annals.2012.175.3.14|arxiv=1007.0575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For other lattices, {{mvar|μ}} has only been approximated numerically, and is believed to not even be an [[algebraic number]]. It is conjectured that{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt;c_n \approx \mu^n n^{\frac{11}{32}}&lt;/math&gt;

as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}, where {{mvar|μ}} depends on the lattice, but the power law correction &lt;math&gt;n^{\frac{11}{32}}&lt;/math&gt; does not; in other words, this law is believed to be universal.

==On networks==
Self-avoiding walks have also been studied in the context of [[network theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Carlos P. Herrero|year= 2005|title= Self-avoiding walks on scale-free networks|journal= Phys. Rev. E|volume= 71|issue= 3|pages= 1728 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.71.016103|url= http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.71.016103|arxiv= cond-mat/0412658|bibcode= 2005PhRvE..71a6103H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it is customary to treat the SAW as a dynamical process, such that in every time-step a walker randomly hops between neighboring nodes of the network. The walk ends when the walker reaches a dead-end state, such that it can no longer progress to newly un-visited nodes. It was recently found that on [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi]] networks, the distribution of path lengths of such dynamically grown SAWs can be calculated analytically, and follows the [[Gompertz distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tishby|first1=I.|last2=Biham|first2=O.|last3=Katzav|first3=E.|title=The distribution of path lengths of self avoiding walks on Erdős–Rényi networks|journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical|date=2016|volume=49|issue=28|pages=285002|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/49/28/285002|arxiv=1603.06613|bibcode=2016JPhA...49B5002T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits==
Consider the uniform measure on {{mvar|n}}-step self-avoiding walks in the full plane. It is currently unknown whether the limit of the uniform measure as {{math|''n'' → ∞}} induces a measure on infinite full-plane walks. However, [[Harry Kesten]] has shown that such a measure exists for self-avoiding walks in the half-plane. One important question involving self-avoiding walks is the existence and conformal invariance of the [[scaling limit]], that is, the limit as the length of the walk goes to infinity and the mesh of the lattice goes to zero. The scaling limit of the self-avoiding walk is conjectured to be described by [[Schramm–Loewner evolution]] with parameter {{math|''κ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|8|3}}.}}

In [[mathematics]], the term '''socle''' has several related meanings.

==Socle of a group==
In the context of [[group theory]], the '''socle of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]''' ''G'', denoted soc(''G''), is the [[subgroup]] generated by the [[minimal normal subgroup]]s of ''G''. It can happen that a group has no minimal non-trivial normal subgroup (that is, every non-trivial normal subgroup properly contains another such subgroup) and in that case the socle is defined to be the subgroup generated by the identity. The socle is a direct product of minimal normal subgroups.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|loc=p.87}}

As an example, consider the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; with [[generating set of a group|generator]] ''u'', which has two minimal normal subgroups, one generated by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 4&lt;/sup&gt; (which gives a normal subgroup with 3 elements) and the other by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 6&lt;/sup&gt; (which gives a normal subgroup with 2 elements). Thus the socle of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the group generated by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 4&lt;/sup&gt; and ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 6&lt;/sup&gt;, which is just the group generated by ''u''&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The socle is a [[characteristic subgroup]], and hence a normal subgroup. It is not necessarily [[Transitively normal subgroup|transitively normal]], however.

If a group G is a finite [[solvable group]], then the socle can be expressed as a product of [[elementary abelian]] [[p-group]]s. Thus, in this case, it is just a product of copies of '''Z/pZ''' for various '''p''' where the same '''p''' may occur multiple times in the product.

==Socle of a module==
In the context of [[module theory]] and [[ring theory]] the '''socle of a [[module (mathematics)|module]]''' ''M'' over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is defined to be the sum of the minimal nonzero submodules of ''M''. It can be considered as a [[duality (mathematics)|dual notion]] to that of the [[radical of a module]]. In set notation,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm {soc}(M) = \sum \{ N \mid N \text{ is a simple submodule of }M \}. &lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm {soc}(M) = \bigcap\{ E \mid E \text{ is an essential submodule of }M \}. &lt;/math&gt;

The '''socle of a ring''' ''R'' can refer to one of two sets in the ring. Considering ''R'' as a right ''R'' module, soc(''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined, and considering ''R'' as a left ''R'' module, soc(&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'') is defined. Both of these socles are [[ring ideal]]s, and it is known they are not necessarily equal.

* If ''M'' is an [[Artinian module]], soc(''M'') is itself an [[essential extension|essential submodule]] of ''M''.
* A module is [[semisimple module|semisimple]] if and only if soc(''M'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''.  Rings for which soc(''M'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M'' for all ''M'' are precisely [[semisimple ring]]s.
* soc(soc(''M''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;soc(''M''). 
*M is a [[finitely cogenerated module]] if and only if soc(''M'') is finitely generated and soc(M) is an [[essential extension|essential submodule]] of M.
*Since the sum of semisimple modules is semisimple, the socle of a module could also be defined as the unique maximal semi-simple submodule.
* From the definition of rad(''R''), it is easy to see that rad(''R'') [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilates]] soc(''R''). If ''R'' is a finite-dimensional unital [[algebra]] and ''M'' a finitely generated ''R''-module then the socle consists precisely of the elements annihilated by the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Alperin]]; Rowen B. Bell, ''Groups and Representations'', 1995,  {{isbn|0-387-94526-1}}, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socle of a Lie algebra==
In the context of [[Lie algebra]]s, a '''socle of a [[symmetric Lie algebra]]''' is the [[eigenspace]] of its structural [[automorphism]] which corresponds to the eigenvalue&amp;nbsp;−1. (A symmetric Lie algebra decomposes into the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of its socle and [[cosocle]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Postnikov]], ''Geometry VI: Riemannian Geometry'', 2001,  {{isbn|3540411089}},[https://books.google.com/books?id=P60o2UKOaPcC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=cosocle#v=onepage&amp;q=socle&amp;f=false p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is measured by the angle between the planes containing the arcs (which naturally also contain the centre of the sphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Spherical Astronomy|first=Robin Michael|last=Green|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780521317795|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOpaUFQFwTwC&amp;pg=PA3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[special functions]], a topic in [[mathematics]], '''spin-weighted spherical harmonics''' are generalizations of the standard [[spherical harmonics]] and—like the usual spherical harmonics—are functions on the [[sphere]].  Unlike ordinary spherical harmonics, the spin-weighted harmonics are {{math|[[U(1)]]}} [[gauge field]]s rather than [[scalar field]]s: mathematically, they take values in a complex [[line bundle]].  The spin-weighted harmonics are organized by degree {{mvar|l}}, just like ordinary spherical harmonics, but have an additional '''spin weight''' {{mvar|s}} that reflects the additional {{math|U(1)}} symmetry.  A special basis of harmonics can be derived from the Laplace spherical harmonics {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''lm''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and are typically denoted by {{math|&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''lm''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{mvar|l}} and {{mvar|m}} are the usual parameters familiar from the standard Laplace spherical harmonics.  In this special basis, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics appear as actual functions, because the choice of a polar axis fixes the {{math|U(1)}} gauge ambiguity.  The spin-weighted spherical harmonics can be obtained from the standard spherical harmonics by application of [[Ladder operators|spin raising and lowering operators]].  In particular, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics of spin weight {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} are simply the standard spherical harmonics:
:&lt;math&gt;{}_0Y_{l m} = Y_{l m}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Spaces of spin-weighted spherical harmonics were first identified in connection with the [[representation theory]] of the [[Lorentz group]] {{harv|Gelfand|Minlos|Shapiro|1958}}.  They were subsequently and independently rediscovered by {{harvtxt|Newman|Penrose|1966}} and applied to describe [[gravitational radiation]], and again by {{harvtxt|Wu|Yang|1976}} as so-called "monopole harmonics" in the study of [[Dirac monopole]]s.

==Spin-weighted functions==
Regard the sphere {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} as embedded into the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  At a point {{math|'''x'''}} on the sphere, a positively oriented [[orthonormal basis]] of [[tangent vector]]s at {{math|'''x'''}} is a pair {{math|'''a''', '''b'''}} of vectors such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{b} &amp;= 0\\
\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{b} &amp;= 1\\
\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} &amp;= 0\\
\mathbf{x}\cdot (\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}) &amp;&gt; 0,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the first pair of equations states that {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are tangent at {{math|'''x'''}}, the second pair states that {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are [[unit vector]]s, the penultimate equation that {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are [[orthogonal]], and the final equation that {{math|('''x''', '''a''', '''b''')}} is a right-handed basis of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

A spin-weight {{mvar|s}} function {{mvar|f}} is a function accepting as input a point {{math|'''x'''}} of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and a positively oriented orthonormal basis of tangent vectors at {{math|'''x'''}}, such that
:&lt;math&gt;f\bigl(\mathbf x,(\cos\theta)\mathbf{a}-(\sin\theta)\mathbf{b}, (\sin\theta)\mathbf{a} + (\cos\theta)\mathbf{b}\bigr) = e^{is\theta}f(\mathbf x,\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})&lt;/math&gt;
for every rotation angle {{mvar|θ}}.

Following {{harvtxt|Eastwood|Tod|1982}}, denote the collection of all spin-weight {{mvar|s}} functions by {{math|'''B'''(''s'')}}.  Concretely, these are understood as functions {{mvar|f}} on {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\{0}}} satisfying the following homogeneity law under complex scaling
:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\lambda z,\overline{\lambda}\bar{z}\right) = \left(\frac{\overline{\lambda}}{\lambda}\right)^s f\left(z,\bar{z}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This makes sense provided {{mvar|s}} is a half-integer.

Abstractly, {{math|'''B'''(''s'')}} is [[isomorphic]] to the smooth [[vector bundle]] underlying the [[antiholomorphic]] vector bundle {{math|{{overline|'''O'''(2''s'')}}}} of the [[Serre twist]] on the [[complex projective line]] {{math|'''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  A section of the latter bundle is a function {{mvar|g}} on {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\{0}}} satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;g\left(\lambda z,\overline{\lambda}\bar{z}\right) = \overline{\lambda}^{2s} g\left(z,\bar{z}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Given such a {{mvar|g}}, we may produce a spin-weight {{mvar|s}} function by multiplying by a suitable power of the hermitian form
:&lt;math&gt;P\left(z,\bar{z}\right) = z\cdot\bar{z}.&lt;/math&gt;
Specifically, {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''P''&lt;sup&gt;−''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''g''}} is a spin-weight {{mvar|s}} function.  The association of a spin-weighted function to an ordinary homogeneous function is an isomorphism.

===The operator {{mvar|ð}}===
The spin weight bundles {{math|'''B'''(''s'')}} are equipped with a [[differential operator]] {{mvar|ð}} ([[eth]]).  This operator is essentially the [[Dolbeault operator]], after suitable identifications have been made,
:&lt;math&gt;\partial : \overline{\mathbf O(2s)} \to \mathcal{E}^{1,0}\otimes \overline{\mathbf O(2s)} \cong \overline{\mathbf O(2s)}\otimes\mathbf{O}(-2).&lt;/math&gt;
Thus for {{math|''f'' ∈ '''B'''(''s'')}},
:&lt;math&gt;\eth f \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ P^{-s+1}\partial \left(P^s f\right) &lt;/math&gt;
defines a function of spin-weight {{math|''s'' + 1}}.

==Spin-weighted harmonics==
Just as conventional spherical harmonics are the [[eigenfunction]]s of the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]] on the sphere, the spin-weight {{mvar|s}} harmonics are the eigensections for the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on the bundles {{math|{{mathcal|E}}(''s'')}} of spin-weight {{mvar|s}} functions.
       
==Representation as functions==
The spin-weighted harmonics can be represented as functions on a sphere once a point on the sphere has been selected to serve as the North pole.  By definition, a function {{mvar|η}} with ''spin weight {{mvar|s}}'' transforms under rotation about the pole via
:&lt;math&gt;\eta \rightarrow e^{i s \psi}\eta.&lt;/math&gt;

Working in standard spherical coordinates, we can define a particular operator {{mvar|ð}} acting on a function {{mvar|η}} as:
:&lt;math&gt;\eth\eta =  - \left(\sin{\theta}\right)^s \left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + \frac{i}{\sin{\theta}} \frac{\partial} {\partial \phi} \right\} \left[ \left(\sin{\theta}\right)^{-s} \eta \right].&lt;/math&gt;
This gives us another function of {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|φ}}. (The operator {{mvar|ð}} is effectively a [[covariant derivative]] operator in the sphere.)

An important property of the new function {{mvar|ðη}} is that if {{mvar|η}} had spin weight {{mvar|s}}, {{mvar|ðη}} has spin weight {{math|''s'' + 1}}.  Thus, the operator raises the spin weight of a function by 1.  Similarly, we can define an operator {{mvar|{{overline|ð}}}} which will lower the spin weight of a function by 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar\eth\eta =  - \left(\sin{\theta}\right)^{-s} \left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} - \frac{i}{\sin{\theta}} \frac{\partial} {\partial \phi} \right\} \left[ \left(\sin{\theta}\right)^{s} \eta \right].&lt;/math&gt;

The spin-weighted spherical harmonics are then defined in terms of the usual [[spherical harmonics]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;
{}_sY_{l m} = \begin{cases}
\sqrt{\frac{(l-s)!}{(l+s)!}}\ \eth^s Y_{l m},&amp;&amp; 0\leq s \leq l; \\
\sqrt{\frac{(l+s)!}{(l-s)!}}\ \left(-1\right)^s \bar\eth^{-s} Y_{l m},&amp;&amp; -l\leq s \leq 0; \\
0,&amp;&amp;l &lt; |s|.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
The functions {{math|&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''lm''&lt;/sub&gt;}} then have the property of transforming with spin weight {{mvar|s}}.

Other important properties include the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\eth\left({}_sY_{l m}\right)     &amp;= +\sqrt{(l-s)(l+s+1)}\, {}_{s+1}Y_{l m};\\
\bar\eth\left({}_sY_{l m}\right) &amp;= -\sqrt{(l+s)(l-s+1)}\, {}_{s-1}Y_{l m};
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Orthogonality and completeness ==
The harmonics are orthogonal over the entire sphere:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{S^2} {}_sY_{l m}\, {}_s\bar{Y}_{l'm'}\, dS = \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'}, &lt;/math&gt;
and satisfy the completeness relation
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{l m} {}_s\bar Y_{l m}\left(\theta',\phi'\right) {}_s Y_{l m}(\theta,\phi) = \delta\left(\phi'-\phi\right)\delta\left(\cos\theta'-\cos\theta\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Calculating==
These harmonics can be explicitly calculated by several methods.  The obvious recursion relation results from repeatedly applying the raising or lowering operators.  Formulae for direct calculation were derived by {{harvtxt|Goldberg|Macfarlane|Newman|Rohlich|1967}}.  Note that their formulae use an old choice for the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Condon-ShortleyPhase.html Condon–Shortley phase].  The convention chosen below is in agreement with Mathematica, for instance.

The more useful of the Goldberg, et al., formulae is the following:
:&lt;math&gt;{}_sY_{l m} (\theta, \phi) = \left(-1\right)^m \sqrt{ \frac{(l+m)! (l-m)! (2l+1)} {4\pi (l+s)! (l-s)!} } \sin^{2l} \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \times\sum_{r=0}^{l-s} {l-s \choose r} {l+s \choose r+s-m} \left(-1\right)^{l-r-s} e^{i m \phi} \cot^{2r+s-m} \left( \frac{\theta} {2} \right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;

A Mathematica notebook using this formula to calculate arbitrary spin-weighted spherical harmonics can be found [http://www.black-holes.org/SpinWeightedSphericalHarmonics.nb here].

With the phase convention here:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{}_s\bar Y_{l m} &amp;= \left(-1\right)^{s+m}{}_{-s}Y_{l(-m)}\\
{}_sY_{l m}(\pi-\theta,\phi+\pi) &amp;= \left(-1\right)^l {}_{-s}Y_{l m}(\theta,\phi).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== First few spin-weighted spherical harmonics ==

Analytic expressions for the first few orthonormalized spin-weighted spherical harmonics:

=== Spin-weight {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, degree {{math|''l'' {{=}} 1}} ===

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{}_1 Y_{10}(\theta,\phi)     &amp;=  \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\,\sin\theta \\
{}_1 Y_{1\pm 1}(\theta,\phi) &amp;= -\sqrt{\frac{3}{16\pi}}(1 \mp \cos\theta)\,e^{\pm i\phi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Relation to Wigner rotation matrices ==

:&lt;math&gt;D^l_{-m s}(\phi,\theta,-\psi) =\left(-1\right)^m \sqrt\frac{4\pi}{2l+1} {}_sY_{l m}(\theta,\phi) e^{is\psi}&lt;/math&gt;

This relation allows the spin harmonics to be calculated using recursion relations for the [[Wigner D-matrix|{{mvar|D}}-matrices]].

== Triple integral ==

The triple integral in the case that {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} is given in terms of the [[3-j symbol|3-{{mvar|j}} symbol]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{S^2} \,{}_{s_1} Y_{j_1 m_1}
\,{}_{s_2} Y_{j_2m_2}\, {}_{s_3} Y_{j_3m_3} = \sqrt{\frac{\left(2j_1+1\right)\left(2j_2+1\right)\left(2j_3+1\right)}{4\pi}}
\begin{pmatrix}
  j_1 &amp; j_2 &amp; j_3\\
  m_1 &amp; m_2 &amp; m_3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  j_1 &amp; j_2 &amp; j_3\\
  -s_1 &amp; -s_2 &amp; -s_3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2801">In mathematics and computer science, a '''splicing rule''' is a transformation on [[formal language]]s which formalises the action of [[gene splicing]] in [[molecular biology]].  A '''splicing language''' is a language generated by iterated application of a splicing rule: the splicing languages form a proper subset of the [[regular language]]s.

==Definition==
Let ''A'' be an alphabet and ''L'' a language, that is, a subset of the free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;.  A '''splicing rule''' is a quadruple ''r'' = (''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'') of elements of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the action of the rule ''r'' on ''L'' is to produce the language

:&lt;math&gt; r(L) = \{ xady : xabq, pcdy \in L \} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

If ''R'' is a set of rules then ''R''(''L'') is the union of the languages produced by the rules of ''R''.  We say that ''R'' ''respects'' ''L'' if ''R''(''L'') is a subset of ''L''.  The ''R''-closure of ''L'' is the union of ''L'' and all iterates of ''R'' on ''L'': clearly it is respected by ''R''.  A '''splicing language''' is the ''R''-closure of a finite language.&lt;ref name=A236&gt;Anderson (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;236&lt;/ref&gt;

A rule set ''R'' is '''reflexive''' if (''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'') in ''R'' implies that (''a'',''b'',''a'',''b'') and (''c'',''d'',''c'',''d'') are in ''R''.  A splicing language is reflexive if it is defined by a reflexive rule set.&lt;ref name=A242/&gt;

==Examples==
* Let ''A'' = {''a'',''b'',''c''}.  The rule (''caba'',''a'',''cab'',''a'') applied to the finite set {''cabb'',''cabab'',''cabaab''} generates the regular language ''caba''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;''b''.&lt;ref name=A238&gt;Anderson (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
* All splicing languages are regular.&lt;ref name=A239&gt;Anderson (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;239&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not all regular languages are splicing.&lt;ref name=A240&gt;Anderson (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;240&lt;/ref&gt;  An example is (''aa'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; over {''a'',''b''}.&lt;ref name=A239/&gt;  
* If ''L'' is a regular language on the alphabet ''A'', and ''z'' is a letter not in ''A'', then the language { ''zw'' : ''w'' in ''L'' } is a splicing language.&lt;ref name=A238/&gt;
* There is an algorithm to determine whether a given regular language is a reflexive splicing language.&lt;ref name=A242&gt;Anderson (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;242&lt;/ref&gt;
* The set of splicing rules that respect a regular language can be determined from the [[syntactic monoid]] of the language.&lt;ref name=A241&gt;Anderson (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stevens's power law''' is an empirical relationship in [[psychophysics]] between an increased intensity or strength in a physical stimulus and the perceived [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] increase in the sensation created by the stimulus. It is often considered to supersede the [[Weber–Fechner law]], based on a logarithmic relationship between stimulus and sensation, because the power law describes a wider range of sensory comparisons.

The theory is named after psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (1906–1973).  Although the idea of a [[power law]] had been suggested by 19th-century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957.

The general form of the law is
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(I) = k I ^a,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the intensity or strength of the stimulus in physical units (energy, weight, pressure, mixture proportions, etc.), ψ(''I'') is the magnitude of the sensation evoked by the stimulus, ''a'' is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation or sensory modality, and ''k'' is a [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constant that depends on the units used.

A distinction has been made between local [[psychophysics]], where stimuli can only be discriminated with a probability around 50%, and global psychophysics, where the stimuli can be discriminated correctly with near certainty ([[R. Duncan Luce|Luce]] &amp; Krumhansl, 1988). The Weber–Fechner law and methods described by [[L. L. Thurstone]] are generally applied in local psychophysics, whereas Stevens's methods are usually applied in global psychophysics.

The table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens.

==Methods==
The principal methods used by Stevens to measure the perceived intensity of a stimulus were ''magnitude estimation'' and ''magnitude production''. In magnitude estimation with a standard, the experimenter presents a stimulus called a ''standard'' and assigns it a number called the ''modulus''. For subsequent stimuli, subjects report numerically their perceived intensity relative to the standard so as to preserve the ratio between the sensations and the numerical estimates (e.g., a sound perceived twice as loud as the standard should be given a number twice the modulus). In magnitude estimation without a standard (usually just ''magnitude estimation''), subjects are free to choose their own standard, assigning any number to the first stimulus and all subsequent ones with the only requirement being that the ratio between sensations and numbers is preserved. In magnitude production a number and a reference stimulus is given and subjects produce a stimulus that is perceived as that number times the reference. Also used is ''cross-modality matching'', which generally involves subjects altering the magnitude of one physical quantity, such as the brightness of a light, so that its perceived intensity is equal to the perceived intensity of another type of quantity, such as warmth or pressure.

==Criticisms==
Stevens generally collected magnitude estimation data from multiple observers, averaged the data across subjects, and then fitted a power function to the data.  Because the fit was generally reasonable, he concluded the power law was correct.

A principal criticism has been that Stevens's approach provides neither a direct test of the power law itself nor the underlying assumptions of the magnitude estimation/production method: it simply fits curves to data points. In addition, the power law can be deduced mathematically from the Weber-Fechner logarithmic function ([[Mackay, 1963]]&lt;ref&gt;MacKay, D. M. Psychophysics of perceived intensity: A theoretical basis for Fechner's and Stevens' laws. Science, 1963, 139, 1213-1216.&lt;/ref&gt;), and the relation makes predictions consistent with data ([http://hdl.handle.net/10161/6003 Staddon], 1978&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. E. R.)].  Theory of behavioral power functions. Psychological Review, 85, 305-320. &lt;/ref&gt;). As with all psychometric studies, Stevens's approach ignores individual differences in the stimulus-sensation relationship, and there are generally large individual differences in this relationship that averaging the data will obscure {{Harv|Green|Luce|1974}}.

Stevens's main assertion was that using magnitude estimations/productions respondents were able to make judgements on a [[Scale (ratio)|ratio scale]] (i.e., if ''x'' and ''y'' are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant ''k'' such that ''x'' = ''ky''). In the context of [[axiomatic system|axiomatic]] psychophysics, {{harv|Narens|1996}} formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions ''p'' and ''q'', and three stimuli, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', if ''y'' is judged ''p'' times ''x'', ''z'' is judged ''q'' times ''y'', then ''t'' = ''pq'' times ''x'' should be equal to ''z''. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected ({{harvnb|Ellermeier|Faulhammer|2000}}, {{harvnb|Zimmer|2005}}). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, {{Harv|Narens|1996}} formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if ''y'' is judged ''p'' times ''x'', ''z'' is judged ''q'' times ''y'', and if ''y''{{'}} is judged ''q'' times ''x'', ''z''{{'}} is judged ''p'' times ''y''{{'}}, then ''z'' should equal ''z''{{'}}. This property has been sustained in a variety of situations ({{Harvnb|Ellermeier|Faulhammer|2000}}, {{harvnb|Zimmer|2005}}).

Critics of the power law also point out that the validity of the law is contingent on the measurement of perceived stimulus intensity that is employed in the relevant experiments. {{harv|Luce|2002}}, under the condition that respondents' numerical distortion function and the psychophysical functions could be separated, formulated a behavioral condition equivalent to the psychophysical function being a power function. This condition was confirmed for just over half the respondents, and the power form was found to be a reasonable approximation for the rest {{Harv|Steingrimsson|Luce|2006}}.

It has also been questioned, particularly in terms of [[signal detection theory]], whether any given stimulus is actually associated with a particular and ''absolute'' perceived intensity; i.e. one that is independent of contextual factors and conditions. Consistent with this, Luce (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;73) observed that "by introducing contexts such as background noise in loudness judgements, the shape of the magnitude estimation functions certainly deviates sharply from a power function". Indeed, nearly all sensory judgments can be changed by the context in which a stimulus is perceived.

{{String theory}}

In [[physics]], '''string theory''' is a [[Mathematical theory|theoretical framework]] in which the [[Point particle|point-like particles]] of [[particle physics]] are replaced by [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|one-dimensional]] objects called [[String (physics)|strings]]. It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], and other properties determined by the [[vibration]]al state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the [[graviton]], a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] particle that carries [[gravity|gravitational force]]. Thus string theory is a theory of [[quantum gravity]].

String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of [[fundamental physics]]. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in [[black hole]] physics, early universe [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[condensed matter physics]], and it has stimulated a number of major developments in [[pure mathematics]]. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a [[theory of everything]], a self-contained [[mathematical model]] that describes all [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental force]]s and forms of [[matter]]. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details. 

String theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the [[strong nuclear force]], before being abandoned in favor of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, [[bosonic string theory]], incorporated only the class of [[particle]]s known as [[boson]]s. It later developed into [[superstring theory]], which posits a connection called [[supersymmetry]] between bosons and the class of particles called [[fermion]]s. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as [[M-theory]]. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a [[quantum field theory]].

One of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. Another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous [[string landscape|landscape]] of possible universes, and this has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and question the value of continued research on string theory unification.

== Fundamentals==
[[Image:Open and closed strings.svg|right|thumb|alt=A wavy open segment and closed loop of string.|The fundamental objects of string theory are open and closed [[string (physics)|string]] models.]]

In the twentieth century, two theoretical frameworks emerged for formulating the laws of physics. The first is [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], a theory that explains the force of [[gravity]] and the structure of space and time. The other is [[quantum mechanics]] which is a completely different formulation to describe physical phenomena using the known [[probability]] principles. By the late 1970s, these two frameworks had proven to be sufficient to explain most of the observed features of the [[universe]], from [[elementary particle]]s to [[atom]]s to the evolution of stars and the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker 2007, p. 1"&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these successes, there are still many problems that remain to be solved. One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker 2007, p. 1"/&gt; The general theory of relativity is formulated within the framework of [[classical physics]], whereas the other [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] are described within the framework of quantum mechanics. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the problem of developing a consistent theory of quantum gravity, there are many other fundamental problems in the physics of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], [[black hole]]s, and the early universe.{{efn|For example, physicists are still working to understand the phenomenon of [[quark confinement]], the paradoxes of [[black holes]], and the origin of [[dark energy]].}}

String theory is a [[mathematical theory|theoretical framework]] that attempts to address these questions and many others. The starting point for string theory is the idea that the [[point particle|point-like particles]] of [[particle physics]] can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called [[string (physics)|strings]]. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, there is only one kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as [[vibrating strings]]. In string theory, one of the vibrational states of the string gives rise to the [[graviton]], a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker 2007, pp. 2"&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main developments of the past several decades in string theory was the discovery of certain "dualities", mathematical transformations that identify one physical theory with another. Physicists studying string theory have discovered a number of these dualities between different versions of string theory, and this has led to the conjecture that all consistent versions of string theory are subsumed in a single framework known as [[M-theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 9–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of string theory have also yielded a number of results on the nature of black holes and the gravitational interaction. There are certain paradoxes that arise when one attempts to understand the quantum aspects of black holes, and work on string theory has attempted to clarify these issues. In late 1997 this line of work culminated in the discovery of the [[anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence]] or AdS/CFT.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; This is a theoretical result which relates string theory to other physical theories which are better understood theoretically. The AdS/CFT correspondence has implications for the study of black holes and quantum gravity, and it has been applied to other subjects, including [[nuclear physics|nuclear]]&lt;ref name="Klebanov and Maldacena 2009"&gt;Klebanov and Maldacena 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[condensed matter physics]].&lt;ref name="Merali 2011"&gt;Merali 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachdev 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Since string theory incorporates all of the fundamental interactions, including gravity, many physicists hope that it fully describes our universe, making it a [[theory of everything]]. One of the goals of current research in string theory is to find a solution of the theory that reproduces the observed spectrum of elementary particles, with a small [[cosmological constant]], containing [[dark matter]] and a plausible mechanism for [[cosmic inflation]]. While there has been progress toward these goals, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of details.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 3, 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. The scattering of strings is most straightforwardly defined using the techniques of [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], but it is not known in general how to define string theory [[Non-perturbative|nonperturbatively]].&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not clear whether there is any principle by which string theory selects its [[vacuum state]], the physical state that determines the properties of our universe.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; These problems have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to the unification of physics and question the value of continued research on these problems.&lt;ref name="Woit 2006"&gt;Woit 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strings===
{{main|String (physics)}}

[[Image:World lines and world sheet.svg|left|thumb|250px|Interaction in the quantum world: [[worldline]]s of point-like [[particles]] or a [[worldsheet]] swept up by closed [[string (physics)|strings]] in string theory.]]

The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the [[electromagnetic field]], which are extended in space and time, is known as [[quantum field theory]]. In particle physics, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields.&lt;ref name="Zee 2010"&gt;Zee 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of [[perturbation theory]]. Developed by [[Richard Feynman]] and others in the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called [[Feynman diagram]]s to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions.&lt;ref name="Zee 2010"/&gt;

The starting point for string theory is the idea that the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string.&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker 2007, p. 6"&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In theories of particle physics based on string theory, the characteristic length scale of strings is assumed to be on the order of the [[Planck length]], or {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt;}} meters, the scale at which the effects of quantum gravity are believed to become significant.&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker 2007, p. 6"/&gt; On much larger length scales, such as the scales visible in physics laboratories, such objects would be indistinguishable from zero-dimensional point particles, and the vibrational state of the string would determine the type of particle. One of the vibrational states of a string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force.&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker 2007, pp. 2"/&gt;

The original version of string theory was [[bosonic string theory]], but this version described only [[bosons]], a class of particles which transmit forces between the matter particles, or [[fermions]]. Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories called [[superstring theory|superstring theories]]. These theories describe both bosons and fermions, and they incorporate a theoretical idea called [[supersymmetry]]. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between the bosons and fermions. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of superstring theory: [[type I string|type I]], [[type IIA string|type IIA]], [[type IIB string|type IIB]], and two flavors of [[heterotic string]] theory ([[special orthogonal group|{{math|''SO''(32)}}]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|{{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;×''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. For example, the type I theory includes both open strings (which are segments with endpoints) and closed strings (which form closed loops), while types IIA, IIB and heterotic include only closed strings.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Number of dimensions}}Extra dimensions===

[[File:Compactification example.svg|right|thumb|alt=A tubular surface and corresponding one-dimensional curve.|An example of [[compactification (physics)|compactification]]: At large distances, a two dimensional surface with one circular dimension looks one-dimensional.]]

In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and length. Einstein's general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional [[spacetime]]. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of the geometry of spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 1984, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the fact that the universe is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily.{{efn|For example, in the context of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], theorists often formulate and study theories of gravity in unphysical numbers of spacetime dimensions.}} There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics.&lt;ref&gt;Zee 2010, Parts V and VI&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable feature of string theories is that these theories require [[extra dimensions]] of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In bosonic string theory, spacetime is 26-dimensional, while in superstring theory it is 10-dimensional, and in [[M-theory]] it is 11-dimensional. In order to describe real physical phenomena using string theory, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Calabi yau.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Visualization of a complex mathematical surface with many convolutions and self intersections.|A cross section of a quintic [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] ]]

[[Compactification (physics)|Compactification]] is one way of modifying the number of dimensions in a physical theory. In compactification, some of the extra dimensions are assumed to "close up" on themselves to form circles.&lt;ref name="Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6"&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Greene 2000, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Compactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]].&lt;ref name="Yau and Nadis 2010, Ch. 6"/&gt; A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special [[topological space|space]] which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians [[Eugenio Calabi]] and [[Shing-Tung Yau]].&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to reducing the number of dimensions is the so-called [[brane cosmology|brane-world]] scenario. In this approach, physicists assume that the observable universe is a four-dimensional subspace of a higher dimensional space. In such models, the force-carrying bosons of particle physics arise from open strings with endpoints attached to the four-dimensional subspace, while gravity arises from closed strings propagating through the larger ambient space. This idea plays an important role in attempts to develop models of real world physics based on string theory, and it provides a natural explanation for the weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces.&lt;ref&gt;Randall and Sundrum 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dualities===

[[File:StringTheoryDualities.svg|right|thumb|alt=A diagram indicating the relationships between M-theory and the five superstring theories.|250px|A diagram of string theory dualities. Yellow arrows indicate [[S-duality]]. Blue arrows indicate [[T-duality]].]]

{{main|S-duality|T-duality}}

One notable fact about string theory is that the different versions of the theory all turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways. One of the relationships that can exist between different string theories is called [[S-duality]]. This is a relationship which says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can, in some cases, be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory. Roughly speaking, a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently. Type I string theory turns out to be equivalent by S-duality to the {{math|''SO''(32)}} heterotic string theory. Similarly, type IIB string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by S-duality.&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007"&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relationship between different string theories is [[T-duality]]. Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension. T-duality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius {{math|''R''}} is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius {{math|1/''R''}} in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has [[momentum]] as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the [[winding number]]. If a string has momentum {{math|''p''}} and winding number {{math|''n''}} in one description, it will have momentum {{math|''n''}} and winding number {{math|''p''}} in the dual description. For example, type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality, and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by T-duality.&lt;ref name="Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007"/&gt;

In general, the term ''duality'' refers to a situation where two seemingly different [[physical system]]s turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. Two theories related by a duality need not be string theories. For example, [[Montonen–Olive duality]] is example of an S-duality relationship between quantum field theories. The AdS/CFT correspondence is example of a duality which relates string theory to a quantum field theory. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be ''dual'' to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Branes ===
{{main|Brane}}
[[File:D3-brane et D2-brane.PNG|thumb|right|alt=A pair of surfaces joined by wavy line segments.|Open strings attached to a pair of [[D-brane]]s.]]

In string theory and other related theories, a [[brane]] is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions. For instance, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. In dimension ''p'', these are called ''p''-branes. The word brane comes from the word "membrane" which refers to a two-dimensional brane.&lt;ref name="Moore 2005, p. 214"&gt;Moore 2005, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics. They have mass and can have other attributes such as charge. A ''p''-brane sweeps out a (''p''+1)-dimensional volume in spacetime called its ''worldvolume''. Physicists often study [[field (physics)|fields]] analogous to the electromagnetic field which live on the worldvolume of a brane.&lt;ref name="Moore 2005, p. 214"/&gt;

In string theory, [[D-brane]]s are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane. The letter "D" in D-brane refers to a certain mathematical condition on the system known as the [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]. The study of D-branes in string theory has led to important results such as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which has shed light on many problems in quantum field theory.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2005, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Branes are frequently studied from a purely mathematical point of view, and they are described as objects of certain [[category (mathematics)|categories]], such as the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on a [[complex algebraic variety]], or the [[Fukaya category]] of a [[symplectic manifold]].&lt;ref name="Aspinwall et al. 2009"&gt;Aspinwall et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between the physical notion of a brane and the mathematical notion of a category has led to important mathematical insights in the fields of [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] and [[symplectic geometry]] &lt;ref name="Kontsevich 1995"&gt;Kontsevich 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and [[representation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Kapustin and Witten 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==M-theory==

{{main|M-theory}}

Prior to 1995, theorists believed that there were five consistent versions of superstring theory (type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two versions of heterotic string theory). This understanding changed in 1995 when [[Edward Witten]] suggested that the five theories were just special limiting cases of an eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory. Witten's conjecture was based on the work of a number of other physicists, including [[Ashoke Sen]], [[Chris Hull]], [[Paul Townsend]], and [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]]. His announcement led to a flurry of research activity now known as the [[second superstring revolution]].&lt;ref name="Duff 1998"&gt;Duff 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unification of superstring theories===

[[File:Limits of M-theory.svg|right|350px|thumb|alt=A star-shaped diagram with the various limits of M-theory labeled at its six vertices.|A schematic illustration of the relationship between [[M-theory]], the five [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], and eleven-dimensional [[supergravity]]. The shaded region represents a family of different physical scenarios that are possible in M-theory. In certain limiting cases corresponding to the cusps, it is natural to describe the physics using one of the six theories labeled there.]]

In the 1970s, many physicists became interested in [[supergravity]] theories, which combine general relativity with supersymmetry. Whereas general relativity makes sense in any number of dimensions, supergravity places an upper limit on the number of dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Duff 1998, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, work by [[Werner Nahm]] showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven.&lt;ref&gt;Nahm 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Eugene Cremmer]], [[Bernard Julia]], and [[Joel Scherk]] of the [[École Normale Supérieure]] showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Cremmer, Julia, and Scherk 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duff 1998, p. 65"&gt;Duff 1998, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, many physicists hoped that by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, it might be possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as [[chirality (physics)|chirality]]. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.&lt;ref name="Duff 1998, p. 65"/&gt;

In the [[first superstring revolution]] in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects.&lt;ref name="Duff 1998, p. 65"/&gt; Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.&lt;ref name="Duff 1998, p. 65"/&gt;

Although there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation.&lt;ref name="Duff 1998, p. 65"/&gt; However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways. They found that a system of strongly interacting strings can, in some cases, be viewed as a system of weakly interacting strings. This phenomenon is known as S-duality. It was studied by Ashoke Sen in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions&lt;ref&gt;Sen 1994a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen 1994b&lt;/ref&gt; and by Chris Hull and Paul Townsend in the context of the type IIB theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hull and Townsend 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Duff 1998, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, as many physicists were studying the properties of strings, a small group of physicists was examining the possible applications of higher dimensional objects. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes.&lt;ref&gt;Bergshoeff, Sezgin, and Townsend 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, [[Michael Duff (physicist)|Michael Duff]], Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity with one of the dimensions curled up into a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Duff et al. 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.&lt;ref&gt;Duff 1998, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at a string theory conference in 1995, Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality and the appearance of higher dimensional branes in string theory.&lt;ref&gt;Witten 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming different parts of his proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Duff 1998, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, some physicists suggested that the new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes, but Witten was skeptical of the role of membranes in the theory. In a paper from 1996, Hořava and Witten wrote "As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation, we will non-committally call it the M-theory, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes."&lt;ref&gt;Hořava and Witten 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of an understanding of the true meaning and structure of M-theory, Witten has suggested that the ''M'' should stand for "magic", "mystery", or "membrane" according to taste, and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known.&lt;ref&gt;Duff 1996, sec. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matrix theory===

{{main|Matrix theory (physics)}}

In mathematics, a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a rectangular array of numbers or other data. In physics, a [[matrix theory (physics)|matrix model]] is a particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="Banks et al. 1997"&gt;Banks et al. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

One important example of a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], [[Stephen Shenker]], and [[Leonard Susskind]] in 1997. This theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.&lt;ref name="Banks et al. 1997"/&gt;

The development of the matrix model formulation of M-theory has led physicists to consider various connections between string theory and a branch of mathematics called [[noncommutative geometry]]. This subject is a generalization of ordinary geometry in which mathematicians define new geometric notions using tools from [[noncommutative algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Connes 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In a paper from 1998, [[Alain Connes]], [[Michael R. Douglas]], and [[Albert Schwarz]] showed that some aspects of matrix models and M-theory are described by a [[noncommutative quantum field theory]], a special kind of physical theory in which spacetime is described mathematically using noncommutative geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Connes, Douglas, and Schwarz 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.&lt;ref&gt;Nekrasov and Schwarz 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seiberg and Witten 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black holes==

In general relativity, a black hole is defined as a region of spacetime in which the gravitational field is so strong that no particle or radiation can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, black holes are thought to arise when massive stars undergo [[gravitational collapse]], and many [[galaxies]] are thought to contain [[supermassive black hole]]s at their centers. Black holes are also important for theoretical reasons, as they present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum aspects of gravity. String theory has proved to be an important tool for investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a framework in which theorists can study their [[black hole thermodynamics|thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="de Haro et al. 2013, p.2"/&gt;

===Bekenstein–Hawking formula===

In the branch of physics called [[statistical mechanics]], [[entropy]] is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a physical system. This concept was studied in the 1870s by the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], who showed that the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of a [[gas]] could be derived from the combined properties of its many constituent [[molecule]]s. Boltzmann argued that by averaging the behaviors of all the different molecules in a gas, one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume, temperature, and pressure. In addition, this perspective led him to give a precise definition of entropy as the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of different states of the molecules (also called ''microstates'') that give rise to the same macroscopic features.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, physicists began to apply the same concepts to black holes. In most systems such as gases, the entropy scales with the volume. In the 1970s, the physicist [[Jacob Bekenstein]] suggested that the entropy of a black hole is instead proportional to the ''surface area'' of its [[event horizon]], the boundary beyond which matter and radiation is lost to its gravitational attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Bekenstein 1973&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with ideas of the physicist [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref name="Hawking 1975"&gt;Hawking 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bekenstein's work yielded a precise formula for the entropy of a black hole. The [[Bekenstein–Hawking formula]] expresses the entropy {{math|''S''}} as

:&lt;math&gt;S= \frac{c^3kA}{4\hbar G}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], {{math|''k''}} is [[Boltzmann's constant]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''G''}} is [[Newton's constant]], and {{math|''A''}} is the surface area of the event horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Wald 1984, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any physical system, a black hole has an entropy defined in terms of the number of different microstates that lead to the same macroscopic features. The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula gives the expected value of the entropy of a black hole, but by the 1990s, physicists still lacked a derivation of this formula by counting microstates in a theory of quantum gravity. Finding such a derivation of this formula was considered an important test of the viability of any theory of quantum gravity such as string theory.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivation within string theory===

In a paper from 1996, [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] showed how to derive the Beckenstein–Hawking formula for certain black holes in string theory.&lt;ref name="Strominger and Vafa 1996"&gt;Strominger and Vafa 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Their calculation was based on the observation that D-branes—which look like fluctuating membranes when they are weakly interacting—become dense, massive objects with event horizons when the interactions are strong. In other words, a system of strongly interacting D-branes in string theory is indistinguishable from a black hole. Strominger and Vafa analyzed such D-brane systems and calculated the number of different ways of placing D-branes in spacetime so that their combined mass and charge is equal to a given mass and charge for the resulting black hole. Their calculation reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking formula exactly, including the factor of {{math|1/4}}.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 190–192&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work by Strominger, Vafa, and others refined the original calculations and gave the precise values of the "quantum corrections" needed to describe very small black holes.&lt;ref&gt;Maldacena, Strominger, and Witten 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ooguri, Strominger, and Vafa 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The black holes that Strominger and Vafa considered in their original work were quite different from real astrophysical black holes. One difference was that Strominger and Vafa considered only [[extremal black hole]]s in order to make the calculation tractable. These are defined as black holes with the lowest possible mass compatible with a given charge.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt; Strominger and Vafa also restricted attention to black holes in five-dimensional spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was originally developed in this very particular and physically unrealistic context in string theory, the entropy calculation of Strominger and Vafa has led to a qualitative understanding of how black hole entropy can be accounted for in any theory of quantum gravity. Indeed, in 1998, Strominger argued that the original result could be generalized to an arbitrary consistent theory of quantum gravity without relying on strings or supersymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Strominger 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with several other authors in 2010, he showed that some results on black hole entropy could be extended to non-extremal astrophysical black holes.&lt;ref&gt;Guica et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Maloney, and Strominger 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==AdS/CFT correspondence==

{{main|AdS/CFT correspondence}}

One approach to formulating string theory and studying its properties is provided by the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. This is a theoretical result which implies that string theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.&lt;ref name="Klebanov and Maldacena 2009"/&gt; The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by [[Juan Maldacena]] in late 1997.&lt;ref name="Maldacena 1998"&gt;Maldacena 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by [[Steven Gubser]], [[Igor Klebanov]], and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gubser, Klebanov, and Polyakov 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and by Edward Witten.&lt;ref name="Witten 1998"&gt;Witten 1998&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, Maldacena's article had over 7000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of [[high energy physics]].{{efn|{{cite web |url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/topcites/2010/eprints/to_hep-th_annual.shtml |title=Top Cited Articles during 2010 in hep-th |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=25 July 2013}}}}

===Overview of the correspondence===

[[Image:Uniform tiling 433-t0 (formatted).svg|thumb|left|alt=A disk tiled by triangles and quadrilaterals which become smaller and smaller near the boundary circle.|A [[tessellation]] of the [[hyperbolic plane]] [[tritetragonal tiling|by triangles and squares]]]]

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain [[vacuum solution]] of [[Einstein's equation]] called [[anti-de Sitter space]].&lt;ref&gt;Klebanov and Maldacena 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the [[metric tensor|metric]]) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. It is closely related to [[hyperbolic space]], which can be viewed as a [[Poincaré disk model|disk]] as illustrated on the left.&lt;ref name="Maldacena 2005, p. 60"&gt;Maldacena 2005, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; This image shows a [[tessellation]] of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.&lt;ref name="Maldacena 2005, p. 61"&gt;Maldacena 2005, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

One can imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.&lt;ref name="Maldacena 2005, p. 60"/&gt; It looks like a solid [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] in which any [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is [[curvature|curved]] in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.&lt;ref name="Maldacena 2005, p. 61"/&gt;

[[File:AdS3.svg|thumb|right|alt=A cylinder formed by stacking copies of the disk illustrated in the previous figure.|350px|Three-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]] is like a stack of [[Poincaré disk model|hyperbolic disks]], each one representing the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting [[spacetime]] looks like a solid [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].]]

This construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space dimensions and one time dimension, but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions. Indeed, hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can "stack up" copies of hyperbolic space to get higher-dimensional models of anti-de Sitter space.&lt;ref name="Maldacena 2005, p. 60"/&gt;

An important feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder in the case of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, within a small region on the surface around any given point, it looks just like [[Minkowski space]], the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which "spacetime" is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the "spacetime" for a quantum field theory. The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to a gravitational theory, such as string theory, in the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a "dictionary" for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.&lt;ref&gt;Maldacena 2005, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications to quantum gravity===

The discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence was a major advance in physicists' understanding of string theory and quantum gravity. One reason for this is that the correspondence provides a formulation of string theory in terms of quantum field theory, which is well understood by comparison. Another reason is that it provides a general framework in which physicists can study and attempt to resolve the paradoxes of black holes.&lt;ref name="de Haro et al. 2013, p.2"&gt;de Haro et al. 2013, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Stephen Hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the [[event horizon]].&lt;ref name="Hawking 1975"/&gt; At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict with one of the basic [[postulates of quantum mechanics]], which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the [[Schrödinger equation]]. This property is usually referred to as [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]] of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the [[black hole information paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Susskind 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The AdS/CFT correspondence resolves the black hole information paradox, at least to some extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space.&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so the black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Maldacena 2005, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.&lt;ref&gt;Hawking 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications to nuclear physics===

{{main|AdS/QCD correspondence}}

[[File:Meissner effect p1390048.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A magnet levitating over a superconducting material.|A [[magnet]] [[Meissner effect|levitating]] above a [[high-temperature superconductor]]. Today some physicists are working to understand high-temperature superconductivity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.&lt;ref name="Merali 2011"/&gt;]]

In addition to its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity, the AdS/CFT correspondence has been applied to a variety of problems in quantum field theory. One physical system that has been studied using the AdS/CFT correspondence is the [[quark–gluon plasma]], an exotic [[state of matter]] produced in [[particle accelerator]]s. This state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy [[ions]] such as [[gold]] or [[lead]] nuclei are collided at high energies. Such collisions cause the [[quarks]] that make up atomic nuclei to [[deconfinement|deconfine]] at temperatures of approximately two [[1,000,000,000,000|trillion]] [[kelvin]]s, conditions similar to those present at around {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;}} seconds after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;Zwiebach 2009, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

The physics of the quark–gluon plasma is governed by a theory called [[quantum chromodynamics]], but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving the quark–gluon plasma.{{efn|More precisely, one cannot apply the methods of perturbative quantum field theory.}} In an article appearing in 2005, [[Đàm Thanh Sơn]] and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence could be used to understand some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory.&lt;ref name="Kovtun, Son, and Starinets 2001"&gt;Kovtun, Son, and Starinets 2001&lt;/ref&gt; By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, Sơn and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark–gluon plasma, the [[shear viscosity]] and volume density of entropy, should be approximately equal to a certain universal [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]. In 2008, the predicted value of this ratio for the quark–gluon plasma was confirmed at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Merali 2011, p. 303"&gt;Merali 2011, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luzum and Romatschke 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications to condensed matter physics===

{{main|AdS/CMT correspondence}}

The AdS/CFT correspondence has also been used to study aspects of condensed matter physics. Over the decades, [[experimental physics|experimental]] condensed matter physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter, including [[superconductors]] and [[superfluids]]. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including [[Subir Sachdev]] hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.&lt;ref name="Merali 2011, p. 303"/&gt;

So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]. A superfluid is a system of [[electrically neutral]] [[atoms]] that flows without any [[friction]]. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using [[liquid helium]], but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing [[lasers]]. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the [[temperature]] and on [[Planck's constant]], the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other [[phase (matter)|phases]]. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.&lt;ref name="Sachdev 2013, p.51"&gt;Sachdev 2013, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomenology==

{{main|String phenomenology}}

In addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, string theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity and particle physics. [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|Phenomenology]] is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. [[String phenomenology]] is the part of string theory that attempts to construct realistic or semi-realistic models based on string theory.

Partly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because of the extremely high energies needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.&lt;ref name="Woit 2006"/&gt;

===Particle physics===

The currently accepted theory describing elementary particles and their interactions is known as the [[standard model of particle physics]]. This theory provides a unified description of three of the fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Despite its remarkable success in explaining a wide range of physical phenomena, the standard model cannot be a complete description of reality. This is because the standard model fails to incorporate the force of gravity and because of problems such as the [[hierarchy problem]] and the inability to explain the structure of fermion masses or dark matter.

String theory has been used to construct a variety of models of particle physics going beyond the standard model. Typically, such models are based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, physicists postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles.&lt;ref&gt;Candelas et al. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. Such compactifications offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct realistic or semi-realistic models of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 147–150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===

{{main|String cosmology}}

[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|right|300px|A map of the [[cosmic microwave background]] produced by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]]]]

The Big Bang theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. Despite its success in explaining many observed features of the universe including galactic [[redshift]]s, the relative abundance of light elements such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], and the existence of a [[cosmic microwave background]], there are several questions that remain unanswered. For example, the standard Big Bang model does not explain why the universe appears to be same in all directions, why it appears flat on very large distance scales, or why certain hypothesized particles such as [[magnetic monopoles]] are not observed in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 530–531&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the leading candidate for a theory going beyond the Big Bang is the theory of cosmic inflation. Developed by [[Alan Guth]] and others in the 1980s, inflation postulates a period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion of the universe prior to the expansion described by the standard Big Bang theory. The theory of cosmic inflation preserves the successes of the Big Bang while providing a natural explanation for some of the mysterious features of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 531&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has also received striking support from observations of the cosmic microwave background, the radiation that has filled the sky since around 380,000 years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 538&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theory of inflation, the rapid initial expansion of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the [[inflaton]]. The exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from a more fundamental theory such as string theory.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there have been a number of attempts to identify an inflaton within the spectrum of particles described by string theory, and to study inflation using string theory. While these approaches might eventually find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Becker, and Schwarz 2007, pp. 539–543&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to mathematics==

In addition to influencing research in [[theoretical physics]], string theory has stimulated a number of major developments in [[pure mathematics]]. Like many developing ideas in theoretical physics, string theory does not at present have a [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] formulation in which all of its concepts can be defined precisely. As a result, physicists who study string theory are often guided by physical intuition to conjecture relationships between the seemingly different mathematical structures that are used to formalize different parts of the theory. These conjectures are later proved by mathematicians, and in this way, string theory serves as a source of new ideas in pure mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Deligne et al. 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirror symmetry===

{{main|Mirror symmetry (string theory)}}

[[File:Clebsch Cublic.png|thumb|right|alt=A complex mathematical surface in three dimensions.|The [[Clebsch cubic]] is an example of a kind of geometric object called an [[algebraic variety]]. A classical result of [[enumerative geometry]] states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on this surface.]]

After Calabi–Yau manifolds had entered physics as a way to compactify extra dimensions in string theory, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, several physicists noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold.&lt;ref&gt;Hori et al. 2003, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, two different versions of string theory, type IIA and type IIB, can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Aspinwall et al. 2009, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of whether Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct description of nature, the existence of the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in [[enumerative geometry]], a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions.&lt;ref name="Aspinwall et al. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hori et al. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Enumerative geometry studies a class of geometric objects called [[algebraic varieties]] which are defined by the vanishing of [[polynomial]]s. For example, the [[Clebsch cubic]] illustrated on the right is an algebraic variety defined using a certain polynomial of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[George Salmon]] states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Generalizing this problem, one can ask how many lines can be drawn on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, such as the one illustrated above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician [[Hermann Schubert]], who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 1991, most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish.&lt;ref name="Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169"&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists [[Philip Candelas]], [[Xenia de la Ossa]], Paul Green, and Linda Parks showed that mirror symmetry could be used to translate difficult mathematical questions about one Calabi–Yau manifold into easier questions about its mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Candelas et al. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they used mirror symmetry to show that a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of degree three.&lt;ref name="Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 169"/&gt; In addition to counting degree-three curves, Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, these results of Candelas were justified on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally prefer rigorous proofs that do not require an appeal to physical intuition. Inspired by physicists' work on mirror symmetry, mathematicians have therefore constructed their own arguments proving the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry.{{efn|Two independent mathematical proofs of mirror symmetry were given by Givental 1996, 1998 and Lian, Liu, Yau 1997, 1999, 2000.}} Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Hori et al. 2003, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the [[homological mirror symmetry]] program of [[Maxim Kontsevich]]&lt;ref name="Kontsevich 1995"/&gt; and the [[SYZ conjecture]] of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and [[Eric Zaslow]].&lt;ref&gt;Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monstrous moonshine===

{{main|Monstrous moonshine}}

[[File:Labeled Triangle Reflections.svg|left|thumb|200px|alt=An equilateral triangle with a line joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side|An equilateral triangle can be rotated through 120°, 240°, or 360°, or reflected in any of the three lines pictured without changing its shape.]]

[[Group theory]] is the branch of mathematics that studies the concept of [[symmetry]]. For example, one can consider a geometric shape such as an equilateral triangle. There are various operations that one can perform on this triangle without changing its shape. One can rotate it through 120°, 240°, or 360°, or one can reflect in any of the lines labeled {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the picture. Each of these operations is called a ''symmetry'', and the collection of these symmetries satisfies certain technical properties making it into what mathematicians call a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. In this particular example, the group is known as the [[dihedral group]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] 6 because it has six elements. A general group may describe finitely many or infinitely many symmetries; if there are only finitely many symmetries, it is called a [[finite group]].&lt;ref&gt;Dummit and Foote 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians often strive for a [[classification theorems|classification]] (or list) of all mathematical objects of a given type. It is generally believed that finite groups are too diverse to admit a useful classification. A more modest but still challenging problem is to classify all finite ''simple'' groups. These are finite groups which may be used as building blocks for constructing arbitrary finite groups in the same way that [[prime number]]s can be used to construct arbitrary [[Integer|whole number]]s by taking products.{{efn|More precisely, a nontrivial group is called ''[[simple group|simple]]'' if its only [[normal subgroup]]s are the [[trivial group]] and the group itself. The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.}} One of the major achievements of contemporary group theory is the [[classification of finite simple groups]], a mathematical theorem which provides a list of all possible finite simple groups.&lt;ref&gt;Dummit and Foote 2004, pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

This classification theorem identifies several infinite families of groups as well as 26 additional groups which do not fit into any family. The latter groups are called the "sporadic" groups, and each one owes its existence to a remarkable combination of circumstances. The largest sporadic group, the so-called [[monster group]], has over {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;}} elements, more than a thousand times the number of atoms in the Earth.&lt;ref name="Klarreich 2015"&gt;Klarreich 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KleinInvariantJ.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A graph of the [[j-invariant|{{math|''j''}}-function]] in the complex plane]]

A seemingly unrelated construction is the [[j-invariant|{{math|''j''}}-function]] of [[number theory]]. This object belongs to a special class of functions called [[modular function]]s, whose graphs form a certain kind of repeating pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon 2006, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which seems very different from the theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]] and [[John G. Thompson|John Thompson]] noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its [[irreducible representation]]s) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the {{math|''j''}}-function (namely, the coefficients of its [[Fourier series]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gannon 2006, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship was further developed by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Simon P. Norton|Simon Norton]]&lt;ref&gt;Conway and Norton 1979&lt;/ref&gt; who called it [[monstrous moonshine]] because it seemed so far fetched.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon 2006, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Richard Borcherds]] constructed a bridge between the theory of modular functions and finite groups and, in the process, explained the observations of McKay and Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon 2006, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borcherds 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Borcherds' work used ideas from string theory in an essential way, extending earlier results of [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]], who had realized the monster group as the symmetries of a particular{{which|date=February 2016}} version of string theory.&lt;ref&gt;Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Borcherds was awarded the [[Fields medal]] for his work.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon 2006, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, the connection between string theory and moonshine has led to further results in mathematics and physics.&lt;ref name="Klarreich 2015"/&gt; In 2010, physicists Tohru Eguchi, [[Hirosi Ooguri]], and [[Yuji Tachikawa]] discovered connections between a different sporadic group, the [[Mathieu group M24|Mathieu group {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], and a certain version{{which|date=November 2016}} of string theory.&lt;ref&gt;Eguchi, Ooguri, and Tachikawa 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miranda Cheng]], John Duncan, and [[Jeffrey A. Harvey]] proposed a generalization of this moonshine phenomenon called [[umbral moonshine]],&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Duncan, and Harvey 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and their conjecture was proved mathematically by Duncan, Michael Griffin, and [[Ken Ono]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Griffin, and Ono 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Witten has also speculated that the version of string theory appearing in monstrous moonshine might be related to a certain simplified model of gravity in three spacetime dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Witten 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Main|History of string theory}}

===Early results===

Some of the structures reintroduced by string theory arose for the first time much earlier as part of the program of classical unification started by [[Albert Einstein]]. The first person to add a [[Five-dimensional space|fifth dimension]] to a theory of gravity was [[Gunnar Nordström]] in 1914, who noted that gravity in five dimensions describes both gravity and electromagnetism in four. Nordström attempted to unify electromagnetism with [[Nordström's theory of gravitation|his theory of gravitation]], which was however superseded by Einstein's general relativity in 1919. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] combined the fifth dimension with [[general relativity]], and only Kaluza is usually credited with the idea. In 1926, the Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza–Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of the unobservable extra dimension—it is wrapped into a small circle. Einstein introduced a [[Antisymmetric tensor|non-symmetric]] [[metric tensor]], while much later Brans and Dicke added a scalar component to gravity. These ideas would be revived within string theory, where they are demanded by consistency conditions.

[[File:LeonardSusskindStanford2009 cropped.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Leonard Susskind]]]]

String theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a never completely successful theory of [[hadron]]s, the [[subatomic particle]]s like the [[proton]] and [[neutron]] that feel the [[strong interaction]]. In the 1960s, [[Geoffrey Chew]] and [[Steven Frautschi]] discovered that the [[meson]]s make families called [[Regge trajectories]] with masses related to spins in a way that was later understood by [[Yoichiro Nambu]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] to be the relationship expected from rotating strings. Chew advocated making a theory for the interactions of these trajectories that did not presume that they were composed of any fundamental particles, but would construct their interactions from [[bootstrap model|self-consistency conditions]] on the [[S-matrix]]. The [[S-matrix theory|S-matrix approach]] was started by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in the 1940s as a way of constructing a theory that did not rely on the local notions of space and time, which Heisenberg believed break down at the nuclear scale. While the scale was off by many orders of magnitude, the approach he advocated was ideally suited for a theory of quantum gravity.

Working with experimental data, R. Dolen, D. Horn and C. Schmid developed some sum rules for hadron exchange. When a particle and [[antiparticle]] scatter, virtual particles can be exchanged in two qualitatively different ways. In the s-channel, the two particles annihilate to make temporary intermediate states that fall apart into the final state particles. In the t-channel, the particles exchange intermediate states by emission and absorption. In field theory, the two contributions add together, one giving a continuous background contribution, the other giving peaks at certain energies. In the data, it was clear that the peaks were stealing from the background—the authors interpreted this as saying that the t-channel contribution was dual to the s-channel one, meaning both described the whole amplitude and included the other.

[[File:GabrieleVeneziano.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Gabriele Veneziano]]]]

The result was widely advertised by [[Murray Gell-Mann]], leading [[Gabriele Veneziano]] to construct a [[Veneziano scattering amplitude|scattering amplitude]] that had the property of Dolen–Horn–Schmid duality, later renamed world-sheet duality. The amplitude needed poles where the particles appear, on straight line trajectories, and there is a special mathematical function whose poles are evenly spaced on half the real line—the [[gamma function]]— which was widely used in Regge theory. By manipulating combinations of gamma functions, Veneziano was able to find a consistent scattering amplitude with poles on straight lines, with mostly positive residues, which obeyed duality and had the appropriate Regge scaling at high energy. The amplitude could fit near-beam scattering data as well as other Regge type fits, and had a suggestive integral representation that could be used for generalization.

Over the next years, hundreds of physicists worked to complete the [[Bootstrap model|bootstrap program]] for this model, with many surprises. Veneziano himself discovered that for the scattering amplitude to describe the scattering of a particle that appears in the theory, an obvious self-consistency condition, the lightest particle must be a [[tachyon]]. [[Miguel Ángel Virasoro (physicist)|Miguel Virasoro]] and Joel Shapiro found a different amplitude now understood to be that of closed strings, while [[Ziro Koba]] and [[Holger Bech Nielsen|Holger Nielsen]] generalized Veneziano's integral representation to multiparticle scattering. Veneziano and [[Sergio Fubini]] introduced an operator formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes that was a forerunner of [[world-sheet conformal theory]], while Virasoro understood how to remove the poles with wrong-sign residues using a constraint on the states. [[Claud Lovelace]] calculated a loop amplitude, and noted that there is an inconsistency unless the dimension of the theory is 26. [[Charles Thorn]], [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]] and [[Richard Brower]] went on to prove that there are no wrong-sign propagating states in dimensions less than or equal to 26.

In 1969–70, [[Yoichiro Nambu]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]], and [[Leonard Susskind]] recognized that the theory could be given a description in space and time in terms of strings. The scattering amplitudes were derived systematically from the action principle by [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]], [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], [[Claudio Rebbi]], and [[Charles Thorn]], giving a space-time picture to the vertex operators introduced by Veneziano and Fubini and a geometrical interpretation to the [[Virasoro algebra|Virasoro conditions]].

In 1971, [[Pierre Ramond]] added fermions to the model, which led him to formulate a two-dimensional supersymmetry to cancel the wrong-sign states. [[John Henry Schwarz|John Schwarz]] and [[André Neveu]] added another sector to the fermi theory a short time later. In the fermion theories, the critical dimension was 10. [[Stanley Mandelstam]] formulated a world sheet conformal theory for both the bose and fermi case, giving a two-dimensional field theoretic path-integral to generate the operator formalism. [[Michio Kaku]] and [[Keiji Kikkawa]] gave a different formulation of the bosonic string, as a [[string field theory]], with infinitely many particle types and with fields taking values not on points, but on loops and curves.

In 1974, [[Tamiaki Yoneya]] discovered that all the known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct [[Ward identities]] to be a graviton. John Schwarz and [[Joel Scherk]] came to the same conclusion and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, [[quantum chromodynamics]] was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the [[dustbin of history]].

String theory eventually made it out of the dustbin, but for the following decade all work on the theory was completely ignored. Still, the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks to the work of a handful of devotees. [[Ferdinando Gliozzi]], Joel Scherk, and [[David Olive]] realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-strings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined. The resulting theory did not have a tachyon, and was proven to have space-time supersymmetry by John Schwarz and [[Michael Green (physicist)|Michael Green]] in 1984. The same year, [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]] gave the theory a modern path integral formulation, and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively. In 1979, [[Daniel Friedan]] showed that the equations of motions of string theory, which are generalizations of the [[Einstein equations]] of [[general relativity]], emerge from the [[renormalization group]] equations for the two-dimensional field theory. Schwarz and Green discovered T-duality, and constructed two superstring theories—IIA and IIB related by T-duality, and type I theories with open strings. The consistency conditions had been so strong, that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined, with only a few discrete choices.

===First superstring revolution===

[[File:Edward Witten.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Edward Witten]]]]

In the early 1980s, [[Edward Witten]] discovered that most theories of quantum gravity could not accommodate [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] fermions like the neutrino. This led him, in collaboration with [[Luis Álvarez-Gaumé]], to study violations of the conservation laws in gravity theories with [[Gravitational anomaly|anomalies]], concluding that type I string theories were inconsistent. Green and Schwarz discovered a contribution to the anomaly that Witten and Alvarez-Gaumé had missed, which restricted the gauge group of the type I string theory to be SO(32). In coming to understand this calculation, Edward Witten became convinced that string theory was truly a consistent theory of gravity, and he became a high-profile advocate. Following Witten's lead, between 1984 and 1986, hundreds of physicists started to work in this field, and this is sometimes called the [[first superstring revolution]].

During this period, [[David Gross]], [[Jeffrey A. Harvey|Jeffrey Harvey]], [[Emil Martinec]], and [[Ryan Rohm]] discovered [[heterotic strings]]. The gauge group of these closed strings was two copies of [[E8 (mathematics)|E8]], and either copy could easily and naturally include the standard model. [[Philip Candelas]], [[Gary Horowitz]], [[Andrew Strominger]] and Edward Witten found that the Calabi–Yau manifolds are the compactifications that preserve a realistic amount of supersymmetry, while [[Lance Dixon]] and others worked out the physical properties of [[orbifolds]], distinctive geometrical singularities allowed in string theory. [[Cumrun Vafa]] generalized T-duality from circles to arbitrary manifolds, creating the mathematical field of [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]]. [[Daniel Friedan]], [[Emil Martinec]] and [[Stephen Shenker]] further developed the covariant quantization of the superstring using conformal field theory techniques. [[David Gross]] and [[Vipul Periwal]] discovered that string perturbation theory was divergent. [[Stephen Shenker]] showed it diverged much faster than in field theory suggesting that new non-perturbative objects were missing.

[[File:Joseph Polchinski.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Polchinski]]]]

In the 1990s, [[Joseph Polchinski]] discovered that the theory requires higher-dimensional objects, called [[D-brane]]s and identified these with the black-hole solutions of supergravity. These were understood to be the new objects suggested by the perturbative divergences, and they opened up a new field with rich mathematical structure. It quickly became clear that D-branes and other p-branes, not just strings, formed the matter content of the string theories, and the physical interpretation of the strings and branes was revealed—they are a type of black hole. [[Leonard Susskind]] had incorporated the [[holographic principle]] of [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] into string theory, identifying the long highly excited string states with ordinary thermal black hole states. As suggested by 't Hooft, the fluctuations of the black hole horizon, the world-sheet or world-volume theory, describes not only the degrees of freedom of the black hole, but all nearby objects too.

===Second superstring revolution===

In 1995, at the annual conference of string theorists at the University of Southern California (USC), [[Edward Witten]] gave a speech on string theory that in essence united the five string theories that existed at the time, and giving birth to a new 11-dimensional theory called [[M-theory]]. M-theory was also foreshadowed in the work of [[Paul Townsend]] at approximately the same time. The flurry of activity that began at this time is sometimes called the [[second superstring revolution]].&lt;ref name="Duff 1998"/&gt;

[[Image:JuanMaldacena.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Juan Maldacena]]]]

During this period, [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], [[Stephen Shenker]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] formulated matrix theory, a full holographic description of M-theory using IIA D0 branes.&lt;ref name="Banks et al. 1997"/&gt; This was the first definition of string theory that was fully non-perturbative and a concrete mathematical realization of the [[holographic principle]]. It is an example of a gauge-gravity duality and is now understood to be a special case of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] calculated the entropy of certain configurations of D-branes and found agreement with the semi-classical answer for extreme charged black holes.&lt;ref name="Strominger and Vafa 1996"/&gt; [[Petr Hořava (theorist)|Petr Hořava]] and Witten found the eleven-dimensional formulation of the heterotic string theories, showing that orbifolds solve the chirality problem. Witten noted that the effective description of the physics of D-branes at low energies is by a supersymmetric gauge theory, and found geometrical interpretations of mathematical structures in gauge theory that he and [[Nathan Seiberg]] had earlier discovered in terms of the location of the branes.

In 1997, [[Juan Maldacena]] noted that the low energy excitations of a theory near a black hole consist of objects close to the horizon, which for extreme charged black holes looks like an [[anti-de Sitter space]].&lt;ref name="Maldacena 1998"/&gt; He noted that in this limit the gauge theory describes the string excitations near the branes. So he hypothesized that string theory on a near-horizon extreme-charged black-hole geometry, an anti-de Sitter space times a sphere with flux, is equally well described by the low-energy limiting [[gauge theory]], the [[N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]]. This hypothesis, which is called the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], was further developed by [[Steven Gubser]], [[Igor Klebanov]] and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and by [[Edward Witten]],&lt;ref name="Witten 1998"/&gt; and it is now well-accepted. It is a concrete realization of the [[holographic principle]], which has far-reaching implications for [[black hole]]s, [[Principle of locality|locality]] and [[information]] in physics, as well as the nature of the gravitational interaction.&lt;ref name="de Haro et al. 2013, p.2"/&gt; Through this relationship, string theory has been shown to be related to gauge theories like [[quantum chromodynamics]] and this has led to more quantitative understanding of the behavior of [[hadron]]s, bringing string theory back to its roots.{{Citation needed|reason=see talk on source 84|date=June 2018}}

==Criticism==

===Number of solutions===
{{main|String theory landscape}}

To construct models of particle physics based on string theory, physicists typically begin by specifying a shape for the extra dimensions of spacetime. Each of these different shapes corresponds to a different possible universe, or "vacuum state", with a different collection of particles and forces. String theory as it is currently understood has an enormous number of vacuum states, typically estimated to be around {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and these might be sufficiently diverse to accommodate almost any phenomena that might be observed at low energies.&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, pp. 240–242&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics of string theory have expressed concerns about the large number of possible universes described by string theory. In his book ''Not Even Wrong'', [[Peter Woit]], a lecturer in the mathematics department at [[Columbia University]], has argued that the large number of different physical scenarios renders string theory vacuous as a framework for constructing models of particle physics. According to Woit,

{{quote|The possible existence of, say, {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt;}} consistent different vacuum states for superstring theory probably destroys the hope of using the theory to predict anything. If one picks among this large set just those states whose properties agree with present experimental observations, it is likely there still will be such a large number of these that one can get just about whatever value one wants for the results of any new observation.&lt;ref name="Woit 2006, p. 242"&gt;Woit 2006, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some physicists believe this large number of solutions is actually a virtue because it may allow a natural anthropic explanation of the observed values of [[physical constant]]s, in particular the small value of the cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="Woit 2006, p. 242"/&gt; The [[anthropic principle]] is the idea that some of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics are not fixed by any fundamental principle but must be compatible with the evolution of intelligent life. In 1987, [[Steven Weinberg]] published an article in which he argued that the cosmological constant could not have been too large, or else [[galaxy|galaxies]] and intelligent life would not have been able to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg suggested that there might be a huge number of possible consistent universes, each with a different value of the cosmological constant, and observations indicate a small value of the cosmological constant only because humans happen to live in a universe that has allowed intelligent life, and hence observers, to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

String theorist Leonard Susskind has argued that string theory provides a natural anthropic explanation of the small value of the cosmological constant.&lt;ref&gt;Susskind 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to Susskind, the different vacuum states of string theory might be realized as different universes within a larger [[multiverse]]. The fact that the observed universe has a small cosmological constant is just a tautological consequence of the fact that a small value is required for life to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent theorists and critics have disagreed with Susskind's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; According to Woit, "in this case [anthropic reasoning] is nothing more than an excuse for failure. Speculative scientific ideas fail not just when they make incorrect predictions, but also when they turn out to be vacuous and incapable of predicting anything."&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background independence===

{{main|Background independence}}

One of the fundamental properties of Einstein's general theory of relativity is that it is [[background independence|background independent]], meaning that the formulation of the theory does not in any way privilege a particular spacetime geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Smolin 2006, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main criticisms of string theory from early on is that it is not manifestly background independent. In string theory, one must typically specify a fixed reference geometry for spacetime, and all other possible geometries are described as perturbations of this fixed one. In his book ''[[The Trouble With Physics]]'', physicist [[Lee Smolin]] of the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] claims that this is the principal weakness of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, saying that string theory has failed to incorporate this important insight from general relativity.&lt;ref&gt;Smolin 2006, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have disagreed with Smolin's characterization of string theory. In a review of Smolin's book, string theorist Joseph Polchinski writes

{{quote|[Smolin] is mistaking an aspect of the mathematical language being used for one of the physics being described. New physical theories are often discovered using a mathematical language that is not the most suitable for them… In string theory it has always been clear that the physics is background-independent even if the language being used is not, and the search for more suitable language continues. Indeed, as Smolin belatedly notes, [AdS/CFT] provides a solution to this problem, one that is unexpected and powerful.&lt;ref name="Polchinski 2007"&gt;Polchinski 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Polchinski notes that an important open problem in quantum gravity is to develop holographic descriptions of gravity which do not require the gravitational field 
to be asymptotically anti-de Sitter.&lt;ref name="Polchinski 2007"/&gt; Smolin has responded by saying that the AdS/CFT correspondence, as it is currently understood, may not be strong enough to resolve all concerns about background independence.{{efn|{{cite web|url=http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/links/on-some-criticisms-of-string-theory/lee-smolins-response |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105234427/http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/links/on-some-criticisms-of-string-theory/lee-smolins-response |archivedate=November 5, 2015 }} Response to review of The Trouble with Physics by Joe Polchinski}}

===Sociology of science===

Since the superstring revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s, string theory has become the dominant paradigm of high energy theoretical physics.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose 2004, p. 1017&lt;/ref&gt; Some string theorists have expressed the view that there does not exist an equally successful alternative theory addressing the deep questions of fundamental physics. In an interview from 1987, [[Nobel laureate]] [[David Gross]] made the following controversial comments about the reasons for the popularity of string theory:

{{quote|The most important [reason] is that there are no other good ideas around. That's what gets most people into it. When people started to get interested in string theory they didn't know anything about it. In fact, the first reaction of most people is that the theory is extremely ugly and unpleasant, at least that was the case a few years ago when the understanding of string theory was much less developed. It was difficult for people to learn about it and to be turned on. So I think the real reason why people have got attracted by it is because there is no other game in town. All other approaches of constructing grand unified theories, which were more conservative to begin with, and only gradually became more and more radical, have failed, and this game hasn't failed yet.&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several other high-profile theorists and commentators have expressed similar views, suggesting that there are no viable alternatives to string theory.&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, Ch. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics of string theory have commented on this state of affairs. In his book criticizing string theory, Peter Woit views the status of string theory research as unhealthy and detrimental to the future of fundamental physics. He argues that the extreme popularity of string theory among theoretical physicists is partly a consequence of the financial structure of academia and the fierce competition for scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;Woit 2006, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] expresses similar views, stating "The often frantic competitiveness that this ease of communication engenders leads to [[bandwagon effect]]s, where researchers fear to be left behind if they do not join in."&lt;ref&gt;Penrose 2004, p. 1018&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose also claims that the technical difficulty of modern physics forces young scientists to rely on the preferences of established researchers, rather than forging new paths of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose 2004, pp. 1019–1020&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Smolin expresses a slightly different position in his critique, claiming that string theory grew out of a tradition of particle physics which discourages speculation about the foundations of physics, while his preferred approach, [[loop quantum gravity]], encourages more radical thinking. According to Smolin,

{{quote|String theory is a powerful, well-motivated idea and deserves much of the work that has been devoted to it. If it has so far failed, the principal reason is that its intrinsic flaws are closely tied to its strengths—and, of course, the story is unfinished, since string theory may well turn out to be part of the truth. The real question is not why we have expended so much energy on string theory but why we haven't expended nearly enough on alternative approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Smolin 2006, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Smolin goes on to offer a number of prescriptions for how scientists might encourage a greater diversity of approaches to quantum gravity research.&lt;ref&gt;Smolin 2006, Ch. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] the symbol &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; has taken the name '''turnstile''' because of its resemblance to a typical [[turnstile]] if viewed from above. It is also referred to as '''tee''' and is often read as "yields", "proves", "satisfies" or "entails". The symbol was first used by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his 1879 book on logic, ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frege|1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Per Martin-Löf]] (1996) analyzes the &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; symbol thus: "...[T]he combination of Frege's {{lang|de|Urteilsstrich}}, judgement stroke [&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;], and {{lang|de|Inhaltsstrich}}, content stroke [—], came to be called the assertion sign."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin-Löf|1996|pp=6, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege's notation for a [[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgement]] of some content {{mvar|A}}
:&lt;math&gt;\vdash A&lt;/math&gt; 
can then be read
:''I know {{mvar|A}} is true''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin-Löf|1996|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same vein, a conditional assertion
:&lt;math&gt;P \vdash Q&lt;/math&gt;
can be read as:
:''From {{mvar|P}}, I know that {{mvar|Q}}''
In [[TeX]], the turnstile symbol &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the command &lt;tt&gt;\vdash&lt;/tt&gt;. In [[Unicode]], the turnstile symbol (&lt;big&gt;⊢&lt;/big&gt;) is called '''right tack''' and is at code point U+22A2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2200.pdf Unicode standard]&lt;/ref&gt; (Code point U+22A6 is named ''assertion sign'' (&lt;big&gt;⊦&lt;/big&gt;).) On a [[typewriter]], a turnstile can be composed from a [[vertical bar]] (|) and a [[dash]] (–). In [[LaTeX]] there is a turnstile package which issues this sign in many ways, and is capable of putting labels below or above it, in the correct places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/turnstile&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==

The turnstile represents a [[binary relation]]. It has several different [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] in different contexts:
* In [[metalogic]], the study of [[formal language]]s; the turnstile represents [[Logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] (or "derivability"). This is to say, that it shows that one string can be [[formal proof|derived]] from another in a single step, according to the [[rule of inference|transformation rules]] (i.e. the [[syntax (logic)|syntax]]) of some given [[formal system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~hammond/ling178-sp06/mathCh6.pdf Chapter 6, Formal Language Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the expression
:&lt;math&gt;P \vdash Q&lt;/math&gt;
:means that {{mvar|Q}} is derivable from {{mvar|P}} in the system.
:Consistent with its use for derivability, a "⊢" followed by an expression without anything preceding it denotes a [[theorem]], which is to say that the expression can be derived from the rules using an [[empty set]] of [[axiom]]s. As such, the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\vdash Q&lt;/math&gt;
:means that {{mvar|Q}} is a theorem in the system.
*In [[proof theory]], the turnstile is used to denote "provability". For example, if {{mvar|T}} is a [[Theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]] and {{mvar|S}} is a particular sentence in the language of the theory then
:&lt;math&gt;T \vdash S&lt;/math&gt;
:means that {{mvar|S}} is [[formal proof|provable]] from {{mvar|T}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Troelstra| Schwichtenberg| 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is demonstrated in the article on [[propositional calculus]].
* In the [[typed lambda calculus]], the turnstile is used to separate typing assumptions from the typing judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/lambdanotes.pdf Peter Selinger, Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[category theory]], a reversed turnstile (&lt;math&gt;\dashv&lt;/math&gt;), as in &lt;math&gt;F \dashv G&lt;/math&gt;, is used to indicate that the [[functor]] {{mvar|F}} is [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]] to the functor {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor adjoint functor in nLab]&lt;/ref&gt; More rarely, a turnstile (&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;). as in &lt;math&gt;F \vdash G&lt;/math&gt;, is used to indicate that the functor {{mvar|F}} is [[adjoint functors|right adjoint]] to the functor {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=FunctorFact |number=750413999649546245 |date=5 July 2016 |title=Functor Fact on Twitter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14330">{{unsolved|mathematics|Do planar graphs have universal point sets of subquadratic size?}}
In [[graph drawing]], a '''universal point set''' of order ''n'' is a set ''S'' of points in the [[Euclidean plane]] with the property that every ''n''-vertex [[planar graph]] has a [[Fáry's theorem|straight-line drawing]] in which the vertices are all placed at points of ''S''.

==Bounds on the size of universal point sets==
[[File:Nested triangle graph grid.svg|thumb|360px|Grid drawing of a [[:en:Nested triangles graph|nested triangles graph]]. In any drawing of this graph, at least half of the triangles must form a nested chain, which requires a bounding box of size at least ''n''/3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n''/3. The layout shown here comes close to this, using size approximately ''n''/3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n''/2]]

When ''n'' is ten or less, there exist universal point sets with exactly ''n'' points, but for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;15 additional points are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cardinal|Hoffmann|Kusters|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have shown that subsets of the [[integer lattice]] of size ''O''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''O''(''n'') are universal. In particular, {{harvtxt|de Fraysseix|Pach|Pollack|1988}} showed that a grid of (2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) points is universal, and {{harvtxt|Schnyder|1990}} reduced this to a triangular subset of an (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) grid, with ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''O''(''n'') points. By modifying the method of de Fraysseix et al., {{harvtxt|Brandenburg|2008}} found an embedding of any planar graph into a triangular subset of the grid consisting of 4''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/9 points. A universal point set in the form of a rectangular grid must have size at least ''n''/3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n''/3&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dolev|Leighton|Trickey|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Chrobak|Karloff|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Demaine|O'Rourke|2002–2012}}. A weaker quadratic lower bound on the grid size needed for planar graph drawing was given earlier by {{harvtxt|Valiant|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but this does not rule out the possibility of smaller universal point sets of other types. The smallest known universal point sets are not based on grids, but are instead constructed from [[superpattern]]s ([[permutation]]s that contain all [[permutation pattern]]s of a given size); the universal point sets constructed in this way have size ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''O''(''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bannister|Cheng|Devanny|Eppstein|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|de Fraysseix|Pach|Pollack|1988}} proved the first nontrivial lower bound on the size of a universal point set, with a bound of the form ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;(&amp;radic;''n''), and {{harvtxt|Chrobak|Karloff|1989}} showed that universal point sets must contain at least 1.098''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''o''(''n'') points. {{harvtxt|Kurowski|2004}} stated an even stronger bound of 1.235''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''o''(''n''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mondal|2012}} claimed that Kurowski's proof was erroneous, but later (after discussion with Jean Cardinal) retracted this claim; see [http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~jyoti/Resources/notes.pdf Explanation Supporting Kurowski's Proof], D. Mondal, updated August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was further improved by {{harvtxt|Scheucher|Schrezenmaier|Steiner|2018}} to 1.293''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''o''(''n'').

Closing the gap between the known linear lower bounds and quadratic upper bounds remains an open problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Demaine|O'Rourke|2002–2012}}; {{harvtxt|Brandenburg|Eppstein|Goodrich|Kobourov|2003}}; {{harvtxt|Mohar|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special classes of graphs==
Subclasses of the planar graphs may, in general, have smaller universal sets (sets of points that allow straight-line drawings of all ''n''-vertex graphs in the subclass) than the full class of planar graphs, and in many cases universal point sets of exactly ''n'' points are possible. For instance, it is not hard to see that every set of ''n'' points in [[convex position]] (forming the vertices of a convex polygon) is universal for the ''n''-vertex [[outerplanar graph]]s, and in particular for [[tree (graph theory)|trees]]. Less obviously, every set of ''n'' points in [[general position]] (no three collinear) remains universal for outerplanar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gritzmann|Mohar|Pach|Pollack|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Planar graphs that can be partitioned into nested cycles, 2-outerplanar graphs and planar graphs of bounded [[pathwidth]], have universal point sets of nearly-linear size.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Angelini|Bruckdorfer|Di Battista|Kaufmann|2018}}; {{harvtxt|Bannister|Cheng|Devanny|Eppstein|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonian network|Planar 3-trees]] have universal point sets of size ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;5/3&lt;/sup&gt;); the same bound also applies to [[series-parallel graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fulek|Toth|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other drawing styles==
[[File:Goldner-Harary-linear.svg|thumb|An arc diagram]]
As well as for straight-line graph drawing, universal point sets have been studied for other drawing styles; in many of these cases, universal point sets with exactly ''n'' points exist, based on a topological [[book embedding]] in which the vertices are placed along a line in the plane and the edges are drawn as curves that cross this line at most once.  For instance, every set of ''n'' collinear points is universal for an [[arc diagram]] in which each edge is represented as either a single [[semicircle]] or a smooth curve formed from two semicircles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Giordano|Liotta|Mchedlidze|Symvonis|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By using a similar layout, every convex curve in the plane can be shown to contain an ''n''-point subset that is universal for [[Polygonal chain|polyline]] drawing with at most [[Bend minimization|one bend per edge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Everett|Lazard|Liotta|Wismath|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This set contains only the vertices of the drawing, not the bends; larger sets are known that can be used for polyline drawing with all vertices and all bends placed within the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dujmović|Evans|Lazard|Lenhart|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
