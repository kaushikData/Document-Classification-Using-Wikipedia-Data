'''Albert Ghiorso''' (July 15, 1915 – December 26, 2010) was an American nuclear scientist and co-discoverer of a record 12 [[chemical element]]s on the [[periodic table]]. His research career spanned five decades, from the early 1940s to the late 1990s.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ghiorso was born in [[California]] on July 15, 1915, of Italian and Spanish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghiorso.org/AG_documents/AG_obituary_short_version_11_Jan_2011.html|title=Albert Ghiorso Obituary |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Alameda, California]]. As a teenager, he built radio circuitry and earned a reputation for establishing radio contacts at distances that outdid the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p074|title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |author1=D. C. Hoffman |author2=A. Ghiorso |author3=G. Seaborg |date=2000 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-1-86094-087-3 |doi=10.1142/p074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1937. After graduation, he worked for Reginald Tibbets, a prominent amateur radio operator who operated a business supplying radiation detectors to the government. Ghiorso's ability to develop and produce these instruments, as well as a variety of electronic tasks, brought him into contact with the nuclear scientists at the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, in particular [[Glenn Seaborg]]. During a job in which he was to install an intercom at the lab, he met two secretaries, one of whom married Seaborg. The other, Wilma Belt, became Albert's wife of 60+ years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Scientist pushed periodic table, discovered 12 elements|first=Martin|last=Weil|work=Washington Post|date=January 20, 2011|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghiorso was raised in a devout Christian family, but later left the religion and became an atheist. However, he still identified with Christian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Schmieder, R. W. Albert Ghiorso – Notes for Memoirs. Jan. 2010, ghiorso.org/AG_documents/AG_autobiography_reorganized_0.48.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, Glenn Theodore., et al. Transuranium People: The Inside Story. Imperial College Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime research===
In the early 1940s, Seaborg moved to Chicago to work on the Manhattan Project. He invited Ghiorso to join him, and for the next four years Ghiorso developed sensitive instruments for detecting the radiation associated with nuclear decay, including spontaneous fission. One of Ghiorso's breakthrough instruments was a 48-channel pulse height analyzer, which enabled him to identify the energy, and therefore the source, of the radiation. During this time they discovered two new elements (95, [[americium]] and 96, [[curium]]), although publication was withheld until after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/today/2005/Jul/11-Mon/ghiobio-jump.html|title=Today at Berkeley Lab: Al Ghiorso's Long and Happy Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New elements===
After the war, Seaborg and Ghiorso returned to Berkeley, where they and colleagues used the 60" Crocker cyclotron to produce elements of increasing atomic number by bombarding exotic targets with helium ions. In experiments during 1949-1950, they produced and identified elements 97 ([[berkelium]]) and 98 ([[californium]]). In 1953, in a collaboration with Argonne Lab, Ghiorso and collaborators sought and found elements 99 ([[einsteinium]]) and 100 ([[fermium]]), identified by their characteristic radiation in dust collected by airplanes from the first thermonuclear explosion (the [[Ivy Mike|Mike test]]). In 1955, the group used the cyclotron to produce 17 atoms of element 101 ([[mendelevium]]), the first new element to be discovered atom-by-atom. The recoil technique invented by Ghiorso was crucial to obtaining an identifiable signal from individual atoms of the new element.

In the mid-1950s it became clear that to extend the periodic chart any further, a new accelerator would be needed, and the Berkeley Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC) was built, with Ghiorso in charge. That machine was used in the discovery of elements 102-106 (102, [[nobelium]]; 103, [[lawrencium]]; 104, [[rutherfordium]]; 105, [[dubnium]] and 106, [[seaborgium]]), each produced and identified on the basis of only a few atoms. The discovery of each successive element was made possible by the development of innovative techniques in robotic target handling, fast chemistry, efficient radiation detectors, and computer data processing. The 1972 upgrade of the HILAC to the superHILAC provided higher intensity ion beams, which was crucial to producing enough new atoms to enable detection of element 106.

With increasing atomic number, the experimental difficulties of producing and identifying a new element increase significantly. In the 1970s and 1980s, resources for new element research at Berkeley were diminishing, but the GSI laboratory at Darmstadt, Germany, under the leadership of Peter Armbruster and with considerable resources, was able to produce and identify elements 107-109 (107, [[bohrium]]; 108, [[hassium]] and 109, [[meitnerium]]). In the early 1990s, the Berkeley and Darmstadt groups made a collaborative attempt to create element 110. Experiments at Berkeley were unsuccessful, but eventually elements 110-112 (110, [[darmstadtium]]; 111, [[roentgenium]] and 112, [[copernicium]]) were identified at the Darmstadt laboratory. Subsequent work at the JINR laboratory at Dubna, led by Yuri Oganessian and a Russian-American team of scientists, was successful in identifying elements 113-118 (113, [[nihonium]]; 114, [[flerovium]]; 115, [[moscovium]]; 116, [[livermorium]]; 117, [[tennessine]] and 118, [[oganesson]]), thereby completing the seventh row of the periodic table of the elements.

===Inventions===
Ghiorso invented numerous techniques and machines for isolating and identifying heavy elements atom-by-atom. He is generally credited with implementing the multichannel analyzer and the technique of recoil to isolate reaction products, although both of these were significant extensions of previously understood concepts. His concept for a new type of accelerator, the Omnitron, is acknowledged to have been a brilliant advance that probably would have enabled the Berkeley lab to discover numerous additional new elements, but the machine was never built, a victim of the evolving political landscape of the 1970s in the U.S. that de-emphasized basic nuclear research and greatly expanded research on environmental, health, and safety issues. Partially as a result of the failure to build the Omnitron, Ghiorso (together with colleagues Bob Main and others) conceived the joining of the HILAC and the Bevatron, which he called the Bevalac. This combination machine, an ungainly articulation across the steep slope at the Rad Lab, provided heavy ions at GeV energies, thereby enabling development of two new fields of research: "high-energy nuclear physics," meaning that the compound nucleus is sufficiently hot to exhibit collective dynamical effects, and heavy ion therapy, in which high-energy ions are used to irradiate tumors in cancer patients. Both of these fields have expanded into activities in many laboratories and clinics worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://epaper.kek.jp/c66/papers/e-003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
In his later years, Ghiorso continued research toward finding superheavy elements, fusion energy, and innovative electron beam sources. He was a non-participating co-author of the experiments in 1999 that gave evidence of elements 116 and 118, which later turned out to be a case of scientific fraud perpetrated by the first author, [[Victor Ninov]]. He also had brief research interests in the free quark experiment of William Fairbank of Stanford, in the discovery of [[technetium|element 43]], the electron disk accelerator, among others.

===Legacy===
Albert Ghiorso is credited with having co-discovered the following elements&lt;ref&gt;[http://alsos.wlu.edu/qsearch.aspx?browse=people/Ghiorso,+Albert ''Annotated Bibliography for Albert Ghiorso'', The Alsos Digital Library for Nuclear Issues]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Americium]]'' ca. 1945 (element 95)
* ''[[Curium]]'' in 1944  (element 96)
* ''[[Berkelium]]'' in 1949 (element 97)
* ''[[Californium]]'' in 1950 (element 98)
* ''[[Einsteinium]]'' in  1952 (element 99)
* ''[[Fermium]]'' in 1953 (element 100)
* ''[[Mendelevium]]'' in 1955 (element 101)
* ''[[Nobelium]]'' in 1958–59 (element 102)
* ''[[Lawrencium]]'' in 1961 (element 103)
* ''[[Rutherfordium]]'' in 1969 (element 104)
* ''[[Dubnium]]'' in 1970 (element 105)
* ''[[Seaborgium]]'' in 1974 (element 106)

Ghiorso personally selected some of the names recommended by his group for the new elements. His original name for element 105 (hahnium) was changed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([[IUPAC]]) to dubnium, to recognize the contributions of the laboratory at Dubna, Russia, in the search for trans-fermium elements. His recommendation for element 106, seaborgium, was accepted only after extensive debate about naming an element after a living person. In 1999, evidence for two superheavy elements ([[Livermorium|element 116]] and [[Oganesson|element 118]]) was published by a group in Berkeley. The discovery group intended to propose the name ''[[ghiorsium]]'' for element 118, but eventually the data were found to have been tampered and in 2002 the claims were withdrawn. Ghiorso's lifetime output comprised about 170 technical papers, most published in The Physical Review.

Ghiorso is famous among his colleagues for his endless stream of creative "doodles," which define an art form suggestive of fractals. He also developed a state-of-the-art camera for birdwatching, and was a constant supporter of environmental causes and organizations.

Several obituaries are available online, and a full-length biography is in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghiorso.org|title=ALBERT GHIORSO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prince]] '''Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg, Count of La Marck''' [[Grandee of Spain]] (30 August 1753 – 26 September 1833),&lt;ref name=Littell-221&gt;Eliakim Littell, Robert S. Littell (editors 1851).''Littell's living age'', T. H. Carter &amp; Co., 1851 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bCbVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA221&amp;as_brr=3 p. 221]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Stores Smith (1848), ''Mirabeau: A Life-history, in Four Books'', Lea and Blanchard, 1848. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4vwaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;as_brr=3 p. 316](second footnote)&lt;/ref&gt; was the second son and fourth child of [[Charles Marie Raymond of Arenberg|Charles, 5th Duke of Arenberg]], the head of the [[House of Arenberg]] (and who still held the rank of sovereign princes).

==Early life==
===Father===
d'Arenberg was born on 30 August 1753 at [[Brussels]], where his father resided. The duke, who had served with great distinction during the [[Seven Years' War]], and was a field-marshal in the Austrian army, originally intended Prince Auguste for the same service, in which, indeed, he began his career at the age of fifteen; but family circumstances altered his career.&lt;ref name=Littell-221/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dublin University magazine: a literary and political journal'', Volume 39, W. Curry, jun., and co., 1852. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkCgnto24YwC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=%22Auguste+Marie+Raymond%22+count+de+la+Marck&amp;as_brr=3 p. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncle===
Louis Engelbert, Comte de [[House of La Marck|La Marck]], the last of his name, and the father-in-law of Charles, 5th Duke of Arenberg, was the officer of a regiment of German infantry in the service of France, and, having no son, proposed that Prince Auguste should enter the French service, offering, if he did so, to give him his regiment. The proposition was accepted, and it was further arranged that on the death of his maternal grandfather, the young prince should take the title of Comte de La Marck, by which he subsequently became known.&lt;ref&gt;Honoré-Gabriel de Riquetti Mirabeau (comte de), Auguste Marie Raymond Arenberg (prince d', comte de La Marck), Adolphe Fourier de Bacourt. ''Correspondance entre le comte de Mirabeau et le comte de La Marck: pendant les années 1789, 1790 et 1791'' volume 1, V. Le Normant, 1851 [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA279&amp;dq=Nicolas+PIGNATELLI,+%22+de+la+Marck%22&amp;id=QDoBAAAAQAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicolas%20PIGNATELLI%2C%20%22%20de%20la%20Marck%22&amp;f=false p. 280] (French &lt;!-- (translation on the talk page) --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Move to France===
The family of [[Arenberg]] had constantly borne arms in the Austrian army, but belonged to a sovereign [[House of Arenberg|house]], they were free to take service wherever they pleased; the Duke d'Arenberg, however, who stood high in the estimation of the Empress-Queen, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], judged it advisable to obtain her consent to this change in the career of his son. The request was made at the very moment when the marriage was decided on between the Archduchess [[Marie Antoinette]] and the [[Louis XVI of France|Dauphin of France]]; and the empress, in acceding to it, strongly recommended the Prince of Arenberg to her daughter. He was accordingly presented in due form to [[Louis XV]], assisted at all the fêtes which were given on the occasion of the marriage, was warmly welcomed by the dauphine, and honored by a kindness and confidence never afterwards withdrawn. Consequently, La Marck was a zealous defender of Marie Antoinette, whom he endeavored to represent as much less disposed towards political interference—until the gravity of events compelled her to interfere—than she has often described during his later life.&lt;ref name=Littell-221/&gt;

==Military career==
===Title===
After being thus presented, Prince Auguste joined his regiment in the South of France, remained with it for a year to learn his duty, and then, at the age of 20, returned to court, where, having succeeded to his grandfather's title, and being invested with the rank of [[Grandee of Spain]], he enjoyed every facility for establishing a political and social connection of the highest kind.&lt;ref name=Littell-221/&gt;

===Duel===
Marck distinguishing himself in India fighting under Count [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau|de Bussy]], and from whence he returned severely wounded.&lt;ref name=Littell-221/&gt; On his return he was involved in a [[duel]] in Paris with a former young Swedish officer of his regiment, called M. Peyron. Marck and Peyron had exchanged words before Marck's regiment had embarked for India when Peyron had resigned his commission. They fought with swords, and after a few passes M. Peyron fell dead, having received a sword thrust through an eye. The Count perceived at the same moment that he also was wounded, by a torrent of blood which gushed from his mouth. M. Peyron's sword had in fact pierced his lungs just below the armpit, leaving a slight mark on his back.&lt;ref name=Littell-221/&gt;

Marck recovered from his wounds and directed his martial qualities towards his military career. He bestowed considerable pains on the discipline of his regiment, which became a model for the rest of the service, was appointed inspector-general of infantry, and finally vice-president of the committee for regulating the tactics of the troops of the line, in which latter capacity he acquired considerable reputation.

===Court life===
These duties were Marck's chief occupation till 1789, apart from them, having married in 1776, Marck led an agreeable life, alternately at [[Raismes]], his country residence near [[Valenciennes]], and at Versailles, where his rank and position gave him the means of observing all that was passing, which he appears to have noted with care and tolerable impartiality. As he had no personal interests to serve, sought no employment, needed no title, had ample wealth, and, the ties of friendship excepted, stood aloof from all who sought the monarch's [[Levée (ceremony)|levée]] or the minister's ante-chamber.

==Political career==
===Friendship with Mirabeau===
In 1789 Marck met with [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Count de Mirabeau]] at a dinner given by the Prince de Poix, the Governor of Versailles, to which Mirabeau was taken by M. de Meilhan, a friend of Marck. Though de La Marck and Mirabeau met each other several times after this on terms of growing intimacy, it was not till the convocation of States-General, in 1789, that their friendship became closely cemented.

Marck, who was friend of both the queen and Mirabeau, became a communicator between them. After [[The March on Versailles|the march on Versailles]] Marck consulted Mirabeau as to what measures the king ought to take, and Mirabeau drew up a state paper, which was presented to the king by ''Monsieur'', afterwards [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. However as events unfolded these negotiations came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Eliakim, pp. 222–227&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution===
During this period Marck was first a member of the States-general, and afterwards of the National Assembly. However he was deprived of command of his regiment by the National Assembly and when the royal cause became hopeless he left France, and entered the Austrian army with the rank of major-general. He was employed as a [[diplomatist]] on various occasions, but never on any military service. On [[Louis Engelbert, 6th Duke of Arenberg|his brother]]'s establishment at Paris, he was anxious to re-enter the service of France; this however [[Napoleon]] would not allow him to do, and he remained at Vienna till 1814, when he came to Brussels, and was made lieutenant-general by the new king of the Netherlands. He left the Dutch army after the revolution of 1830, and died in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh James Rose (editor 1848), ''A new general biographical dictionary, projected'', Fellowes, 1848.

'''Bondita Acharya'''( [[Assamese language|Assamese]] '''বন্দিতা আচাৰ্য''')  is a [[Human rights activists|human rights defender]] from  [[Jorhat]] [[Assam]], in [[Northeast India|Northeastern India]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/bondita-acharya-receives-death-threats/|title=Bondita Acharya Receives Death Threats|last=|first=|date=2017-04-12|website=Front Line Defenders|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was part of several fact-finding missions to document cases of [[sexual violence]], [[human rights violations]], [[witch hunting]], and conflict situation in the [[Assam]] region of [[India]].  Acharya has been engaging with [[UN]] organisations since 2010 in [[Geneva]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Bangkok]].

==Beef controversy==

On April 4, 2017, following a complaint from [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] member Mridupawan Bora, three people were arrested in Jorhat, Assam for possessing 500 grams of beef meant for consumption. The consumption of beef is taboo in Hinduism. The law under which the three were arrested, the Assam Cattle Preservation Act, does not criminalize the possession or consumption of beef, but rather sets forth the conditions under which cattle can be slaughtered, causing a question of whether the three could be arrested under the auspices of the act.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Acharya condemned the arrests on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lankasocialistsforum.org/archives/777|title=INDIA: Assamese Human Rights Defender Bondita Acharya violently threatened on social media. {{!}} Lanka Socialists Forum|last=|first=|date=2017-04-19|website=www.lankasocialistsforum.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bajrang Dal]], a Hindu nationalist organization, issued a press statement demanding that Acharya issue a public apology for condemning the [[arrests]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 10 April 2017, Acharya filed a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department in [[Guwahati]], [[Assam]] state in Northeast India, after she was the target of violent threats on [[social media]] for condemning the arrest of three people for the possession of beef on 4 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.awid.org/news-and-analysis/whrds-condemn-online-threats-against-bondita-acharya|title=WHRDs condemn online threats against Bondita Acharya|last=|first=|date=2017-05-02|work=AWID|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acharya was threatened with [[death]], [[rape]] and [[acid attacks]] by members of [[Bajrang Dal]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/rights/bondita-acharya-beef-bajrang-dal|title=Assam: Activist Threatened With Rape, Acid Attacks For Condemning Beef Arrests|last=|first=|date=|website=The Wire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Lindbergh''' "'''Chuck'''" '''McGill, Jr.''', is a fictional character who appears in the [[crime drama]] television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. He is portrayed by [[Michael McKean]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].

Chuck was born in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], [[Illinois]] and is the eldest son of Ruth and Charles McGill Sr. He is the older brother of fellow lawyer and titular character [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill ("Saul Goodman")]]. Chuck is a successful attorney, who runs his own law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin &amp; McGill (HHM), with partner [[Howard Hamlin]]. Chuck has become semi-reclusive and believes that he suffers from [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]]. He was amicably divorced from his wife, [[List of Better Call Saul characters#Rebecca Bois|Rebecca Bois]], a few years before the events of ''Better Call Saul''.

Although he initially seemed supportive of Jimmy, Chuck harbored resentful feelings toward his brother. His betrayal of and opposition to Jimmy, and his subsequent death, serve as a catalyst for Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman. Chuck's life and death also deeply affect [[Howard Hamlin]] and [[Kim Wexler]], Jimmy's law partner and girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/31/better-call-saul-season-4-premiere-date-amc/ |title=Better Call Saul Season 4 Gets August Premiere Date at AMC |first=Dave |last=Nemetz |work=TVLine |date=May 31, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck's character development and McKean's performance throughout the first three seasons received critical acclaim, with many critics claiming that McKean gave the best performance on television in 2017. 

==Character biography==
Chuck was born and raised in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], [[Illinois]]. He graduated [[valedictorian]] from Francis Xavier High School at the age of 14, making him the youngest graduate in the history of that school. He later attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Georgetown University Law Center]]. After clerking at both the [[Delaware]] [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]], Chuck joined George Hamlin's solo practice in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. Over the next twenty-three years, the two men, along with George's son [[Howard Hamlin|Howard]], built up their law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin &amp; McGill (HHM). Early in his career, Chuck excelled in criminal law, famously arguing and winning the precedent-setting case of ''State v. Gonzalez''.

Ten years before the start of the series, when his younger brother [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]] faced serious charges after defecating through the sunroof of a romantic rival's [[BMW]] &amp;ndash; unaware the man's children were in the backseat &amp;ndash; Chuck bailed him out on the condition that Jimmy abandon his career as a [[con artist]] and work a legitimate job in HHM's mailroom. Around the time of his divorce from his wife, [[List of Better Call Saul characters#Rebecca Bois|Rebecca Bois]], Chuck took a leave of absence from HHM after apparently developing [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], or a painful allergic sensitivity to electricity. Jimmy, who quit HHM after they refused to hire him after he passed his [[bar exam]], took over Chuck's care and provided his groceries.

{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}
In the [[Uno (Better Call Saul)|pilot episode]], Jimmy confronts Howard and demands that HHM cash out Chuck's US$17 million share in the firm. After Jimmy stages a phony rescue of a billboard worker, his actions make the news. Jimmy removes the local paper from Chuck's daily drop-off in order to prevent him from learning about the "rescue". Seeing that his neighbors have their papers, Chuck runs outside to steal a neighbor's paper and reads about Jimmy's act. After another neighbor reports him for stealing the paper, he is [[taser]]ed, arrested and hospitalized. A doctor tries to have Jimmy commit Chuck to a mental institution, but Jimmy convinces her that he is fully capable of looking after Chuck in his own home; the doctor advises Jimmy that Chuck's "disease" is entirely [[psychosomatic]].

Chuck aids Jimmy in his investigation of the Sandpiper Crossing [[retirement community]], which has been grossly overcharging its elderly residents. At a meeting between the McGill brothers and Sandpiper's attorneys, Chuck demands that they pay $20 million in settlement fees. As they make preparations for a court case, an exhausted Jimmy leaves some paperwork in his car. Preoccupied with his preparation, Chuck casually leaves his house to retrieve the paperwork unprotected from his condition, which stuns both brothers. However, after HHM takes over the Sandpiper case from the McGill brothers, Jimmy realizes that Chuck blocked his advancement at the firm. Upon being confronted by Jimmy, Chuck admits that he doesn't think his brother is a "real lawyer", suspecting Jimmy hasn't changed his criminal, short-cutting ways. Jimmy cuts ties with Chuck.

=== Season 2 ===
{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}
Howard visits Chuck in "[[Cobbler (Better Call Saul)|Cobbler]]", expressing concern about Jimmy's employment at Davis &amp; Main. Chuck announces his suspicions about the legality of Jimmy's bribery of a Sandpiper bus driver to allow him to solicit a bus full of Sandpiper residents on their way to lunch in "[[Amarillo (Better Call Saul)|Amarillo]]".

In a flashback in "[[Rebecca (Better Call Saul)|Rebecca]]", Jimmy visits Chuck's house shortly after moving to Albuquerque, where he also meets Chuck's wife, Rebecca ([[Ann Cusack]]). Jimmy manages to charm Rebecca with his charisma, which makes Chuck uncomfortable. Chuck talks to Kim, and tells her a story about how years ago, Jimmy had secretly embezzled money from their father's business, which led to its eventual collapse. Chuck then promises to try to get Kim reinstated. 

After Kim leaves HHM in "[[Fifi (Better Call Saul)|Fifi]]", Chuck arranges a "final, tie up loose ends" meeting with Mesa Verde and masterfully damns Kim with faint praise enough to change the Mesa Verde boss's mind, whereupon he decides to stay with HHM. However, forcing himself to appear normal in the HHM office environment, without "protection" from everyday office electromagnetic radiation leads to Chuck's collapse.

in "[[Nailed (Better Call Saul)|Nailed]]", at what should have been a routine meeting between the New Mexico Banking Board, Mesa Verde Bank and Chuck and Howard, it is revealed that the addresses in the documents Chuck submitted (based on those Jimmy falsified) do not match those initially filed, creating a six-week delay in Mesa Verde's plans to open their newest branch. A humiliated Chuck immediately suspects that Jimmy is responsible for the sabotage. Dissatisfied with this turn of events and HHM's performance, Mesa Verde decides to leave HHM and sign with Kim.

In a flashback in "[[Klick (Better Call Saul)|Klick]]", Chuck and Jimmy are beside their comatose mother's hospital bed. Jimmy leaves to buy sandwiches for himself and for Chuck, who has not eaten for days. While Chuck is alone with his mother she wakes and calls Jimmy's name twice before dying. Jimmy returns to find his mother's room empty, and asks Chuck if their mother awakened or had any last words. Chuck says she did not. Returning to 2002, Jimmy rushes into the copy store and orders the clerk to call an ambulance. In the hospital, Chuck, now stable, wonders how it was possible for Jimmy to come to his aid in the copy store when Chuck had only been unconscious for less than a minute, correctly deducing that Jimmy had bribed the clerk and then stayed to watch. However, Ernesto covers for Jimmy, lying to Chuck that he called Jimmy before going to the copy store. Howard calls Jimmy to advise that Chuck has quit HHM. Jimmy rushes to Chuck's house, where he finds his brother covering the walls, floor and ceiling of his living room with foil sheets. Chuck explains that the walls of his home were doing nothing to deflect electromagnetic rays, and this has led to the deterioration of his mind over time, hence his inexcusable mistake with the Mesa Verde documents. Feeling guilty about his deception and Chuck's unnecessary decision to abandon his beloved law profession, Jimmy confesses to tampering with the documents and bribing the copy store clerk, assuring Chuck that his mind is not deteriorating. After Jimmy leaves, Chuck unveils a tape recorder he had hidden and activated prior to Jimmy's arrival.

=== Season 3 ===
{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}
Jimmy helps Chuck remove the foil from his wall and reminisces over a book they read together during their youth; Chuck is quick to sever the nostalgia and remind him that his actions won't be forgotten or forgiven. Chuck plays Jimmy's confession to Hamlin, who warns him that the tape has no legal or public value. Chuck assures him that it has a use. Chuck later arranges for a key part of the tape to be played by Ernesto in a way that appears to Ernesto to be accidental. Chuck quickly turns the player off and makes Ernesto promise not to repeat anything that he heard to anyone on the premise of confidentiality. However, it's part of Chuck's plan to get Jimmy disbarred.

As part of Chuck's plan, Ernesto approaches Wexler-McGill but decides against entering and speaks to Kim in the parking lot about the tape. Kim relays this to Jimmy and the former takes the latter on as her legal client, advising him that the tape is no legal threat to him. Jimmy suppresses his feelings of anger and betrayal in front of Kim, but later drives to Chuck's house, breaks in, berates him and destroys the tape. However, this more or less all happens according to Chuck's plan, as he only used the tape as bait and Hamlin and the private investigator are present to witness Jimmy's break-in.

Jimmy is arrested, following a few harsh but hesitant words with Chuck and chooses to represent himself (against Kim's wishes), pleads not guilty and posts bail. Jimmy later explains what happened during his break-in and tells Kim to work on Mesa Verde while he works his own legal battle, to which she flatly agrees. The prosecutor in Jimmy's case, Hay, meets with Chuck and tells him that she doesn't plan to let Jimmy off easy. Chuck wishes to seek a "better solution for everyone": Jimmy can avoid jail time, but will have to confess to his felony break-in and submit his confession to the New Mexico Bar Association, which will likely result in disbarment. Kim convinces Jimmy to let her help him fight Chuck's plot.

Jimmy, Kim, Hamlin, Chuck and ADA Hay meet in order to finalize Jimmy's confession, with Jimmy agreeing to have his confession reviewed by the New Mexico Bar Association. After the meeting, Kim confronts Chuck, telling him that she suspects he has a copy of the tape. Chuck confirms her suspicions and states that he plans to submit the tape as evidence in Jimmy's disciplinary hearing. Kim then relays the information to Jimmy, revealing that having Chuck admit the existence of the second tape was all according to their plan.

In a flashback in "[[Chicanery (Better Call Saul)|Chicanery]]", Chuck invites Rebecca over for dinner and comes up with an elaborate lie about the power to his house being cut so he doesn't have to reveal his EHS to her. However, Rebecca answers her cell phone, causing Chuck to knock it out of her hands in a panic. He refuses to explain his actions to her and forbids Jimmy from revealing the truth. In the present, both sides gear up for Jimmy’s hearing in front of the New Mexico Bar Association after Jimmy meets with Caldera to acquire the services of "someone with a light touch." At the hearing, things do not seem to go well for Jimmy as the tape is played before the committee. Rebecca enters the courtroom, much to Chuck’s surprise, though he believes it's some ploy by Jimmy to throw him off balance. Indeed, it is, as earlier, Jimmy and Kim had hired [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] to enter Chuck's house posing as a repairman hired to fix Chuck's front door, and take pictures of Chuck's living conditions to show to Rebecca. Later, Jimmy cross-examines Chuck about the circumstances of the recording, Rebecca’s presence and his illness. Though Chuck remains calm throughout most of it, Jimmy reveals that Chuck has been carrying a fully charged cell phone battery planted by Huell for the entire hearing, contradicting the EHS symptoms Chuck claimed to have and suggesting he has a mental illness. This triggers a sudden and acidic tirade from Chuck as he vents all of his frustrations about Jimmy and how he never should have tried to help him. Chuck realizes, too late, that his outburst has shocked the entire courtroom, including the committee.

Jimmy is given only a year's suspension in the aftermath of his legal battle with Chuck. While he and Kim celebrate, Rebecca asks Jimmy to help with Chuck, who has shuttered himself in his home, but Jimmy refuses, no longer calling Chuck his brother. Chuck later admits Howard into his home. Howard suggests to Chuck that he forget about Jimmy and look to the future, which Chuck appears to agree to. However, Chuck is later seen walking through the streets of Albuquerque, dialing Dr. Cruz, the doctor who diagnosed his condition, over a payphone.  He admits that the events of the disciplinary hearing demonstrated that his EHS may not be real. Dr. Cruz agrees to help Chuck, and he is able to walk to a store to buy groceries on his own.

Kim feels some regret for destroying Chuck's reputation in the disciplinary hearing. While having dinner with Jimmy, she wonders whether they did the right thing and Jimmy replies what happened to Chuck was his own fault and that she should forget about him.  Desperate for funds to keep up his end of office expenses, Jimmy meets with an insurance agent to try and get a refund on his malpractice insurance policy. However, the agent is unable to grant the refund and mentions that due to his suspension, Jimmy's premium will rise by 150%. Jimmy is visibly shaken by this news and starts to cry. When the agent reacts sympathetically to his emotional breakdown, Jimmy seizes the opportunity to "accidentally" mention Chuck's mental illness before leaving, knowing that the insurance company will be forced to act on the information.

The insurance company's representatives meet with Howard and Chuck and give them an ultimatum: either they can have HHM's malpractice insurance premiums raised, or have Chuck supervised at all times. Chuck refuses to negotiate and instead decides to fight the insurance company in court. This proves to be the last straw for Howard, who informs Chuck that he will be forced to retire since his judgment can no longer be trusted. Chuck responds by suing HHM for $8 million, the value of his share of the practice. Howard, who cares deeply about his employees, calls Chuck's bluff by paying off Chuck's $9 million share out of his own pocket. 

Jimmy tries to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck coldly cuts ties with Jimmy. After forcing Jimmy away, Chuck's EHS symptoms begin to re-emerge, and he becomes obsessed with disabling all electronic devices in his home to the point of tearing walls open to remove the wiring. He eventually reaches a breaking point and knocks the gas lantern over, setting fire to his house, while he is still inside. 

After this scene there was much speculation as to what happened to Chuck after the fire started. Creator [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] said, "I dont want to define anything more than what's on screen." Michael McKean told ''Vulture'' that he learned Chuck's fate while driving: "I got a call on my cell from Peter [and] Vince [Gilligan]. I said, 'If this is the death call, I'm going to pull over.' And that's what I did. I pulled into the parking lot of the bookstore and I called them back and they told me what they had planned. They told me they had laughed about what I had said, but they had to deliver it." When he was asked by ''The New York Times'' whether Chuck is dead, McKean said: "I am.

{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}
Upon hearing the news of Chuck's death, Jimmy and Kim  race over, just as the coroner's van is leaving with Chuck's corpse. Jimmy knows that Chuck seemed well five days prior, showing no signs of his electromagnetic hypersensitivity, but since then, all of his electronics had been thrown out, meaning he must have relapse. Jimmy falls into a deep depression.

Howard helps to arrange for Chuck's funeral, which many of Chuck's former legal associates attend. After the funeral, Howard approaches Jimmy and Kim and takes the blame for Chuck's death, having forced Chuck out of HHM due to the insurance rate hike. Upon hearing Howard's admission, Jimmy immediately regains his happy-go-lucky composure. Chuck, despite his lucrative law firm, and high net worth, leaves his house to his ex-wife over Jimmy, and leaves him $5,000 only so that Jimmy cannot legally contest the will in court for a higher amount. He also leaves an encouraging letter he wrote to Jimmy when the two were on far better terms that Jimmy eventually reads.

Chuck also appears in a flashback sequence, having a conversation with Kim Wexler and his brother Jimmy, in a scene set 10 years before the show's events and his problems with EHS.

When Jimmy eventually goes to take his $5,000, needing the money for his burner phone business, he discovers that HHM is falling apart and has experienced massive layoffs. Howard admits that they are having trouble paying out to Chuck's estate. As well, Chuck's actions over the previous seasons, particularly his breakdown at the bar hearing have damaged HHM's reputation, possibly beyond repair, apparently causing HHM to have trouble attracting and keeping clients. Due to his guilt over his perceived role in Chuck's death, Howard is far more subdued and seems uninterested in doing anything to fix the damage.

==Reception==
[[File:MichaelMcKeanApr09.jpg|thumb|right|upright|250px|[[Michael McKean]] portrays Chuck McGill]]

[[Michael McKean]]'s portrayal of Chuck McGill was critically acclaimed. 

The [[Better Call Saul (season 1)|first season]] episode "[[Pimento (Better Call Saul)|Pimento]]" received critical acclaim, with many critics praising the performances from [[Bob Odenkirk]] and [[Michael McKean]]. Roth Cornet of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 9.0 rating, concluding, "Better Call Saul revealed the betrayal that may very well be at the heart of what turns Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman, as this stunningly crafted story continues to unfold."&lt;ref name=Cornet&gt;{{cite web|last=Cornet|first=Roth|title=Better Call Saul: "Pimento" Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/31/better-call-saul-pimento-review|publisher=IGN|date=March 30, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Better Call Saul (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[Chicanery (Better Call Saul)|Chicanery]]", received universal acclaim from critics, with some considering it to be a series-best. Terri Schwartz of [[IGN]] awarded the episode 10 out of 10, describing it as "the best episode of Better Call Saul to date".&lt;ref name="sch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/better-call-saul-chicanery-review |title=Better Call Saul: "Chicanery" Review |work=[[IGN]] |date=May 8, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017 |author=Schwartz, Terri}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds a 100% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average of 9.5/10 based on 12 reviews. The site consensus reads: "The war between Jimmy and Chuck comes to an unprecedented climax in the heartbreaking, sober, and defining 'Chicanery', an episode that clearly cements ''Better Call Saul'' as essential television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/better_call_saul/s03/e05|title=Chicanery|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[TVLine]] named [[Michael McKean]] the "Performer of the Week" for his performance in this episode, writing it was the "finest showcase yet for his fascinatingly layered performance as Jimmy's brother Chuck McGill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2017/05/13/michael-mckean-better-call-saul-performance-season-3-chicanery/ |title=Performer of the Week: Michael McKean |publisher=TVLine |date=May 13, 2017 |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Bowman of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', who gave the episode an "A" rating, praised the courtroom scene, saying "it isn’t just to give us the satisfaction of a courtroom drama, the neat ending where the truth comes out. The brilliance of this structure is to give us a slow-motion view of the heavens falling, an outcome methodically pursued by Kim and Jimmy, which nevertheless seems to give them no satisfaction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/chuck-takes-stand-better-call-saul-goes-full-court-254909|publisher= The A.V. Club|title=Chicanery · Better Call Saul · TV Review|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics were disappointed when McKean, who was said to have given "one of the best performances by anyone in TV all year", failed to secure an Emmy nomination while his co-star [[Jonathan Banks]] did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/13/15967526/2017-emmy-nominations-bad-snubs-leftovers|title=The 2017 Emmy nominations’ 13 most disappointing omissions|publisher=Vox.com|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/13/emmy-nomination-snubs-2017-leftovers-americans|title='Its exclusion is an almighty slap in the face' – all the Emmy snubs and shocks|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his performances as Chuck McGill, [[Michael McKean]] won a [[Satellite Award]] for [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor]] in 2018 at the [[22nd Satellite Awards]].

Matt Zoller Seitz of ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]'' considers him to be the ''Better Call Saul'' version of ''Breaking Bad'' character [[Skyler White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/better-call-saul-chuck-breaking-bad-skyler.html|title=Chuck McGill Is Better Call Saul’s Version of Skyler White|first=Matt Zoleller|last=Seitz|website=Vulture|date=April 21, 2016|accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], Warwickshire, he was interested in antiques from age 12,&lt;ref name=BBCObit/&gt; which led to his joining the profession on leaving school. He qualified aged 21 as a member of the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers, which merged with the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insolvencydirect.bis.gov.uk/technicalmanual/Ch25-36/Chapter32/part3/part1/part1.htm |title=Auctioneers |date=March 2008 |publisher=The Insolvency Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barby started his own independent valuation business, [[Hillmorton]]-based David J. Barby and Associates, in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=RugObs/&gt; where he still worked at the time of his death. As an auctioneer, his affable manner made him very popular and particularly with those bidding. His great success in October 2000 was the sale of a £1&amp;nbsp;million collection.&lt;ref name=IndyObit/&gt;

The Royal Leamington Society marked its Jubilee Year in 2006 with an "Evening with David Barby on Images of the 50s", at the Town Hall in [[Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leamingtonsociety.org.uk/Newsletters/Feb%202006%20newsletter.pdf |website=The Leamington Society |title= Newsletter February 2006 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617214340/http://leamingtonsociety.org.uk/Newsletters/Feb%202006%20newsletter.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2016 |access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar evenings with David Barby were held at Snitterfield Village Hall, [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snitterfield.com/images/DavidBarbyposter.pdf |title=Snitterfield W.I.

'''David Helfgott''' (born 19 May 1947) is an Australian concert pianist. Helfgott's life inspired the [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'', in which he was portrayed by actors [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Noah Taylor]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Helfgott was born in [[Melbourne]] to [[Polish Jewish]] parents Rachel ([[née]] Granek) and Elias Peter Helfgott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3493700030.html |title=Helfgott, David - Dictionary definition of Helfgott, David &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com: Free online dictionary |website=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won the state final of the [[ABC Symphony Australia Young Performers Awards|ABC Instrumental and Vocal Competition]] six times.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

=== London studies and mental illness ===
The awards he won at the [[Royal College of Music]] included the [[Dannreuther Prize for Best Concerto Performance]], for his performance of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 3]]'', and the [[Marmaduke Barton]] Prize.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

During his time in London, he began showing more definite manifestations of [[schizoaffective disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/then-now-david-helfgott-pianist-1.539444|title=Then and now David Helfgott, pianist|author=Courney, Kevin|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Perth in 1970. The following year he married [[Clare Papp]], who had four children.&lt;ref name=who&gt;''Who'', 24 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked as a rehearsal pianist for the [[Western Australian Opera Company]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

In 1983, his brother Les Helfgott found him working at a Perth wine bar called Riccardo's.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

=== ''Shine'' ===
Helfgott was the subject of the 1996 film ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'', which dealt with the pianist's formative years and struggle with mental illness. Helfgott was portrayed by actors [[Geoffrey Rush]] (adult), [[Noah Taylor]] (teenager) and Alex Rafalowicz (child).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117631/|title=Shine (1996)|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Les has described the portrayal of their father in both ''Shine'' and in Gillian Helfgott's biography as "all outright lies". David Helfgott's first wife Clare Papp has also said that Peter Helfgott was "quite badly maligned" in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jinman, "Sound and Fury", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 May 1997, News Review, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor of ''[[Limelight (magazine)|Limelight]]'' magazine, published in the September 2013 edition, Margaret and Les Helfgott refer to certain claims made in an article in the August 2013 edition&lt;ref name="Limelight"&gt;Illario Colli, ''Limelight'', August 2013. [http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/354932%2Crise-and-shine-with-david-helfgott.aspx Rise and shine with David Helfgott]. Retrieved 2 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and state that "there was no estrangement from members of David's family following his return to Australia. On the contrary, he moved straight back into the family home, and was cared for by our family. Dad was not 'overbearing', and his main objection to David's going abroad was his concern for his son's welfare."&lt;ref name="Limelight"/&gt;

=== Current musical career ===
Helfgott generally prefers to perform [[Romantic music]], mostly [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]. However, his recordings and performances, especially that of Rachmaninoff's ''[[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 3]]'', have been criticized as "pallid, erratic and incoherent."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E2DD1230F935A35750C0A961958260 |title=For Audience at a Recital, the Shine Is Undiminished |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1997-03-06 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two commercial recordings released by [[RCA Red Seal|RCA]], the American journal ''[[Fanfare Magazine]]'' was critical not only of Helfgott himself, but also of his producers, who were "marketing Helfgott's pain."&lt;ref&gt;''Fanfare'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (1999), review by Peter J. Rabinowitz&lt;/ref&gt; The British magazine ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' was similarly scathing about the exploitative nature of their issue, which, the magazine said, falsely marketed Helfgott as an "unsung genius".&lt;ref&gt;''Gramophone'', March 1997, review by Bruce Morrison&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gramophone'', September 1997, review by Philip Kennicott&lt;/ref&gt;

On stage, Helfgott is known for his unusual platform manner. In 1997, critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] noted that Helfgott "stares into the hall and renders a nonstop commentary of grunts, groans and mutterings".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;  Of a 1997 Helfgott recital in New Zealand, critic [[Denis Dutton]] wrote, "If, as Goethe claimed, architecture is frozen music, David Helfgott is the musician who finally proves the converse: that music can also be melted architecture — a structureless rubble of notes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denisdutton.com/helfgott.htm |title=Denis Dutton on David Helfgott |website=Denisdutton.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helfgott tours Australia annually and plays a small number of recitals in other countries.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhelfgott.com/tour/ |title=Tours |publisher=David Helfgott |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helfgott's 2015 European tour was the subject of a documentary, ''Hello, I Am David!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tan|first=Becky|title=Hello, I Am David - Eine Reise mit David Helfgott|url=http://www.kinocritics.com/film_review.php?f=2255|website=KinoCritics.com|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3012">'''David Whippey''' (or '''Whippy''') was an American sailor from [[Nantucket]] who became a "[[wikt:beachcomber|beachcomber]]", a white resident of the Fijian islands who served as liaison between the local and foreign communities, and eventually US vice-consul.

Whippey left Nantucket on the [[whaling ship]] ''Hero'' in 1816, but [[jump ship|jumped ship]] in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amy Jenness|title=On This Day in Nantucket History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm9hBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA307|date=2014-10-07|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-62619-626-1|pages=307–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824 he arrived in the [[Fiji|Fijian Islands]] on the brig {{ship||Calder|1821 ship|2}}, [[Peter Dillon]], master, who then left Whippey behind to collect tortoise shell, but never returned. Whippey settled in Fiji, married a local woman, and had families/children with three other women in three different regions of the Fijian Islands. He also  mediated between the Fijians and white sailors.&lt;ref name="Ridgell1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reilly Ridgell|title=Pacific Nations and Territories: The Islands of Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldLahhkAvSUC&amp;pg=PA41|year=1995|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=978-1-57306-006-6|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whippey served as the [[vice-consul]] of the United States to Fiji from 1846-1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historic Nantucket|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eIxLAAAAYAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Nantucket Historical Association.|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'In 1819 David Whippey shipped in a Nantucket whaler. After many months at sea he tired of life aboard the Massachusetts ‘spouter’,  and when his ship reached the Fiji Islands - the ‘Cannibal Islands’ of those days - he skipped and went native. He learnt the lingo, became a favourite of, and adviser to, the ‘Cannibal King’ [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]]. He learned the native Fijian language and learnt about the herbal medicines. He was made a chief and presided at cannibal banquets and ‘long-pig’ ceremonies, but whether he partook of the meat has not been recorded. There are hundreds of his descendants live in the Fijian group and all around the world to this day. He helped many shipwrecked whalemen - at this time the Fijians were partial to white seamen - and prevented them from being turned into ‘long-pig’. When the islands were ceded to Britain in 1874, Whippey acted as official interpreter at the ceremony.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hugil|first1=Stan|title=Sailortown,|date=1967|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegen Paul|page=11|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ding Guangquan''' (14 October 1944 – 18 January 2018) was a Chinese comedian. He mainly performed [[Xiangsheng]] (crosstalk), a form of traditional Chinese comedy. He was a senior actor in the China Coal-Mine Art Troupe and had accepted over 40 students in his years teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edu.cn/200104_1466/20060323/t20060323_4196.shtml|title=Ding Guangquan: Teacher of Comic Dialogue to Foreigners|website=www.edu.cn|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Ding's foreign students are now stars of comic dialogue on the Chinese stage today, such as Mark Rowswell ([[Dashan]]), Julien Guadfroy, and [[Liam Bates]] (Li Mu).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/beijing/2014-01/24/content_17284027.htm|title=Humor across cultures|newspaper=China Daily|date=24 January 2014|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ding's master was the famous Xiangsheng master, [[Hou Baolin]], whom he studied under starting in 1973.

'''Donald Andrew''' "'''Donnie'''" '''McClurkin, Jr.''' (born November 9, 1959) is an American [[gospel music|gospel]] singer and [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. He has won three [[Grammy Awards]], ten [[Stellar Awards]], two [[BET Awards]], two [[Soul Train Awards]], one [[Dove Award]] and one [[NAACP Image Awards]]. He is one of the top selling Gospel music artists, selling over 10 million albums worldwide. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' dubbed McClurkin as a “Reigning King of Urban Gospel”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/music/reviews/hopeville-tour-1200543845/|title=Hopeville Tour |date=January 26, 2003|accessdate=January 5, 2018|work=GARY JACKSON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
McClurkin was born in Chester, South Carolina. When he was eight years old, his two-year-old brother was hit and killed by a speeding driver. Soon after the loss, McClurkin experienced family turmoil due to the loss of his brother and shortly thereafter he was a victim of [[childhood sexual abuse]] at the hands of his great uncle, and years after that by his great uncle's son. Two of his sisters dealt with [[substance abuse]] problems, and that's when  the young McClurkin found solace in his going to a church; and, also through an aunt of his who sang background vocals with [[gospel|gospel music]] musician, [[Andraé Crouch]]. By the time that he was a teenager, he had formed the McClurkin Singers, and later he formed another group, the New York Restoration Choir, with recordings from as early as 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlib.com/pages/318905.php |title=WLIB New York Radio Station |publisher=WLIB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723225400/http://wlib.com/pages/318905.php |archivedate=2008-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Gospel/The-New-York-Restoration-Choir/list.php |title=Malaco Gospel |publisher=MalacoRecords |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515233549/http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Gospel/The-New-York-Restoration-Choir/list.php |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-see-a-world-mw0000611138&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ministry ==

He was hired, as an associate [[minister of religion|minister]], at [[Winans family|Marvin Winans']] Perfecting Church in [[Detroit, Michigan]], in 1989.&lt;ref name=ebony&gt;{{cite news|title=How Donnie McClurkin Overcame, Sexual Abuse and Leukemia Scare To Become A Gospel Music Star |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627 |publisher=Ebony |date=August 2001 |author=Jeffers, Glenn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917030542/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627/ |archivedate=2009-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  McClurkin served as an assistant to Winans for over a decade.

In 1991, a sharp pain and swelling, followed by internal bleeding led, he says, to his being diagnosed as having leukemia. The doctor suggested immediate treatment, but McClurkin, who was then 31, decided to take his own advice. "I tell people to believe that God will save you," he says, "[and] I had to turn around and practice the very thing that I preached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627/ |title=How Donnie McClurkin Overcame Rape, Sexual Abuse And Leukemia Scare To Become A Gospel Music Star |publisher=EbonyMagazine |date=August 2001 |first=Glenn |last=Jeffers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917030542/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627/ |archivedate=2009-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was ordained and sent out by the Winans in 2001 to establish Perfecting Faith Church in [[Freeport, New York]], where there is no First Lady, but he is now Senior Pastor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfectingfaith.org|title=Official Perfecting Faith Church website |publisher=PFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_100/ai_75950915 |title=Popular Gospel Singer Donnie McClurkin Ordained As Pastor |publisher=Jet Magazine |date=June 25, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027171219/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_100/ai_75950915 |archivedate=October 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==

A friendship with a [[Warner Alliance]] executive resulted in his signing to the label for his 1996 self-titled LP, with producers Bill Maxwell, [[Mark Kibble]] of [[Take 6]], Cedric and Victor Caldwell plus [[Andrae Crouch|Andraé Crouch]]. The disc, which featured the perennially popular "Stand," went gold shortly after being publicly lauded by Oprah Winfrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_103/ai_96238156 |title=Donnie McClurkin: Gospel Music's Hidden Treasure |publisher=Jet Magazine |date=January 6, 2003 |first=Clarence |last=Waldron |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027171224/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_103/ai_96238156 |archivedate=October 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, he won in the category Traditional Soul Gospel Album, for "Psalms, Hymns &amp; Spiritual Songs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/09/grammys.list/index.html List of Grammy winners] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lSheSN0K?url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/09/grammys.list/index.html |date=2009-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McClurkin is best known for his hit songs "Stand" and "We Fall Down" which were played in heavy rotation on both Gospel and Urban radio. His three solo albums have topped the Billboard charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= {{BillboardURLbyName |artist=donnie mcclurkin|chart=all}}| title=Billboard Charts|publisher=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dovetailing off the success of his near double-platinum selling album,"Live in London and More" McClurkin released "Psalms,Hymns and Spiritual Songs" in 2005 and "We All Are One: Live In Detroit" in 2009 which also topped Billboard charts across various musical genres. McClurkin's love for people and desire to share gospel music, globally, is the reason he includes a language medley: Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Dutch in most live performances.

== Radio and television ==

Tom Versen and Tony Sisti of T&amp;T Creative signed McClurkin to a radio syndication deal with advertising giant Dial-Global and syndicator Gary Bernstein. T&amp;T Creative provided a mobile recording studio in Pastor Donnie's church that he can also take on the road. He is quoted as saying, "As much as I love music and singing, I really love doing radio and the direct feedback I get from my listeners all over the country. I never thought I would be having this much fun doing radio and I could touch and impact so many beautiful people."[19]

In 2009, he also broadcast his own television series, ''Perfecting Your Faith'', on [[cable television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackchristiannews.com/news/2009/05/donnie-mcclurkin-launches-weekly-television-broadcast.html |title=Donnie McClurkin Launches Weekly Television Broadcast |publisher=Black Christian News |date=May 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517034656/http://blackchristiannews.com/news/2009/05/donnie-mcclurkin-launches-weekly-television-broadcast.html |archivedate=May 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His television appearances include ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[CBS]]’s ''[[The Early Show]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', ''[[Girlfriends (U.S. TV series)|Girlfriends]]'' and ''[[The Parkers]]''. He has also been featured in such films as ''[[The Gospel (film)|The Gospel]]'' and ''[[The Fighting Temptations]]''. He played a Single Man or a Church Pastor.

== Personal life ==
McClurkin, in 2002, told a Christian website that, due to the sexual abuse, he had struggled with homosexuality. He also said that he had rejected that "lifestyle": "I’ve been through this and have experienced God’s power to change my lifestyle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Giordano''' (sometimes anglicized as '''Jordan''') '''Pierleoni''' (in contemporary [[Latin]], ''Jordanus filius Petrus Leonis'') was the son of the [[Consul]] [[Pier Leoni]] and therefore brother of [[Antipope Anacletus II]] and leader of the [[Commune of Rome]] which the people set up in 1143.  According to [[Gregorovius]], he was a "[[wikt:maverick|maverick]]" in the great [[Pierleoni family]], for he continued to oppose the [[papacy]] after Anacletus' death, when the rest of his clan had returned to support of Rome.

In late autumn 1143, the democratic element in [[Rome]] set up a [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in opposition to the higher nobility and the papacy.  Drawing on the glorious ancient [[Roman Republic]], the citizens declared a senate, based on four elected representatives from each of the newly created [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|fourteen districts of medieval Rome]], the first real senators since the seventh century.  The fifty six senators then elected as [[patricianship|patrician]] Pierleoni, because the title of [[consul]] had taken on noble connotations.  Pierleoni led the defence of the city against [[Pope Lucius II]]'s assault in 1145, where Lucius himself was killed.  However, Pierleoni could not maintain order in the city and, despite his overtures of negotiations with Lucius&amp;mdash;demanding the pope renounce secular authority and live as a common [[priest]] before being allowed reentry into the city, &amp;mdash;he was deposed by the people, who invited [[Pope Eugene III]], Lucius' successor, back.  The power vacuum left by Pierleoni's deposition caused even more anarchy and eventually the pope left and a less illustrious man than Giordano, [[Giacomo da Vico]], was elected patrician&amp;mdash;though a man his equal, [[Arnold of Brescia]], had arrived in the commune in 1145.  Arnold would renew the commune, giving it the intellectual leadership it lacked after Pierleoni's downfall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The '''Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year''' award is bestowed annually by the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]] society at [[Harvard University]].  The award was created in 1951, and its first recipient was Gertrude Lawrence, an English actress, singer and dancer. It has since been awarded annually by the society members of the Hasty Pudding to performers deemed to have made a "lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment."

The Woman of the Year recipient is traditionally treated to a day of celebrations in her honor, including a parade through Harvard Square accompanied by members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and Pudding-affiliated Organizations.  This is usually followed by a celebratory dinner and entertainment by the [[Harvard Krokodiloes]].

Below is a list of the women who have received the award:&lt;ref name=winners&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hastypudding.org/past-honorees|title = Men and Women of the Year|publisher = Hasty Pudding Theatricals|date=|accessdate= 16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haydar Khan Amo-oghli''' or '''Haydar Khan Amu ogly Tariverdiev''' ({{lang-fa|حیدرخان عمواوغلی تاریوردی}}; {{lang-az|حیدرخان عمواوغلی تاریوردی}}&amp;nbsp;— ''Heydər Xan Əmioğlu Tarverdiyev''; December 20, 1880 &amp;ndash; October 15, 1921) was a leftist revolutionary during the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] and among the founders of the [[Communist Party of Persia]].&lt;ref name=HaydarSheikholeslami&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Sheikholeslami |first=Alireza  | title=HAYDAR KHAN ʿAMU-OḠLI| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2011-10-30|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haydar-khan-amu-ogli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
He was born in [[Urmia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], Brian C. Collins. ''Historical Dictionary of Azerbaijan''. Scarecrow Press, 1999; p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; but immigrated with his family at a young age to [[Alexandropol]] (present-day [[Gyumri]], Armenia). He received training in [[Yerevan|Erivan]] and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] in electrical engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haydar-khan-amu-ogli|title=ḤAYDAR KHAN ʿAMU-OḠLI|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he was invited to Iran in 1901 to set up an electrical plant for [[Imam Reza shrine]] in [[Mashhad]]. His father was Ali-Akbar Afshar (a physician) and his mother was Zahra. Because local people tend to call his father ''Amo'' (''Uncle'' in Persian and Azeri language), they also called him  ''Amo-oghli'' (''Cousin'' in Azeri language). He immigrated to [[Alexandropol]] in 1886. As a student of Tbilisi Polytechnic University, he became acquainted with the ideas of socialism closer and in 1898 joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]].

==Haydar Khan in Mashhad ==

Haydar Khan arrived in Iran as an inexperienced young man who knew no Persian and was unfamiliar with Iranian society and culture, but was driven to action by his restlessness, his sense of mission, and a belief in his exceptional love for Iran and the Iranians. Upon humiliating an official (Saham ol mulk Motavalibashi) in Khorasan, he comments in his memoirs, ''"I had only one purpose in mind, which was to show the people of Khorasan (Iran) who had little or no education and understanding that &lt;nowiki&gt;[the official]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was also an ordinary human being"''.&lt;ref name=HaydarSheikholeslami/&gt; He remained 15 months in Mashhad and after that he went to [[Tehran]] as the engineer of [[Haj Amin Al-zarb]] electrical plant.

==In Tehran==

He arrived Tehran in 1903, where the [[Constitutional Revolution]] was about to unfold. He may have exaggerated his role in the Constitutional Revolution when he claimed that he was the one who sent the first group of people to take refuge on the grounds of the British Embassy. However, upon the death of [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar ad-Din Shah]] and the accession of [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]], Haydar Khan, now more experienced and knowledgeable, played a significant role in radicalizing the course of Iranian politics.&lt;ref name=HaydarSheikholeslami/&gt;

On the very day that the [[Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907|Anglo-Russian Agreement]] was signed in St. Petersburg in 1907, dividing Iran into two spheres of influence, [[Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan|Ali Asghar Khan]], the powerful Persian premier, was shot in front of the [[Majles]]. Haydar Khan admitted that he had masterminded the assassination, and this was confirmed by [[Hassan Taqizadeh]], who, however, denies that there existed a ''Terror Committee'' on whose orders Haydar Khan carried out this act. Ali Asghar Khan had just persuaded the Shah to work with Parliament, where he had a strong enough base to guarantee its cooperation. As a result of his death, the parliamentary coalition he had built soon evaporated. Moreover, the Shah became more suspicious of Parliament, and, as the politicized crowd saw the revolutionary potential of prime minister's removal, Parliament became less willing to accommodate the Shah. The lines became sharply drawn, increasing the likelihood of violent conflict.&lt;ref name=HaydarSheikholeslami/&gt;[[File:Atabak.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan|Ali Asghar Khan]] the second Prime minister of Iran after [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]]. He was assassinated in front of the Iranian Parliament on August 31, 1907, and this was masterminded by Haydar Khan e Amo-oghli.]]

Other members of the political elite who attempted to bridge the gap between the Shah and the Constitutionalists were also the targets of Haydar Khan's political terrorism. These included Mirza Ahmad Khan Ala-al-Dawla and the Khedmat Society, which included members of the old regime who professed Constitutionalist sympathies. However, the most radical attack by Haydar Khan took place on 28 February 1908, when a bomb was thrown at the Shah's motorcade. Haydar Khan was found responsible for the plot and was arrested, but he was soon released at the insistence of his parliamentary Social Democrat friends. This single act of violence was followed by the Shah's closing of Parliament. The Shah and the Constitutionalists now stood against each other, and both sides were armed. Consequently, in 1909, for the first time in the Middle East, a monarch was dethroned in the name of the people.&lt;ref name=HaydarSheikholeslami/&gt;

During this conflict, Haydar Khan first escaped to Caucasia, where he helped in the provision of men and material for the revolutionaries, before returning to fight alongside them - providing the basis for the character of Johnny English, as portrayed by Rowan Atkinson in the 2003 film of the same name. Once the Shah had been dethroned, he joined the radical Democratic Party and organized the assassination in January 1910 of Ayatollah Mirza [[Sayyed Abdullah Behbahani]], who led the conservative wing of the Constitutionalists.[[File:Sayyed Abdullah Behbahani.jpg|thumb|right|Ayatollah Mirza Sayyed Abdullah Behbahani, one of the conservative leaders of the Constitutionalists, assassinated by Haydar Khan e Amo-oghli.]]

Later, Haydar Khan, in support of the Democrats and the governmental forces during the government of the popular [[Mostowfi ol-Mamalek|Mirza Hasan Khan Mostawfi-al-Mamalek]], participated in attacks against the [[Sattar Khan]] and [[Baqer Khan]] and Mojahed groups, veterans of the armed struggle during the Constitutional revolution who were now providing military support for the Conservatives. Haydar Khan and the Democrats supported [[Yeprem Khan]], the Armenian head of the police force, and succeeded in disarming them. Sattar Khan died soon afterwards as a consequence of an injury he sustained in action.

In March 1911 Haydar Khan was forced to leave Iran. The Conservatives had regrouped, and the Russians, who invaded Iran and occupied Azerbaijan, did not want a revolutionary neighbor on their border. After obtaining money from the deposed Shah in Russia, by pretending that he would help him regain his throne, Haydar Khan left for Europe.

==Death==

The [[1917 Russian Revolution]] provided an opportunity for Haydar Khan to go back to the Caucasus and participate in the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East|Baku Congress]] in 1921, as one of the leaders of the Iranian delegation. Haydar Khan was sent back to Iran by the [[Bolsheviks]] to settle the conflict which raged between the [[Jangal movement of Gilan|Jangalis]] and the Communist Party of Persia in Gilan. Although accounts of this episode vary in their details, it is almost certain that he was killed by a group of Jangalis soon afterwards, with or without [[Kuchik Khan|Mirza Kuchek]]'s knowledge. Following this his body was extensively embalmed and smuggled out of the country to France. His remains are now preserved by former Iranian crown prince [[Patrick Ali Pahlavi]], who runs a mowing business.

[[File:SOAOTO - Folio 042R.jpg|thumb|Hugo van Lannoy as Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece]]
'''Hugo van Lannoy''' ([[French language|French]]: 'Hue' or 'Hugues de Lannoy'; 1384 – 1 May 1456), Lord of [[Santes]], was a Flemish statesman in the service of the [[Dukes of Burgundy]], most notably [[Philip the Good|Philip III]] who founded the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

==Biography==
He was a member of the noble [[Lannoy (noble family)|de Lannoy]] family. He was the son of Guillebert I van Lannoy and Catherine of Molembais.&lt;br&gt;
His brothers were [[Guillebert of Lannoy]] and [[Baldwin of Lannoy]], also founding Knights of the Golden Fleece.
As a young knight, he travelled to [[Jerusalem]] and joined an expedition against the [[Tatars]], who occupied [[Muscovy]]. Back in Europe, he served [[John the Fearless]]. Hugo also fought in 1415 against the English in the [[Battle of Azincourt]], where he was captured.

After his release, he entered as a diplomat in the service of [[Philip the Good]] and helped arrange the marriage between [[Jacqueline, Countess of Holland]] and [[Humphrey of Gloucester]].

[[File:Blason Hugues de Lannoy (1386-1462).svg|thumb|100px|left|Arms]]
When Jacqueline married in secret with [[Frank van Borssele]], Philip the Good annexed the counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut. Hugo van Lannoy became the first Burgundian [[Stadtholder]] of Holland and Zeeland.

At the age of 68, Hugo fought against the [[Revolt of Ghent (1449–1453)]] between 1452 and 1453.
He died without children and was buried in [[Lille]].

'''John Eckhardt Jr''', (August 27, 1911 – January 5, 1991) professionally billed as '''Johnny Eck''' was an American [[freak show]] performer in side shows and a film actor. Born without the lower half of his torso, Eck is best known today for his role in [[Tod Browning]]'s 1932 cult classic film ''[[Freaks]]'' and his appearances as a bird creature in several [[Tarzan]] films. He was often billed as "The Amazing Half-Boy", "King of the Freaks" and  "The Most Remarkable Man Alive".

Besides being a [[freak show|sideshow]] performer and [[actor]], the multi-talented Eck was also an [[artist]], [[musician]], [[photographer]], [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]], [[Amusement arcade#Penny arcade|penny arcade]] owner, [[Punch and Judy]] operator, and expert model-maker.

==Early life==
John Eckhardt, Jr. was born on August 27, 1911 to Emilia (b. circa 1876) and John Eckhardt, Sr. (b. 1874) in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, as a fraternal twin. His brother Robert Eckhardt was also a performer and he had an older sister named Caroline Laura Echhardt.&lt;ref name="johnnyeckmuseum.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnyeckmuseum.com/bio.html |title=Johnny's Bio |publisher=Johnnyeckmuseum.com |date=1911-08-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eck was born with a truncated torso due to [[Caudal regression syndrome|sacral agenesis]]. Though Eck would sometimes describe himself as "snapped off at the waist", he had unusable, underdeveloped legs and feet that he would hide under custom-made clothing. At birth, Eck weighed two pounds (0.9&amp;nbsp;kg) and was less than eight inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm) in length. He would eventually reach a height of eighteen inches (45&amp;nbsp;cm). Though Eck capitalized on the resemblance between himself and Robert, the twins were [[fraternal twins|fraternal]]. Aside from the sacral agenesis, Eck was healthy.

Eck was walking on his hands before his brother was standing when he was a year old.&lt;ref name="thehumanmarvels.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehumanmarvels.com/?p=65 |title=JOHNNY ECK - The Half-Man |publisher=The Human Marvels |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Eckhardt twins could read by the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;Hornberger, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The twins had an older sister named Caroline who educated Eck at home until he and his brother enrolled in public school at age seven. He recalled that larger students would "fight each other for the 'honor' or 'privilege' of lifting [him] up the stone steps" to school, and that school windows were blacked out to discourage throngs of curious onlookers from peering in at Eck during his studies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In spite of the scrutiny, Eck remained consistently upbeat about his birth defect. When asked if he wished he had legs, he quipped, "Why would I want those? Then I'd have pants to press."&lt;ref name="johnnyeckmuseum.com"/&gt; He challenged those who did have legs by asking, "What can you do that I can't do, except tread water?"&lt;ref name="Coolidge 82"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coolidge | first = Danger | title = My favorite freak #2: Johnny Eck | journal = Unbelievably Bad | issue = 2 | url = http://issuu.com/vonhelle/docs/ub_2/82 | page = 82 | accessdate =2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilia Eckhardt intended that Eck go into [[clergy|the ministry]], and the young Eck was often called upon to perform impromptu sermons for guests. "I would climb atop of a small box and preach against drinking beer and damning sin and the devil," Eck recalled in an autobiographical fragment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These sermons quickly came to an end when Eck began passing around a saucer for donations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

At an early age, Eck developed an interest in [[painting]] and [[woodwork]]ing, and would spend hours with his brother carving and painting elaborate, fully articulated circuses.

==Professional career==

In late 1923, Eck and his brother attended a performance of [[stage magic]] at a local church by John McAslan. When McAslan asked for volunteers for his act, 12-year-old Eck bounded onto the stage on his hands to the surprise of the magician. McAslan convinced Eck to join the sideshow with him as manager; Eck agreed, but only if his brother was also employed.&lt;ref&gt;Hornberger, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert was charged with looking after his brother by their mother. His parents signed a one-year contract, which Eck claimed the magician later changed to a ten-year contract by adding a zero.&lt;ref name="thehumanmarvels.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welcometobaltimorehon.com/?page_id=95 |title=Johnny Eck |publisher=Welcome to Baltimore, Hon! |date=1911-08-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Eck left McAslan and signed on with a carny named Captain John Sheesley.&lt;ref name="Coolidge 82"/&gt;

Eck was billed as a single-o (solo sideshow act), though he traveled with Robert and used Robert's normality to emphasize his own abnormal physique. His performance included sleight-of-hand and acrobatic feats including his famous one-armed handstand. Eck often performed in a tuxedo jacket while perched upon a tasseled stool. Eck performed for [[Ringling Brothers]], [[Barnum and Bailey]] and others.&lt;ref name="Coolidge 82"/&gt;

Eck went to the Canadian Exposition in the summer of 1931. Eck was performing in [[Montreal]] when he was approached by a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Studios]] talent scout to be cast for his first feature film as the "Half-Boy" in [[Tod Browning]]'s 1932 film ''[[Freaks]]''.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=460 | title = Freaks | first = Jeff | last = Stafford | publisher = Turner Classic Movies | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eck got along quite well with [[Tod Browning]] and was often at his side while on set. Eck would later say that "Browning wanted me to stay as close to him as possible. He told me whenever I have an empty seat or chair, you are to sit alongside me while we shoot."&lt;ref name="missinglinkclassichorror.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missinglinkclassichorror.co.uk/freaksnattxt.htm |title=Freaks of Nature |publisher=Missinglinkclassichorror.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he sometimes tried to socialize, he didn't feel comfortable mingling with his castmates, whom he described as a "happy, noisy crowd" and "childish, silly and in a world all their own."&lt;ref&gt;Hornberger, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; At one point he complained that they had gone "Hollywood" because of the film, "wear[ing] sunglasses and acting funny."&lt;ref name=TCM/&gt; When Pete Robinson had difficulty lying on a blanket in one scene, Eck made the comment that if he had legs, he would have lain on a [[fakir]]'s bed of nails. [[Olga Baclanova]] would reminisce fondly of her costar (whom she described as "handsome"), "When we finished the picture, he came and gave me a present. He had made a circus ring made from matches. He said he had made it in my honor."&lt;ref name="missinglinkclassichorror.co.uk"/&gt;

Eck claimed that Browning wished to do a follow-up picture with him and Robert where he would play a [[mad scientist]]'s creation. However, Browning's career was irretrievably hurt by ''[[Freaks]]'', and he no longer had the clout with studios to do many of the projects he wished to do. Eck was also disappointed by how much of his part had been trimmed from the film in the nearly thirty minutes that were cut by censors.

After ''[[Freaks]]'', Eck was featured as a bird creature or "Gooney Bird" in three [[Tarzan]] movies: ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' (1932), ''[[Tarzan Escapes]]'' (1936) and ''[[Tarzan's Secret Treasure]]'' (1941). In order to create the bird costume used by Eck for the [[Tarzan]] films, footage which was filmed during the production of ''[[Freaks]]'' in 1931, a full body cast was taken of him.

When the Eckhardt home was facing foreclosure due to the oncoming [[Great Depression]], Eck performed for the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] Odditorium at the [[Century of Progress|1933 Chicago World's Fair]]. It was there that Eck was billed as "the Most Remarkable Man Alive".&lt;ref name="Coolidge 82"/&gt;

==Famous illusion==

In 1937, Eck and Robert were recruited by the [[illusionist]] and [[hypnotist]] Rajah Raboid, for his "Miracles of 1937" show.&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;{{cite book | title = Weird Maryland: Your Travel Guide to Maryland's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets | first = Matt | last = Lake |author2=Mark Moran |author3=Mark Sceurman  | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. | isbn = 1-4027-3906-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=L0iv57e2mXEC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Eck+tasseled+stool | page = 89 | date = 2006-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it they performed a magic feat that amazed audiences.  Raboid  performed the traditional [[Sawing a woman in half|sawing-a-man-in-half]]  [[illusion]], except with an unexpected twist.  At first Robert would pretend to be a member of the audience and heckle the illusionist during his routine, resulting in Robert being called on stage to be sawed in half himself.  During the illusion, Robert would then be switched with his twin brother Eck, who played the top half of his body, and a [[dwarfism|dwarf]], who played the bottom half, concealed in specially-built pant legs.&lt;ref name=Lake/&gt;  After being sawed in half, the legs would suddenly get up and start running away, prompting Eck to jump off the table and start chasing his legs around the stage, screaming, "Come back!" "I want my legs back!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Rajah Raboid| url =
http://www.johnnyeckmuseum.com/magic/rajahraboid.html| accessdate = 20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes he even chased the legs into the audience. The subsequent reaction was amazing - people would scream and sometimes even flee the theater in terror.  As Eck described it, "The men were more frightened than the women - the women couldn't move because the men were walking across their laps, headed for the exit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coolidge | first = Danger | title = My favorite freak #2: Johnny Eck | journal = Unbelievably Bad | issue = 2 | url = http://issuu.com/vonhelle/docs/ub_2/82 | page = 82 | accessdate =2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The act provided the perfect jolt by frightening people at first but then caused just as much laughter and applause.&lt;ref&gt;"Magic's Most Unusual Illusion", David Charvet, ''Magic'', June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The illusion would end with stage hands plucking up Eck and setting him atop his legs and then twirling him off-stage to be replaced by his twin Robert, who would then loudly threaten to sue Raboid and storm out of the theater. Their act was so popular that they played to packed audiences up and down the East coast.

In addition to film, sideshow and stage, Eck was also pursuing other interests in this period. He and his brother were musicians, having their own twelve-piece orchestra in Baltimore. Eck conducted while Robert played the piano. Eck continued his love of drawing and painting, early on choosing such subjects as pretty girls, ships and himself. He was also a [[race car]] enthusiast and the driver&lt;ref name=H78&gt;Hornberger, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; of his own custom-built [[race car]] that was street-legal in [[Baltimore]], the "Johnny Eck Special". In 1938, Eck climbed the [[Washington Monument]] on his hands.&lt;ref name=H78/&gt;

==Later life==
When sideshows lost popular appeal, the Eckhardt brothers returned to their red brick rowhouse at 622 North Milton Avenue, in the East-side, working-class section of Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Lake/&gt;&lt;ref name="622 N Milton Ave"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.johnnyeckmuseum.com/photos/622NMiltonAve.html|title=622 N Milton Ave. |publisher=Johnnyeckmuseum.com |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the same house that the family had lived in since 1906, and is where the Eckhardt brothers resided for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="622 N Milton Ave"/&gt;  In Baltimore they bought and ran a [[penny arcade]] until a business tax forced them out of business. In the 1950s, the brothers bought and ran a used children's train ride in a local park; Eck acting as conductor. Eck also became a [[screen painting|screen painter]], having learned the craft from William Oktavec, a grocer and local folk artist who invented the art form in 1913. Eck is interviewed about the craft in the 1989 documentary film ''The Screen Painters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2013/10/1/most-famous-baltimore-screen-painter-johnny-eck-lived-an-extraordinary-life|title=Screen Star|first=Baltimore|last=magazine|date=1 October 2013|website=baltimoremagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eck would sit on the steps of his porch with his [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], Major, telling stories about his life. He and his brother often performed [[Punch and Judy]] shows for the children who would come to visit.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;"The Second Life of Johnny Eck", Stephanie Shapiro, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', April 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Eckhardts' neighborhood was increasingly becoming less safe with drugs and crime.

The 1980s brought more visitors as the video release of ''[[Freaks]]'' attracted a new generation of fans, some of whom Eck wasn't entirely comfortable with, telling a friend, "You'd be surprised to see these 'avid' fans. I say they are crazy."&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt;  But he also expressed dismay at his own circumstances.  Despite having a notable career that had spanned back to the 1920s, Eck had very little material-wise to show for his successes - what he attributed to being taken advantage of over the years by unscrupulous managers, "sharp crooks," and even "best friends."&lt;ref name="Letters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnyeckmuseum.com/writings/letter.html |title=Letters |publisher=Johnnyeckmuseum.com |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the situation of fans dropping by his rowhouse on Milton, Eck wrote to a close friend in 1985, "I am so embarrassed - I would love to be financially able to entertain these wonderful people in a refined way - a tiny sandwich, cold Cola or something..."&lt;ref name="Letters"/&gt;

In January 1987, the then 76-year-old Eckhardt brothers were robbed in an ordeal that lasted several hours.&lt;ref name=Lake/&gt; One of the two thieves mocked and sat on Eck while the other took his belongings.&lt;ref&gt;Hornberg, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Eck went into seclusion&lt;ref name=Lake/&gt; and the brothers no longer invited visitors into their home. Eck would go on to say, "If I want to see freaks, all I have to do is look out the window."&lt;ref name="missinglinkclassichorror.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elizabeth J. Anderson |url=http://www.phreeque.com/johnny_eck.html |title='+windowtitle+' |publisher=Phreeque.com |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 1991, Eck suffered a heart attack in his sleep,&lt;ref name=Lake/&gt; dying at the age of 79 at the home where he was born. Robert followed him on February 25, 1995, aged 83. They are buried under one headstone in [[Green Mount Cemetery]], Baltimore.

==Controversies==

===Scholarship controversy===
The controversial figure of his father also affected his own life: while his father was president of the Spanish savings bank [[La Caixa]], he got a scholarship to complete his MBA at [[New York University]] from the private foundation of this bank.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Wrestling exclusion from the Olympics===
In February 2013 the IOC voted to eliminate a single sport from the Olympics. Although many experts predicted that the pentathlon would be removed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOC to Drop One Sport: Pentathlon in the Hot Seat|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=171840100|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 8, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its low popularity. Instead, wrestling was voted to be removed, despite having a larger athlete and fan base. Many cited Samaranch-Salisachs's influence to explain the IOCs reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=171840100|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 13, 2013|title=Body Slam For Wrestling: Sport Cut From Olympics|accessdate=February 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-juan-antonio-samaranch-modern-pentathlon-20130212,0,1157345.story|author=Houston Mitchell|title=Former IOC president's son is modern pentathlon vice president|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 2013, the IOC announced that wrestling would remain part of the Summer Olympics, reversing the February decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-08/wrestling-wins-vote-to-retain-spot-in-2020-summer-olympic-games IOC Reinstates Wrestling as Olympic Sport for 2020, 2024 Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13917">The '''Kollyvades''' ({{lang-el|Κολλυβάδες}}) were the members of a movement within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] that began in the second half of the eighteenth century among the monastic community of [[Mount Athos]], which was concerned with the restoration of traditional practices and opposition to unwarranted innovations, and which turned unexpectedly into a movement of spiritual regeneration. As Bishop [[Kallistos of Diokleia]] succinctly points out:
{{quote|throughout the [[History of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Empire|Turkish period]] the traditions of [[Hesychasm]] remained alive, particularly on [[Mount Athos]]. Here during the second half of the eighteenth century there arose an important movement of spiritual renewal, whose effects can still be felt today. Its members, known as the Kollyvades, were alarmed at the way in which all too many of their fellow Greeks were falling under the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment|influence of the Western Enlightenment]]. The Kollyvades were convinced that a regeneration of the Greek nation would come, not through embracing the secular ideas fashionable in the west, but only through a return to the true roots of [[Orthodox Christianity]] – through a rediscovery of [[History_of_Christian_theology#Patristic_theology|Patristic theology]] and Orthodox liturgical life. In particular, they advocated frequent communion – if possible, daily – although at this time most Orthodox communicated only three or four times a year. For this the Kollyvades were fiercely attacked on the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Ware. ''The Orthodox Church.'' 2nd ed. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

The movement derived its name from the [[Kollyva]] (boiled wheat) which is used during [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial services]]. Its proponents were Athonite monks who adhered strictly to [[Holy_Tradition#Holy tradition in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches|Holy Tradition]], and insisted that memorial services should not be performed on [[Lord's Day|Sundays]], because that is the day of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Lord's Resurrection]], but rather on [[Sabbath_in_Christianity#Eastern_Christianity|Saturday]], the usual day for the commemoration of the dead. They were also in favor of frequent reception of [[Holy_Communion#Orthodox|Holy Communion]], and practiced unceasing [[Jesus Prayer|prayer of the heart]].

The terms ''“Kollyvades”'', ''“Kollyvistai”'', and ''“Sabbatianoi”'' were epithets which were originally meant sarcastically as bitter insults, however over the passage of time these contemptuous appellations became a title or badge of honor.&lt;ref name="PATAPIOS"&gt;''[http://www.synodinresistance.org/pdfs/2008/11/29/20081129bMannafromAthos.pdf The Kollyvades Movement and the Advocacy of Frequent Communion].''

He was a monk of admirable virtue and immense learning, even if his conservatism provoked strong opposition and eventually led to his departure from the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]].&lt;ref name="PATAPIOS"/&gt;|group=note}} Saint [[Macarius of Corinth|Makarios (Notaras) of Corinth]] (1731-1805), Saint [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite|Nicodemus of the Holy Mountain]] (1749-1809), and Saint [[Athanasios Parios]] (1722-1813).

==History==
===Commemorations of the dead===
The movement arose in 1754 out of a dispute within the [[Skete]] of St. Anne at Mount Athos when a group of monks objected to the scheduling of the [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|commemoration of the dead]] on Sunday, the day that represented the Resurrection and Christ's victory over death, instead of Saturday or weekdays as it had been according to ancient custom. Other monks held that the commemoration of the dead has a Resurrection theme in every [[Divine Liturgy|Liturgical celebration]]. While much animosity developed between the groups, the movement of the Kollyvades, as they became known, became part of an attempt to address deficiencies in spiritual life that had arisen in the Church since Byzantine times.

The first response from Constantinople to the issue of Sunday commemorations of the dead came in the form of a letter from Patriarch Theodosios II in 1772, wherein he stated that those who performed Saturday memorials did so appropriately in conformity with ancient tradition, whereas those who performed them on Sundays ''“ouch hypokeintai krimati”'' (do not sin).&lt;ref name="PATAPIOS"/&gt; 

This attempt at reconciliation having failed, the Patriarch’s successor, Samuel I Chatzeres (1773–1774), issued a Synodal Encyclical (1773) directing all monastics to adhere to the policies enacted by their monasteries and avoid strife over the issue of commemorations. Once more, this tactic, also in the spirit of compromise and aimed at a reconciliation of the two factions, failed.&lt;ref name="PATAPIOS"/&gt;

Therefore, a Synod was convened in 1774 at the [[Koutloumousiou monastery|Koutloumousiou Monastery]], on Mount Athos, at the order of the Oecumenical Patriarch. It was composed of two former Patriarchs of Constantinople, four retired Metropolitans, two active Metropolitans, and two Bishops from Thessaloniki. There were also about two hundred monks present at the convocation. The Synod declared that all of those who did not accept the Synodal Encyclical of 1773 were subject to [[anathema]]. Despite this determination, the controversy went on.&lt;ref name="PATAPIOS"/&gt;

Thus, in 1776, yet another Synod was convened in Constantinople, under Patriarch Sophronios II, at which the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] and sixteen other hierarchs were also present. It was declared by the participants that memorial services could be celebrated on either Saturday or Sunday, and that the issue was not to be discussed further. It was at this Synod that St. Athanasios Parios, Neophytos Kavsokalyvites, and St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite, among others, were excommunicated. These individuals were of course subsequently vindicated.&lt;ref name="PATAPIOS"/&gt;

===Frequent communion===
In addition to the issue of following proper ritualistic traditions, there was a concern for return to a Eucharistic-centered spirituality and to the precepts preached by the [[Hesychasm|Hesychasts]] of the fourteenth century. The Kollyvades movement strove for a rediscovery of [[History_of_theology#Patristic_theology|Patristic theology]] and a liturgical life that included frequent communion. The movement came under assault by many at Mount Athos and elsewhere, attacks that became, at times, vicious and beyond what one would expect from monastics and clergy of any rank.

In 1819 a Council at Constantinople endorsed the views of the Kollyvades fathers that [[Holy_Communion#Orthodox|Holy Communion]] should be partaken of regularly by clergy and faithful alike.&lt;ref&gt;Fr.

'''Kwatsi Alibaruho''' is a [[Flight Director]] for the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. He is the first [[Nyankore people| Kigan]] [[African American]] NASA Flight Director.

As of November 2005, only 58 people had directed [[human spaceflight]] missions. The Flight Director class of 2005, of which Alibaruho is a member, is the second largest ever appointed and the most diverse. The nine-member group also included three women and two [[Hispanic]]s. Leading a team of flight controllers, support personnel and engineering experts, a flight director has the overall responsibility to manage and carry out [[Space Shuttle]] flights and [[International Space Station]] expeditions. A flight director also leads and orchestrates planning and integration activities with flight controllers, payload customers, space station partners and others.

==Background==
Alibaruho was born to the late Dr. George Alibaruho of [[Uganda]], and Dr. Gloria Alibaruho of [[Macon, Georgia]]. His mother is a retired university professor of [[social sciences]], and his father is a retired [[economist]]. From his early beginnings, Alibaruho's parents encouraged his interest in [[mathematics]] and [[science]] by exposing him to printed material about [[rocket]]s and about NASA as well as by exposing him to [[science fiction]] media of the time.  Kwatsi is married to Macresia Alibaruho with two children. 

"I caught the science bug very early from watching science fiction programs, and I wanted to learn about real science," Alibaruho has said. Every chance he had, he signed up for extracurricular activities and seminars where he dedicated weekends and summers to further his knowledge of science and [[engineering]].

==Education==
Alibaruho earned a Bachelor of Science in [[Avionics]] in 1994 from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In May 2011, he earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Rice University]] through Rice's Executive MBA Program, which he attended full-time while concurrently performing his duties as Flight Director.

==Early NASA career==
Alibaruho started with NASA in 1993 as a Cooperative Education student serving in the Mission Operations Directorate's ISS Life Support Systems Group. Post-graduation, he serviced as an ISS Life Support Systems Flight Controller (MCC Call Sign: ECLSS) from 1995–2000. During that time, Alibaruho became one of the first ECLSS officers qualified for duty in the new International Space Station Program and served on missions ISS-1A/R, [[STS-88]]/ISS-2A, [[STS-101]]/ISS-2A.2a, [[STS-106]]/ISS-2A.2b, [[STS-97]]/ISS-4A, [[STS-105]]/ISS-5A.1.

In May 2001, Alibaruho was selected as the Manager of the ISS Life Support Systems Group where he managed and trained a team of approximately 25 Flight Controllers. He served in this capacity for just over three years until he was selected as a Flight Director in February 2005.

==Flight Director career==
By August 2005, Alibaruho had completed more than 700 hours of training as an International Space Station Flight Director and reported for active duty in [[Mission Control]] immediately following completion of NASA's "Return-to-flight" mission, [[STS-114]] / LF-1, a flight led by his longtime mentors [[Paul Hill (flight director)|Paul Hill]] and Mark Ferring.

Shortly after, Alibaruho completed training as a Space Shuttle Flight Director, now qualified to manage operations on both spacecraft. During his Flight Director career, Alibaruho served as an Orbit ISS Flight Director for Assembly Missions [[STS-115]] / ISS-12A and [[STS-123]]/ISS-1J/A. He served as an Orbit ISS Flight Director for [[List of International Space Station expeditions|Expeditions]] 11 – 28, logging literally hundreds of shifts in Mission Control. Alibaruho served as a Shuttle Orbit Flight Director for Missions [[STS-126]] / ULF-2, [[STS-127]] / ISS-2J/A, [[STS-128]] / ISS-17A, and [[STS-134]] / ULF-6.

During his tenure, Alibaruho served as the Lead ISS Flight Director for Russian EVA 15 and for [[STS-119]] / ISS-15A, the mission which delivered the S6 Solar Array &amp; Truss Segment to the International Space Station. As a Space Shuttle Flight Director, Alibaruho also served as the Lead Flight Director for Mission [[STS-130]] / ISS-20A, the mission that delivered the Node-3 and Cupola to the International Space Station.

After STS-130, Alibaruho was selected to serve a 7-month temporary assignment as Deputy Chief of the EVA, Robotics, and Crew Systems Operations Division, where he assisted the Division Chief in management of approximately 200 civil service and contractor personnel and the Division’s two major facilities, the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]] (NBL) and the [[Space Vehicle Mockup Facility]] (SVMF).

As his temporary assignment as Deputy Division Chief concluded, NASA directed the addition of one final Space Shuttle Flight to the Program Manifest, [[STS-135]] / ULF-7, which was to be the last Shuttle Flight in U.S. history. Senior Management of Mission Operations Directorate selected Alibaruho to serve as the Lead Space Shuttle Flight Director for this historic mission alongside Lead ISS Flight Director, J. Chris Edelen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18794">A '''librarian''' is a person who works professionally in a [[library]], and may hold a degree in librarianship (known either as [[library science]] or [[library and information science]]).

==Duties and functions==
Traditionally, a librarian is associated with collections of [[book]]s, as demonstrated by the etymology of the word "librarian" (from the Latin ''liber'', "book"). The role of a librarian is continually evolving to meet social and technological needs. A modern librarian may deal provision and maintenance of information in many formats, including: physical [[book]]s; electronic resources; [[magazine]]s; [[newspaper]]s; audio and video recordings; maps; [[manuscript]]s; photographs and other graphic material; [[bibliographic databases]]; and web-based and digital resources. A librarian may also provide other information services, including: computer provision and training; coordination with community groups to host public programs; basic literacy education; [[assistive technology]] for people with disabilities; and assistance locating community resources. Appreciation for librarians is often included by authors and scholars in the [[Acknowledgment (creative arts and sciences)|Acknowledgment]] sections of books.

==History in the United States==
[[File:Chariton Free Public Library 2012-09-27 19-31-24.jpg|thumb|[[Chariton, Iowa|Chariton]] Free Public Library, a [[Carnegie Library]] ]]
In the 19th century, librarianship began to emerge as a true profession. Male librarians (called "bookmen") were found in sophisticated academic institutions around the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 78"&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Like the librarians of [[Alexandria]], these librarians were primarily scholars, not custodians of the library in which they worked. At that time there was no formal training for librarians. Education in the field was gained by experience, either self-taught or under tutelage of other librarians. Experienced librarians quite often recruited trainees.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 78"/&gt;  In 1872, [[Publishers Weekly]], an instructional publication focusing on the publishing industry, began to regularly devote small sections to librarians.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 78"/&gt; In 1876, The [[Office of Education|U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education]] published ''Public Libraries in the United States of America: Their History, Condition, and Management''. Aimed at practicing librarians, the study included a manual written by notable authorities on librarianship with articles on management, administration, history, cataloging, popular reading, and library buildings.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 78"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education.

[[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]] created an increased need for larger numbers of librarians to manage them, thus career library workers became an established permanent workforce.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 79"&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[Melvil Dewey]] became a primary force in the professionalization of librarians and library education in the United States. Dewey believed that librarians are meant to provide patrons with "better" books to improve people and their way of life.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 79"/&gt; In 1876, Dewey, [[Justin Winsor]], [[Charles Ammi Cutter]] and other prominent librarians of the day, founded the [[American Library Association]] (ALA). The formation of this professional organization provided national visibility and recognition to the field of librarianship, while substantially strengthening the professional identity among the library practitioners.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 80"&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Dewey founded the first major professional publication for librarians, ''[[Library Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 80"/&gt; Dewey founded the first library school, [[Melvil Dewey#School of Library Economy|The School of Library Economy]], which opened at Columbia College in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The coursework programs offered by the library school took three months to complete, following which students had to take an internship of up to 2 years to gain exposure to and familiarity with professional tasks.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 80"/&gt;

[[File:Sarah Byrd Askew.jpg|thumb|[[Sarah Byrd Askew]] (1877–1942) pioneered the establishment of county libraries in the USA.]]
After Dewey's library school, four more library schools were opened by 1900: Albany, [[Pratt Institute]], [[Drexel University]], and the Armour Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, there were 15 more programs in the United States. These programs varied by length of program, type of degree or certificate awarded, and requirements for admission. On completion of most programs, students became Bachelors of Library Science. At the time, the degree of Master of Library Science was not awarded anywhere but Albany.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 84"&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the rise of Library education programs, ALA created the ALA Committee on Library Training in which members would review the various educational programs. This led to ALA’s "Standards for Library Education", which established separate standards for the different types of training programs.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 84"/&gt;  The neutral approach that ALA took to the Library Schools, however, influenced the schools to band together and create their own organization: the Association of American Library Schools.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 84"/&gt; The Williamson Report, created for the [[Carnegie Corporation]], however, was the most important review of library education programs. In the Williamson report, C.C. Williamson criticises the quality of many established programs, and designates a university graduate degree, not a college bachelor's degree, as the appropriate education for professional librarians.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Graduate Library School, University of Chicago, 1928-1989.]] was founded to respond to this need. It was thanks to the Williamson report that librarians were required to receive one year of postgraduate education in librarianship. By the 1950s most library schools in the US awarded a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this point in history that the notion of library science was established as the study for future librarians. In addition to professional librarians, faculty in Library Science programs included other academics such as sociologists and historians.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 87"&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Because the faculty consisted mostly of scholars, they contributed a considerable amount of research which formed the foundation of the field of library science.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 87"/&gt;

Another notable progression that arose after the “Williamson Report” was the establishment of The Hampton Institute Library School, the first library school to train African-American librarians in the US.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 87"/&gt;  After the establishment of the Hampton Institute Library School, more African-Americans were accepted to library schools, including [[Edward Christopher Williams]], a graduate of the New York State Library School, who went on to become the director of the library at Howard University in 1916.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 87"/&gt;

With the expanding economy, the baby boom, and the important federal legislation supporting the development of education institutions and their libraries, library schools reached their heyday in the 1950s to 1960s. These factors lead to an increased need for librarians.  By the 1970s, there were more than 70 accredited library schools with master’s programs in US and Canada.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 88"&gt;Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, however, there were only 56 ALA-accredited library school programs in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 88"/&gt; As library schools were never high-profile departments, these closures were a result of universities' efforts to reduce costs during the recessions of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Rubin, Richard E 2010 p. 88"/&gt;

==History in Canada==
In the earlier half of the 19th century, Canada had no formal training or library schools to educate potential librarians. The [[Toronto Public Library]] held competitive examinations for librarian hopefuls. The first exam was held December 15, 1887 and tested candidates on writing, arithmetic, reading, and English Literature. In 1890, an additional qualification for exam graduation was added: candidates were required to be at least 5'3" (160&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Elaine. "Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience." Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences 41, no.2 (2003): p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful candidates were referred to American library schools for training, or given the option of serving as [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]] to complete [[on-the-job training]].

The starting push to establish library schools in Canada came from [[George Locke]], chief librarian of the [[Toronto Public Library]] from 1908–1937. When Locke started his reign as chief librarian at TPL, training for librarians was still limited to on the job training. He believed, however, that librarians should be formally trained in educational programs like those of the US. He favoured librarians that had a formal educational background in librarianship. In 1909, Locke recruited Winnifred Barnstead, a Canadian graduate of a two-year training course for librarians at [[Princeton University]], to head the cataloguing department.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Elaine. "Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience." Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke also hired Lillian H. Smith, a Canadian graduate from the training school at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, to head the Children's department.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Elaine. "Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience." Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 165.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Barnstead and Smith, Locke began his own training program through the [[Toronto Public Library]].

A contemporary of Locke was Edwin A. Hardy, secretary of the [[Ontario Library Association]] from its inception in 1901 to 1925, then as president from 1925–1926.&lt;ref name="Boone, Elaine 2003"&gt;Boone, Elaine. "Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience." Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy was vocal in his opinion of formal educational training for librarians, and desperately desired a library school in Canada for fear of losing Canadian librarians trained in the US to the US. He was active in establishing library institutes, one-day regional workshops, through Ontario departments of Education, the first of which was held in Brantford, Ontario in 1907.&lt;ref name="Boone, Elaine 2003"/&gt;

These institutes, however, proved insufficient, and  there was a formal request for Departments of Education to begin a summer library school. The first of these summer schools ran in 1911; it was a hybrid program modelled after American schools and normal schools which educated teachers in Ontario.&lt;ref name="Boone, Elaine 2003"/&gt; This program ran for four weeks in the summer when libraries were able to spare staff for training and eligible candidates were only those already employed in libraries. In 1919, it was extended to be a 3-month program and became the Ontario Library School.&lt;ref name="Boone, Elaine 2003"/&gt;

The first formal library education program in Canada was established at McGill University in 1904. The McGill Summer Library School was formally founded under the jurisdiction of the University Library Committee, offering education in library administration. It was one of the first university programs in librarianship anywhere in the world outside the United States. Instrumental in the founding of the School and the establishment of its curriculum, Melvyl Dewey, a good friend and colleague of Charles Gould, University Librarian and a founder of the School, taught at the school during its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/sis/about/mission-history|title=Mission &amp; history {{!}} School of Information Studies - McGill University|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.mcgill.ca/sis/about/mission-history|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Library schools in Canada at this time, however, were unique to those in the US because many were under complete control of the Department of Education. While the Department of Education always provided funding for the library school, librarians were not able to push their own ideas or agenda. A course was established in the Ontario College of Education, located on the [[University of Toronto]] campus, to provide an academic and professional compliment to the already established technical training of librarians. Barnstead became the first director, but all financial, hiring, and curriculum matters were made by the Dean of the College of Education and the Minister of Education. Graduates of the program did not receive a degree; they received a librarian's certificate from the Minister of Education and a diploma from the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Elaine. "Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience." Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 1930s that the library school became a separate entity from the Department and Ministry of Education. In 1937, the library school at the University of Toronto received ALA accreditation and Canadian students began to receive a professional degree – the Bachelor of Library Science.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Elaine. "Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience." Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lithuanians''' ({{lang-lt|lietuviai}}, singular ''lietuvis/lietuvė'') are a [[Balts|Baltic]] [[ethnic group]], native to [[Lithuania]], where they number around 2,561,300 people.&lt;ref name=pop /&gt; Another million or more make up the Lithuanian [[diaspora]], largely found in countries such as the United States, Argentina,  Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Russia, United Kingdom and Ireland. Their native language is [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], one of only two surviving members of the [[Baltic language]] family. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.74% as [[Poles]], 6.31% as [[Russians]], 1.23% as [[Belarusians]], and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Most Lithuanians belong to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while the [[Lietuvininkai]] who lived in the northern part of [[East Prussia]] prior to World War II, were mostly [[Evangelical Lutherans]].

==History==
The territory of the Balts, including modern Lithuania, was once inhabited by several Baltic tribal entities ([[Aukštaitians]], [[Sudovians]], Old Lithuanians, [[Curonians]], [[Semigallians]], [[Selonians]], [[Samogitians]], [[Skalvians]], [[Old Prussians]] (''[[Nadruvians]]'')), as attested by ancient sources and dating from prehistoric times. Over the centuries, and especially under the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], some of these tribes consolidated into the Lithuanian nation, mainly as a defence against the marauding [[Teutonic Order]] and [[Eastern Slavs]]. The last Pagan peoples in Europe, they were eventually [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted to Christianity]] in 1387.

The territory inhabited by the ethnic Lithuanians has shrunk over centuries; once Lithuanians made up a majority of the population not only in what is now [[Lithuania]], but also in northwestern [[Belarus]], in large areas of the territory of the modern [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia, and in some parts of modern [[Latvia]] and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Price. Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe, 2000, pp.304–306&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is a current argument that the Lithuanian language was considered non-prestigious enough by some elements in Lithuanian society, and a [[Polonization|preference for the Polish language]] in certain territories of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], as well as a preference for the [[German language]] in territories of the former [[East Prussia]] (now Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia) caused the number of Lithuanian speakers to decrease. The subsequent [[Russian Empire|imperial Russian]] occupation accelerated this process; it pursued a policy of [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|Russification]], which included a [[Lithuanian press ban|ban on public speaking and writing in Lithuanian]] (see, e.g., [[Knygnešiai]], the actions against the Catholic Church). It was believed by some at the time that the nation as such, along with its language, would become extinct within a few generations.

At the end of the 19th century a [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian cultural and linguistic revival]] occurred. Some of the Polish- and Belarusian-speaking persons from the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania expressed their affiliation with the modern Lithuanian nation in the early 20th century, including [[Michał Pius Römer]], [[Stanisław Narutowicz]], [[Oscar Milosz]] and [[Tadas Ivanauskas]]. Lithuania [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|declared independence]] after World War I, which helped its national consolidation. A standardised Lithuanian language was approved. However, the eastern parts of Lithuania, including the [[Vilnius Region]], were annexed by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], while the [[Klaipėda Region]] was taken over by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939. In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], and forced to join it as the [[Lithuanian SSR]]. The Germans and their allies attacked the USSR in June 1941, and from 1941—1944, Lithuania was occupied by Germany. The Germans retreated in 1944, and Lithuania fell under Soviet rule once again. The long-standing communities of Lithuanians in the Kaliningrad Oblast (''[[Lithuania Minor]]'') were almost destroyed as a result.

The Lithuanian nation as such remained primarily in Lithuania, few villages in northeastern Poland, southern [[Latvia]] and also in the diaspora of emigrants. Some indigenous Lithuanians still remain in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, but their number is small compared to what they used to be. Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, and was recognized by most countries in 1991. It became a member of the [[European Union]] on May 1, 2004.

==Ethnic composition of Lithuania==
{{Main|Demographics of Lithuania}}
Among the [[Baltic states]], Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as [[Poles]], 6.31% as [[Russians]], 1.23% as [[Belarusians]], and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups such as [[Ukrainians]], [[Jews]], [[Germans]], [[Tatars]], [[Latvians]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Estonians]], [[Crimean Karaites]], [[Scandinavia]]ns etc.

Poles are mostly concentrated in the [[Vilnius Region]]. Especially large Polish communities are located in the [[Vilnius District Municipality]] and the [[Šalčininkai District Municipality]]. This concentration allows [[Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania]], an ethnic minority-based political party, to exert political influence. Due to the excessive pro-Pole political agenda, the party is known to cause friction between Lithuanians and Poles. However,  it has only held 1 or 2 seats in the parliament of Lithuania for the past decade. Thus, it is more active in local politics by having a majority in a few minor municipality councils.

Russians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and do not have a strong political party. The most prominent community lives in the [[Visaginas Municipality]] (52%). Most of them are workers who moved from Russia to work at the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]]. A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.

In the past, the ethnic composition of Lithuania has varied dramatically. The most prominent change was the extermination of the Jewish population during [[the Holocaust]]. Before World War II, about 7.5% of the population was Jewish{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, which was sometimes nicknamed the northern [[Jerusalem]], was about 30% Jewish.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Almost all its Jews were killed during [[The Holocaust in Lithuania|the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania]], some 75,000 alone between the years 1941 – 1942,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sönke Neitzel]] &amp; [[Harald Welzer]], ''Soldaten'' (''Protokolle vom Kämpfen, Töten und Sterben''), Frankfurt am Main 2011, pp. 118–120 (Hebrew edition translated from the German) {{ISBN|978-965-552-818-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others later immigrated to the United States and Israel. Now there are about 3,200 Jews living in Lithuania.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;

===Cultural subgroups===
{{Main|Regions of Lithuania}}
Apart from the various religious and ethnic groups currently residing in Lithuania, Lithuanians themselves retain and differentiate between their regional identities; there are 5 historic regional groups: [[Samogitians|''Žemaičiai'']], [[Sudovians|''Suvalkiečiai'']], [[Aukštaitija|''Aukštaičiai'']], [[Dzukian|''Dzūkai'']] and [[Prussian Lithuanians|''Prūsai'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Angelė | last=Vyšniauskaitė | coauthors= | title=LIETUVIŲ ETNINĖ KULTŪRA&amp;nbsp;– AKCENTAS DAUGIALYPĖJE EUROPOS KULTŪROJE | year=2005 | publisher= | url =http://samogitia.mch.mii.lt/KULTURA/Seminaras_etnine_kultura.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-26 | language = Lithuanian |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080125230536/http://samogitia.mch.mii.lt/KULTURA/Seminaras_etnine_kultura.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last of which is virtually extinct. City dwellers are usually considered just Lithuanians, especially ones from large cities such as [[Vilnius]] or [[Kaunas]].
The four groups are delineated according to certain region-specific traditions, dialects, and historical divisions. There are some stereotypes used in jokes about these subgroups, for example, Sudovians are supposedly frugal while Samogitians are stubborn.

==Genetics==
[[File:PLOS 3.PNG|thumb|Genetic distance of Balto-Slavs by A (atDNA), B (Y-DNA) and C (mtDNA plot).]]
Since the [[Neolithic]] period the native inhabitants of the Lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside, so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements,&lt;ref&gt;Česnys G. Anthropological roots of the Lithuanians.
Science, Arts and Lithuania 1991; 1: p. 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; although without being actually isolated from them.&lt;ref name="genetic variability"&gt;Daiva Ambrasienė, Vaidutis Kučinskas [http://images.katalogas.lt/maleidykla/eko31/E-89.pdf Genetic variability of the Lithuanian human population according to Y chromosome microsatellite markers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227130101/http://images.katalogas.lt/maleidykla/eko31/E-89.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous, without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.katalogas.lt/maleidykla/act41/A-01.pdf Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Analysis in the Lithuanian Population] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227130058/http://images.katalogas.lt/maleidykla/act41/A-01.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 analysis of [[mtDNA]] in a Lithuanian population revealed that Lithuanians are close to both [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking populations of Northern Europe. [[Y-chromosome]] SNP [[haplogroup]] analysis showed Lithuanians to be closest to [[Balts]], [[Russians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Finnish people|Finnish]] people. [[Autosomal]] SNP analysis situates Lithuanians most proximal to [[Latvians]], followed by the [[East Slavs]], furthermore, all [[Slavic peoples]] and [[Germans]] are situated more proximal to Lithuanians than Finns and northern Russians.&lt;ref name=slav&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4558026 | pmid=26332464 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0135820 | volume=10 | issue=9 | title=Genetic Heritage of the Balto-Slavic Speaking Populations: A Synthesis of Autosomal, Mitochondrial and Y-Chromosomal Data | year=2015 | journal=PLoS ONE | page=e0135820 | last1 = Kushniarevich | first1 = A |display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuanian [[Ashkenazi]] Jews also have interesting genetics, since they display a number of unique genetic characteristics; the utility of these variations has been the subject of debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/abstracts-diseases.html Genetic diseases among the Ashkenazi]&lt;/ref&gt; One variation, which is implicated in familial [[hypercholesterolemia]], has been dated to the 14th century, corresponding to the establishment of Ashkenazi settlements in response to the invitation extended by [[Vytautas|Vytautas the Great]] in 1388.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Lithuanians, like most other Baltic/Scandinavian cultures, have been known for being people of above average height. At the end of the 19th century, the average height of males was {{convert|163.5|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and the average height of females was {{convert|153.3|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}}.

Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht über die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur. 2005 Mar;63(1):29–44.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
[[File:Regions with largest Lithuanian populations.png|thumb|right|400px|Regions with largest Lithuanian populations]]
Lithuanian settlement extends into adjacent countries that are now outside the modern Lithuanian state. A small Lithuanian community exists in the vicinity of [[Puńsk]] and [[Sejny]] in the [[Suwałki]] area of Poland, an area associated with the Lithuanian writer and cleric [[Antanas Baranauskas]]. Although most of the Lithuanian inhabitants in the region of [[Lithuania Minor]] that formed part of [[Prussia (region)|East Prussia]] were expelled when the area was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] as the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], small groups of Lithuanians subsequently settled that area as it was repopulated with new Soviet citizens.

Apart from the traditional communities in Lithuania and its neighboring countries, Lithuanians have emigrated to other continents during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

* Communities in the United States make up the largest part of this [[diaspora]]; as many as one million Americans can claim Lithuanian descent. Emigration to America began in the 19th century, with an interruption during the Soviet occupation, when travel and emigration were severely restricted. The largest concentrations of [[Lithuanian Americans]] are in the [[Great Lakes]] area and the Northeast. Nearly 20,000 Lithuanians have immigrated to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/immigrationstatistics Immigration Statistics | Homeland Security&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lithuanian communities in Canada are among the largest in the world along with the United States (See [[Lithuanian Canadian]]).
* Lithuanian communities in Mexico and South America ([[Ethnography of Argentina#Lithuanians|Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], and Uruguay) developed before World War II, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Currently, there is no longer a flow of emigrants to these destinations, since economic conditions in those countries are not better than those in Lithuania (see [[Lithuanians in Brazil]]).
* Lithuanian communities were formed in South Africa during the late 19th and 20th century, the majority being Jewish.
* Lithuanian communities in other regions of the former Soviet Union were formed during the Soviet occupation; the numbers of Lithuanians in [[Siberia]] and Central Asia increased dramatically when a large portion of Lithuanians were involuntarily deported into these areas. After [[de-Stalinization]], however, most of them returned. Later, some Lithuanians were relocated to work in other areas of the Soviet Union; some of them did not return to Lithuania, after it became independent.
* The Lithuanian communities in Western Europe ([[Lithuanians in the United Kingdom|UK]], [[Lithuanians in Ireland|Ireland]], Spain, Sweden, and Norway) are very new and began to appear after the restoration of independence to Lithuania in 1990; this emigration intensified after Lithuania became part of the [[European Union]]. London and [[Glasgow]] (especially the [[Bellshill]] and [[Coatbridge]] areas of [[Greater Glasgow]]) have long had large Catholic and Jewish Lithuanian populations. The Republic of Ireland probably has the highest concentration of Lithuanians relative to its total population size in Western Europe; its estimated 45,000 Lithuanians (about half of whom are registered) form over 1% of Ireland’s total population.
* Lithuanian communities in Australia exist as well; due to its great distance from Europe, however, emigration there was minuscule. There are Lithuanian communities in [[Melbourne]], [[Geelong]], Sydney, [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Hobart]] and [[Perth]].

==Culture and traditions==
{{Main|Culture of Lithuania}}
The Lithuanian national sport is usually considered to be [[basketball]] (''krepšinis''), which is popular among Lithuanians in Lithuania as well as in the diasporic communities. Basketball came to Lithuania through the [[Lithuanian American|Lithuanian-American community]] in the 1930s. Lithuanian basketball teams were bronze medal winners in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|1996]], and [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2000 Summer Olympics]].

[[Joninės]] (also known as [[Rasos (festival)|Rasos]]) is a traditional national holiday, celebrated on the summer solstice. It has pagan origins. [[Užgavėnės]] ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) takes place on the day before [[Ash Wednesday]], and is meant to urge the retreat of winter. There are also national traditions for Christian holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Lithuanian cuisine}}

Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with other European cuisines and features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's rich history.

Since shared similarities in history and heritage, Lithuanians, Jews and Poles have developed many similar dishes and beverages: dumplings ( ''koldūnai''), doughnuts (''spurgos''), and crepes (''lietiniai blynai''). German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding ([[kugelis]]) and potato sausages ([[vėdarai]]), as well as the [[baroque]] tree cake known as [[šakotis]]. Traditional dishes of [[Lithuanian Tatars]] and [[Crimean Karaites#Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Lithuanian Karaites]] like [[Kibinai]] and [[Chiburekki|čeburekai]], that are similar to [[pasty]], are popular in Lithuania.

For Lithuanian Americans both traditional Lithuanian dishes of [[Halušky|virtinukai]] (cabbage and noodles) and [[Halupki|balandėliai]] (rolled cabbage) are growing increasingly more popular.

There are also regional cuisine dishes, e.g. traditional [[kastinys]] in [[Žemaitija]], Western Lithuania, [[Skilandis]] in Western and Central Lithuania, [[Kindziukas]] in Eastern and Southern Lithuania ([[Dzūkija]]).

[[File:Sekacz.jpg|frame|right|Lithuanian ''šakotis'']]

[[Cepelinai]], a stuffed potato creation, is the most popular national dish. It is popular among Lithuanians all over the world. Other national foods include dark [[rye bread]], [[Cold Beet Soup|cold beet soup]] (šaltibarščiai), and [[kugelis]] (a baked potato pudding). Some of these foods are also common in neighboring countries. [[Lithuanian cuisine]] is generally unknown outside Lithuanian communities. Most Lithuanian restaurants outside Lithuania are located in cities with a heavy Lithuanian presence.

Lithuanians in the early 20th century were among the thinnest people in the developed countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lissau | first1 = I. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | date = January 2004 | title = Body mass index and overweight in adolescents in 13 European countries, Israel, and the United States | pmid = 14706954 | journal = Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine | volume = 158 | issue = 1| pages = 27–33 | doi=10.1001/archpedi.158.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lithuanian cuisine there is some emphasis on attractive presentation of freshly prepared foods.

===Literature===
{{Main|Lithuanian literature}}
When the [[Lithuanian press ban|ban against printing the Lithuanian language]] was lifted in 1904, various European literary movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]], and [[expressionism]] each in turn influenced the work of Lithuanian writers. The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918–40) gave them the opportunity to examine themselves and their characters more deeply, as their primary concerns were no longer political. An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was [[Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius]], a novelist and dramatist. His many works include ''Dainavos šalies senų žmonių padavimai'' (Old Folks Tales of [[Dzūkija|Dainava,]] 1912) and the historical dramas ''Šarūnas'' (1911), ''[[Skirgaila]]'' (1925), and ''Mindaugo mirtis'' (The Death of [[Mindaugas]], 1935). [[Petras Vaičiūnas]] was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s. [[Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas]] wrote lyric poetry, plays, and novels, including the novel ''Altorių šešėly'' (In the Shadows of the Altars, 3 vol., 1933), a remarkably powerful autobiographical novel.

''[[Keturi vėjai]]'' movement started with publication of ''The Prophet of the Four Winds'' by talented poet [[Kazys Binkis]] (1893—1942). It was rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of ''Keturi vėjai'' initially was [[Futurism (art)|futurism]] which arrived through Russia from the West and later [[cubism]], [[dadaism]], [[surrealism]], [[unanimism]], and German [[expressionism]]. The most influensive futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tekstai.lt/tekstai/4vejai/apie/nyliunas.htm Alfonsas Nyka-Niliūnas. ''Keturi vėjai ir keturvėjinikai'', ''Aidai'', 1949, No. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oskaras Milašius (1877–1939) is a paradoxical and interesting phenomenon in Lithuanian culture. He never lived in Lithuania but was born and spent his childhood in Cereja (near [[Mogilev]], [[Belarus]]) and graduated from [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] in Paris. His longing for his fatherland was more metaphysical. Having to choose between two conflicting countries&amp;nbsp;— Lithuania and Poland&amp;nbsp;— he preferred Lithuania which for him was an idea even more than a fatherland. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was appointed officially as Chargé d'Affaires for Lithuania. He published: 1928, a collection of 26 Lithuanian songs; 1930, ''Lithuanian Tales and Stories''; 1933, ''Lithuanian Tales''; 1937, ''The origin of the Lithuanian Nation''.

===Folk music===
{{Main|Music of Lithuania}}
[[File:Lithuanian folklore performance.jpg|thumb|250 px|Lithuanian folklore band [[Kulgrinda (band)|Kulgrinda]] performing in Vilnius]]
Lithuanian [[folk music]] is based around songs (''[[daina (Lithuania)|dainos]]''), which include romantic and wedding songs, as well as work songs and archaic war songs. These songs used to be performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel [[chord (music)|chord]]s or [[unison]]. [[Duophonic]] songs are common in the renowned [[sutartinė]]s tradition of [[Aukštaitija]]. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called [[ratelis|rateliai]], a kind of [[round dance]]. Instrumentation includes [[kanklės]], a kind of [[zither]] that accompanies sutartinės, rateliai, [[waltz]]es, [[quadrille]]s and [[polka]]s, and [[fiddle]]s, (including a bass fiddle called the ''basetle'') and a kind of [[whistle]] called the ''lumzdelis''; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the [[concertina]], [[accordion]] and [[bandoneon]]. Sutartinė can be accompanied by ''skudučiai'', a form of [[panpipes]] played by a group of people, as well as wooden [[trumpet]]s (''ragai'' and ''dandytės''). Kanklės is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of [[Strings (music)|string]]s and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include ''švilpas'' whistle, drums and ''tabalas'' (a percussion instrument like a [[gong]]), ''[[sekminių ragelis]]'' ([[bagpipe]]) and the ''pūslinė'', a [[musical bow]] made from a pig’s bladder filled with dried peas.&lt;ref name="Cronshaw"&gt;Cronshaw, Andrew (2000). «Singing Revolutions», Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.)

==Organizations in exile==
* '''[[Ateitis]]''' – a Catholic youth organization whose members are called ''ateitininkai'', started in Lithuania in 1910: During the [[Lithuanian SSR|occupation of Lithuania]] by the [[Soviet Union]] between 1945 and 1990 no Catholic organizations were allowed in Lithuania. The organization, however, continued to function in exile outside Lithuania. After Lithuania [[Act of March 11|regained its independence]] in 1990, Ateitis returned to Lithuania as an official youth organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ateitis.lt/en/node/240 Homepage of Ateitis: Mission and Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the branches outside Lithuania continue to function serving Lithuanian emigrees and descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atnamai.org/?page_id=122|title=Ateitis Foundation|year=2012|work=Ateitininkų Namai|language=English|location=Lemont, IL|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louisa May Alcott''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|k|ə|t|,_|-|k|ɒ|t}}; November 29, 1832{{snd}}March 6, 1888) was an [[American novelist]] and poet best known as the author of the novel ''[[Little Women]]'' (1868) and its sequels ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) and ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name="Cullen-ugly" /&gt; Raised in New England by her [[transcendentalist]] parents, [[Abigail May]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day, such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].

Alcott's family suffered from financial difficulties, and while she worked to help support the family from an early age, she also sought an outlet in writing. She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s.  Early in her career, she sometimes used the pen name '''A. M. Barnard''', under which she wrote novels for young adults that focused on spies, revenge, and [[crossdresser]]s.

Published in 1868, ''[[Little Women]]'' is set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters. The novel was very well received and is still a popular [[children's novel]] today, filmed several times.

Alcott was an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and a [[feminism|feminist]] and remained unmarried throughout her life. She died from a stroke, two days after her father died, in Boston on March 6, 1888.

==Early life==
Louisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832,&lt;ref name="Cullen-ugly"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cullen-DuPont, Kathryn|title=Encyclopedia of women's history in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA374|date=August 1, 2000|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4100-8|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]],&lt;ref name="Cullen-ugly"/&gt; which is now part of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, on her father's 33rd birthday. She was the daughter of [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] and educator [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and social worker [[Abby May]] and the second of four daughters: [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna Bronson Alcott]] was the eldest; [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott]] and [[May Alcott Nieriker|Abigail May Alcott]] were the two youngest. The family moved to Boston in 1834,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1129.html|title=Louisa M. Alcott Dead|work=The New York Times|date=March 7, 1888|accessdate=April 2, 2018|quote=The parents of the authoress removed to Boston when their daughter was 2 years old, and in Boston and its immediate vicinity she made her home ever after.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Alcott's father established an experimental school and joined the [[Transcendental Club]] with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Bronson Alcott's opinions on education and tough views on child-rearing shaped young Alcott's mind with a desire to achieve perfection, a goal of the transcendentalists.&lt;ref name=showalter&gt;{{cite book|author=Louisa May Alcott|editor-last=Showalter|editor-first=Elaine|title=Alternative Alcott|year=1988|publisher=Rutgers University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PfOjRvcWHrQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Alternative+Alcott+By+Louisa+May+Alcott+by+Elaine+Showalter#v=onepage|isbn=9780813512723}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attitudes towards Alcott's wild and independent behavior, and his inability to provide for his family, created conflict between Bronson Alcott and his wife and daughters.&lt;ref name=showalter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121831612|title=Alcott: 'Not the Little Woman You Thought She Was'|work=Morning Edition|date=December 28, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, after several setbacks with the school, the Alcott family moved to a cottage on {{convert|2|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land, situated along the [[Sudbury River]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. The three years they spent at the rented Hosmer Cottage were described&lt;!-- PASSIVE VOICE: Who described them as idyllic? --&gt; as idyllic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheever|first=Susan|title=Louisa May Alcott: A Personal Biography|date=November 2011|orig-year=2010|edition=1st|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-4PYzxTQVAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Louisa+May+Alcott:+A+Personal+Biography+by+Susan+Cheever#v=onepage|isbn=9781416569923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1843, the Alcott family moved, along with six other members of the Consociate Family,&lt;ref name=showalter/&gt; to the [[Utopia]]n [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]] community for a brief interval in 1843–1844. After the collapse of the Utopian Fruitlands, they moved on to rented rooms and finally, with Abigail May Alcott's inheritance and financial help from Emerson, they purchased a homestead in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]. They moved into the home they named "[[The Wayside|Hillside]]" on April 1, 1845, but moved in 1852, selling to Nathaniel Hawthorne who renamed it The Wayside. Moving 22 times in 30 years, the Alcotts returned to Concord once again in 1857 and moved into [[Orchard House]], a two-story clapboard farmhouse, in the spring of 1858.

[[File:Louisa May Alcott.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Louisa May Alcott]]
Alcott's early education included lessons from the [[naturalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] who inspired her to write ''Thoreau's Flute'' based on her time at Walden's Pond.  Most of the education she received though, came from her father who was strict and believed in "the sweetness of self-denial."&lt;ref name=showalter/&gt; She also received some instruction from writers and educators such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Margaret Fuller]], and [[Julia Ward Howe]], all of whom were family friends. She later described these early years in a newspaper sketch entitled "Transcendental Wild Oats." The sketch was reprinted in the volume ''Silver Pitchers'' (1876), which relates the family's experiment in "plain living and high thinking" at Fruitlands.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alcott, Louisa May|volume=1|page=529|last=Richardson|first=Charles F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poverty made it necessary for Alcott to go to work at an early age as a teacher, [[seamstress]], [[governess]], domestic helper, and writer. Her sisters also supported the family, working as seamstresses, while their mother took on social work among the [[Irish immigrants]]. Only the youngest, May, was able to attend public school. Due to all of these pressures, writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Alcott.&lt;ref name=showalter/&gt; Her first book was ''[[Flower Fables]]'' (1849), a selection of tales originally written for Ellen Emerson, daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Alcott is quoted as saying "I wish I was rich, I was good, and we were all a happy family this day"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121831612|title=Alcott: 'Not The Little Woman You Thought She Was'|last=Reisen|first=Harriet|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=NPR|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was driven in life not to be poor.

In 1847, she and her family served as [[safe house|station master]]s on the [[Underground Railroad]], when they housed a [[fugitive slave]] for one week and had discussions with [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcottfilm.com/louisa-may-alcott/life/|title=Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women, The Alcotts|publisher=Nancy Porter Productions, Inc.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott read and admired the "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]", published by the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] on [[women's rights]], advocating for [[women's suffrage]] and became the first woman to register to vote in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] in a school board election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyofmassachusetts.org/louisa-may-alcott-the-first-woman-registered-to-vote-in-concord/|title=Louisa May Alcott: The First Woman Registered to Vote in Concord|work=History of Massachusetts|author=Brooks, Rebecca Beatrice|date=September 19, 2011|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1850s were hard times for the Alcotts, and in 1854 Louisa found solace at the [[The Boston Theatre|Boston Theatre]] where she wrote The Rival Prima Donnas, which she later burned due to a quarrel between the actresses on who would play what role.  At one point in 1857, unable to find work and filled with such despair, Alcott contemplated suicide. During that year, she read [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s biography of [[Charlotte Brontë]] and found many parallels to her own life.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 1858, her younger sister Elizabeth died, and her older sister Anna married a man named John Pratt. This felt, to Alcott, to be a breaking up of their sisterhood.&lt;ref name=showalter/&gt;

==Literary success==
[[File:Alcott-L.jpg|thumb|right|Louisa May Alcott]]
As an adult, Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist. In 1860, Alcott began writing for the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, she served as a nurse in the Union Hospital at [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], [[District of Columbia|DC]], for six weeks in 1862–1863.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; She intended to serve three months as a nurse, but halfway through she contracted typhoid and became deathly ill, though she eventually recovered.  Her letters home{{mdash}}revised and published in the Boston anti-slavery paper ''Commonwealth'' and collected as ''[[Hospital Sketches]]'' (1863, republished with additions in 1869)&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;{{mdash}}brought her first critical recognition for her observations and humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=Garrett |title=Walt Whitman in Washington, D.C.: The Civil War and America's Great Poet |year=2015 |publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=978-1626199736 |pages=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote about the mismanagement of hospitals and the indifference and callousness of some of the surgeons she encountered. Her main character, Tribulation Periwinkle, showed a passage from innocence to maturity and is a "serious and eloquent witness".&lt;ref name=showalter/&gt; Her novel ''Moods'' (1864), based on her own experience, was also promising.&lt;ref&gt;Elbert 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1860s, Alcott wrote passionate, fiery novels and sensational stories under the [[nom de plume]] '''A. M. Barnard'''. Among these are ''[[A Long Fatal Love Chase]]'' and ''Pauline's Passion and Punishment''. Her [[protagonist]]s for these books are strong and smart. She also produced stories for children, and after they became popular, she did not go back to writing for adults. Other books she wrote are the [[Novella|novelette]] ''A Modern Mephistopheles'' (1875), which people thought [[Julian Hawthorne]] wrote, and the semi-autobiographical novel ''Work'' (1873).

Alcott became even more successful with the first part of ''[[Little Women]]: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy'' (1868), a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts, published by the [[Roberts Brothers (publishers)|Roberts Brothers]]. Part two, or ''Part Second'', also known as ''[[Good Wives]]'' (1869), followed the March sisters into adulthood and marriage. ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of ''[[Little Women]]''. ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886) completed the "March Family Saga".
[[File:Louisa May Alcott 5c 1940 issue.JPG|thumb|left|250 px|Louisa May Alcott commemorative stamp, 1940 issue]]
In ''[[Little Women]]'', Alcott based her heroine "Jo" on herself. But whereas Jo marries at the end of the story, Alcott remained single throughout her life. She explained her "[[spinsterhood]]" in an interview with [[Louise Chandler Moulton]], "I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man's soul put by some freak of nature into a woman's body ... because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man." However, Alcott's romance while in Europe with the young Polish man Ladislas "Laddie" Wisniewski was detailed in her journals but then deleted by Alcott herself before her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6KyE2i0aM3AC&amp;pg=PR22&amp;lpg=PR22&amp;dq=Ladislas+Wisniewski#v=onepage&amp;q=Ladislas%20Wisniewski |title=The Lost Stories of Louisa May Alcott |editor1=Stern, Madeleine B. |editor2=Daniel Shealy |year=1993 |publisher=Citadel Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8065-1654-2 |chapter=Introduction |accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview27 |title=From little acorns, nuts: Review of 'Eden's Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father' by John Matteson |author=Hill, Rosemary |date=February 29, 2008 |newspaper=The Guardian |quote=Louisa succumbed to typhoid pneumonia within a month and had to be taken home.

''[[Little Women]]'' was well received, with critics and audiences finding it suitable for many age groups. A reviewer of ''Eclectic Magazine'' called it "the very best of books to reach the hearts of the young of any age from six to sixty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Beverly Lyon |title=Louisa May Alcott: The Contemporary Reviews |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=czzIm4FT-DkC&amp;dq=Louisa+May+Alcott:+The+Contemporary+Reviews+by+Beverly+Lyon+Clark|isbn=9780521827805}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a fresh, natural representation of daily life. With the success of ''Little Women'', Alcott shied away from the attention and would sometimes act as a servant when fans would come to her house.

Along with [[Elizabeth Drew Stoddard|Elizabeth Stoddard]], [[Rebecca Harding Davis]], Anne Moncure Crane, and others, Alcott was part of a group of female authors during the [[Gilded Age]], who addressed women's issues in a modern and candid manner. Their works were, as one newspaper columnist of the period commented, "among the decided 'signs of the times'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review 2 – No Title |journal=The Radical |date=May 1868 |publisher=ProQuest American Periodical Series 1740 – 1900 |url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=305&amp;querySyntax=PQ&amp;searchInterface=1&amp;moreOptState=OPEN&amp;TS=1170259771&amp;h_pubtitle=&amp;h_pmid=&amp;clientId=2281&amp;JSEnabled=1&amp;SQ=Anne+Moncure+Crane&amp;DBId=5197&amp;onDate=&amp;beforeDate=&amp;fromDate=&amp;toDate=&amp;pubtitle=&amp;author=&amp;AT=any&amp;STYPE=all&amp;FT=1&amp;sortby=CHRON&amp;searchButtonImage.x=0&amp;searchButtonImage.y=0 |subscription=yes |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After her youngest sister May died in 1879, Louisa took over for the care of niece, Lulu, who was named after Louisa. Alcott suffered chronic health problems in her later years,&lt;ref name="119y"&gt;{{cite news|first=Maura|last=Lerner|url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/11345301.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517160545/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/11345301.html|archivedate=May 17, 2008|title=A diagnosis, 119 years after death|work=Star Tribune|date=August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[vertigo]].&lt;ref name="donaldson"&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman and Betty|last=Donaldson|title=How Did They Die?|year=1980|publisher=Greenwich House|isbn=0-517-40302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her earliest biographers&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirschhorn|first1=Norbert|last2=Greaves|first2=Ian|title=Louisa May Alcott: Her Mysterious Illness|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=50|issue=2|date=Spring 2007|pages=243–259|doi=10.1353/pbm.2007.0019|pmid=17468541}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed her illness and death to [[mercury poisoning]]. During her [[American Civil War]] service, Alcott contracted [[typhoid fever]] and was treated with a [[Compounding|compound]] containing mercury.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;&lt;ref name="119y"/&gt; Recent analysis of Alcott's illness, however, suggests that her [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic health]] problems may have been associated with an [[autoimmune disease]], not mercury exposure. Moreover, a late portrait of Alcott shows a [[rash]] on her [[cheeks]], which is a characteristic of [[lupus]].&lt;ref name="119y" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn/&gt;

Alcott died of a stroke at age 55 in Boston, on March 6, 1888,&lt;ref name=donaldson/&gt; two days after her father's death. Lulu, her niece was only 8 years old when Louisa died. Louisa's last known words were "Is it not [[meningitis]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Michael S.|url=http://www.vu.union.edu/~mcguirem/lastwords.html|publisher=Union College|title=Famous Last Words|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303204115/http://www.vu.union.edu/~mcguirem/lastwords.html|archivedate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (Concord, Massachusetts)|Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in Concord, near Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau, on a hillside now known as "Authors' Ridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Isenberg, Nancy|editor2=Andrew Burstein|title=Mortal Remains: Death in Early America|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2003|page=244 n42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisa frequently wrote in her journals about going on runs up until she died. She challenged the social norms regarding gender by encouraging her young female readers to run as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women|last=Reisen|first=Harriet|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; CO|year=2009|isbn=0312658877|location=New York City|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Louisa May Alcott|last=Allen|first=Amy Ruth|publisher=Lerner Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=9780822549383|location=Minneapolis|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lydia Kaʻonohiponiponiokalani Aholo''' (February 6, 1878 – July 7, 1979) was the namesake and ''[[hānai]]'' daughter of Queen [[Liliuokalani|Liliʻuokalani]] of [[Hawai'i]]. She became an educator and was the first to formally teach [[Hawaiian language]] at [[Kamehameha Schools]].

==Biography==
Aholo was born on February 6, 1878, in [[Lahaina]], [[Maui]]. Her parents were Keahi Aholo, who died shortly after the birth, and [[Luther Aholo]], who would become a leading politician in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and secretary at the time to [[Governors of Maui|Governor of Maui]] [[John Owen Dominis]], husband of the future Queen [[Liliuokalani|Liliʻuokalani]]. The girl was the Aholos' third child, and there were many siblings from her father's previous marriage. 

Dominis and Liliʻuokalani's marriage had been childless, and she had decided to adopt the newborn child as her own under the Hawaiian tradition of ''[[hānai]]'' despite the disapproval of her husband, her mother-in-law and her brother King [[Kalākaua]].{{sfn|Allen|1982|pages=149–152}} She named her Lydia Kaʻonohiponiponiokalani Aholo. Besides Lydia, Liliʻuokalani also adopted [[Joseph Kaiponohea ʻAeʻa]] and [[John ʻAimoku Dominis]].{{sfn|Bonura|Witmer|2013|pages=109–115}}

She grew up in the royal household with her ''hānai'' mother and ''hānai'' brothers. She attended Kawaiaha‘o Female Seminary and graduated from the [[Kamehameha Schools|Kamehameha School]] for Girls in 1897. Aholo also attended [[Oberlin College]], where she studied music. In Queen Liliʻuokalani's old age, Aholo became a confidante to her ''hānai'' mother.{{sfn|Bonura|Witmer|2013|pages=131–37}} 

She worked with Principal Ida May Pope at Kamehameha School and taught [[Hawaiian language]] until her retirement at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="OlaNaIwi"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Aholo, Lydia Kaonohiponiponiokalani|series=Ola Nā Iwi: Kūpuna Project|website=Ka‘iwakīloumoku Virtual Archive, Kamehameha Schools|url=https://apps.ksbe.edu/kaiwakiloumoku/ola-na-iwi/aholo|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite never marrying or having her own children, Aholo was devoted to her extended family. In later life, she became a mother figure to her grandniece and grandnephews who called her ''Aunty Tūtū.'' She had a strong influence on her grandnephew [[Alfred Apaka]], a baritone singer who popularized romantic Hawaiian ballads during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="OlaNaIwi"/&gt; 

In 1969, Helen G. Allen interviewed the aging Aholo at the Maunalani Hospital in [[Kaimuki, Hawaii|Kaimuki]]. Allen would use the tapes from the interviews to write her 1982 book ''The Betrayal of Liliuokalani''. Parts of the tapes were rediscovered in 2008 by historian Sandra Bonura.&lt;ref name="Gordon2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Mike|title=Lydia's Voice: A long-gone audiotape of royal remembrances by the hanai daughter of Queen Liliuokalani is rediscovered|url=http://www.sandrabonura.com/__honolulu_star_advertiser___116839.htm|date=December 18, 2011|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|location=Honolulu|publisher=Oahu Publications, Inc.|accessdate=July 3, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815064411/http://www.sandrabonura.com/__honolulu_star_advertiser___116839.htm|archivedate=August 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aholo died on July 7, 1979, at the age of 101. She was buried at Nuʻuanu Memorial Park.{{sfn|Bonura|Witmer|2013|pages=140–42}}

'''Mark Odom Hatfield''' (July 12, 1922&amp;nbsp;– August 7, 2011) was an American politician and educator from the state of [[Oregon]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served for 30&amp;nbsp;years as a [[United States Senator]] from Oregon, and also as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. A native Oregonian, he served in the [[United States Navy]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]] after graduating from [[Willamette University]]. After the war he earned a graduate degree from [[Stanford University]] before returning to Oregon and Willamette as a professor.

While still teaching, Hatfield served in both houses of the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]]. He won election to the [[Oregon Secretary of State]]'s office at the age of 34 and two years later was elected as the [[List of Governors of Oregon|29th Governor of Oregon]]. He was the youngest person to ever serve in either of those offices, and served two terms as governor before election to the [[United States Senate]]. In the Senate he served for 30&amp;nbsp;years, and now holds the record for longest tenure of any Senator from Oregon. At the time of his retirement, he was [[List of United States Senators in the 104th Congress by seniority|7th most senior Senator]] as well as second most senior Republican. In 1968, he was considered a candidate to be [[Richard Nixon]]'s running mate for the Republican Party presidential ticket.

Hatfield served as [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations]] on two different occasions. With this role, he was able to direct funding to Oregon and research-related projects. Several Oregon institutions, buildings and facilities are named in his honor, including the [[Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the [[Mark O. Hatfield Library]] at [[Willamette University]] (his [[alma mater]]), the [[Hatfield Government Center (MAX station)|Hatfield Government Center]] light-rail station in Hillsboro, the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government in the College of Urban and Public Affairs at [[Portland State University]], and the [[Hatfield Marine Science Center]] in [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]]. Outside of Oregon, a research center at the [[National Institutes of Health]] is also named in his honor for his support of medical research while in the Senate. Hatfield died in Portland on August 7, 2011, after a long illness.

==Early life==
Hatfield was born in [[Dallas, Oregon]], on July 12, 1922,&lt;ref name="congbio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hatfield, Mark Odom|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000343|publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only son of Dovie E. (Odom) Hatfield, a schoolteacher, and Charles Dolen Hatfield, a [[blacksmith]] for the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].&lt;ref name=lonely&gt;{{cite book|first1=Robert|last1=Eells|first2=Bartell|last2=Nyberg.|title=''Lonely Walk: The Life of Senator Mark Hatfield''|location=Chappaqua, New York|publisher=Christian Herald Books|year=1979|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatfield's father was from California and his mother from [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=lonely/&gt; When he was five years old, his maternal grandmother took over the household while his mother, Dovie attended Oregon State College (now [[Oregon State University]]) and graduated with a teaching degree after four years.&lt;ref name=lonely/&gt; Dovie taught school in Dallas for two years before the family moved to [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], where she taught junior high school.&lt;ref name=lonely/&gt;

Encouraged by his mother, Hatfield's first experience with politics came at the age of 10, when he campaigned in his neighborhood for President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s 1932 re-election campaign.&lt;ref name=retire&gt;Walth, Brent. "Mark of distinction". ''[[The Oregonian]]'', December 29, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s Hatfield worked as a tour guide at the new [[Oregon State Capitol|Oregon State Capitol Building]] in Salem, using his key to enter the governor's office, where he sat in the governor's chair.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt;

On June 10, 1940, the 17-year-old Hatfield, driving his mother's car, struck and killed a pedestrian, Alice Marie Lane, as she crossed the street.&lt;ref name=osc&gt;''Lane v. Hatfield'', 173 Or. 79, 143 P.2d 230 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; Hatfield was not held criminally liable for the crash, but was found civilly liable to the family.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; The case made its way to the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] in 1943, with the court affirming the trial court's decision.&lt;ref name=osc/&gt;

Hatfield graduated from Salem High School (now [[North Salem High School (Salem, Oregon)|North Salem High School]]) in 1940 and then enrolled at [[Willamette University]], also in Salem.&lt;ref&gt;16 grads to enter North's hall of fame. ''[[Statesman Journal]]'', April 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; While attending Willamette, Hatfield became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and Kappa Gamma Rho, which he later helped become a chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.willamette.edu/scene/2005/fall/28/ |title= All in the Family |date= Fall 2005 |work= The Scene |accessdate= August 8, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331012232/http://www.willamette.edu/scene/2005/fall/28/ |archivedate= March 31, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1964, Hatfield was elected to the National position of Third Vice President of Alpha Phi Omega).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apoarchive.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FEBRUARY_1965.pdf Alpha Phi Omega Torch and Trefoil Magazine, February 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; In college he also worked part-time for then Oregon Secretary of State [[Earl Snell]], where he learned how to build a political base by sending out messages to potential voters after reading about life changes posted in newspapers, such as deaths and graduations.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; He also sketched out a political career path beginning with the state legislature and culminating in a spot in the United States Senate, with a blank for any position beyond the Senate.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; Hatfield graduated from Willamette in 1943 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree after three years at the school.&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; While at the school he lost his only election, for student body president.&lt;ref&gt;Eells, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatfield joined the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] after graduation,&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; taking part in the [[World War II]] battles at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] as a [[landing craft]] officer where he witnessed the carnage of the war.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; A [[lieutenant]], he also witnessed the effects of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], as one of the first Americans to see the ruins of the city (later, as Senator, Hatfield opposed arms proliferation and the [[Vietnam War]]).&lt;ref name=retire/&gt;&lt;ref name=record/&gt; After Japan, he served in [[French Indochina]], where he witnessed firsthand the wealth divide between the peasant Vietnamese and the colonial French bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; After his discharge, he spent one year at [[Willamette University College of Law|Willamette’s law school]], but decided politics or teaching better suited him.&lt;ref name=teaching&gt;[Mark Hatfield]. ''[[Statesman Journal]]'', March 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eells, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatfield then enrolled at [[Stanford University]], where he obtained a [[master's degree]] in political science in 1948.&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; He returned to Salem and Willamette after Stanford and began working as an assistant professor in political science.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; During his tenure as professor, he built a political base by sending out messages and speaking at any public forum where he could get an invitation.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt;

[[File:Mark Hatfield 1950.jpg|thumb|Hatfield in 1950]]
Mark Hatfield's career in public office spanned five decades as he held office in both the legislative and executive branches of Oregon's state government, including two terms as governor.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; On the national stage he became the longest serving [[List of United States Senators from Oregon|U.S. Senator from Oregon]] and a candidate for the [[List of United States Republican Party presidential tickets|Republican Vice Presidential nomination]] in 1968. In the U.S. Senate he would twice serve as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], and twice be investigated for possible ethics violations.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt;

===Oregon===
In 1950 while teaching [[political science]] and serving as dean of students at Willamette, Hatfield began his political career by winning election to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] as a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/Pages/records/legislators_guide.aspx Oregon Legislative Assembly (46th) 1951 Regular Session.] Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated six others for the seat at a time when state assembly elections were still determined by county-wide votes.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; He served for two terms representing [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion County]] and Salem in the lower chamber of the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/Pages/records/legislators_guide.aspx Oregon Legislative Assembly (47th) 1953 Regular Session.] Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was the youngest legislator in Oregon and still lived at his parents' home.&lt;ref name=page25&gt;Eells, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Hatfield would teach early-morning classes and then walk across the street to the Capitol to legislate.&lt;ref name=page25/&gt;

In 1952 he won re-election to his seat in the Oregon House. He also received national attention for his early support for coaxing [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to run for President of the United States as a Republican.&lt;ref name=page27&gt;Eells, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This earned him a spot as a delegate at the [[Republican National Convention]] that year.&lt;ref name=page27/&gt;

While in college he saw firsthand the discrimination against African Americans in Salem when he was tasked by his fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, after a dinner with driving their guest, black artist [[Paul Robeson]] back to Portland, as African Americans were prohibited from staying in hotels in Salem.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; In 1953, he introduced and passed legislation in the House that prohibited discrimination based on race in public accommodations before federal legislation and court decisions did so on a national level.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; In 1954, Hatfield ran and won a seat in the [[Oregon State Senate]] representing Marion County.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/Pages/records/legislators_guide.aspx Oregon Legislative Assembly (48th) 1955 Regular Session.] Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While in the legislature, he continued to apply the grassroots strategy he learned from Earl Snell, but expanded it to cover the entire state to increase his political base.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt;

After serving in the state senate,&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt; he became the youngest [[Oregon Secretary of State|secretary of state]] in Oregon history after winning election in 1956 at age 34. Hatfield defeated fellow state senator [[Monroe Sweetland]] for the office, receiving 51.3% of the vote in the November general election.&lt;ref name=election1956&gt;Swarthout, John M. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/444252 The 1956 Election in Oregon.] ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 10, No. 1. (March, 1957), pp. 142–150.&lt;/ref&gt; He took office on January 7, 1957, and remained until he resigned on January 12, 1959.&lt;ref name=sos&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/explore/notable/secretaries-of-state.aspx Oregon Blue Book: Secretaries of State of Oregon.] Oregon Secretary of State. Retrieved on March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his first run for [[Governor of Oregon]] in 1958, the Republican Party opposed his candidacy going into the primary election.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; The large political base he had cultivated allowed him to win the party's primary despite the party's opposition.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; In the primary he defeated [[Oregon State Treasurer]] Sig Unander for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref name=gov1958&gt;Swarthout, John M. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/444061 "The 1958 Election in Oregon."] ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 12, No. 1, Part 2. (March, 1959), pp. 328–344.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1958, after the primary election, Hatfield married Antoinette Kuzmanich, a counselor at Portland State College (now [[Portland State University]]).&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; The marriage during the campaign drew some attention as the Catholic Kuzmanich converted to Hatfield's Baptist religion.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; The couple would have four children: Elizabeth, Mark Jr., Theresa and Charles ("Visko"). He continued his campaign for the governor's office after the wedding, but avoided most public appearances with fellow Republican candidates for office and did not mention them during his campaign, despite requests by other Republicans for joint appearances.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt;

In the November general election Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent [[Robert D. Holmes]].&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; In the final days of the campaign U.S. Senator [[Wayne Morse]], a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Travis. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/443997 "The 1958 Hatfield Campaign in Oregon"]. ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 12, No. 2 (June, 1959), Western Political Science Association. pp. 568-571.&lt;/ref&gt; This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments, as did Holmes and other Democrats.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, who would have to resign to become governor.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt; Hatfield appointed [[Howell Appling, Jr.]] to the office,&lt;ref name=sos/&gt; and O'Hara challenged the appointment in state court. The [[Oregon Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Hatfield on the [[Oregon Constitution|constitutional issue]], with the appointment of Appling confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;''State ex rel. O'Hara v. Appling'', 215 Or. 303, 334 P.2d 482 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.&lt;ref name=gov1958/&gt;

In 1962 Hatfield had been considered a possible candidate to run against Morse for his Senate seat, but Hatfield instead ran for re-election.&lt;ref name=gov1962&gt;Balmer, Donald G. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/444960 "The 1962 Election in Oregon"]. ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 2, A Symposium: The 1962 Elections in the West (June, 1963), Western Political Science Association. pp. 453-459.&lt;/ref&gt; He faced [[Oregon Attorney General]] [[Robert Y. Thornton]] in the general election, winning with 345,497&amp;nbsp;votes to Thorton's 265,359.&lt;ref name=gov1962/&gt; He became the state's first two-term governor in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century when he was re-elected in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House Report 104-587 – Designation of Mark O.

Hatfield gave the keynote speech at the 1964 [[Republican National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]] that nominated [[Barry Goldwater]] and served as temporary chairman of the party during the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Herbert|last=Waltzer|title=In the Magic Lantern: Television Coverage of the 1964 National Conventions |jstor= 2747369|journal=''The Public Opinion Quarterly'' |volume=30 |number=1 |date= Spring 1966 |publisher=American Association for Public Opinion Research |pages= 33–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated a moderate approach for the party and opposed the extreme conservatism associated with Goldwater and his supporters.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; He also was the only governor to vote against a resolution by the [[National Governors' Conference]] supporting the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson Administration's]] policy on the [[Vietnam War]], as Hatfield opposed the war, but pledged "unqualified and complete support" for the troops.&lt;ref name=timevietnam&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840678,00.html The Viet Nam Race.] [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], October 14, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred the use of [[economic sanctions]] to end the war.&lt;ref name=timevietnam/&gt;

Hatfield was a popular Governor who supported Oregon's traditional industries of timber and agriculture, but felt that in the postwar era expansion of industry and funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, Mark O., and Diane N. Solomon. ''Against the Grain: Reflections of a Rebel Republican''. Ashland, OR: White Cloud Press, 2001. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state's economy, such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; As part of the initiative, he helped to found the [[Oregon Graduate Center]] in what is now the [[Silicon Forest]] in [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=ogc&gt;Nelson, Bryce.

Limited to two terms as governor, Hatfield announced his candidacy in the [[United States Senate election in Oregon, 1966|1966 U.S. Senate election]] for the seat vacated by the retiring [[Maurine Neuberger]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], and during an election year, he was the only person to vote against a resolution by a governors' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966.&lt;ref name=election1966&gt;Balmer, Donald G.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the war was supported by 75&amp;nbsp;percent of the public, and was also supported by Hatfield's opponent in the November election.&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; He won the primary election with 178,782 votes compared to a combined 56,760&amp;nbsp;votes for three opponents.&lt;ref name=election1966/&gt; Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman [[Robert B. Duncan|Robert Duncan]] in the election.&lt;ref name=election1966/&gt; In order to finish his term as governor, which ended on January 9, 1967, he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3.&lt;ref name="congbio"/&gt;

Hatfield's re-election victory for governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on [[Richard Nixon]]'s short list for [[vice president]],&lt;ref name=retire/&gt; and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. [[Billy Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Billy. ''Just As I Am: The Autobiography of Billy Graham''.

As a senator Hatfield took positions that made him hard to classify politically.

In 1981, Hatfield served as the chairman of the Congressional [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|Joint Committee on Presidential Inaugurations]], overseeing the first inauguration of [[Ronald Reagan]] in January of that year.

[[File:MaríaNieves-TangoArgentino.jpg|thumb|160px|María Nieves (2011)]]
'''María Nieves Rego''' (born September 6, 1934)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/english/artists/biography/798/Maria-Nieves/|title=Biography of María Nieves by José María Otero - Todotango.com|website=www.todotango.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Argentine tango]] dancer and choreographer who starred in the 1983 musical ''[[Tango Argentino (musical)#Tango Argentino .28musical.29|Tango Argentino]]''.

==Early life==
Born in the [[Saavedra, Buenos Aires|Saavedra]] district of [[Buenos Aires]], she was the daughter of modest [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]]n emigrants. After her father died, she left school in the 4th grade to work as a maid in [[La Boca]]. She was introduced to the tango by her elder sister known as La Ñata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todotango.com/spanish/creadores/mnieves.asp|title=María Nieves|author=José María Otero|publisher=|accessdate= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nieves and [[Juan Carlos Copes]] brought the tango and the [[Milonga (dance)|milonga]] to audiences throughout the world.&lt;ref name=js/&gt; By 1956 Nieves and Copes had created a dance based on music by [[Astor Piazzolla]] but it was after touring through Central America, Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico and Cuba that they were asked to meet Piazzolla in [[Mexico City]]. The three of them shared tango music and got on well together. They flew to Puerto Rico in October 1959 where they packed out [[Club Flamboyan]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] with "Companina Argentina Tangolandia". Piazzolla was serving as the musical director and he dreamt of taking them to North America. The tour continued in New York, Chicago and then Washington. The last show that the three of them did together was an appearance on CBS the only colour TV channel in the US. They featured on [[The Arthur Murray Party]] in April 1960.&lt;ref name=collier&gt;{{cite book|last=Collier|first=María Susana Azzi; Simon|title=Le grand tango: the life and music of Astor Piazzolla|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0195127773|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195127773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They continued to be dance partners for decades. In the 1980s, they created and starred in ''Tango Argentino''.&lt;ref name=groppa/&gt; The show's run had to be extended as Nieves and Copes had been only booked for a week. It moved to another theatre in October and continued there until the following year. With different dancers, it went on for a number of years in New York. In 1986, it received [[Tony Award]] nominations for best musical, best director, and best choreographer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/List-of-Nominees-for-1986-Tony-Awards-With-PM-Tonys/id-8654f37e434fe1c53b5b3ec23a16d87e|title=List of Nominees for 1986 Tony Awards With PM-Tonys|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=6 May 1986|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the [[40th Tony Awards]] show a dance excerpt from ''Tango Argentino'' was performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/ceremonies/200909161253133942703.html|title=1986 - 40th annual Tony Awards|publisher=Tony Award Productions|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''The tango in the United States : a history'' incorrectly reported that the show had won a tony Award.&lt;ref name=groppa&gt;{{cite book|last=Groppa|first=Carlos G.|title=The tango in the United States: a history|year=2004|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0786414065|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0786414065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nieves and Copes went on tour with ''Tango Argentino'' in 1999 before starring in ''Tanguera'' (2002) in Buenos Aires, New York, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and then in the [[West End theatre|West End]] (2010). Nieves was given the role of the brothel keeper as she is thought of as essential to a tango production.&lt;ref name=js&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/7900116/Tanguera-bringing-tango-to-the-West-End.html|title=Tanguera: bringing tango to the West End|author=Jessica Salter|work=The Telegraph|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=4 March 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent acclaim==

Now in her late 70s, María Nieves offers a simple explanation for her success despite never having had a dancing lesson: "The first time I danced the tango, it entered my skin through my feet, passed from my skin to my blood and through my blood to my heart. It requires no [[acrobatics]], you simply have to devote yourself to your heartbeat."&lt;ref name=js/&gt;

The '''Megaupload legal case''' concerns a number of related criminal indictments and enforcement actions taken against [[Megaupload]] owner [[Kim Dotcom]] in various jurisdictions. On 19 January 2012 the [[United States Department of Justice]] seized and shut down the file-hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced [[criminal case]]s against its owners and others. On 20 January 2012 [[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Customs]] froze more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars (US$39 million) in assets belonging to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Yung, Chester |title= Hong Kong Freezes Megaupload Assets |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204301404577174362457114578?mod=googlenews_wsj |work=The Wall Street Journal |date= 21 January 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests in New Zealand==
Acting upon a US Federal prosecutor's request, the [[New Zealand Police]] arrested Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives in a leased $30 million mansion at [[Coatesville, New Zealand|Coatesville]] near [[Auckland]] on Friday, 20 January 2012 ([[Time in New Zealand|NZDT]], UTC+13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 23 January, Dotcom appeared in Auckland's North Shore [[District Court of New Zealand|District Court]] for a bail hearing. The crown argued against bail on the basis that he was a flight risk with a helicopter on his front lawn, while defence lawyers argued that the helicopter could not fly far enough to reach another country. They also said that Dotcom denied any criminal wrongdoing. Judge David McNaughton expressed concern at the discovery of two shotguns at Dotcom's mansion during the police raid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Megaupload-accused-Kim-Schmitz-in-court-helicopter-part-of-bail-debate/tabid/423/articleID/240281/Default.aspx |title=Megaupload accused Kim Schmitz in court, helicopter part of bail debate |publisher=3news.co.nz |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deferred a decision on whether to grant bail, saying that he needed more time to review the submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577178830739157386?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Judge Delays Kim Dotcom Bail Decision |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012 |first=Lucy |last=Craymer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request for bail was turned down, with Judge McNaughton saying that "he was denied due to the risk [that] Mr. Dotcom would flee jurisdiction and the possibility that if he reached Germany he wouldn't be extradited to face the charges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordswithmeaning.org/2012/01/megaupload-founder-has-been-denied-bail/ |title=Megaupload Founder has been DENIED Bail |publisher=Wordswithmeaning.org |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2012, an appeal to the [[High Court of New Zealand]] upheld the decision to deny bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16869788|title=Megaupload co-founder's bail appeal rejected by court|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 February 2012|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 2012, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned the previous rulings and granted bail to Kim Dotcom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordswithmeaning.org/2012/02/kim-dotcom-released-from-prison|title=WordswithMeaning! -      Kim Dotcom Released From Prison|work=WordswithMeaning!|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that the risk of flight had diminished after his assets had been seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17122866|title=Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom granted bail|publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2012|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2012, a formal request for the [[extradition]] to the United States of Kim Dotcom and three other senior Megaupload staff was filed in a New Zealand court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17257308|title=Megaupload founder extradition papers filed by US|publisher=BBC News |date=5 March 2012|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that around $750,000 of Kim Dotcom's assets could be returned, including a [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG]] and [[Toyota Alphard|Toyota Vellfire]] that had been seized during the raid on his home. The assets in 63 bank accounts and around thirty other vehicles remained in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/megaupload-founder-kim-schmitz-assets-worth-750000-returned-44480.html |title=Megaupload Founder Kim Schmitz: Assets Worth $750,000 Returned |publisher=autoevolution.com |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paperwork error by the New Zealand authorities meant that Kim Dotcom's property had been seized in January 2012 without giving proper notice. The restraining order on his property was granted in April 2012. During April 2012, US district court judge [[Liam O'Grady]] stated "I frankly don't know that we are ever going to have a trial in this matter," as he found out that the company had never been formally served with criminal papers by the US.&lt;ref name="grady"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=David|title=Dotcom trial may not occur - Judge|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10800409|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2012, [[High Court of New Zealand|New Zealand High Court]] judge Justice Helen Winkelmann ruled that the [[search warrant]]s used to raid the home of Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying "The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18623043|title=Megaupload raid warrant 'invalid', New Zealand judge says|publisher=BBC News |date=28 June 2012|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2012, a decision on whether Kim Dotcom and other Megaupload employees should be extradited to the United States was delayed until March 2013, in order to allow further time for legal arguments to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18779866#|title=Megaupload extradition case delayed until March 2013|publisher=BBC News |date=10 July 2012|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, it was delayed until August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10855130| title=Dotcom extradition case delayed until August| date=19 December 2012| publisher= New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the [[Government Communications Security Bureau]] (GCSB),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-wins-right-to-sue-Govt-spies/tabid/423/articleID/289342/Default.aspx|work=[[3 News NZ]] | title= Dotcom wins right to sue Govt spies| date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10869764 |work=NZ Herald |title=Dotcom wins right to sue| date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Crown-wants-GCSB-exluded-from-Dotcom-case/tabid/423/articleID/286755/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Crown wants GCSB exluded from Dotcom case| date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/128063/judge-describes-dotcom-case-as-a-procedural-mess |work=[[Radio NZ]]|title=Judge describes Dotcom case as a procedural mess| date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 2014, a New Zealand appeals court overruled the 28 June 2012 decision, declaring the search warrants against Kim Dotcom to be valid. Dotcom's extradition hearing was set for July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tajitsu|first=Naomi|title=NZ court rules Megaupload warrant legal, dealing blow to Dotcom|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/19/us-newzealand-megaupload-warrant-idUSBREA1I02F20140219|work=Reuters|publisher=Thompson Reuters|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that the New Zealand Police is to return seized electronic devices unencrypted back to Dotcom and those involved.&lt;ref name="winforDotcom"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11320761 | title=A win for Dotcom over seized property | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=8 September 2014 | accessdate=9 September 2014 | author=Bayer, Kurt | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Megaupload Indictment|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/78786408/Mega-Indictment|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Shuts Offshore File-Share 'Locker'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204616504577171060611948408|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged that Megaupload differed from other online [[File hosting service|file storage businesses]].

Media reports covering the case highlighted a number of points from the indictment used to support claims of illegal activity. The indictment provided a number of instances alleged to show criminal behaviour, as well as indicating design points of Megaupload's [[business model|operating model]] as being evidence of [[intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]]:&lt;ref name="indictment" /&gt;

# In practice, the "vast majority" of users do not have any significant long term private storage capability. Continued storage is dependent upon regular downloads of the file occurring. Files not downloaded are rapidly removed in most cases, whereas popular downloaded files are retained. (items 7&amp;nbsp;– 8)
# Because only a small portion of users pay for storage, the business is dependent upon advertising. Adverts are primarily viewed when files are downloaded and the business model is therefore not based upon storage but upon maximising downloads. (items 7&amp;nbsp;– 8)
# Persons indicted have "instructed individual users how to locate links to infringing content on the Mega Sites ... [and] ... have also shared with each other comments from Mega Site users demonstrating that they have used or are attempting to use the Mega Sites to get infringing copies of copyrighted content." (item 13)
# Persons indicted, unlike the public, are not reliant upon links to stored files, but can search the internal database directly. It is claimed they have "searched the internal database for their associates and themselves so that they may directly access copyright-infringing content". (item 14)
# A comprehensive takedown method is in use to identify [[child pornography]], but not deployed to remove infringing content. (item 24)
# Infringing users did not have their accounts terminated, and the defendants "made no significant effort to identify users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of infringing copies of copyrighted materials, or to identify infringing copies of copyrighted works" (item 55–56)
# An incentivising program was adopted encouraging the upload of "popular" files in return for payments to successful uploaders. (item 69e ''et al.'')
# Defendants explicitly discussed evasion and infringement issues, including an attempt to copy and upload the entire content of YouTube. (items 69i-l. YouTube: items 69 i,j,l,s)

=== Counter arguments advanced ===
Schmitz hired the services of Ira Rothken, an attorney who defended several copyright infringement cases. Rothken claims that the raid was unjustly swift and did not give his client the opportunity to defend himself, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of a completely different turnout.&lt;ref name="def"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-57362609-261/megaupload-assembles-worldwide-criminal-defense/ | title=Megaupload assembles worldwide criminal defense | publisher=[[CNET]] | date=20 January 2012 | accessdate=20 January 2012 | author=Sandoval, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| first=Cecilia| last=Kang| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/megaupload-lawyer-qanda-on-doj-criminal-case/2012/01/20/gIQA3HJhDQ_story.html| title=Megaupload lawyer Q&amp;A on DOJ criminal case| publisher=[[Washington Post]]| date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal commentators point out that while the indictment may be correct and Megaupload might have acted as a criminal conspiracy as claimed, a number of points in the indictment are based upon selective interpretations and legal concepts (described in one article as "novel theories" of the law&lt;ref name="latimes novel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2012/01/copyrights-feds-push-novel-theories-in-megaupload-case.html|title=Opinion L.A.|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and could be challenged in court. An [[L.A. Times]] analysis stated that the author was "struck by how far the indictment goes to find something nefarious";&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; likewise a [[TechDirt]] analysis concluded that while the [[Kim Dotcom|founder of Megaupload]] had a significant history of "flaunting the law", evidence has potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could "come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services".&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120120/00373617487/megaupload-details-raise-significant-concerns-about-what-doj-considers-evidence-criminal-behavior.shtml| title=Megaupload Details Raise Significant Concerns About What DOJ Considers Evidence Of Criminal Behavior| first=Mike| last=Masnick| publisher=techdirt| date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both analyses concur that other evidence could show criminality; the concerns were not irrefutable. The legal concerns included:

:* Indictment cites lack of a site search as evidence supporting criminality, but in other copyright cases having a site search has been described as evidence in support of criminality and in ''[[Legal aspects of file sharing#Legal issues relevant to file sharing|Atari v. RapidShare]]'' &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; having a site search was agreed by the court as evidence of responsible activity given that some infringing content might exist and be searched for if one existed.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; In the case of ''Isohunt'', the ''presence'' of a search feature was interpreted as evidence of inducement.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt; [[TechDirt]] commented that "To use the lack of a feature, that previously was shown to be a problem, as evidence of a conspiracy is crazy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't."&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* The "top 100" list excluded copyrighted titles, but the indictment claims this was evidence of concealing, rather than avoiding downloads of, infringing materials.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* The indictment asserts as evidence that no effort was made to identify infringing files or users, in other words by acts of omission. But federal court rulings repeatedly agree that no duty exists to search these out.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; In particular, in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'' the Supreme Court looked at "substantial noninfringing uses"; mere lack of monitoring was not by itself sufficient to show wrongdoing or inducement.&lt;ref name="latimes novel" /&gt; It may not be possible (or reasonable to require) the host to know and identify what activity is legitimate or not, as file sharing may be used by many content creators.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Deletion after a limited period of non-download is suggested as evidence of a motive. But many legitimate sites such as [[Imgur]] remove unused content after a while to free up server space. If files were routinely deleted after a short period it could equally suggest legitimate use - because it serves users who share legitimately for a short while, and enforces removal afterwards.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Much of the indictment, in the words of one analysis, "seems to be based on the simple assumption that encouraging more usage means they must be encouraging infringement", in other words there should be evidence of actual wrongdoing, not merely evidence of popular use. Many legitimate files are popular and popularly shared, and an assumption that paid use largely equates to infringing use would need evidence.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Failure to remove all links following a takedown request is often legitimate. For example the same content may be uploaded by legitimate and illegitimate users. Removing the infringing ''link'' does not affect legitimate uploaders. Removing the infringing ''file'' would wrongfully cause it to be deleted for legitimate users too.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt; Similarly, once child pornography is identified, it is ''always'' illegal for ''all'' users. But other material may be legal for some users and not for others. So the fact one case requires ''file'' removal and the other only requires ''link'' removal may well be correct conduct.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* The indictment includes [[money laundering]] charges. But these include "basic payments" for web hosting, suggesting "lumping in" — adding matters that are in no way illegal to make a case look bad.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;
:* Megaupload had indicated willingness to attend court in the U.S. already, and answer civil cases.&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis" /&gt;

===Safe harbor provisions===
The US [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] provides [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for sites that promptly take down infringing content. Safe harbor does not exist if the site has [[actual knowledge]] and does nothing about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload.ars |title=Why the feds smashed Megaupload |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Megaupload's case, the indictment alleges DMCA provisions were used for the appearance of legitimacy&amp;nbsp;– the actual material was not removed, only some links to it were, takedowns agreement was approved based on business growth rather than infringement, and the parties themselves openly discussed their infringing activities. The indictment claims that Megaupload executives:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or alternatively know facts or circumstances that would make infringing material apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity where the provider can control that activity; and have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright infringing material from servers they control.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 20, page 9 of the indictment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prosecutors claimed in the indictment that Megaupload was not DMCA compliant, and cited the example of an alleged infringer on the site known as "VV." Over six years, VV had allegedly uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, resulting in more than 334 million views. According to prosecutors, although numerous takedown e-mails had been sent, none of the files had been deleted.&lt;ref name="DMCA"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/17/justice/megaupload-com-indictment/| title=Feds broaden piracy case against Megaupload.com|publisher=CNN | date=18 February 2012 | accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a television interview with [[3 News]], Kim Dotcom denied being a "piracy king", and claimed that Megaupload had applied the provisions of the DMCA and went beyond it, by giving copyright holders direct rights to delete links. He also claimed that the indictment relied on a malicious interpretation of technical issues to construe its claim of criminal intent, and that there was significant legal use of Megaupload.&lt;ref name="3news"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcoms-first-TV-interview-Im-no-piracy-king/tabid/817/articleID/244830/Default.aspx| title=Kim Dotcom's first TV interview: 'I'm no piracy king'| publisher=[[3 News]]| date=1 March 2012| accessdate=28 April 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729131119/http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcoms-first-TV-interview-Im-no-piracy-king/tabid/817/articleID/244830/Default.aspx| archivedate=29 July 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal defense action==
Kim Dotcom denied the charges filed against him, and retained the services of [[Ira P. Rothken]], an attorney who has defended several copyright infringement cases. Ira Rothken stated that there is no criminal liability for secondary copyright infringement under US law, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of similar accusations which were dealt with as a civil case.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Dotcom initially hired Washington, D.C. attorney [[Robert S. Bennett|Robert Bennett]], who had confirmed that he was going to represent Megaupload in the piracy case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/dc-attorney-robert-bennett-to-represent-megaupload-in-piracy-case-promises-vigorous-defense/2012/01/20/gIQAPCzGEQ_story.html |title=DC attorney Robert Bennett to represent Megaupload in piracy case, promises vigorous defense |work=Washington Post |date= 20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2012/01/20/renowned_attorney_bennett_to_represent_megaupload_1327113598/ |title=Renowned attorney Bennett to represent Megaupload |work=Associated Press |date= 20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 January 2012, Bennett withdrew from the case due to a conflict of interest with another client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/22/megauploads-high-profile-defense-lawyer-robert-bennett-withdraws-from-piracy-case/ |title=megauploads high-profile defense lawyer robert bennett withdraws from piracy case |work=National Post |location=Canada  |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingram |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/22/us-usa-megaupload-bennett-idUSTRE80L0UV20120122 |title=Reuters.com |agency=Reuters |date= 22 January 2012|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 23 January, barrister Paul Davison QC was quoted as representing Megaupload's founder, Kim Dotcom, in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Megaupload boss says innocent, rival stops file-sharing |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/01/23/internet-piracy-megaupload-idUKL4E8CN3X620120123 |work=Reuters |date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nzbar.org.nz/Person?Action=Profile&amp;Person_id=425| title=Paul Davison QC| publisher= NZ Barr Association| accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of April 2012, a controversy emerged over legal representation. The law firm [[Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan|Quinn Emanuel]], retained by Megaupload to argue for the retention of Megaupload's data, claimed in a motion filed to the court that there was a concerted effort by the [[United States Department of Justice]] to deny Megaupload fair legal representation. In the brief, Quinn Emanuel alleged that several law firms had dropped out of the case after the DoJ wrote to them over potential conflicts of interest, arguing that they wanted to call clients of the firms as witnesses. Given the size of the Megaupload, Quinn Emanuel claimed that this "conflict of interest" argument could be applied to any law firm with experience in intellectual property rights, denying Megaupload experienced representation in a case where both law and technical issues are involved. Quinn Emanuel received such a letter but rejected the DoJ's arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/04/government-trying-to-deny-megaupload-legal-representation.ars?clicked=related_right|title=Government trying to deny Megaupload fair legal representation|publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Techdirt]] argued that while the [[Kim Dotcom|founder of Megaupload]] had a significant history of "flouting the law", evidence had potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could "come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services".&lt;ref name="techdirt analysis"/&gt; [[Eric Goldman]], a professor of law at [[Santa Clara University]], described the Megaupload case as "a depressing display of abuse of government authority". He pointed out that criminal copyright infringement requires that willful infringement has taken place, and that taking Megaupload offline had produced the "deeply unconstitutional effect" of denying legitimate users of the site access to their data.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Eric|title=Comments on the Megaupload Prosecution (a Long-Delayed Linkwrap)|url=http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2012/04/megaupload.htm|work=Technology &amp; Marketing Blog|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other legal commentators have disagreed with Goldman's assessment of the copyright charges, concluding that the allegations in the indictment, if proven, would support a guilty finding on charges of aiding and abetting copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="Benton Martin"&gt;{{citation|last=Benton Martin |first=Jeremiah Newhall |title=Criminal Copyright Enforcement against Filesharing Services |date=6 March 2013 |ssrn=2229376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor James Grimmelmann, for example, commented, "If proven at trial, there's easily enough in the indictment to prove criminal copyright infringement many times over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload.ars |title=Why the feds smashed Megaupload |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713194540/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload/ |archivedate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense has drawn on procedural errors by the prosecution to challenge the case. In a judgement in the end of May, NZ Judge David Harvey granted the defendants the right to the disclosure of evidence against them held by the FBI in preparation for the extradition trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/digital-notes-judge-presses-u-s-in-megaupload-case/ | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | title=Digital Notes: Judge Presses U.S. in Megaupload Case | date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 81-page decision, he came to the assessment that the DoJ is attempting to use concepts of civil law, in particular secondary copyright infringement, in a criminal case, which creates legal issues. He also confirmed that the charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/95215045/Torrent-Freak-Mega-Extra|title=Torrent Freak Mega Extra|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate development in the United States, the defense has challenged the case against Megaupload as a whole, claiming that the US has no jurisdiction over a foreign company and that the seizure of Megaupload's assets was unlawful.&lt;ref name="nojurisdiction"&gt;{{Cite Pacer

==Data retention==
Following the seizure of Megaupload, concerns were raised as to what would happen to the files that had been uploaded by its users.&lt;ref name=Chloe1&gt;{{cite news|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|title=Megaupload Shutdown Targets Pirates ...

In response, on 30 January 2012, Carpathia Hosting denied having access to MegaUpload files and issued a press release stating

&lt;blockquote&gt;Carpathia Hosting does not have, and has never had, access to the content on MegaUpload servers and has no mechanism for returning any content residing on such servers to MegaUpload's customers. The reference to the 2 February 2012 date in the Department of Justice letter for the deletion of content is not based on any information provided by Carpathia to the U.S. Government.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has started a campaign to allow legitimate users of Megaupload in the US access to their data and wants the data preserved for that reason. It has chosen to represent one such legitimate user in court and thus has sided with Megaupload and Carpathia in asking the court to retain the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/megaupload-user-asks-court-return-his-video-files| title=Megaupload User Asks Court to Return His Video Files| date=30 March 2012| publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2012, Megaupload data negotiations began. Carpathia reported that maintaining the data costs over 9,000 USD a day, and wanted to seek a formal resolution on whether to delete the data or release it to interested parties. United States district court Judge Liam O'Grady ordered all parties to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that 35 million USD had been paid by Megaupload to Carpathia, and alleged that Carpathia had knowingly profited from copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/us-megauploads-hosting-company-might-be-sued-next-120415/|title=US: Megaupload's Hosting Company Might be Sued Next - TorrentFreak|work=TorrentFreak|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retaliatory attacks by Anonymous==
Following the shutdown of the Megaupload website, the website of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and a number of other websites were taken offline following concerted [[denial of service]] attacks attributed to [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anonymous in revenge attack for MegaUpload shutdown|url=http://blogs.ft.com/fttechhub/2012/01/anonymous-megaupload-ddos/#axzz1k55k0F00|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11371315|title=Activists target recording industry websites|date=20 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8013548/Music-and-film-industry-websites-targeted-in-cyber-attacks.html|title=Music and film industry websites targeted in cyber attacks|last=Beaumont|first=Claudine|date=20 September 2012|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other reactions==
Former French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said he was satisfied with the shutdown of the website. He found the site's operators were reaping "criminal profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works". "The time has come for increased judicial and police co-operation between states" in the fight against online piracy, he said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI unplugs top piracy site|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/fbi-unplugs-top-piracy-site/story-e6frg6so-1226249800286|work=The Australian|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web organisations have raised concerns about possible effects of the Megaupload case on the future of [[file sharing]], [[cloud storage]], and [[Internet commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/technology/antipiracy-case-sends-shivers-through-some-legitimate-storage-sites.html Antipiracy Case Sends Shivers Through Some Legitimate Storage Sites ([[New York Times]], 20 January 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/megaupload-shutdown-raises-new-internet-sharing-fears/2012/01/20/gIQATHRtEQ_story.html|title=Megaupload shutdown raises new Internet-sharing fears|work=Washington Post|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-01-20/megaupload-arrests-FBI/52697186/1|title=Takedown of Megaupload leads to fears Internet commerce will suffer – USATODAY.com|work=USATODAY.COM|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators including [[John C.

People who used Megaupload for personal and business storage, such as large audio and video files for family and work, have also voiced their complaints about the fact that they no longer had access to their files on the service.&lt;ref name="ars users"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodkin |first=Jon |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2012/01/megaupload-wasnt-just-for-pirates-angry-users-out-of-luck-for-now.ars |title=Megaupload wasn't just for pirates: angry users out of luck for now |publisher=Arstechnica.com |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albanesius |first=Chloe |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399162,00.asp |title=Recovering Legitimate Megaupload Files?

There are a number of similar sites for this use, but Megaupload was always the fastest".&lt;ref name="ars users" /&gt;

In response to the shutdown, a number of other file hosting websites changed the functionality of their services. FileSonic.com, one of the top ten [[file hosting service]]s, withdrew the ability to share links to files. The site's main page added a banner stating "All sharing functionality on FileSonic is now disabled. Our service can only be used to upload and retrieve files that you have uploaded personally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FileSonic disables file sharing in wake of MegaUpload arrests|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57363594-93/filesonic-disables-file-sharing-in-wake-of-megaupload-arrests/|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=23 January 2012|date=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other file hosting websites followed suit, including FileServe.com, FileJungle.com, Uploadstation.com, x7.to and 4shared.com, by shutting down, cancelling affiliate programs or allowing users to only download what they themselves uploaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberlocker Ecosystem Shocked As Big Players Take Drastic Action|url=http://torrentfreak.com/cyberlocker-ecosystem-shocked-as-big-players-take-drastic-action-120123/|work=torrentfreak.com|accessdate=23 January 2012|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another large file-sharing website, Uploaded.to, ceased services for users accessing from United States-based IP addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologymob.com/2012/01/filesonic-and-uploaded-to-bow-out-in-light-of-recent-events/ |title=FileSonic and Uploaded.to bow out in light of recent events |publisher=Technologymob.com |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BTJunkie]], a website indexing [[torrent file]]s, shut down voluntarily on 6 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/02/06/bittorrent-index-btjunkie-bites-the-dust/|title=BitTorrent Index BTjunkie Bites the Dust |work=Time |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The file hosting site Turbobit.net blocked access to U.S. visitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/turbobit-net-blocks-us-visitors-after-megaupload-shutdown-120207/|title=Turbobit.net Blocks US Visitors After MegaUpload Shutdown|publisher=TorrentFreak.net |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and QuickSilverScreen, a site offering [[streaming media|streaming video]] links, closed on 7 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/quicksilverscreen-streaming-site-calls-it-quits-120207/|title=QuickSilverScreen Streaming Links Site Calls It Quits|publisher=TorrentFreak.net |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other file hosting companies felt no need to change, with [[MediaFire]]'s CEO Derek Labian saying that he and his file hosting company are not concerned by the Megaupload incident because "Megaupload was making a ridiculous amount of money with a ridiculously bad service... We don't have a business built on copyright infringement."&lt;ref&gt;22 January 2012, [https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/22/mediafire-megaupload-business-model-piracy/ MediaFire CEO: Unlike Megaupload, our business model isn’t built on piracy], CloudBeat&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for [[RapidShare]] similarly expressed a lack of concern, saying that "file hosting itself is a legitimate business", pointing out that Microsoft's [[OneDrive]] operates on a similar basis.&lt;ref&gt;20 January 2012, [https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/rapidshare-not-concerned-about-megaupload-takedown.ars RapidShare "not concerned" about Megaupload takedown], Ars Technica&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Menachem Mendel Taub''' (born 1923) is the [[Rebbe]] of the [[Kaliv (Hasidic dynasty)|Kaliv]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[List of Hasidic dynasties|dynasty]]. Born in [[Transylvania]] in 1923, he is seventh in a direct paternal line to the founder of the dynasty, Rabbi Yitzchak Izak of Kaliv, a disciple of the Rebbe Reb [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]].

His second cousin, Rabbi Moshe Taub, is the Kalover Rebbe of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Aryeh. "Until the Last Yid". ''[[Mishpacha]]'', September 2, 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Menachem Mendel Taub is the son of Rabbi Yehuda Yechiel Taub, the Rozler Rov, and son-in-law of Grand Rabbi Pinchos Shapiro, the Kechneyer Rebbe, scion of the [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]] dynasty. He had six brothers and sisters.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; He married his first wife, Chana Sara Shapiro, before the start of World War II.&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Sparks-of-love-this-Lag-Baomer|first=Jeremy|last=Sharon|title=Sparks of Love This Lag Ba'omer|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=13 May 2014|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, he was deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], arriving there three days before [[Shavuot]]. While in Auschwitz, he was experimented upon by [[Josef Mengele]]. Because of "chemical burning experiments", he is unable to grow facial hair;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; he is also unable to have children.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} He was transferred from Auschwitz to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and the [[Breslau]] [[concentration camp]], and later to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Six months after the war ended, he reunited with his wife in [[Sweden]]. In 1947 they immigrated to the United States and settled in [[Cleveland]], Ohio.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Meir|last=Halachmi|title=תולדות החסידות בארץ ישראל |trans-title=History of Hasidism in Israel|volume=1|pages=540–542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later he moved his headquarters to [[Bnei Brak]].&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; In 2004, the rebbe's court moved to [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

==Activities==
Since World War II, the Rebbe has actively spoken about the Holocaust and frequently invokes the memory of the Jewish martyrs. He has encouraged the recital of "[[Shema Yisrael]]" to memorialize Holocaust victims at the conclusion of religious events in Israel.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/148876#.U3J96fmSzkU|title=Thousands of Jews Pray at Yosef's Tomb|first=Tzvi|last=Ben Gedalyahu|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=13 May 2014|work=[[Arutz Sheva|Israel National News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also traveled to interact with millions of [[Jews]] by telling his story and encouraging the saying of "Shema Yisrael". He is also active in [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|Jewish outreach]] and conducts regular lectures for groups of professionals, including doctors and police officers. In addition, a network of [[kollel]]s, an encyclopedia project, and several other divisions of Kaliv have been founded.

In March 2014 he participated in the annual conference of the Rabbinical Congress of Europe, which met in [[Budapest]] to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the destruction of [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jewry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lubavitch.com/news/article/2030765/European-Jewry-Anti-Semitism-Addressed-at-Rabbinical-Conference-in-Hungary.html|title=European Jewry, Anti-Semitism, Addressed at Rabbinical Conference in Hungary|first=Rena |last=Greenberg|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=13 May 2014|publisher=Lubavitch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered an emotion-laden speech in Hebrew, and switched to English to direct remarks to US President [[Barack Obama]] and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosizneias.com/159496/2014/03/25/budapest-in-moving-speech-at-holocust-commemoration-kalever-rebbe-warns-obama-and-putin-of-dangers-ahead/|title=Budapest - In Moving Speech At Holocaust Commemoration Kalever Rebbe Warns Obama And Putin Of Dangers Ahead|first=Sandy|last=Eller|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=13 May 2014|work=[[Vosizneias]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Millis Rowland Jefferis''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] [[Military Cross|MC]] (9 January 1899 – 5 September 1963) was a British military officer who founded a special unit of the British [[Ministry of Supply]] which developed unusual weapons during the [[Second World War]].

==Early career==
Born at Merstham, Surrey on 9 January 1899,&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office entry of birth, Jan-Mar 1899, Croydon registration district, Volume 2a Page 278&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferis was educated at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]].  From Woolwich he was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] on 6 June 1918 and after passing through the [[Royal School of Military Engineering|School of Military Engineering]] at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], he was posted to the First Field Squadron RE in the Rhine Army.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary &gt;''Sir Millis Jefferis New Weapons of War (Obituary)''. ''[[The Times]]'', 7 September 1963 p10 column E.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 he went to India and served with the [[Madras Engineer Group|Queen's Own Madras Sappers and Miners]] in the Third Field Troop at Sialkot. In 1922 he went into the Works Services in India as garrison engineer at [[Kohat]] and then at [[Spina Khaisora|Khaisora]] which is today in [[Pakistan]]. He saw active service in the [[Waziristan campaign (1936–1939)|Waziristan Campaign]] where his main responsibility was the construction of roads.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt; On 12 June 1923 he was awarded the [[Military Cross]], the citation read:

{{quote|''The War Office, 12th June, 1923.''

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the undermentioned rewards for distinguished service in the Field with the Razmak Force: —

''Awarded the Distinguished Service Order.''

Maj. Leslie Charles Bertram Deed, R.E.

''Awarded the Military Cross.''

Lt. Millis Rowland Jefferis, R.E.

For gallantry and devotion to duty whilst reconnoitring ahead of the road construction parties on the Isha-Razmak road between May and December, 1922, and in the supervision of the work. The satisfactory progress of the road was due in great measure to their efforts and disregard of danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32833|pages=4133–4134|date=12 June 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then returned to Chatham and went to [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt;

In 1925 he returned to India and was placed on special duty at [[Kabul]] in the foreign and political department. In 1926 he returned to [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]] as garrison engineer and spent several years in Works Services at [[Peshawar]] where he made full use of this engineering genius designing bridges.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt; Also in 1925, he married Ruth Carolyne, daughter of G. E. Wakefield. They had three sons, two of whom went on to serve in the Royal Engineers.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt; On 1 June 1929, Jefferis was promoted to [[captain (land)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33500|page=3587|date=31 May 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 he was posted to the [[Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners]] at Kirkee as a company commander in the training battalion.

==Second World War==

===Norway===
In 1940, Jefferis was sent to Norway, he returned to give a personal account of his activities to Prime Minister Winston Churchill who used his report to brief the War Cabinet:

{{quote|sign=|source=|The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account of the report which had been made personally to him by Major Jefferis. Major Jefferis had been sent out to Andalsnea with instructions to blow up the Western railway in Central Norway. He had accordingly gone down the railway line and joined Brigadier Morgan’s Brigade; but the Norwegians had categorically refused to allow him to carry out any demolitions. He had been present when Morgan’s Brigade had been engaged by the enemy. The Germans had attacked with artillery, tanks and armoured cars, which our troops had been without. Far more destructive of morale, however, had been the low-flying attacks with bombs and machine guns. Although the casualties had not been so great as from shell fire, the moral effect of seeing the aircraft coming, of being unable to take cover, of being able to observe the bomb dropping, and of the terrific explosion, had been overwhelming.

Jefferis had eventually found himself with the Germans behind him. Picking up a sergeant and two privates, he had succeeded in making his way back to Andalsnes; and on the way he had managed to blow up the girders of two bridges on the German side. He estimated that it would take some three weeks to repair these. At Andalsenes the conditions of air attack had been such as to make it quite impossible to walk down to the jetty during daylight hours. He had spent a day in a sloop in the harbour at which thirty bombs had been aimed. None had hit, but the immunity of a ship under such conditions could only be, in Major Jefferis’s opinion, a matter of time, and he calculated that his life would probably not be more than three days.

The general conclusion which he (the Prime Minister) drew from Major Jefferis’s account was that it was quite impossible for land forces to withstand complete air superiority of the kind which the Germans had enjoyed in Norway. This made it all the more imperative to the success of our operations at Narvik that we should establish air bases in that area, not only for fighters, but also for bombers.&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Archives]], [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=7&amp;CATID=-4279405 CAB 65/7/1], [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7965566 ''Conclusion of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10 Downing Street, SW1, on Wednesday, May 1, 1940 at 10:30 am''], pp. 5–6. (Free download available.)&lt;/ref&gt;}} For his service in Norway, Jefferis was awarded the Norwegian [[War Cross with sword]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35660|supp=y|page=3493|date=7 August 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mentioned in Despatches]] for his efforts in the withdrawal from [[Lillehammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35020|supp=y|pages=7200–7201|date=20 December 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7688597 Recommendations for honours and awards, Army—Image details—Jefferis, Millis Rowland—Mention in Despatches], ''DocumentsOnline'', [[The National Archives]] (fee usually required to view full original recommendation).  Retrieved on 6 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===MD1===
Jefferis started working on sabotage devices for the "Military Intelligence Research" (MIR). When MIR was combined with other ''hush-hush'' elements to form the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]], Jefferis' unit was not included and it instead became a department in the Ministry of Defence; the only unit of the Minister of Defence (The Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]]) and was known as "[[MD1]]", ultimately based in a house called "The Firs" in Whitchurch near [[Aylesbury]] in Buckinghamshire England.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1958, p63&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit was responsible for the design, development and production of a number of unique special forces and regular munitions during the Second World War. It gained the nickname "Winston Churchill's toyshop".

Jefferis was an explosives expert and engineer, but lacked the ability to manage men well. He was assisted in the management of MD1 by a wily assistant – Major [[Stuart Macrae (inventor)|Stuart Macrae]], whose book ''Winston Churchill's Toyshop'', is still one of the few published works on this unique unit.

Over the period of the Second World War, MD1 was responsible for the introduction into service of a total of 26 different devices.

Their designs include the [[PIAT]], the [[Sticky bomb]] and one of the first magnetic Limpet [[naval mines]].

Through the application of the Squash head and HEAT technology they had a role in the development and production of Lt-Col [[Stewart Blacker]]'s [[Blacker Bombard]], the PIAT (Blacker's smaller version of the bombard matched to a hollow charge warhead, [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] (effectively an adaption of the Bombard spigot mortar principle working with the Navy's [[Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]) and tank variants including the [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|AVRE]] with its "Flying Dustbin" 290mm Petard [[spigot mortar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remuseum.org.uk/articles/rem_article_assaultbridge.htm Royal Engineers Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625161850/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/articles/rem_article_assaultbridge.htm |date=25 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a bridge-laying tank.

Jefferis developed the idea of the squash head further. His most ambitious project was a bomb designed to sink [[capital ship]]s, his ideas were put forward by himself and [[Lord Cherwell]] in 1944 and coincided with the Admiralty's interest in developing a homing bomb for use against the Japanese. The development of this weapon was supported by the Air Staff and MAP who allocated it a higher priority that any other anti-capital ship weapon. When the war ended, development of the 'Cherwell-Jefferis' bomb was continued under the code names ''Journey's End'' and ''[[Blue Boar (bomb)|Blue Boar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Twigge 1996. pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Churchill became acquainted with then Major Jefferis in 1940 and regarded him as a "singularly capable and forceful man." He recommended a promotion to [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] so that Jefferis would have more authority.  Jefferis received substantive promotion to this rank on 10 February 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36576|supp=y|page=2977|date=20 June 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferis was promoted to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) by Churchill in the [[1945 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours]], having previously been appointed a Commander of the Order (CBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37227|supp=y|pages=4183–4184|date=14 August 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to acting [[Major General (United Kingdom)|major general]] on 15 May 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37236|supp=y|page=4274|date=21 August 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; and substantive [[colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] on 14 July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37245|supp=y|page=4377|date=28 August 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the Ministry of Supply on 20 November 1945, reverting to the temporary rank of brigadier.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37419|supp=y|page=233|date=1 January 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In 1945 Jefferis became deputy Engineer-in-Chief in India and 1947 he became Engineer-in-Chief in Pakistan, holding the temporary rank of major general.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt; He was promoted to substantive [[brigadier]] on 1 November 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38242|supp=y|page=2007|date=19 March 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to England on 2 January 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38922|supp=y|page=2617|date=26 May 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become Chief Superintendent of the Military Engineering Experimental Establishment,&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt; reverting to the rank of brigadier on 8 March 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38854|supp=y|page=1151|date=7 March 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made [[Aide de Camp|ADC to the King]] on 24 May 1951 and held that appointment until he retired on 18 August 1953, on his retirement he was granted the honorary rank of major-general.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39268|supp=y|page=3479|date=22 June 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39939|supp=y|page=4467|date=14 August 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an ADC, Jefferis took part in [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI's]] funeral, and [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation Procession]]&lt;ref&gt;''Processions''. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, 1 June 1953 p19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39575|supp=y|pages=3345–3351|date=17 June 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40020|supp=y|pages=6223–6227|date=17 November 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 5 September 1963.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt;

== Ocean racing ==

Jefferis had a passion for ocean racing. In 1938, he built a 7-ton yacht at Aldershot called ''Prelude'' with another Royal Engineer officer and they sailed successfully both before and after the war.&lt;ref name = Times_Obituary /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Times Yacht Racing" &gt;''Yacht Racing – The New Lloyd's''.

'''Pauline Elizabeth Smith''' (5 September 1933 – 19 March 2017) was a British provocateur and artist who specialised in [[mail art]]. In later life she became fascinated by astrology and the "charismatic appeal" of [[Adolf Hitler]]. She founded the Adolf Hitler Fan Club in order to test the limits of free speech and to provoke a reaction, which it did when the police raided her home.

== Early life ==
Smith was born in [[Kenya]] on 5 September 1933. Her father was a telecommunications engineer. The family lived in Uganda and Egypt before arriving in the United Kingdom in 1945. Smith was educated at a convent school in St. Albans which she left at the age of 16 against the wishes of her mother. She worked as a florist, a window dresser and for the [[BBC]] as a secretary.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;

Between 1962 and 1966 she took evening classes at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] where she was taught by [[Anthony Caro]] and [[Elizabeth Frink]]. She took classes at the [[Chelsea School of Art]] in 1966–67 under [[Jeremy Moon]], [[Robyn Denny]] and [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pauline-smith-obituary-m5xc7zxdc Pauline Smith.] ''[[The Times]]''. 12 June 2017. Retrieved 15 June 2017. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=axis /&gt; She spent two years as a school teacher from 1970 but left due to disillusionment about British teaching conditions.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;

== Art career ==

Smith's first solo exhibition was in 1969 and her photographs and paintings were also shown in London and New York. In the early 1970s she began to create mail art after she met [[Opal L. Nations]] and was invited to join the [[Global Infantilism]] group.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; She knew [[Anna Banana]], founder of ''Vile'' magazine, and [[Bill Gaglione]].

Her work had a strong anti-establishment theme and her regular despatches included ''Lost Marbles Dump'', which commented on property developers in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], and ''A Present From Belfast'' about the [[conflict in Northern Ireland]]. In 1974&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reed, S.

In 1983, she explained in her ''c.v.'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ADOLF HITLER FAN CLUB was intended to be an analogy for the week-kneed [''sic''] British Governments since 1945 and was stimulated by local Chelsea politics regarding landlords/tenants/development/tourism, in which I was interested in the early seventies. Of course, this was not the only factor involved but it was the most pressing. The country is a mess and nothing gets any better. What I feel about the current situation will take several years more to express through my art. For the immediate present I am preoccupied with Adolf Hitler's involvement in the occult, the mediumistic nature of his public speaking and the mystery of his charismatic appeal to the multitudes ... Adolf Hitler remained the subject of my painting as he had been of my Mailart and I continue to paint about him because everything that has happened in this country since his death has been a reaction against him. He is the biggest influence on this country this century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/ma.htm THE ASSAULT ON CULTURE CHAPTER 13 (pages 69-73)  MAIL ART.] stewarthomesociety.org Retrieved 18 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

She used antique black and white cameras to produce her mailart which she replaced with a modern colour camera in 1998,&lt;ref name=axis /&gt; and colour photography became her main medium for a time,&lt;ref name=times /&gt; taking pictures that she said were "inspired by ancient monuments, cultures, myths and flint simulacra gathered on Brighton beach which also could have interested our ancient ancestors."&lt;ref name=axis&gt;[https://www.axisweb.org/p/paulinesmith/#info Biography.] Axisweb.

 members}}
{{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}}

A '''quintet''' is a group containing five members. It is commonly associated with musical groups, such as a [[string quintet]], or a group of five singers, but can be applied to any situation where five similar or related objects are considered a single unit.

==Overview==
In [[european classical music|classical instrumental music]], any additional instrument (such as a [[piano]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], etc.) joined to the usual [[string quartet]] (two [[violin]]s, a [[viola]], and a [[cello]]), gives the resulting ensemble its name, such as "[[piano quintet]]", "[[clarinet quintet]]", etc. A piece of music written for such a group is similarly named.

The standard [[wind quintet]] consists of one player each on [[Western concert flute|flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]], and [[French horn|horn]], while the standard [[brass quintet]] has two [[trumpet]]s, [[French horn|horn]], [[trombone]], and [[tuba]]. Other combinations, however, are sometimes found.

In [[jazz music]], a quintet is group of five players, usually consisting of two of any of the following instruments, [[guitar]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[clarinet]], [[flute]] or [[trombone]] in addition to traditional [[jazz trio]] – [[piano]], [[double bass]], [[Drum kit|drums]].

In some modern bands there are quintets formed from the same family of instruments with various voices, as an all-[[brass instrument|brass]] ensemble, or all [[saxophone]]s, in [[soprano saxophone|soprano]], [[alto saxophone|alto]], [[baritone saxophone|baritone]], and [[bass (instrument)|bass]], and sometimes [[double bass]].

Many rock, pop, and metal bands are made up of five people, normally consisting of two [[guitarist]]s, a [[bassist]], a [[drummer]], and a [[lead vocalist]]. This is normally considered to the maximum size of most bands. However, several bands like [[Linkin Park]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and [[DragonForce]] have more than 5 band members. Having more than five members is mostly uncommon in rock and pop music.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

It is becoming increasingly common in [[a cappella]] and [[barbershop music]] circles to use the fifth voice as vocal percussionist, with the remainder being a traditional SATB ([[soprano]] [[alto]] [[tenor]] [[bass (voice type)|bass]]) quartet, or perhaps SSAA or TTBB.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Notable quintets==

'''Ruby Garrard Woodson''' (June 22, 1931 – February 8, 2008) was an [[educator]] and chemistry teacher, the founder of the ''Cromwell Academy'' in [[Washington, D. C.]], and the founder of the ''Florida Academy of African American Culture'' in [[Sarasota, Florida]].

She was born in [[Houston County, Alabama]], but raised in Sarasota. Her mother, Ella Mae Garrard (later, Singleton) worked as a maid and later owned a small country store. Her father, David Garrard, was a farmer, and later a [[circus]] [[roustabout]]. She had one child, William G. Woodson.

At the age of fifteen, she was the [[valedictorian]] of her class of 1947 when she was graduated from [[Booker High School (Florida)|Booker High School]] in Sarasota.

At the age of nineteen, in June 1951 Woodson was awarded her [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[chemistry]] from [[Florida A &amp; M University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. She received her master of arts degree in education from [[American University]] in Washington, D.C. in 1960. Her masters thesis was entitled, ''Some Effects of the Atomic Era on the Teaching of High School Chemistry in the United States''.

== Breaking racial barrier at Sarasota library ==

In 1957, while she was on a vacation in her hometown of Sarasota and researching materials for completion of her master's degree, Ruby Woodson was refused entry to the public library in Sarasota. She made a formal objection to her treatment that she took to city and county government officials. Her efforts led to the elimination of racial barriers to community services paid for by the taxation of all residents. Soon the vestiges of [[racial segregation|segregation]] began to fall in Sarasota and all residents were granted access to the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sarasota.granicus.com/DocumentViewer.php?file=9e08dcc6246d3eeaa28e9d54f40c1104.pdf&amp;view=1|title=Minutes Of The Regular Sarasota City Commission Meeting Of March 3, 2008|last=|first=|date=2008-03-03|website=City of Sarasota|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cromwell Academy founded ==

[[Image:Ruby Garrard Woodson - memorial resolution by Sarasota Florida.JPG|thumb|Memorial resolution honoring the contributions and achievements of Ruby Garrard Woodson]]
She spent thirteen years teaching chemistry and physics in the Washington, D.C. public school system before founding ''Cromwell Academy'', a private [[secondary school]] to serve [[gifted]] [[minority group|minority]] students in the district. The academy was founded in 1973 in a church annex and soon was sending many of its students to classes at [[Georgetown University]] and [[Howard University]] for credits toward their secondary diplomas. The inspiration for the name of the academy was [[Otelia Cromwell]], an educator who was the first black woman awarded a Ph.D. by [[Yale University]]. A reputation developed quickly by the academy for its academic achievements, attracting the enrollment of their children by prominent people as well as the gifted and aspiring members of disadvantaged groups whose teachers advised application to the academy. [[Bill Cosby]] sent his son, Ennis, and the president of [[Venezuela]] sent his daughter.

Woodson was a pivotal figure in the day-to-day administration of the academy and fulfilled many other roles such as college placement adviser, guidance counselor, as well as instructor. Initial difficulties encountered in operating expenses often were resolved by donations from Woodson's personal savings.

The student body of the academy was small and familial. Often, instruction in life skills also fell to Woodson, who helped the students with financing as well as handling personal issues and later, negotiating such things as the purchase of automobiles and houses. Donations were sought to develop a scholarship program to assist many of the students. Woodson had overcome [[dyslexia]] in her efforts to excel and was able to provide special insights to children coping with similar hurdles. She inspired the students with her own high standards of ethics and morality and helped them develop personal discipline and self-respect. She taught them how to make applications to colleges appropriate to their interests and abilities and to apply for scholarships.

The students from the academy gained entrance to the best academic institutions in the country and soon Woodson’s students were awarded baccalaureate and advanced degrees form [[Columbia University]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], [[Yale University]], and [[Vassar College]]. The academy became recognized for academic excellence.

One 1979 graduate of the academy, Lisa S. Martin, later was graduated from Yale University and Emory University and is a practicing psychologist in Maryland. She attests to the power Woodson had to inspire her students, making them feel able to meet any type of academic challenge and motivating them to win acceptance at the institutions of their choice, be it Ivy League, the big ten, or top southern colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20080214/NEWS/802140326|title=Educator broke down racial barriers in Sarasota|last=Zaloudek|first=Mark|date=2008-02-14|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodson's achievements were lauded in the [[Washington Post]] and by the [[United States Department of Education]].

== Retirement to Sarasota ==

In 1989 Ruby Woodson retired to Sarasota, but immersed herself in the affairs of the community. She participated in many cultural and civic activities, from the Asolo Center for the Performing Arts and Habitat for Humanity to the United Way as well as in local and regional long-range planning charrettes. She ultimately was moved to found the Florida Academy for African-American Culture (FAAC), an institution dedicated to educational advancement and cultural preservation with a special emphasis on children from pre-school through high school.

She was appointed to the county library advisory board and was among those who brought a branch of the library to the Newtown neighborhood, the section of the city where she had been raised, so a library would be within walking distance for the children of that area. The United Way named Ruby Woodson among the twelve ''Women of Community Impact'' in Sarasota County.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/heraldtribune/obituary.aspx?n=ruby-garrard-woodson&amp;pid=103324740|title=Ruby Garrard Woodson's Obituary on Herald Tribune|website=Herald Tribune|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Florida Academy for African American Culture founded ==

After her return to Sarasota, Woodson founded another educational institution in that community, the ''Florida Academy for African American Culture''.

The historic home of a prominent black family, the ''Pearl and Grover Koons House'', was purchased, listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and developed as a museum with a library, the African-American Culture Research Center and Library, to enhance the educational opportunities of the children of the community. It had classrooms for gifted pre-school and school-age students in an adjacent building.

The academy sponsored [[Public speaking|oratory]] and [[essay]] contests, awarding prizes to students participating in its Black History events. Its library donated books to local students, churches, and day-care centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverblackflorida.com/index.asp?CommandSites=detail&amp;SiteID=68] {{Dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Saturday free books were given to interested children coming to the academy.

==Focus on reading to inspire children==

An avid reader from her youth, Ruby Woodson emphasized the importance of developing reading skills in children and encouraging them to read about all things that interest them. She credited her father and Ethel Reid Hays, her first teacher, for encouraging her interest in reading.

{{quotation|text=I believe that learning to read at a young age and reading everything (as I did) makes all of the difference in the life of a child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familyheritagehousemuseum.com/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Ruby G. Woodsen|source=}}

The quote above is from a biography of Ruby Woodson assembled and kept on file by the [[Family Heritage House Museum]] in Manatee County, Florida; the museum is on the campus of the State College of Florida (formerly Manatee Community College). The file includes an undated article published by the United Way of Sarasota County entitled, ''Ruby Woodson'', that contains this quote.

Dutton Publishing|isbn= 0-525-24653-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Americans|American]] best known for his relationship with and lawsuit against the entertainer [[Liberace]].

==Liberace==

=== Relationship ===
A teenaged Thorson met Liberace in 1976 through his romantic friendship with dancer Bob Street (a friend of [[Hollywood]] producer [[Ray Arnett]]) who was staging Liberace's shows in Vegas. When Thorson was 18, Liberace hired him to act as his personal friend and companion, a position that allegedly included a five-year romantic relationship with lavish gifts, travel, and Liberace's promises that he would adopt and care for Thorson. Liberace claimed that he had "more mink coats and diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor".&lt;ref name="Mashable" /&gt; Liberace also incorporated Thorson into his [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] stage performances – for example, Thorson drove Liberace's [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]] onstage,&lt;ref name="transcripts" /&gt; and was a dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-16/local/me-1065_1_entertainer-liberace|title=Local News in Brief: Liberace Companion Held|author=Metro Digest|date=16 March 1988|journal=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to Thorson, their committed relationship ended because of Liberace's promiscuous behavior and Thorson's drug addiction. Thorson also claimed that it was Liberace that originally started him on the drugs, but then when his habit got out of control, Liberace cut him off from all of his credit cards.&lt;ref name="Mashable"&gt;Oprah: Where Are They Now? -Interview with Scott Thorson [TV Series]. (2013). United States: OWN TV (Oprah Winfrey Network).&lt;/ref&gt; Thorson stated that following his plastic surgery, the surgeon provided for him a cocktail of highly addictive drugs that included [[cocaine]], [[Methaqualone|Quaalude]]s, biphetamines, and [[Demerol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/fashion/scott-thorson-the-boy-toys-story.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=The Boy Toy’s Story|author=David Segal|date=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorson stated that since he was so young at the time of meeting Liberace, he would do anything that he could to please him, including getting plastic surgery so that he could resemble him, but he felt that their relationship was one-sided. He called Liberace both generous and possessive.&lt;ref name="Mashable" /&gt;

In 2000, Thorson was among several people featured in the British television documentary ''Liberace: Too Much of a Good Thing Is Wonderful''. In 2002, Thorson was interviewed by [[Larry King]] on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', during which Thorson confirmed that, in the midst of his relationship with Liberace, he chose to have plastic surgery to look more like Liberace at the pianist's suggestion. Also during the interview with King, Thorson revealed his chin implant had been removed earlier in 2002.&lt;ref name="transcripts" /&gt;

Following his release from prison in 2012, Thorson gave interviews about his relationship with Liberace, one with [[Howard Stern]], in June 2013, in which he talked about former lovers and affairs he had when he lived with Liberace. Another interview was on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' in May 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/121296_Liberace_s_Former_Lover_Details_Secret_Romance|title=Liberace's Former Lover Details Secret Romance|publisher=ETonline.com|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/howard-on-air/howard-100-101/2013-06-17#gallery-20547|title=Gallery|date=June 17, 2013|website=HowardStern.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he stated that memories of his time with Liberace were still difficult for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-television-distribution/releases/view?id=35339|title=Press Express|publisher=Cbspressexpress.com|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit and book ===
In 1982, after he was let go by Liberace,&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lPgjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7055,2894925&amp;dq=liberace+denied+homosexual&amp;hl=en Liberace had last laugh on critics by 'crying all the way to the bank'] ''The Pittsburgh Press'', February 5, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Thorson filed a $113 million lawsuit against Liberace,&lt;ref name="celeblegalissues"&gt;{{cite web|work=Celeb Legal Issues|title=Celebrity Alimony/Palimony|url=http://www.celeblegalissues.com/legal-jargon/celebrity-alimony-palimony/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transcripts"&gt;{{cite news|journal=Larry King Live|title=Interview with Scott Thorson (Transcript)|date=August 12, 2002 |publisher=CNN|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0208/12/lkl.00.html|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of which was a [[palimony]] suit. This was the first same-sex palimony case filed in U.S. history.&lt;ref name="Mashable" /&gt; Thorson decided to sue because he claimed that Liberace threw him out on the streets with nothing.&lt;ref name="Mashable" /&gt; Liberace continued to deny that he was homosexual, and during court depositions in 1984, he insisted that Thorson was never his lover.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Throughout their lawsuit, Thorson stated that Liberace referred to him in the media as a disgruntled employee, a liar, a gold digger, and claimed that there was never a sexual relationship between them.&lt;ref name="Mashable" /&gt; 

The case was settled out of court in 1986, with Thorson receiving a $75,000 cash settlement, plus three cars and three pet dogs worth another $20,000.&lt;ref name="news.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mashable" /&gt;  Thorson  visited and reconciled with Liberace shortly before the entertainer's death in February 1987.&lt;ref name="transcripts" /&gt; Thorson said, after Liberace had died, that he settled because he knew that Liberace was dying, and that Thorson had intended to sue based on conversion of property rather than palimony.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

A year after Liberace's death, Thorson published a book about their relationship, ''[[Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace]].''&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/depression-2-0-sunday-in-kerouac-alley-2496025179.html|title=Depression 2.0: Sunday in Kerouac Alley|work=[[PopMatters]]|authorlink=Rodger Jacobs|author=Jacobs, Rodger|date=May 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Canada–US [[television film]] ''[[Liberace: Behind the Music]]'' (1988), Thorson was portrayed by [[Michael Dolan]].&lt;ref name="MattDamon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2010/jul/04/matt-damon-looking-forward-playing-liberaces-lover|title=Matt Damon looking forward to playing Liberace’s lover in upcoming biopic|author=Katsilometes, John|publisher=Lasvegassun.com|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorson's book was later adapted by [[Richard LaGravenese]] and [[Steven Soderbergh]] into the 2013 film ''[[Behind the Candelabra]]'', in which Thorson was played by [[Matt Damon]] opposite [[Michael Douglas]] as Liberace. The movie aired on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] on May 26, 2013.&lt;ref name="USATodayLiberace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/10/douglas-damon-starring-in-hbos-liberace-biopic/1|title=Douglas, Damon starring in HBO's Liberace biopic|date=2011-10-11|publisher=Content.usatoday.com|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]] from a screenplay by [[Richard LaGravenese]], with music by Academy Award-winning composer [[Marvin Hamlisch]].&lt;ref name="Marvin"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q35YHvlGJb4&amp;feature=fvst|title=Director Steven Soderbergh on new Liberace film|author=|date=2009-11-20|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
In 1989, Thorson emerged as a pivotal witness in the prosecution of gangster [[Eddie Nash]], in the [[Wonderland murders|1981 quadruple murders]] of the [[Wonderland Gang]]. For his testimony, he was placed in the federal witness protection program. In 1990, he was shot five times when drug dealers broke into his hotel room in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 2008, Thorson pleaded guilty to felony drug and burglary charges and was sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref name="celeblegalissues" /&gt; 

Previously diagnosed with [[hepatitis C]], in the autumn of 2012 Thorson was diagnosed with [[Cancer staging|stage II]] cancer.&lt;ref name="transcripts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/liberace.s-ex.lover-claims-gay-affair-with-jackson|work=Contactmusic.com|date=2004-04-15|title=Liberace's Ex-Lover Claims Gay Affair With Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his diagnosis, Thorson has made public pleas for money to continue his medical treatments. Thorson had planned in 2012 to re-release the book ''Behind the Candelabra'' to coincide with the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EXCLUSIVE: Inside Scott Thorson's Cancer Battle|author=Staff|url=https://www.etonline.com/news/126245_EXCLUSIVE_Inside_Scott_Thorson_Cancer_Battle|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|date=2012-10-25|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, police investigating a lost wallet tracked the use of the victim's credit cards to a hotel in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Thorson was found to be using the credit cards and was arrested. Thorson (who also uses the alias '''Jess Marlow''', an alias he says that he acquired when he entered the protection program  in the Nash case) was booked on a variety of charges, including burglary and using a credit card without consent.&lt;ref name="The Boy Toy's Story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Segal|first=David|title=The Boy Toy's Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/fashion/scott-thorson-the-boy-toys-story.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynews4.com/mostpopular/story/Liberaces-Alleged-Ex-Lover-in-Washoe-County-Jail/3HFiMUhk0kW59dVYRjVTjg.cspx|title=Liberace's Alleged Ex-Lover in Washoe County Jail|work=My News 4|publisher=[[KRNV-DT]]|date=2013-05-28|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years' probation in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2013/07/liberace-lover-scott-thorson-sentenced-stolen-credit-card|title=Liberace's Ex-Lover Scott Thorson Sentenced To 5 Years Probation After Using Stolen Credit Cards|publisher=Radaronline.com|accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorson did not do well on probation. In September 2013, he tested positive for [[methamphetamine]], but was given another chance. He subsequently failed drug tests again — twice in October, and again on November 1, 2013. He was arrested on November 19, 2013, after violating a court order to enter an inpatient treatment facility in Reno two weeks earlier. On January 23, 2014, his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to 8 to 20 years in Nevada prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/01/23/liberace-lover-to-spend-8-to-20-years-in-prison/4806535|title=Liberace's lover Scott Thorson sentenced to prison|author=AP|date=January 23, 2014|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thorson is currently incarcerated in [[Northern Nevada Correctional Center]] in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

She is critical of theoretical frameworks which treat race, gender, and class atomistically, and reduce them to the domains of discourse, text, language, or identity.  She critiques monopolies of knowledge and power in education, and advocates dialogical and inclusive pedagogical practices. Mojab's research has been published on [[Islamic feminism]], minority women in academe, diversity and academic freedom in Canadian and Iranian universities, [[adult education]] and civil society in the [[Middle East]], feminism and [[nationalism]], state-university relation, and women's access to higher education.&lt;ref name="power"/&gt;

Her publications include, among others, articles and book chapters which have appeared in periodicals such as ''International Journal of Lifelong long Education''; ''Feminist Review''; ''Canadian Woman Studies Journal'';  ''[[Journal of Middle East Women's Studies]]''; ''Journal of Ethnicities''; ''Resources for Feminist Research''; ''The Canadian Journal for the Study of Adult Education''; ''Adult Education Quarterly: A Journal of Research and Theory; Studies in Continuing Education''; ''Al-Raida Magazine'' (Institute for Women’s Studies in the Arab World); ''Pakistan Journal of Women’s Studies: Alam-e-Niswan''; ''Journal of Race, Gender, and Class''; and ''Atlantis: A Women’s Studies Journal''.  Shahrzad writes in Persian and Kurdish and her work is translated into Arabic, French, German, Kurdish, Turkish, and Swedish.

She is the editor of ''Marxism and Feminism'' (2015); ''Women, War, Violence, and Learning'' (2010); ''Women of a Non-State Nation: The Kurds'' (2001, second printing 2003). She co-edited with Sara Carpenter ''Educating from Marx: Race, Gender and Learning'' (2012), with Nahla Abdo, ''Violence in the Name of Honour: Theoretical and Political Challenges'' (2004), with Himani Bannerji and Judith Whitehead, ''Of Property and Propriety: The Role of Gender and Class in Imperialism and Nationalism'' (2001), and with Afsaneh Hojabri ''Women of Iran: A Subject bibliography'' and ''Two Decades of Iranian Women’s Studies in Exiles: A Subject Bibliography'' [in Farsi], both published by the Iranian Women’s Studies Foundation.

She has been the guest editor of the special issue of ''Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East Journal'', on ''Gender and Empire (''Summer 2010) and on ''Dissent: The Politics and Poetics of Women’s Resistance'' (2012); ''International Journal of Lifelong Education'', on ''Women, War and Learning; and Resources for Feminist Research, on War and Militarization.''

Professor Mojab has created two research websites as an archival space for relevant resource for the research and as a tool for the dissemination of knowledge. The websites are: ''[http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/marxfem/index.html Marxism and Feminism: Research, Teaching, and Praxis]''  and ''[http://www.womenpoliticlprisoners.com The Art of Resistance in the Middle East]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''.

In recent years, Shahrzad has attempted to diversify the dissemination of her research results.  Together with [http://www.shahrzadarshadi.com Shahrzad Arshadi], feminist filmmaker and photographer committed to social justice and human rights, she has produced two documentaries. ''Samjana: Memoirs and Resistance'' is based on her research about women in post-war Nepal, their role in the peace process, as well as the role of women’s NGOs in building sustainable peace. This documentary is filmed and directed by Shahrzad Arshadi. ''Talking Prison, Creating Art and Making Justice'' (2010) is a documentary based on an-art based project funded by the Ontario Arts Council and Toronto Arts Council called ''Words, Colour and Movement''. ''Behind the Stained Walls'' (2011) is dance representation of ''Words, Colour and Movement'' project. ''Dancing of Change'' (2015) a documentary which is filmed and directed by Shahrzad Arshadi is based on Shahrzad Mojab’s decades of research and work with Kurdish women. It captures their dreams and desires for a just world, which they seek in socialism and secularism.

Her current research project is: ''Remembering Not to Forget'' is a Digital Storytelling Project telling the stories of former political prisoners-narrating state violence and telling tales of humanity, hope, and resistance. Using storytelling and digital techniques, participants will work one-on-one with artists and facilitators to tell stories, focusing on a particular time, place, space, theme, and moments of imprisonment. These stories include digital images, texts, recorded audio narrations, video clips and/or music.

{{nihongo|'''Shinobu Orikuchi'''|折口 信夫|Orikuchi Shinobu|11 February 1887–3 September 1953}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Chōkū Shaku'''|釋 迢空|''Shaku Chōkū''}}, was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[ethnologist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], [[folklorist]], [[novelist]], and [[poet]]. As a disciple of [[Kunio Yanagita]], he established an original academic field named {{nihongo|"Orikuchiism"|折口学|Orikuchigaku}}, which is a mixture of Japanese folklore, Japanese classics, and [[Shinto|Shintō]]. He produced many works in a diversity of fields covering the history of literature, folkloric performing arts, folklore itself, [[Japanese language]], the classics study, Shintōology, ancient study, and so on. [[Yukio Mishima]] once called him the "Japanese [[Walter Pater]]".

==Biography==
Orikuchi was born in the former [[Nishinari]], [[Osaka|Ōsaka]] (now part of [[Naniwa-ku, Osaka]]). After graduating with a degree in [[Japanese literature]] from [[Kokugakuin University]] in 1910, he started to teach [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and Chinese classics at junior high schools. In 1919, he was employed as a part-time instructor in Kokugakuin University. In 1922, he was promoted to professor. In 1924, he was hired as a professor at [[Keio University]] as well; afterward, he taught at two different universities until he died. As a poet, he and [[Kitahara Hakushu]] established a [[Tanka (poetry)|tanka]] magazine called ''Nikkō'' ("Sunshine") in 1924. In 1925, he published {{nihongo|''Between the Sea and the Mountains''|海山の間|Umi Yama no Aida}}, his first tanka book, which is highly estimated.

In 1934, he received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] for his study on the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. He also established the {{Nihongo|Japan Folklorists Society|日本民俗協会}}.  As a folklorist, Yanagita was known for rejecting every sexual subject; Orikuchi, in contrast, was very open-minded to these matters. He became a model for the protagonist in Mishima's short story {{Nihongo|''Mikumano Mōde''|三熊野詣}}, while his novel ''Shisha no Sho'' was the basis for a [[The Book of the Dead (film)|film]] by [[Kihachiro Kawamoto]].

'''Jóhan Hendrik Sigurð Joensen''' (April 27, 1911 – October 1, 1993) was a [[Faroe Islanders|Faroese]] lawyer, author, and politician for the Faroese [[Republic (Faroe Islands)|Republican Party]] ({{lang-fo|Tjóðveldisflokkurin}}).

Joensen was born in [[Gjógv]].&lt;ref name="Joensen"&gt;Joensen, Sofus et al. 1986. ''Føroyskar bókmentir í úrvali'', vol. 4.

Their granddaughter [[Sólrun Løkke Rasmussen]] is married to Danish Prime Minister [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].

From 1941 to 1945, Joensen was the editor of the Faroese-language newspaper ''Búgvin'' (Ready). In 1948, Joensen was one of the founders of the Faroese Republican Party ({{lang-fo|Tjóðveldisflokkurin}}) together with [[Erlendur Patursson]], [[Jákup í Jákupsstovu]], and [[Hanus við Høgadalsá]], and from 1958 to 1970 Joensen was a member of the [[Faroese Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Joensen"/&gt;

'''Simplício Rodrigues de Sá''' (1785, [[São Nicolau Tolentino (São Domingos)|São Nicolau Tolentino]], [[Cape Verde]],  — 9 March 1839, [[Rio de Janeiro]]) was a Portuguese-born painter and art professor who spent most of his career in Brazil.

==Biography==
Simplício Rodrigues de Sá was born in the parish of [[São Nicolau Tolentino (São Domingos)|São Nicolau Tolentino]] (now part of the municipality of [[São Domingos, Cape Verde (municipality)|São Domingos]]) just north of the city of [[Praia]] in the island of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]

He studied in Lisbon and emigrated to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in 1809. Seven years later, he became a follower of [[Jean Baptiste Debret]], joining his group, the [[Missão Artística Francesa|French Artistic Mission]] and helping to lay the foundations for what would become the [[Academia Imperial de Belas Artes]] in 1826.&lt;ref name="I"&gt;[http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_ic/index.cfm?fuseaction=artistas_biografia&amp;cd_verbete=931&amp;cd_idioma=28555&amp;cd_item=1 Brief biographies] @ the Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also named a [[court painter]] and a private art tutor to Princess [[Maria da Glória]], the future Queen of Portugal. For his services, Emperor Pedro I awarded him the [[Order of Christ (Brazil)|Order of Christ]] in 1826, and named him a Knight in the [[Order of the Southern Cross]].&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; In 1831, when Debret returned to Paris, De Sá took his place as head of the History Painting Department at the Imperial Academy. 

In 1833, he became drawing master for the child-Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] and his sisters. After the death of {{ill|Henrique José da Silva|pt|Henrique José da Silva (pintor)}} in 1834, he took over the Department of Design at the Academy. He also organized the first two major public exhibitions held there, in 1829 and 1830, although his first solo exhibition appears to have been given posthumously.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt;

He worked in several genres, including religious works for the Church of the "Ordem Terceira de São Francisco da Penitência", but is largely remembered as a portrait painter who focused on members of the [[Imperial Family of Brazil|Royal Family]]. He was apparently blind at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt;

'''Stephen "Steve" Wray''' (20 May 1962 - 22 December 2009) was a Bahamian former [[Sport of athletics|athlete]] who competed mostly as a [[high jump]]er.

==Biography==
Wray is best known for winning a silver medal in the high jump at the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]] in Brisbane, in which he set a personal best and equalled the Commonwealth record, 2.31 metres. Over the course of the event he bettered his previous career best jump (2.23m) three times, clearing 2.25m and then 2.28m, before drawing level with Canada's [[Milton Ottey]] on 2.31m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athleticsweekly.com/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-mens-high-jump-7241|title=Commonwealth Games: Men’s high jump|date=26 July 2014|work=[[Athletics Weekly]]|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He only lost out on the gold medal to Ottey on count-back, as the Canadian had made the clearance in his first attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128257315 |title=Brisbane medallists for Canberra |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=25 September 1985 |accessdate=7 October 2016 |page=44 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1983 World Championships in Athletics]], Wray competed in the high jump competition, but couldn't force his way into the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune242.com/news/2016/may/26/which-three-high-jumpers-will-represent-bahamas-ol/|title=Which three high jumpers will represent Bahamas at Olympics?|last=Stubbs|first=Brent|date=25 May 2016|work=[[The Tribune (Bahamas)|The Tribune]]|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also competed at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], where he was unable to register a successful jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/ATH/mens-high-jump.html|title=Athletics at the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Games: Men's High Jump|publisher=[[Sports Reference|Olympics at Sports-Reference.com]]|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2009, both Wray and another fisherman were on a boat which overturned off the coast of Nassau. His body was never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharenews.com/milt-ottey-looks-back-at-a-long-and-rewarding-career/|title=Milt Ottey looks back at a long and rewarding career|date=10 May 2012|work=Share News|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Sturgeon''', also known as '''Stza Crack''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɪ|z|ə}} {{respell|STIZ|ə}}; born March 4, 1976), is a musician who has fronted several [[ska-punk]] [[band (music)|bands]] in the [[New York City]] area, the best known being [[Choking Victim]] and [[Leftöver Crack]].&lt;ref name="racketmag.com"/&gt; The stage name Stza is a tribute to the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], in which the members would take their stage names from the [[Supreme Alphabet]] of the [[Five Percent Nation]], such as GZA (God ZigZagZig Allah) and RZA (Ruler ZigZagZig Allah) - Stza's name would therefore be ''Self Truth ZigZagZig Allah''.

==Early life==
Stza was raised in New York by his mother, who he classified as an "over-protective [[Jewish]] mom". He rarely saw his biological father, and his stepfather committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/an-interview-with-stza-crack-of-leftover-crack-and-sfh/ Lin, Tao - Thought Catalog - Interviews- Leftover Crack]&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he dropped out of high school, ran away from home and began riding freight trains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=leftovercrack Butler, Roya - The Punk Site - Interviews - Leftover Crack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205030513/http://www.thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=leftovercrack |date=2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the age of 16, Stza has been arrested several times, mainly for shoplifting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://betterpropaganda.com/content.aspx?id=179 Better Propaganda - Leftover Crack interview]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Music career==
In 1990, Stza and a friend of his, [[Alec Baillie]], formed No Commercial Value, which later evolved into [[Choking Victim]] and then again into [[Leftöver Crack]]. Although many members of these bands have come and gone, Stza remained a constant figure, writing the vast majority of the lyrics and music and becoming the bands' self-appointed spokesperson. Stza is also associated with the band Morning Glory through Leftöver Crack member, [[Ezra Kire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockzone.com/interviews/loc.shtml Rockzone: Interviews: Leftover Crack]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he collaborated with [[Mischief Brew]] on a song for their first full-length album, [[Smash The Windows]].

==History==
Systema Solar originated in 2006, when DJ Vanessa Gocksch offered to create a band to play at an Art Biennial festival in [[Medellín]], Colombia. Soon afterward, the hastily assembled septet made its debut performance in front of an audience of several thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://remezcla.com/releases/music/systema-solar-rumbo-a-tierra-album-review/ |title=Systema Solar's 'Rumbo a Tierra' Is a Bold Political Statement from Global Bass's First Wave |last=Bryan |first=Beverly |date=2017-01-17 |website=Remezcla |language=en-US |access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7670037/systema-solar-rumbera-rumbo-a-tierra-album-fifa-2017 |title=Systema Solar Talks 'Rumbera' Success &amp; Moving Away From Samples on New Album |last=Leight |first=Elias |date=2017-01-30 |website=Billboard |access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, their self-titled album was released, and the following year, it was re-released on Chusma Records. An expanded version of this album was later released by [[Nacional Records]] in March 2016, featuring tracks from a previous album they had released in 2013.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=10 Best Latin Albums of 2016 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/10-best-latin-albums-of-2016-w458207/systema-solar-systema-solar-w458210 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, they released the album ''Rumbo a Tierra''.&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt; As of 2017, the group had six members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/01/09/systema-solar-album-review/96346924/ |title=Systema Solar throws own dance party  |last=Puckett |first=Jeffrey Lee |date=2017-01-09 |work=The Courier-Journal |access-date=2018-02-13 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named the 2016 reissue of ''Systema Solar'' the third best Latin album of 2016, writing, "Vibrant and demanding, the Colombian psychedelic soundsystem champions the causes of immigrants and POC while commanding bystanders to get rowdy on the dance floor."&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

[[NPR]]'s Jessica Diaz-Hurtado wrote that ''Rumbo a Tierra'' "...takes listeners on a colorful and politically urgent journey", describing it as "a protest album that never lets its innovation stand in the way of its forcefulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/05/508089702/first-listen-systema-solar-rumbo-a-tierra |title=Review: Systema Solar, 'Rumbo A Tierra' |last=Diaz-Hurtado |first=Jessica |date=2017-01-05 |website=NPR |language=en |access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Patrick gave the album an 8 out of 10 rating in ''[[Exclaim!]]'', writing that "Systema Solar bring a "party with a message" mentality that melds future and folk sounds with innovative flair."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/systema_solar-rumbo_a_tierra |title=Systema Solar Rumbo a Tierra |last=Patrick |first=Ryan |date=2017-01-13 |website=Exclaim! |language=en |access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these things helped her, and she eventually got the right diagnosis ([[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]]) and the right medical treatments for her condition.&lt;ref name="Borel" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.umassmedia.com/art_lifestyle/blogger-scibabe-debunks-pseudoscience/article_d7e5166e-5fef-11e5-9541-ef91131f496e.html|title = Blogger SciBabe Debunks Pseudoscience|last = Arthur|first = Christian|date = September 20, 2015|work = The Mass Media|access-date = December 2, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bodyforwife.com/how-science-babe-lost-and-kept-off-90-pounds/ | author=Yvette d'Entremont | title=How SciBabe Lost (and kept off) 90 Pounds | work=Body For Wife | date=January 22, 2015 | accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Entremont also suffers from [[celiac disease]], an autoimmune disorder associated with the consumption of [[gluten]].&lt;ref name="BFW" /&gt; She cites these experiences as her motivation for becoming a blogger and debunking diet myths.&lt;ref name="Borel" /&gt;

D'Entremont started blogging in 2014.&lt;ref name="Keppler" /&gt; She believes that using "snarky humor" is an important tool for communicating science and has been influenced by the style of [[Penn &amp; Teller|Penn &amp; Teller's]] show, ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit]].''&lt;ref name="Borel" /&gt; She began to get wider recognition in April 2015, when her ''Gawker'' article about [[Vani Hari]], titled ''The 'Food Babe' Blogger is Full of Shit''&lt;ref name="Borel" /&gt; went viral.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=9X9ADVNEWSMMGLSTRY000132259808&amp;site=ehost-live|title=SciBabe's Quest for Truth|last=Peddie|first=Claire|date=August 24, 2015|work=The Advertiser (Adelaide)|subscription=yes|access-date=December 2, 2015|via=Newspaper Source - EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Entremont chose the name "Science Babe" in reaction to [[Vani Hari]]'s moniker of "Food Babe."&lt;ref name="Borel" /&gt; Since "Science Babe" had previously been claimed by another scientist, [[Deborah Berebichez|Debbie Berebichez]], the name became shortened to "SciBabe."&lt;ref name="Borel" /&gt; In response to criticism concerning the word ''babe'' in her nickname, d'Entremont has said it is about helping science seem "relatable and sexy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/american-scibabe-blogger-seeks-chemical-reaction-during-science-week-20150813-giydiq.html|title = American SciBabe blogger seeks chemical reaction during Science Week|last = Carbone|first = Suzanne|date = August 15, 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = December 2, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experienced [[science communication|science communicators]] have stated that writers like d'Entremont play an important role in educating the public with engaging and accessible scientific information.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; [[Pamela Ronald]], a biologist at [[University of California, Davis]], applauded d'Entremont's sense of humor.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

D'Entremont has conducted several "stunt" tests of [[Homeopathy|homeopathic remedies]] in order to demonstrate their ineffectiveness or deceptive advertising and labeling. In one event, she drank six bottles of homeopathic remedies sold as "CVS Constipation Relief" from [[CVS Pharmacy]] chains,&lt;ref name="Mac"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/CVS-Laxative-Constipation-Relief-Alcohol-342025991.html|title = CVS Changes Policy on Sale of Medicine That Could Get You Drunk|last = Mac|first = Randy|date = November 6, 2015|work = NBC Los Angeles|access-date = December 2, 2015|via = |last2 = Corral|first2 = Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had no effect except resulting in her being intoxicated with a [[blood alcohol content]] well above the legal limit to drive, as the product contained only 20% [[ethanol|alcohol]] and water.&lt;ref name="Mac" /&gt; In another demonstration, she created a [[YouTube]] video in which she took 50 "homeopathic sleeping pills" at once, without effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.alternet.org/personal-health/modern-science-says-homeopathy-total-bunk-so-why-it-more-popular-ever|title = Modern Science Says Homeopathy Is Total Bunk — So Why Is It More Popular Than Ever?|last = Loki|first = Reynard|date = November 7, 2015|work = Alternet|access-date = December 2, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is currently working as a contributing writer for [[The Outline (website)|The Outline]] and as a columnist for [[Self (magazine)|''Self'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://theoutline.com/post/1951/david-avocado-wolfe-is-the-biggest-asshole-in-the-multiverse|title = David Avocado Wolfe is the Biggest Asshole in the Multiverse|last = d'Entremont|first = Yvette|date = August 7, 2017|work = The Outline|access-date = June 23, 2018|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.self.com/package/voices|title = SELF Voices | date = December 7, 2015|work = SELF|access-date = June 23, 2018|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Entremont also co-hosts with Alice Vaughn the podcast ''Two Girls One Mic: The Porncast'', which features humorous commentary about [[pornography]]. After three episodes, it was listed in the top 20 comedy podcasts on iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twogirlsonemicpodcast.com/about-us/|title=Two Girls One Mic: About|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discoverpods.com/two-girls-one-mic-porncast-comedy-podcast/|title=Trending on the comedy podcast scene: Two Girls One Mic: The Porncast|last=Hines|first=Morgan|date=September 26, 2018|website=Discover Pods|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027031524/https://discoverpods.com/two-girls-one-mic-porncast-comedy-podcast/|archive-date=October 26, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
