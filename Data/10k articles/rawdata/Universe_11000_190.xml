An '''abradable coating''' is a coating made of an abradable material – meaning if it rubs against a more [[abrasive]] material in motion, the former will be worn whereas the latter will face no wear.

Abradable coatings are used in aircraft [[jet engine]]s in the compressor and turbine sections where a minimal [[tip clearance|clearance]] is needed between the blade tips and the casing.

[[Abradable Powder Coatings]] provide an economical and environmentally friendly way to improve the efficiency of engines, compressors and pumps by fine-tuning the operational fit of internal components such as pistons, rotors and cases.  In typical turbo machinery, the clearance between blade tips and the casing must account for thermal and inertial expansion as well as changes in concentricity due to shock loading events. To prevent catastrophic tip to casing contact, conservatively large clearances must be employed. 

The role of abradable coatings is not only to allow for closer clearances, but to automatically adjust clearances, in-situ, to accept physical events and/or thermal scenarios that may be found in a devices operational history.

==Manufacturing==
*[[Thermal spray]]: Many techniques are available (Plasma, Flame, etc.).
*[[Sintering]]: [[Honeycomb structure|Honeycomb]] coatings are sintered on the casing
*[[Casting]]: in the case of polymer coating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16871">In the [[physics]] of [[electromagnetism]], the '''Abraham–Lorentz force'''  (also '''Lorentz–Abraham force''') is the [[recoil]] [[force]] on an [[acceleration|accelerating]] [[charged particle]] caused by the particle emitting [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is also called the '''radiation reaction force''' or the '''self force'''.

The formula predates the theory of [[special relativity]] and is not valid at velocities of the order of the speed of light. Its relativistic generalization is called the "Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force". Both of these are in the domain of [[classical physics]], not [[quantum physics]], and therefore may not be valid at distances of roughly the [[Compton wavelength]] or below.&lt;ref name=Rohrlich&gt;[http://www.lepp.cornell.edu/~pt267/files/teaching/P121W2006/ChargedSphereElectron.pdf Fritz Rohrlich: ''The dynamics of a charged sphere and the electron'', Am. J. Phys. '''65''' (11) p. 1051 (1997)]. "The dynamics of point charges is an excellent example of the importance of obeying the validity limits of a physical theory. When these limits are exceeded the predictions of the theory may be incorrect or even patently absurd. In the present case, the classical equations of motion have their validity limits where quantum mechanics becomes important: they can no longer be trusted at distances of the order of (or below) the Compton wavelength… Only when all distances involved are in the classical domain is classical dynamics acceptable for electrons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, an analogue of the formula that is both fully quantum and relativistic, called the "Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac–Langevin equation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. R. Johnson, B. L. Hu|year=2002|title=Stochastic theory of relativistic particles moving in a quantum field: Scalar Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac–Langevin equation, radiation reaction, and vacuum fluctuations|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=65|issue=6|page=065015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.065015|arxiv = quant-ph/0101001 |bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65f5015J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force is proportional to the square of the object's [[electric charge|charge]], times the [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] (rate of change of acceleration) that it is experiencing. The force points in the direction of the jerk. For example, in a [[cyclotron]], where the jerk points opposite to the velocity, the radiation reaction is directed opposite to the velocity of the particle, providing a braking action.

It was thought that the solution of the Abraham–Lorentz force problem predicts that signals from the future affect the present, thus challenging intuition of [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]] (  [[retrocausality]] ). For example, there are pathological solutions using the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac equation in which a particle accelerates ''in advance'' of the application of a force, so-called ''pre-acceleration'' solutions. One resolution of this problem was discussed by Yaghjian&lt;ref name=Yaghjian&gt;

== Definition and description ==
Mathematically, the Abraham–Lorentz force is given in [[SI units]] by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \mathbf{\dot{a}} = \frac{ q^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} \mathbf{\dot{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

or in [[Gaussian units|cgs units]] by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{rad} = { 2 \over 3} \frac{ q^2}{  c^3} \mathbf{\dot{a}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt; is the force, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{a}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] (the derivative of [[acceleration]], or the third derivative of [[displacement (vector)|displacement]]),  μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]], ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light in vacuum|speed of light]] in [[free space]], and ''q'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle.

Note that this formula is for non-relativistic velocities; Dirac simply renormalized the mass of the particle in the equation of motion, to find the relativistic version (below).

Physically, an accelerating charge emits radiation (according to the [[Larmor formula]]), which carries [[momentum]] away from the charge. Since momentum is conserved, the charge is pushed in the direction opposite the direction of the emitted radiation. In fact the formula above for radiation force can be ''derived'' from the Larmor formula, as shown [[#Derivation|below]].

==Background==

In [[classical electrodynamics]], problems are typically divided into two classes:

# Problems in which the charge and current ''sources'' of fields are specified and the ''fields'' are calculated, and
# The reverse situation, problems in which the fields are specified and the motion of particles are calculated.

In some fields of physics, such as [[plasma physics]] and the calculation of transport coefficients (conductivity, diffusivity, ''etc.''), the fields generated by the sources and the motion of the sources are solved self-consistently. In such cases, however, the motion of a selected source is calculated in response to fields generated by all other sources. Rarely is the motion of a particle (source) due to the fields generated by that same particle calculated. The reason for this is twofold:

# Neglect of the "[[self-energy|self-fields]]" usually leads to answers that are accurate enough for many applications, and
# Inclusion of self-fields leads to problems in physics such as [[renormalization]], some of which are still unsolved, that relate to the very nature of matter and energy.

These conceptual problems created by self-fields are highlighted in a standard graduate text. [Jackson]

&lt;blockquote&gt; The difficulties presented by this problem touch one of the most fundamental aspects of physics, the nature of the elementary particle. Although partial solutions, workable within limited areas, can be given, the basic problem remains unsolved. One might hope that the transition from classical to quantum-mechanical treatments would remove the difficulties. While there is still hope that this may eventually occur, the present quantum-mechanical discussions are beset with even more elaborate troubles than the classical ones. It is one of the triumphs of comparatively recent years (~ 1948–1950) that the concepts of Lorentz covariance and gauge invariance were exploited sufficiently cleverly to circumvent these difficulties in quantum electrodynamics and so allow the calculation of very small radiative effects to extremely high precision, in full agreement with experiment. From a fundamental point of view, however, the difficulties remain. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Abraham–Lorentz force is the result of the most fundamental calculation of the effect of self-generated fields. It arises from the observation that accelerating charges emit radiation. The Abraham–Lorentz force is the average force that an accelerating charged particle feels in the recoil from the emission of radiation. The introduction of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum effects]] leads one to [[quantum electrodynamics]]. The self-fields in quantum electrodynamics generate a finite number of infinities in the calculations that can be removed by the process of [[renormalization]]. This has led to a theory that is able to make the most accurate predictions that humans have made to date. (See [[precision tests of QED]].)  The renormalization process fails, however, when applied to the [[gravitational force]]. The infinities in that case are infinite in number, which causes the failure of renormalization. Therefore, [[general relativity]] has an unsolved self-field problem. [[String theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]] are current attempts to resolve this problem, formally called the problem of [[radiation reaction]] or the problem of [[self-force]].

== Derivation ==
The simplest derivation for the self-force is found for periodic motion from the [[Larmor formula]] for the power radiated from a point charge:

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \mathbf{a}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

If we assume the motion of a charged particle is periodic, then the average work done on the particle by the Abraham–Lorentz force is the negative of the Larmor power integrated over one period from &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{rad} \cdot \mathbf{v} dt = \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} -P dt = - \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \mathbf{a}^2 dt = - \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} dt&lt;/math&gt;.

The above expression can be integrated by parts. If we assume that there is periodic motion, the boundary term in the integral by parts disappears:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{rad} \cdot \mathbf{v} dt = - \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} \bigg|_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} + \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \frac{d^2 \mathbf{v}}{dt^2} \cdot \mathbf{v} dt = -0 + \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \mathbf{\dot{a}} \cdot \mathbf{v} dt&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, we can identify

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi c} \mathbf{\dot{a}}&lt;/math&gt;.

A more rigorous derivation, which does not require periodic motion, was found using an [[Effective field theory|Effective Field Theory]] formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1402.2610|bibcode = 2014IJMPA..2950132B|title = Radiation reaction at the level of the action|journal = International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume = 29|issue = 24|pages = 1450132–90|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|year = 2014|doi = 10.1142/S0217751X14501322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.88.104037|bibcode = 2013PhRvD..88j4037B|title = Theory of post-Newtonian radiation and reaction|journal = Physical Review D|volume = 88|issue = 10|pages = 104037|last1 = Birnholtz|first1 = Ofek|last2 = Hadar|first2 = Shahar|last3 = Kol|first3 = Barak|year = 2013|arxiv = 1305.6930}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative derivation, finding the fully relativistic expression, was found by [[Dirac]].

== Signals from the future ==
&lt;!--Linked to from Abraham-Minkowski controversy--&gt;
Below is an illustration of how a classical analysis can lead to surprising results. The classical theory can be seen to challenge standard pictures of causality, thus signaling either a breakdown or a need for extension of the theory. In this case the extension is to [[quantum mechanics]] and its relativistic counterpart [[quantum field theory]]. See the quote from Rohrlich &lt;ref name=Rohrlich /&gt; in the introduction concerning "the importance of obeying the validity limits of a physical theory".

For a particle in an external force &lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt; m \dot {\mathbf{v} } = \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{rad} + \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ext}  = m t_0  \ddot { \mathbf{{v}}} + \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ext} .&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{\mu_0 q^2}{6 \pi m c}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be integrated once to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; m \dot {\mathbf{v} } = {1 \over t_0} \int_t^{\infty} \exp  \left( - {t'-t \over t_0 }\right ) \, \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ext}(t') \, dt' .&lt;/math&gt;

The integral extends from the present to infinitely far in the future. Thus future values of the force affect the acceleration of the particle in the present. The future values are weighted by the factor

:&lt;math&gt; \exp \left( -{t'-t \over t_0 }\right )  &lt;/math&gt;

which falls off rapidly for times greater than &lt;math&gt;  t_0   &lt;/math&gt; in the future. Therefore, signals from an interval approximately  &lt;math&gt;  t_0   &lt;/math&gt; into the future affect the acceleration in the present. For an electron, this time is approximately &lt;math&gt;  10^{-24}    &lt;/math&gt; sec, which is the time it takes for a light wave to travel across the "size" of an electron, the [[classical electron radius]]. One way to define this "size" is as follows: it is (up to some constant factor) the distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that two electrons placed at rest at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; apart and allowed to fly apart, would have sufficient energy to reach half the speed of light. In other words, it forms the length (or time, or energy) scale where something as light as an electron would be fully relativistic. It is worth noting that this expression does not involve [[Planck's constant]] at all, so although it indicates something is wrong at this length scale, it does not directly relate to quantum uncertainty, or to the frequency-energy relation of a photon. Although it is common in quantum mechanics to treat &lt;math&gt;\hbar \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as a "classical limit", some speculate that even the classical theory needs renormalization, no matter how Planck's constant would be fixed.&lt;!-- This last sentence needs to cite people who believe this to replace and/or supplment the classical theory --&gt;

==Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force==

To find the relativistic generalization, Dirac renormalized the mass in the equation of motion with the Abraham–Lorentz force in 1938. This renormalized equation of motion is called the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac equation of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dirac|first=P. A. M.|date=1938|title=Classical Theory of Radiating Electrons|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/97128|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences|volume=167|issue=929|pages=148–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
The expression derived by Dirac is given in signature (&amp;minus;,&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;+) by 
:&lt;math&gt;F^{\mathrm{rad}}_\mu = \frac{\mu_o q^2}{6 \pi m c}
\left[\frac{d^2 p_\mu}{d \tau^2}-\frac{p_\mu}{m^2 c^2}
\left(\frac{d p_\nu}{d \tau}\frac{d p^\nu}{d \tau}\right)
\right].&lt;/math&gt;

With [[Alfred-Marie Liénard|Liénard]]'s relativistic generalization of Larmor's formula in the [[co-moving frame]],

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\mu_o q^2 a^2 \gamma^6}{6 \pi c},&lt;/math&gt;

one can show this to be a valid force by manipulating the time average equation for [[Power (physics)|power]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Delta t}\int_0^t P dt = \frac{1}{\Delta t}\int_0^t \textbf{F} \cdot \textbf{v}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

===Paradoxes===
Similar to the non-relativistic case, there are pathological solutions using the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac equation that anticipate a change in the external force and according to which the particle accelerates ''in advance'' of the application of a force, so-called ''preacceleration'' solutions. One resolution of this problem was discussed by Yaghjian,&lt;ref name=Yaghjian/&gt; and is further discussed by Rohrlich&lt;ref name=Rohrlich /&gt; and Medina.&lt;ref name=Medina /&gt;

An '''air pump''' is a device for pushing air.  Examples include a [[bicycle pump]], pumps that are used to [[aeration|aerate]] an [[aquarium]] or a [[pond]] via an [[airstone]]; a [[gas compressor]] used to power a [[pneumatic tool]], [[air horn]] or [[pipe organ]]; a [[bellows]] used to encourage a fire; a [[vacuum cleaner]] and a [[vacuum pump]]. All air pumps contain a part that moves (vane, piston, impeller, diaphragm etc.) which drives the flow of air. When the air gets moved, an area of low pressure gets created which fills up with more air. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://powerequipment.honda.com/pumps/pump-theory-1|title=Pump Theory - Principles|website=powerequipment.honda.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pumps and compressors use very similar mechanisms, and basically perform the same action, but in different fluid regimes. At some point there is a crossover point in terminology, but here are some stereotypes:

•	Compressors operate on compressible fluids, typically gases. Pumps operate on fluids, typically liquids, approximated as in-compressible.

•	Compressors are intended to develop a very high pressure rise against a closed system; pumps are designed to develop relatively little pressure against a free-flowing system with minimal back-pressure.

•	Pumps are often used in continuous-flow operation, while many lower-end compressors must have intermittent duty cycles.

•	Compressors usually have a feedback sensor to shut off when they reach a desired pressure; pumps have a fixed design and operate freely across their performance curve as conditions change

==History==
In 1649, [[Otto von Guericke]] invented the spool [[vacuum]] air pump. This pump was called air pump in 19th century [[lexicons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Brockhaus-1809/A/Die+Luftpumpe Brockhaus 1809 Luftpumpe]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Guericke's air pump decreased any potential leaks between the piston and the cylinder by utilizing washers made from leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pumpsandsystems.com/topics/pumps/pumps/history-pumps-through-years|title=The History of Pumps: Through the Years|date=2011-12-22|work=Pumps &amp; Systems|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first effective air pump constructed in England for scientific purposes was made in 1658 by [[Robert Hooke]] for [[Robert Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |title=On the Early History of the Air-pump in England |author=George Wilson |date=Jan 15, 1849 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNosAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1705, an English scientist by the name of [[Francis Hauksbee]], developed a style of a double-barrelled air pump. Hauksbee's double-barrelled air pump was used primarily for scientific research, and had the ability to create a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brundtland |first1=Terje |title=Francis Hauksbee and his air pump |url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/66/3/253 |website=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Types==
'''Diaphragm Pumps'''
{{Main|Diaphragm pump}}
In the case of air pumps, diaphragm pumps are considered to be a type of pump that utilizes positive displacement.  A simple diaphragm pump contains a chamber that acts like a springy [[diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]]. When compressed, the air within the diaphragm gets expelled. When the diaphragm is decompressed, the chamber refills with air. A simple example for a diaphragm pump is a foot pump that requires the user to constantly step up and down on the pump to inflate something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hansen |first1=Tom |title=How Does a Diaphragm Pump Work? |url= https://www.dultmeier.com/technical-library/how-does-a-diaphragm-pump-work.php |website= www.dultmeier.com |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reciprocating Pumps'''
{{Main|Reciprocating pump}}
A simple reciprocating pump is commonly made up of a cylinder with an inlet, an outlet, and a [[piston]] within. The inlet and the outlet are used to direct the flow of air, while the piston is used to generate the flow of air. When the piston is pulled up, air gets sucked into the pump through the inlet. The pump chamber depressurizes as it fills with air. When the piston is forced down, the air becomes compressed and closes the inlet. Then the air flows out from the outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Understanding How Reciprocating Pumps Work {{!}} Designs &amp; Types of Reciprocating Pumps |url= https://www.powerzone.com/resources/glossary/reciprocating-pump |website= www.powerzone.com |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant''' is a [[nuclear power station]] at [[Almaraz]] in [[Spain]] and uses the international [[Tagus River]], that runs into [[Portugal]] for cooling.

It consists of two [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]]s of 1011 and 1006 MWe. 

==The Arrocampo reservoir as system to refrigerate the Nuclear Plant==
[[File:Embalse arrocampo (circulación agua).JPG|thumb|left|250px|'''Water circulation in [[Arrocampo Reservoir]]''']]
The refrigeration of the Almaraz nuclear power plant was the first reason for the construction of the [[Arrocampo Reservoir]] in 1976.

The water is taken from the [[Tagus River]] and covers a U-shaped circuit of 25&amp;nbsp;km which allows the cooling of the heat generated by the two nuclear reactors of the plant. 
(See the illustration of the water circulation in Arrocampo) 

The walls of thermic separation (''pantallas de separación térmica'' in Spanish) (PST) are 11&amp;nbsp;km long and 8 m high. 

The tops of these walls are used by [[great cormorant]]s and [[great egret]] as standing, resting and sleeping areas.

==History==

In 1975 [[Luis E. Echávarri]] was made project manager of the Plant. In 1985 he became Technical Director of the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN), and in 1987 he was named Commissioner of the CSN.

The first reactor began operating in 1981 and the second in 1983. It occupies an area of 1683 hectares.

As of 2017 Spain had approved a nuclear waste warehouse at Almaraz without carrying out any consultations or impact studies. Portugal has taken the matter to the [[EU]], protests planned on January 12 at Spanish consulates were organised by Movimiento Ibérico Antinuclear,&lt;ref&gt;

 | title = FECHAR ALMARAZ

&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided with a meeting between Portuguese and Spanish delegates in Madrid, which ended in deadlock and Portugal to complain to the EU that Spain ignored the potential cross-border impact with no studies being carried out, which is against European Union rules.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish secretary of State for the EU [[Jorge Toledo Albiñana]] has said work will start regardless of Portugals complaints, and uranium bars that will remain radioactive for the next 300 years will be stored on site.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 the Portuguese Parliament approved the [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"]] motion to request the closure of Spain’s Almaraz nuclear plant during the next Iberian summit. Stating that after 2020 the plant should be shut down and the Greens asked the government to take a “resolute position,” for the facility, located only 100 kilometres form the Portuguese border. Environmentalists have warned that the plan to build a nuclear waste warehouse site next to the power plant almost certainly indicates that Spain plans to extend the life of the Almaraz power plant beyond the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety record==

On the 28 January 2016, the [[Spanish Nuclear Safety Council]] inspectors found serious failings in the water pump engines at the plant, which have potential operational issues of the cooling system and could pose a serious risk to local people and the environment in Spain and in neighboring Portugal. [[Greenpeace]] has labelled the plant as an ‘extreme case’ in its study on the application of minimum safety standards introduced in Europe after the Fukushima accident.&lt;ref&gt;

 | accessdate = 13 April 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 21 September 2016, defective parts were used on unit 1’s second and third steam generators and on unit 2’s third steam generator, as well as the rim of the reactor lid in unit 2. It had already been reported that the water pump engines had been stopped twice, the plant’s cooling system was reported as not 100% reliable.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 10 April 2017, the [[Spanish Nuclear Safety Council]] issued a statement stating there was an unscheduled stoppage of the main number two pump at 9.57am Spanish time (8.57am Lisbon time).&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Atomic Hydrogen Arc Welding apparatus, early 1930s, United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|right|An atomic hydrogen blowpipe, circa 1930.]]
'''Atomic hydrogen welding''' ('''AHW''') is an [[arc welding]] process that uses an arc between two [[tungsten]] [[electrode]]s in a shielding atmosphere of [[hydrogen]]. The process was invented by [[Irving Langmuir]] in the course of his studies of [[atomic hydrogen]]. The [[electric arc]] efficiently breaks up the hydrogen molecules, which later recombine with tremendous release of heat, reaching temperatures from 3400 to 4000&amp;nbsp;°C. Without the arc, an [[oxyhydrogen]] torch can only reach 2800&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/AtomicH/atomicH.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111004750/http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/AtomicH/atomicH.html |archivedate=2008-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the third-hottest flame after [[dicyanoacetylene]] at 4987&amp;nbsp;°C and [[cyanogen]] at 4525&amp;nbsp;°C.  An [[acetylene]] torch merely reaches 3300&amp;nbsp;°C. This device may be called an '''atomic hydrogen torch''', '''nascent hydrogen torch''' or '''Langmuir torch'''. The process was also known as '''arc-atom welding'''.

The heat produced by this torch is sufficient to weld [[tungsten]] (3422&amp;nbsp;°C), the most [[refractory metal]]. The presence of hydrogen also acts as a [[shielding gas]], preventing oxidation and contamination by [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] or [[oxygen]], which can severely damage the properties of many metals. It eliminates the need of [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] for this purpose.

The arc is maintained independently of the workpiece or parts being welded. The hydrogen gas is normally diatomic (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but where the temperatures are over {{convert|600|C|-2}} near the arc, the hydrogen breaks down into its atomic form, absorbing a large amount of heat from the arc. When the hydrogen strikes a relatively cold surface (i.e. the weld zone), it recombines into its diatomic form, releasing the energy associated with the formation of that bond. The energy in AHW can be varied easily by changing the distance between the arc stream and the workpiece surface.

In atomic hydrogen welding, [[filler metal]] may or may not be used. In this process, the arc is maintained entirely independent of the work or parts being welded. The work is a part of the electrical [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] only to the extent that a portion of the arc comes in contact with the work, at which time a voltage exists between the work and each electrode.

This process is being replaced by [[Gas metal arc welding|gas metal-arc welding]], mainly because of the availability of inexpensive inert gases.

'''Biomass briquettes''' are a [[biofuel]] substitute to [[coal]] and [[charcoal]]. [[Briquette]]s are mostly used in the [[developing world]], where cooking fuels are not as easily available. There has been a move to the use of briquettes in the developed world, where they are used to heat industrial [[boiler]]s in order to produce [[electricity]] from [[steam]]. The briquettes are [[cofiring|cofired]] with coal in order to create the heat supplied to the boiler.

==Composition and production==

Biomass briquettes, mostly made of [[green waste]] and other organic materials, are commonly used for electricity generation, heat, and cooking fuel. These compressed compounds contain various organic materials, including [[rice husk]], [[bagasse]], ground nut shells, [[municipal solid waste]], agricultural waste.  The composition of the briquettes varies by area due to the availability of raw materials. The raw materials are gathered and compressed into briquette in order to burn longer and make transportation of the goods easier.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.biomass.net/Feed-Biomass.html Feed Biomass]." Biomass.net. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These briquettes are very different from charcoal because they do not have large concentrations of [[carbon]]aceous substances and added materials.  Compared to fossil fuels, the briquettes produce low net total greenhouse gas emissions because the materials used are already a part of the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bionomicfuel.com/biomass-briquettes-for-green-electricity-production/ Biomass Briquettes for Green Electricity Production]." Bionomicfuel.com. 4 May 2009. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common variables of the biomass briquette production process is the way the biomass is dried out.  Manufacturers can use [[torrefaction]], [[carbonization]], or varying degrees of [[pyrolysis]].  Researchers concluded that torrefaction and carbonization are the most efficient forms of drying out biomass, but the use of the briquette determines which method should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Chohfi, Cortez, Luengo, Rocha, and Juan Miguel.  "[http://www.techtp.com/recentpapers/Technology%20to%20produce%20high%20energy%20biomass%20briquettes.pdf Technology to Produce High Energy Biomass Briquettes.]" Techtp.com.  Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compaction is another factor affecting production.  Some materials burn more efficiently if compacted at low pressures, such as corn stover grind. Other materials such as wheat and barley-straw require high amounts of pressure to produce heat.&lt;ref&gt;Mani, Sokhansanj, and L.G. Tabil.  "[http://www.engr.usask.ca/societies/csae/protectedpapers/c0404.pdf Evaluation of compaction equations applied to four biomass species.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721211427/http://www.engr.usask.ca/societies/csae/protectedpapers/c0404.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}"  University of Saskatchewan College of Engineering.  Web.  30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also different press technologies that can be used. A piston press is used to create solid briquettes for a wide array of purposes.  Screw extrusion is used to compact biomass into loose, homogeneous briquettes that are substituted for coal in cofiring.  This technology creates a [[torus|toroidal]], or doughnut-like, briquette.  The hole in the center of the briquette allows for a larger surface area, creating a higher combustion rate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/HC270799/RWEDP/fd46ch1.html Biomass Briquetting: Technology and Practices - Introduction.]" Centre for Ecological Sciences INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE BANGALORE. Web. 04 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

People have been using biomass briquettes in Nepal since before recorded history.  Though inefficient, the burning of loose biomass created enough heat for cooking purposes and keeping warm. The first commercial production plant was created in 1982 and produced almost 900 metric tons of biomass.  In 1984, factories were constructed that incorporated vast improvements on efficiency and the quality of briquettes.  They used a combination of rice husks and molasses.  The King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC) along with the Institute for Himalayan Conservation (IHC) created a mixture of coal and biomass in 2000 using a unique rolling machine.&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh Man Singh.  "[http://www.bgrcnn.net/documents/History%20of%20Bio%20Briquetting.doc History of Bio-Briquetting .] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714000840/http://www.bgrcnn.net/documents/History%20of%20Bio%20Briquetting.doc |date=July 14, 2010 }}"  brgcnn.net.  2008.  Web.  30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese ''Ogalite''===
In 1925, Japan independently started developing technology to harness the energy from sawdust briquettes, known as [[:ja:オガライト|''"Ogalite"'']].  Between 1964 and 1969, Japan increased production fourfold by incorporating screw press and piston press technology.  The member enterprise of 830 or more existed in the 1960s.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} The new compaction techniques incorporated in these machines made briquettes of higher quality than those in Europe.  As a result, European countries bought the licensing agreements and now manufacture Japanese designed machines.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/HC270799/RWEDP/fd46ch1.html Biomass Briquetting: Technology and Practices - Introduction.]" Centre for Ecological Sciences INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE BANGALORE. Web. 04 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cofiring==

[[Cofiring]] relates to the combustion of two different types of materials. The process is primarily used to decrease CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions despite the resulting lower energy efficiency and higher variable cost. The combination of materials usually contains a high carbon emitting substance such as [[coal]] and a lesser CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitting material such as [[biomass]]. Even though CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will still be emitted through the combustion of [[biomass]], the net carbon emitted is nearly negligible.  This is due to the fact that the material gathered for the composition of the [[briquettes]] are still contained in the [[carbon cycle]] whereas fossil fuel combustion releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that has been sequestered for millennia. Boilers in power plants are traditionally heated by the [[combustion]] of [[coal]], but if [[cofiring]] were to be implemented, then the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would decrease while still maintaining the heat inputted to the boiler. Implementing [[cofiring]] would require few modifications to the current characteristics to power plants, as only the [[fuel]] for the boiler would be altered. A moderate investment would be required for implementing biomass briquettes into the combustion process.&lt;ref&gt;PRABIR, B. and BUTLER, J. and LEON, M., "Biomass co-firing options on the emission reduction and electricity generation costs in coal-fired power plants", Renewable Energy, 36 (2011), 282-288. {{doi|10.1016/j.renene.2010.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cofiring is considered the most cost-efficient means of biomass. A higher combustion rate will occur when cofiring is implemented in a boiler when compared to burning only biomass. The compressed biomass is also much easier to transport since it is more dense, therefore allowing more biomass to be transported per shipment when compared to loose biomass.  Some sources agree that a near-term solution for the greenhouse gas emission problem may lie in cofiring.&lt;ref&gt;PRABIR, B. and BUTLER, J. and LEON, M., "Biomass co-firing options on the emission reduction and electricity generation costs in coal-fired power plants", Renewable Energy, 36 (2011), 282-288. {{doi|10.1016/j.renene.2010.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compared to coal==
The use of biomass briquettes has been steadily increasing as industries realize the benefits of decreasing [[pollution]] through the use of biomass briquettes. Briquettes provide higher [[calorie|calorific]] value per dollar than [[coal]] when used for firing industrial [[boilers]]. Along with higher calorific value, biomass briquettes on average saved 30–40% of boiler fuel cost. But other sources suggest that cofiring is more expensive due to the widespread availability of coal and its low cost.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gcmachines.com/News/Biomass-Briquettes.html Biomass Briquette]." Www.gcmachines.com. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the long run, briquettes can only limit the use of coal to a small extent, but it is increasingly being pursued by industries and factories all over the world. Both raw materials can be produced or mined domestically in the United States, creating a fuel source that is free from foreign dependence and less polluting than raw fossil fuel incineration.&lt;ref&gt;Yugo Isobe, Kimiko Yamada, Qingyue Wang, Kazuhiko Sakamoto, Iwao Uchiyama, Tsuguo Mizoguchi and Yanrong Zhou.  "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/j42626l94q5k0522/ Measurement of Indoor Sulfur Dioxide Emission from Coal–Biomass Briquettes.]"  springerlink.com.  Web.  30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmentally, the use of biomass briquettes produces much fewer greenhouse gases, specifically, 13.8% to 41.7% {{CO2}} and  NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;.  There was also a reduction from 11.1% to 38.5% in {{chem|SO|2}} emissions when compared to coal from three different leading producers, EKCC Coal, Decanter Coal, and Alden Coal.  Biomass briquettes are also fairly resistant to water degradation, an improvement over the difficulties encountered with the burning of wet coal.  However, the briquettes are best used only as a supplement to coal.  The use of cofiring creates an energy that is not as high as pure coal, but emits fewer pollutants and cuts down on the release of previously sequestered carbon.&lt;ref&gt;Montross, Neathery, O'Daniel, Patil, Sowder and Darrell Taulbee.

Web.  29 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous release of carbon and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperatures.  The use of cofiring does not stop this process but decreases the relative emissions of coal power plants.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/index.html Greenhouse Gas Emissions.]" US Environmental Protection Agency. 19 Oct. 2010.

==Use in developing world==

The Legacy Foundation has developed a set of techniques to produce biomass briquettes through artisanal production in rural villages that can be used for [[heating]] and cooking. These techniques were recently pioneered by Virunga National Park in eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], following the massive destruction of the [[mountain gorilla]] habitat for [[charcoal]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://greenupgrader.com/10798/how-biomass-briquettes-could-save-the-endangered-mountain-gorilla How Biomass Briquettes Could Save the Endangered Mountain Gorilla]" GreenUpgrader. 5 Mar. 2010. Web. 04 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pangani]], [[Tanzania]], is an area covered in coconut groves.  After harvesting the meat of the coconut, the indigenous people would litter the ground with the husks, believing them to be useless.  The husks later became a profit center after it was discovered that coconut husks are well suited to be the main ingredient in bio briquettes.  This alternative fuel mixture burns incredibly efficiently and leaves little residue, making it a reliable source for cooking in the undeveloped country.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://africanrootsfoundation.org/projects/pangani-community-development-program/bio-briquettes/ Bio-briquettes.]" Africanrootsfoundation.org. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The developing world has always relied on the burning biomass due to its low cost and availability anywhere there is organic material.  The briquette production only improves upon the ancient practice by increasing the efficiency of pyrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/HC270799/RWEDP/fd46ch1.html Biomass Briquetting: Technology and Practices - Introduction.]" Centre for Ecological Sciences INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE BANGALORE.

Two major components of the [[developing world]] are [[China]] and [[India]]. The economies are rapidly increasing due to cheap ways of harnessing electricity and emitting large amounts of [[carbon dioxide]]. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] attempted to regulate the emissions of the three different worlds, but there were disagreements as to which country should be penalized for emissions based on its previous and future emissions. The [[United States]] has been the largest emitter but [[China]] has recently become the largest per capita. The United States had emitted a rigorous amount of [[carbon dioxide]] during its development and the developing nations argue that they should not be forced to meet the requirements. At the lower end, the undeveloped nations believe that they have little responsibility for what has been done to the [[carbon dioxide]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/kyoto CBC News In Depth: Kyoto and beyond]." CBC.ca - Canadian News Sports Entertainment Kids Docs Radio TV. CBC News, 14 Feb. 2007. Web. 1 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
The major use of biomass briquettes in India, is in industrial applications usually to produce steam. A lot of conversions of boilers from FO to biomass briquettes have happened over the past decade. A vast majority of those projects are registered under CDM (Kyoto Protocol), which allows for users to get carbon credits.&lt;ref&gt;http://agrofuelindia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of biomass briquettes is strongly encouraged by issuing [[carbon credit]]s. One carbon credit is equal to one free ton of carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere. India has started to replace [[charcoal]] with biomass briquettes in regards to [[boiler]] fuel, especially in the southern parts of the country because the biomass briquettes can be created domestically, depending on the availability of land. Therefore, constantly rising fuel prices will be less influential in an economy if sources of fuel can be easily produced domestically.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gcmachines.com/News/Biomass-Briquettes.html Biomass Briquette.]" Www.gcmachines.com. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lehra Fuel Tech Pvt Ltd is approved by [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (India)|Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency]] (IREDA), is one of the largest briquetting machine manufacturers from [[Ludhiana]], India.

In the [[African Great Lakes]] region, work on biomass briquette production has been spearheaded by a number of NGOs with GVEP (Global Village Energy Partnership&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvepinternational.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;) taking a lead in promoting briquette products and briquette entrepreneurs in the three Great Lakes countries; namely, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. This has been achieved by a five-year EU and Dutch government sponsored project called DEEP EA (Developing Energy Enterprises Project East Africa) [http://www.gvepinternational.org/en/business/energy-enterprises#deep]. The main feed stock for briquettes in the East African region has mainly been charcoal dust although alternative like sawdust, bagasse, coffee husks and rice husks have also been used.[https://archive.is/20130415062456/http://www.gvepinternational.org/en/business/briquettes]

==Use in developed world==

Coal is the largest carbon dioxide emitter per unit area when it comes to electricity generation. It is also the most common ingredient in charcoal.{{Clarify|reason=coal is an ingredient in charcoal???|date=March 2013}} There has been a recent{{Clarify|reason=When was this updated?|date=March 2016}} push to replace the burning of fossil fuels with biomass.  The replacement of this nonrenewable resource with biological waste would lower the carbon footprint of grill owners and lower the overall pollution of the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.biomass.net/Biomass-Briquettes.html Biomass Briquettes.]"  Biomass.com.  Web.  30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens are also starting to manufacture briquettes at home.  The first machines would create briquettes for homeowners out of compressed [[sawdust]], however, current machines allow for briquette production out of any sort of dried biomass.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.biomass-briquette.com AGICO - Biomass Briquette Machine.]" AGICO Biomass Briquette Machine. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arizona has also taken initiative to turn waste biomass into a source of energy.  Waste cotton and pecan material used to provide a nesting ground for bugs that would destroy the new crops in the spring.  To stop this problem farmers buried the biomass, which quickly led to soil degradation.  These materials were discovered to be a very efficient source of energy and took care of issues that had plagued farms.

The United States Department of Energy has financed several projects to test the viability of biomass briquettes on a national scale.  The scope of the projects is to increase the efficiency of gasifiers as well as produce plans for production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://fossil.energy.gov/news/techlines/2010/10036-DOE_Selects_Projects_Focusing_on_g.html DOE Selects Projects to Advance Technologies for the Co-Production of Power and Hydrogen, Fuels or Chemicals from Coal-Biomass Feedstocks.]" United States Department of Energy. 18 Aug. 2010. Web. 04 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Biomass is composed of organic materials, therefore, large amounts of land are required to produce the fuel. Critics argue that the use of this land should be utilized for food distribution rather than crop degradation. Also, climate changes may cause a harsh season, where the material extracted will need to be swapped for food rather than energy. The assumption is that the production of biomass decreases the food supply, causing an increase in world hunger by extracting the organic materials such as corn and soybeans for fuel rather than food.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bionomicfuel.com/biomass-energy-pros-and-cons Biomass Energy: Pros and Cons – Updated Article With New Information.]" Green Energy Investments and News. 20 Sept. 2010. Web. 04 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of implementing a new technology such as biomass into the current infrastructure is also high. The [[fixed costs]] with the production of biomass briquettes are high due to the new undeveloped technologies that revolve around the extraction, production and storage of the biomass. Technologies regarding extraction of oil and coal have been developing for decades, becoming more efficient with each year. A new undeveloped technology regarding fuel utilization that has no infrastructure built around makes it nearly impossible to compete in the current market.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bionomicfuel.com/biomass-energy-pros-and-cons Biomass Energy: Pros and Cons – Updated Article With New Information.]" Green Energy Investments and News. 20 Sept. 2010.

'''Biopolymers''' are [[polymer]]s produced by [[Organism|living organisms]]; in other words, they are polymeric [[biomolecule]]s. Biopolymers contain [[monomer]]ic units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: [[polynucleotide]]s ([[RNA]] and [[DNA]]), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more [[nucleotide]] [[monomer]]s; [[polypeptides]], which are short polymers of [[amino acid]]s; and [[polysaccharides]], which are often linear bonded polymeric [[carbohydrate]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Cellulose]] is the most common organic compound and biopolymer on Earth. About 33 percent of all plant matter is cellulose. The cellulose content of cotton is 90 percent, for wood it is 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;
Klemm, D., Heublein, B., Fink, H., and Bohn, A., "Cellulose: 
Fascinating Biopolymer / Sustainable Raw Material", Ang. Chemie (Intl. Edn.) Vol. 44, p. 3358 (2004) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vs synthetic polymers ==

A major defining difference between '''biopolymers''' and '''synthetic''' polymers can be found in their structures. All polymers are made of repetitive units called [[monomer]]s. Biopolymers often have a well-defined structure, though this is not a defining characteristic (example: [[lignocellulose]]): 
The exact chemical composition and the sequence in which these units are arranged is called the [[primary structure]], in the case of proteins. Many biopolymers spontaneously fold into characteristic compact shapes (see also "[[protein folding]]"  as well as [[secondary structure]] and [[tertiary structure]]), which determine their biological functions and depend in a complicated way on their primary structures. [[Structural biology]] is the study of the structural properties of the biopolymers.
In contrast, most '''synthetic polymers''' have much simpler and more random (or stochastic) structures. This fact leads to a molecular mass distribution that is missing in biopolymers.
In fact, as their synthesis is controlled by a template-directed process in most ''in vivo'' systems, all biopolymers of a type (say one specific protein) are all alike: they all contain the similar sequences and numbers of monomers and thus all have the same mass. This phenomenon is called [[monodispersity]] in contrast to the [[polydispersity]] encountered in synthetic polymers. As a result, biopolymers have a [[polydispersity index]] of 1.&lt;ref&gt;
Stupp, S.I and Braun, P.V., "Role of Proteins in Microstructural Control: Biomaterials, Ceramics &amp; Semiconductors", Science, Vol. 277, p. 1242 (1997)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventions and nomenclature ==

=== Polypeptides ===

The convention for a [[polypeptide]] is to list its constituent amino acid residues as they occur from the amino terminus to the carboxylic acid terminus. The amino acid residues are always joined by [[peptide bond]]s. [[Protein]], though used colloquially to refer to any polypeptide, refers to larger or fully functional forms and can consist of several polypeptide chains as well as single chains. Proteins can also be modified to include non-peptide components, such as [[saccharide]] chains and [[lipid]]s.

=== Nucleic acids ===
The convention for a [[nucleic acid]] sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5' end to the 3' end of the [[polymer chain]], where 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of carbons around the ribose ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.

=== Sugars ===
Sugar-based biopolymers are often difficult with regards to convention. Sugar polymers can be linear or branched and are typically joined with [[glycosidic bond]]s. The exact placement of the linkage can vary, and the orientation of the linking functional groups is also important, resulting in α- and β-glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons' location in the ring. In addition, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical modifications, such as [[amination]], and can even form parts of other molecules, such as [[glycoprotein]]s.

== Structural characterization ==
There are a number of [[biophysics|biophysical]] techniques for determining sequence information. [[Peptide sequence|Protein sequence]] can be determined by [[Edman degradation]], in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified. Mass [[spectrometer]] techniques can also be used. Nucleic acid sequence can be determined using gel [[electrophoresis]] and capillary electrophoresis. Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using [[optical tweezers]] or [[atomic-force microscopy]]. [[Dual polarization interferometry]] can be used to measure the conformational changes or self-assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.

== As materials ==
Some biopolymers- such as  [[Polylactic acid|PLA]], naturally occurring [[zein]], and [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]] can be used as plastics, replacing the need for [[polystyrene]] or [[polyethylene]] based plastics.

Some plastics are now referred to as being 'degradable', 'oxy-degradable' or 'UV-degradable'. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent) [[oil]]-based and are not currently certified as 'biodegradable' under the [[European Union directive]] on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers will break down, and some are suitable for domestic [[composting]].&lt;ref name="nnfcc"&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-polymers-factsheet-bioplastics NNFCC Renewable Polymers Factsheet: Bioplastics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biopolymers (also called renewable polymers) are produced from [[biomass]] for use in the packaging industry. Biomass comes from crops such as sugar beet, potatoes or wheat: when used to produce biopolymers, these are classified as [[non food crops]]. These can be converted in the following pathways:

[[Sugar beet]] &amp;gt; Glyconic acid &amp;gt; Polyglyconic acid

[[Starch]] &amp;gt; (fermentation) &amp;gt; [[Lactic acid]] &amp;gt; [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA)

[[Biomass]] &amp;gt; (fermentation) &amp;gt; [[Bioethanol]] &amp;gt; [[Ethene]] &amp;gt; [[Polyethylene]]

Many types of packaging can be made from biopolymers: food trays, blown starch pellets for shipping fragile goods, thin films for wrapping.

===Environmental impacts===
Biopolymers can be sustainable, carbon neutral and are always [[renewable]], because they are made from plant materials which can be grown indefinitely. These plant materials come from agricultural [[non food crops]]. Therefore, the use of biopolymers would create a [[sustainable]] industry. In contrast, the feedstocks for polymers derived from petrochemicals will eventually deplete. In addition, biopolymers have the potential to cut [[carbon emissions]] and reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantities in the atmosphere: this is because the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released when they degrade can be reabsorbed by crops grown to replace them: this makes them close to [[carbon neutral]].

Biopolymers are biodegradable, and some are also compostable. Some biopolymers are [[biodegradable]]: they are broken down into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water by [[microorganisms]]. Some of these biodegradable biopolymers are [[compostable]]: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20μm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, even though they are "biodegradable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-5-biopolymers-a-renewable-resource-for-the-plastics-industry NNFCC Newsletter – Issue 5. Biopolymers: A Renewable Resource for the Plastics Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe there is a home composting standard and associated logo that enables consumers to identify and dispose of packaging in their compost heap.&lt;ref name="nnfcc" /&gt;

'''Bracell''' (formerly '''Bracell Limited''') is one of the largest specialty [[cellulose]] producers in the world. It was previously listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] ({{hkex|1768}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-and-china-dissolving-pulp-industry-report-2014-2017-300079691.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lesprom.com/en/news/Bracell_completes_1_1_billion_privatisation_75774/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccfgroup.com/newscenter/newsview.php?Class_ID=600000&amp;Info_ID=20161029014&lt;/ref&gt;

Bracell produces both specialty-grade and rayon-grade dissolving [[wood pulp]] from its subsidiary in [[Brazil]], Bahia Specialty Cellulose (BSC) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahiaspeccell.com&lt;/ref&gt; using wood resources grown from its own eucalyptus plantations. Dissolving wood pulp is the natural raw materials and key ingredients to a diverse range of everyday items from textiles, baby wipes and eyeglass frames, to soft ice-cream, sausage casings and pharmaceuticals, as well as industrial products such as high-performance tire cords.

It owns over 150,000 hectares of freehold timberland in Brazil, of which 84,000 hectares are reserved for eucalyptus plantation. Its harvest cycle is between six and seven years, one of the shortest globally. Its installed capacity at its Brazil operations is 485,000 tons of rayon-grade pulp or 320,000 tons of specialty-grade pulp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brazilcellulose.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Applications==

Its rayon-grade pulp can be used in viscose and lyocell fibers used in textiles; non-wovens including baby wipes, cosmetic masks; and viscose filament used in textiles and tissues.

Its specialty-grade pulp can be used in acetate flakes for cigarette filters, plastics and others; microcrystalline cellulose for food and pharmaceuticals; cord yarns for tires and conveyor belts; and other specialty applications such as sausage casings, cellophane, sponges, etc.

The '''Bridge Mill Power Plant''' is an historic [[hydroelectric plant]] at 25 Roosevelt Avenue in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]].  It is a red brick building, with sections two and three stories in height, located on the west bank of the [[Seekonk River]].  An ashlar granite retaining wall obscures a conduit which delivers water to the facility from the Pawtucket Falls Dam.  The facility has three parts: a gate house, which controls the flow of water into the power house, where five turbines were located.  A boiler house housed a steam generation facility which was used to generate power when the water levels were too low for hydroelectric power generation.  Built in 1893, this is probably the best-preserved 19th-century hydroelectric power station in Rhode Island.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/pawtucket/pawt_historic-resources-of-pawtucket-text.pdf|title=Historic Resources of Pawtucket (PDF pages 139-141)|publisher=Rhode Island Preservation|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5250">The '''current injection technique''' is a technique developed to reduce the turn-OFF switching transient of power bipolar [[semiconductor]] devices. It was developed and published by Dr S. Eio of [[Staffordshire University]] ([[United Kingdom]]) in 2007.

== Background ==

The Turn-OFF switching transient of [[silicon]]-based power bipolar semiconductor devices, caused by stored charge in the device during the forward conduction state, limits switching speed of the device, which in turn limits the efficiency of the application it is used within.

Different techniques, such as carrier lifetime control, injection efficiency and buffer layer devices, have been used to minimize turn-OFF switching transient, but all result in a trade-off between the ON-state loss and switching speed.

== Details of the Technique ==

The current injection technique examined in Dr Eio's publications optimize the switching transient of power [[diode]]s, [[thyristor]]s and [[Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor|insulated gate bipolar transistors]] (IGBTs) without the need of changing the structure of these devices. To implement the current injection technique, [[Electric current|current]] injection circuit was developed with results indicating that the injection of an additional current during its switching transient can reduce the reverse recovery charge of a given power diode and [[Thyristors|thyristor]], and also reduce the tail current of [[Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor|insulated gate bipolar transistors]].

Practical experimental results on [[diode]]s and [[thyristor]]s showed that the amplitude of the injected current required is proportional to the peak reverse recovery current and proved that these devices experience a momentary increase in recombination of current carriers during the injection of the additional current. This help to prevent the device from conducting large negative current, which in turn reduce its reverse recovery charge and reverse recovery time. Results obtained from experiments with [[insulated gate bipolar transistor|insulated gate bipolar transistors]] showed a significant reduction in the time where current falls to zero when opposing current was injected into the device during its turn-off transient. Further simulation results from numerical modeling showed that the injected opposing current temporary increase [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] in the device and therefore reduce the extracted excess carriers that stored within the device.

To prevent circuit commutation and bonding between the current injection circuit and the main test circuit where the [[device under test]] (DUT) is connected to, non-invasive circuit was developed to magnetically couple the two circuits.

In summary, current injection technique makes it possible to use devices with low forward voltage drop for high frequency applications. This also imply cheaper cost of devices as less processing steps are required during the manufacturing stages where the need of carrier lifetime control techniques are reduced. This removed the need for the semiconductor device used in the current injection circuit to have high breakdown voltage rating and also provided electrical isolation. Typical application of this technique in an inductive load chopper circuit showed a significant reduction in the tail current of [[Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor|insulated gate bipolar transistors]], and the reverse recovery time and charge of the [[Flyback diode|freewheeling diode]] used.

Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The drylands can be classified into four sub-types: dry sub-humid lands, semi-arid lands, arid lands, and hyper-arid lands. Some authorities consider Hyper-arid lands as deserts ([[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]]) although a number of the world's deserts include both hyper arid and arid climate zones. The UNCCD excludes hyper-arid zones from its definition of drylands.

Drylands cover 41.3% of the earth’s land surface, including 15% of [[Latin America]], 66% of [[Africa]], 40% of [[Asia]] and 24% of [[Europe]]. There is a significantly greater proportion of drylands in [[developing country|developing countries]] (72%), and the proportion increases with aridity: almost 100% of all Hyper Arid lands are in the developing world. Nevertheless, the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and several countries in [[Southern Europe]] also contain significant dryland areas.&lt;ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment" /&gt;

Drylands are complex, evolving structures whose characteristics and dynamic properties depend on many interrelated links between climate, soil, and vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Iturbe, I. and A.

== Biodiversity ==
The livelihoods of millions of people in [[developing countries]] depend highly on dryland biodiversity to ensure their food security and their well-being. Drylands, unlike more humid biomes, rely mostly on above ground water runoff for redistribution of water, and almost all their water redistribution occurs on the surface&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puigdefabregas|first=J|date=October 1999|title=Scales and processes of water and sediment redistribution in drylands: results from the Rambla Honda field site in Southeast Spain|url=|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=48|pages=39|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(99)00046-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dryland inhabitants' lifestyle provides global environmental benefits which contribute to halt [[climate change]], such as [[carbon sequestration]] and species conservation. Dryland biodiversity is equally of central importance as to ensuring [[sustainable development]], along with providing significant global economic values through the provision of [[ecosystem services]] and biodiversity products. The UN Conference on Sustainable Development [[Rio+20]], held in [[Brazil]] in June 2012, stressed the intrinsic value of biological diversity and recognized the severity of global [[biodiversity loss]] and degradation of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/fr/propos/union/commissions/wcpa/?10867/Conserving-Drylands-Biodiversity|title=Conserving Drylands Biodiversity|date=9 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eivind Kristofer Reiten''' (born 2 April 1953) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] economist, [[corporate officer]] and [[politician]] for the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]]. He was a [[Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Fisheries]] and [[Minister of Petroleum and Energy (Norway)|Minister of Petroleum and Energy]] during the 1980s, before entering a career in business. Reiten served as the Director General (CEO) of [[Norsk Hydro]] between 2001 and 2009, after which he took up the chairmanship of [[Norske Skog]]. Eivind Reiten was also Chairman of [[StatoilHydro]] for four days, until he resigned from his position after [[Norsk Hydro]] had been accused of corruption.

==Political career==
Reiten was born in [[Midsund]] as the son of Kristofer Reiten, a farmer and fisher, and housewife Kjellaug Opstad. He enrolled as a student in 1972, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo]] in 1978 with a [[Cand.oecon.|degree]] in economics. He worked as a civil servant from 1979 to 1982, and as a secretary for the Centre Party from 1982 to 1983. He was then brought into the government as [[state Secretary (Norway)|state secretary]] to the [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]] from 1983 to 1985. He then became [[Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Fisheries]] from 1985 to 1986 as part of the [[Second cabinet Willoch]], and [[Minister of Petroleum and Energy (Norway)|Minister of Petroleum and Energy]] from 1989 to 1990 as part of [[Cabinet Syse]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{stortingetbio|EIRE}}. Retrieved on 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last political position, he was responsible for the deregulation of the electricity market in Norway.&lt;ref name=sparrebjorndal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article1195359.ece |title= - Det er veldig bittert |author=Sparre, Martin Riber |author2=Bjørndal, Bente |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2008 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having chaired the [[Centre Youth]], the youth wing of the Centre Party, from 1979 to 1981, he served as a deputy representative to the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] from 1985 to 1989.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Business career==
Reiten started working for [[Norsk Hydro]] in 1988, heading the energy division from that year, and becoming senior vice president of special projects in 1991. From 1992 he led the refining and marketing division, and from 1998 the aluminum division. He was appointed executive vice president for light metals in 1999. He succeeded [[Egil Myklebust]] as chief executive officer in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydro.com/en/Persons/Eivind-Reiten/ |title=Eivind Reiten |author=[[Norsk Hydro]] |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2008 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101141638/http://www.hydro.com/en/Persons/Eivind-Reiten/ |archivedate=1 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the board of the [[Norges Bank|Bank of Norway]] from 1991 to 1994 and [[Norske Skog]]industrier from 1997 to 2000, and has [[chair (official)|chaired]] the board of [[Posten Norge|Norway Post]] (1996–1999) and [[Telenor]] (2000–2001).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He has attended the [[Bilderberg Group|Bilderberg]] meetings.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} He is a fellow of the [[Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntva.no/index.php?option=com_club&amp;view=member&amp;id=362%3Areiten-eivind-kristofer&amp;Itemid=60|title=Medlemmer: REITEN, Eivind Kristofer|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libya corruption case===
As part of the merger between [[Statoil]] and the oil and gas division of Norsk Hydro, Reiten was appointed [[chair (official)|chair]] of the merged [[StatoilHydro]] that merged on 1 October 2007. Four days later Reiten withdrew from the seat.&lt;ref name=sparrebjorndal /&gt; The reason was that it was uncertain whether or not he knew about a corruption case Hydro had been accused of, where a [[Libya]]n consulting company and the consultant Abdurrazag Gammudi had been paid {{NOK|60 million}}, used to make bribes, after the Hydro take-over of [[Saga Petroleum]] in 1999. Stated Reiten, it was in no-one's interest that he retain a conflict of interest by retaining the seat of chair in the company that would investigate himself. The case had arisen on 26 September, after a Hydro employee had leaked information about the matter; it had not been identified as part of the [[due diligence]] performed by Statoil prior to the merger.&lt;ref name=sparrebjorndal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.no/energi/article1192587.ece |title=Alt om Libyasaken |author=Bjerke, Espen |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2008 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by his deputy, [[Marit Arnstad]], who is also a former Minister of Petroleum and Energy from the Centre Party.&lt;ref name=sparrebjorndal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.no/energi/article1195400.ece |title=- Marit Arnstad ny StatoilHydro-leder |author=Bjerke, Espen |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=4 October 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2008 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation from StatoilHydro concluded that Reiten was informed about this during 2000 and 2001, while the investigation in Norsk Hydro concluded that Reiten did not know about the corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.auraavis.no/meninger/leder/article3884051.ece |title=Hydrosjefen for fall? |author=[[Aure Avis]] |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2008 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Norsk Hydro investigation—that included checking 1.5 million documents—could not show that Reiten knew about the corruption, Hydro Chairman [[Terje Vareberg]] confirmed that Reiten would not be removed from his position. However, two executives of StatoilHydro were required to leave immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nrk.no/nyheter/okonomi/1.6251536 |title=Eivind Reiten blir sittende |author=Sættem, Johan B. |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2008 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaving Norsk Hydro===
In January 2009 Reiten announced that he was stepping down as Chief Executive of Norsk Hydro from 30 March 2009, with executive vice president [[Svein Richard Brandtzæg]] taking over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Hydro Chief Reiten steps down |url=http://www.norwaypost.no/content/view/21477/1/ | agency =[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=Norway Post |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiten has since been nominated to replace Kim Wahl as Chairman of [[Norske Skog]] at the company's [[annual general meeting]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKOSN00191220090206|title=Norske Skog nominates Eivind Reiten as chairman|last=Stoltz|first=Aasa Christine|date=6 February 2009|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7385">The '''Energy Policy Institute of Australia''' is an apolitical, not-for-profit energy policy body. It was created as the Energy Alliance of Australia in 1999 to collaborate with the [[Australian Government]] on the development of energy export markets. The Institute advocates technology neutrality as a core principle of energy policy.  The Institute adopted the name Energy Policy Institute of Australia in 2011. 

For ten years from 2008, the Institute convened an annual forum called the ''Energy State of the Nation'' but this has been superseded by more frequent events as policy issues have arisen. The Institute is governed by a Board of Directors who represent a diverse mix of corporate entities with interests in Australia's energy sector.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energypolicyinstitute.com.au/images/EPIA_membership_brochure_March_2016-for_web.pdf|title=Australia’s Independent Energy Policy Body|last=|first=|date=|website=www.energypolicyinstitute.com.au|publisher=|accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute was established in 1999 as the Energy Alliance of Australia, in consultation with the [[Australian Government]]'s [[Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism]]. It was designed as a vehicle for Australia's energy sector to liaise with the Asia Pacific Energy Cooperation (APEC) organisation. The Energy Alliance of Australia initiated the establishment of APGAS in 2005 as a forum for APEC Member States' energy policymakers, industry regulators, oil and gas suppliers and consumers, traders and pipeline and ship owners and operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.eiseverywhere.com/file_uploads/bfa9db8dd093c5db75f994a4122bf32b_ESON2015flyer-published5Mar.pdf|title = The Energy State of the Nation (ESON) 2015|date = 2014-03-20|accessdate = 2015-06-14|website = Energy Policy Institute of Australia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years APGAS closed, having fulfilled its purpose of accelerating cross-border gas trade. 

== Philosophy ==
The Institute aims to foster an attractive and secure energy investment climate in Australia, and promote an industry which is internationally competitive. It supports free markets and a "resilient" energy supply system, supported by integrated government policy. The Institute accepts "that the world must transition to a low-carbon society as quickly as it can afford to do so."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activity ==
The Institute conducts research into policy, technology, economics, trade and investment relevant to the energy sector. The research is disseminated through the publication of policy papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energypolicyinstitute.com.au/index.php/publications/public-policy-papers|title=Energy Policy Institute - Public Policy Papers (By Invited Authors)|website=www.energypolicyinstitute.com.au|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; presentation of briefings and facilitation of workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energypolicyinstitute.com.au/index.php/calendar-of-events/institute-events|title=Energy Policy Institute - Institute Events|website=www.energypolicyinstitute.com.au|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides "a trusted communications channel between government and the private sector" and represents the Australian industry to the APEC Energy Working Group and similar international bodies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Institute is affiliated with the US Energy Association of Washington DC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usea.org/|title=US Energy Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2016, the Institute commenced to publish a continually updated compendium of its policy papers. The compendium lists the key points of all past papers and is hyperlinked to each of the original papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energypolicyinstitute.com.au/images/Public_Policy_Papers_-_Compendium_of_Key_Points_-_May17.pdf]{{Cite web|url=http://energypolicyinstitute.com.au/images/Public_Policy_Papers_-_Compendium_of_Key_Points_-_Oct16.pdf|title=Energy Policy Institute - Compendium of Policy Papers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the Institute published An Australian Energy Vision and Framework for Energy Policy Priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energypolicyinstitute.com.au/images/EPIA_Vision_Paper_August_2016.pdf|title=Energy Policy Institute - Energy Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the EPIA forwarded its final submission to the Finkel Review on Security of the NEM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energypolicyinstitute.com.au/images/EPIA_Finkel_Review_Mar_2017.pdf|title=EPIA submission to Finkel review|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and then in June 2017, the Institute published its position after the release of the Finkel Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energypolicyinstitute.com.au/images/EPIA_policy_position_Finkel_16_Jun_2017.pdf|title=EPIA's position on the Finkel Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPIA runs a series of Executive Briefings for its members on topical issues with an important bearing on the development of energy policy in Australia.  All events are listed on the Institute's website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energypolicyinstitute.com.au/index.php/calendar-of-events/institute-events|title=Institute events|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Governance ==
The EPIA's members meet once a year, the board meets three times a year, and an Executive Committee (elected by the Board) meets monthly. Each corporate member has the right to appoint a director to the board.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The Executive Director is [[Robert Pritchard (Australian businessman)|Robert Pritchard]]. Robert has over 40 years’ experience as a lawyer and adviser to industry, governments and organisations on energy projects and policies, both in Australia and overseas, and as a director of companies in the energy sector. This includes serving as Managing Director of ResourcesLaw International, Chairman of the St Baker Energy Innovation Fund and SMR Nuclear Technology. Robert was the first Chairman of the Energy Law Section of the International Bar Association and served for nine years on the Finance Committee of the World Energy Council.

'''Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy''' ('''EFN''') is a pro-[[nuclear power]] [[non-profit organization]] which aims at providing complete and straightforward information to the public on energy and the environment.  It also promotes the benefits of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] for a cleaner world, and aims at uniting people in favor of clean nuclear energy.

The website of the organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolo.org|title=Environmentalists For Nuclear ™ - International home page (EFN)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that environmental opposition to nuclear energy is the "greatest misunderstanding and mistake of the century".

EFN is funded by the memberships and donations of its members.

==History==

The '''European Thermoelectric Society (ETS)''' is a non-profit organization founded in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.org/ztlinks/european-thermoelectric-society ''ZTlinks'' - Thermoelectric Websites] Website of the International Thermoelectric Society. Retrieved 2016-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the ETS are to promote European research and development activities and professional networking in the field of [[Thermoelectric effect|thermoelectricity]].

At present, the society has hundred-some members on average and its domicile is the [http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/imw/mc/index.html ''Institute for Materials Sciences (Chair of Materials Chemistry)''] at the [http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/home/ University of Stuttgart]/Germany.

== History ==
The idea to establish a ″thermoelectric network″ within the European Union started to take shape at the 1st European Workshop on Thermoelectricity in [[Dresden]]/[[Germany]] in October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.org/system/files/itsnews_stories201411/199606-TENews-v8n1.pdf Heinrich, A., Schilz, J., Scherrer, H. (1996) ″European Thermoelectric Society". ''Thermoelectric News'', 8(1), p.14]. Retrieved 2016-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual foundation assembly of the European Thermoelectric Society with participants from eight European countries was held in [[Cologne]]/[[Germany]] in February 1995. The first elected president was Hubert Scherrer ([[France]]).

== Aims ==
The ETS aims to represent the interests of everyone in Europe involved in [[Thermoelectric effect|thermoelectricity]]. It offers a platform to the European [[Thermoelectric effect|thermoelectric]] community to improve exchange of information and pool resources. On the other hand, it acts as a single point of contact for economy, politics and the interested public. It is committed to watch trends, give directions for future activities, develop visions, and render guidance to those interested in the field. An important function is to raise awareness of [[Thermoelectric effect|thermoelectricity]] and its applications in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermoelectricity.eu/documents/ets_statuten_en.pdf ETS Bylaws.] Website of the European Thermoelectric Society. Retrieved 2016-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to live up to these purposes, the ETS is organizer of conferences in topics of interest to the community and establishes a communication network between members. In addition, the ETS is in close contact to other [[Thermoelectric effect|thermoelectric]] groups and societies in Europe ([http://www.thermoelektrik.org DTG]/Germany, [http://www.thermoelectric.ch STS]/Switzerland, [http://www.gdr-thermoelectricite.cnrs.fr GDR TE]/France, [http://ait.ieni.cnr.it/index.php/it/english AIT]/Italy) and worldwide ([http://www.its.org ITS]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermoelectricity.eu/links/about.html About the European Thermoelectric Society] Website of the European Thermoelectric Society. Retrieved 2016-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The organs of the society are the general assembly, the executive committee, the extended committee and the auditors.

The general assembly consists of all individual members of the society. A member can be any individual person from industry or academic institutions with activities or interests in [[Thermoelectric effect|thermoelectricity]]. Registration for the European Conference on Thermoelectrics (ECT) involves an obligatory one year membership. The executive committee consisting of president, secretary, and treasurer manages and represents the society, while the extended committee acts in an advisory capacity. The members of both committees are elected by the general assembly for a three-year term.

== Meetings ==
The European countries take turns at organizing the annual European Conference on Thermoelectrics (ECT) showcasing trends, developments, products and services of academia and industry in the field.

Every three years the ECT coincides with the International Conference on Thermoelectrics (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;Vining, C.B., Rowe, D.M., Stockholm, J., Rao, K.R.

== Awards ==
Together with the German, Italian and Swiss Thermoelectric Societies, the ETS sponsors three poster prizes every year. The prizes are endowed with a prize money of 500 Euro each and awarded at the annual ECT.

== Honorary Members ==
According to the ETS bylaws, the executive committee may appoint a person as honorary member in recognition of his achievements. On this basis, the long-time active members Hubert Scherrer ([[France]]) and Harald Böttner ([[Germany]]) were awarded the honorary membership at the ECT2013 in [[Noordwijk]]/[[Netherlands]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10606">Expansion and shock tunnels are aerodynamic testing facilities with a specific interest in high speeds and high temperature testing. Shock tunnels use steady flow nozzle expansion whereas expansion tunnels use unsteady expansion with higher [[enthalpy]], or thermal energy. In both cases the gases are compressed and heated until the gases are released, expanding rapidly down the expansion chamber. The tunnels reach speeds from [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 to Mach 30 to create testing conditions that simulate [[hypersonic]] to [[re-entry]] flight. These tunnels are used by military and government agencies to test hypersonic vehicles that undergo a variety of natural phenomenon that occur during hypersonic flight.&lt;ref&gt;Stalker R.J."Modern developments in hypersonic wind tunnels,"The Aeronautical Journal January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion Process ==
===Expansion Tube===
Expansion tunnels use a dual-diaphragm system where the diaphragms act as rupture discs, or a pressure relief. The tunnel is separated into three sections: drive, driven, and acceleration. The drive section is filled with high pressure helium gas. The driven section is filled with a lower pressure desired test gas, such as carbon dioxide, helium, nitrogen, or oxygen. The acceleration section is filled with an even lower pressurized test gas. Each section is divided by a diaphragm, which is meant to be ruptured in sequence causing the first diaphragm to rupture, mixing and expanding the drive and the driven. When the shock wave hits the second diaphragm, it ruptures casing the two gases to mix with the acceleration and expand down the enclosed test section. Operation time is approximately 250 microseconds.&lt;ref&gt;Hollis, Brian R.; Perkins, John N.,  “Hypervelocity Heat-Transfer Measurements in an Expansion Tube,” AIAA Paper 96-2240 (New Orleans, LA: 19th AIAA Advanced Measurement and Ground Testing Technology Conference, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shock Tunnel===
Reflected shock tunnels heat and pressurize a stagnant gas by using shockwaves that are redirected back into the center; this excites the gases and produces movement, heat, and pressure. The gases are then released and expanded through the nozzle and into the test chamber. Operation time is approximately 20 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="Mach 10"&gt;Bakos, R. J.; Tsai, C.-Y.; Rogers, R. C.; Shih, A. T.,"The Mach 10 Component of NASA's Hyper-X Ground Test Program," Langley Research Center(1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
During the expansion process, a variety of test are run to analyze the aerodynamic and thermal properties of the test vehicle. 
*	'''[[Skin friction]]'''
: The drag that is created when an object travels through a fluid, such as a liquid or gas.
*	'''[[Flow chemistry]]'''
: The analysis of reactions that take place during a continuous flow.
*	'''Durability'''
: The ability to withstand deterioration.
*	'''[[Turbulence]]'''
: The disordered movement of fluids.
*	'''[[Heat transfer]]'''
: The thermal energy transfer from one system to another.
*	'''Aero elastic'''
: The forces created by the movement of air and the manner in which air bends around the object.
*	'''[[Thermal protection]]'''
: The ability to withstand heat transfer, reducing the temperature.
*	'''[[Vibration]]'''
: The oscillation, or shaking, of the molecules.

==Testing Instruments==
*	'''Thin-film Heat Transfer Gauge'''
: When the gauge is heated, the resistance changes; this causes a change in voltage, which is used to calculate the amount of heat transferred into an object.
*	'''Piezoelectric Pressure Transducer'''
: Under pressure, crystals became electrically charged, proportional to that of the pressure exerted.
*	'''Laser Diode Spectrograph'''
: Measures the properties of the refracted light, generated by the laser traveling through the turbulent gas around an object.
*	'''Force -Moment Balance'''
:  Used to measure three or  six components, three forces (lift, drag, and side) and three moments (pitch, roll, and yaw), to completely describe the conditions on the model. Forces on the model are detected by strain gauges located on the balance. Each gauge measures a force by the stretching of an electrical element or foil in the gauge. The stretching changes the resistance of the gauge which changes the measured electric current through the gauge according to Ohm's law. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor.

==Facilities==
=== Hypervelocity Expansion Tube (HET) ===
The HET is one of the shock tunnels in the Caltech Hypersonics group at the California Institute of Technology directed by Professor Joanna Austin.  It operates similarly to a shock tube where a shock formed by the primary diaphragm heats up the test gas.  The novel part of this facility is when its test gas is further accelerated by an expansion shock that forms when the primary shock interacts with a second downstream diaphragm.  It is a 150mm inner diameter facility with the capability to reach Mach 4-8, and was built in 2005.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last = Dufrene | first = A. | last2 = Sharma | first2 = M. | last3 = Austin | first3 = J.

=== HYPULSE ===
NASA's Hypersonic Pulse Facility (HYPULSE) is operated by the [[General Applied Science Laboratory]] (GASL) in New York. The HYPULSE facility was developed for the testing of re-entry vehicles and air-breathing engines. The specifications of the HYPULSE include a diameter of 7 feet and a 19 foot length. This facility was upgraded to have two modes, Reflected Shock Tunnel (RST) and Shock-Expansion Tunnel (SET). HYPULSE-RST generates speeds from Mach 5 to 10, whereas the HYPULSE-SET produces speeds from Mach 12 to 25.&lt;ref name="Mach 10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamagno, Jose; Bakos, Robert; Pulsonetti, Maria; Erdos, John, “Hypervelocity Real Gas Capabilities of GASL's Expansion Tube (HYPULSE) Facility,” AIAA Paper 90-1390(Seattle, WA: AIAA 16th Aerodynamic Ground Testing Conference, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
:Vehicles tested at HYPULSE:
*'''[[Hyper-X]]'''
*'''[[X-34]]'''
*'''HYPLUSE Scramjet Model (HSM)'''

=== LENS-I,II ===
Large Energy National Shock tunnels (LENS) were constructed over the past 15 years at the Aerothermal/Aero-optic Evaluation Center (AAEC) at CUBRC. The LENS facilities were developed for the testing of advanced missile seekerheads and scramjet engines. LENS I and LENS II have similar control, compression and data acquisition systems. LENS I facility has an 11-inch diameter by 25.5 foot long drive tube that is electrically heated with an 8-inch by 60 foot driven section capable of reaching Mach 7 to 18. Test models can have a maximum length of 12 feet and a diameter of 3 feet. The LENS I heats up the drive gas to 750 degrees F to operate at a maximum 30,000 psi. The LENS II facility integrates a 24-inch diameter to both the 60 foot drive and also the 100 foot driven tubes, which runs between Mach 3 and 9.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wadhams,M.S. Holden, M.G. MacLean,"Experimental Space Shuttle Orbiter Studies to Acquire Data for Code and Flight Heating Model Validation," AIAA 2010-1576(Orlando, Fl:48th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
:Vehicles tested at LENS-I:

*'''BLK IVA'''
*'''[[NASA X-43|X-43]]'''
*'''ARRRMD'''
*'''HyCause'''
*'''RRSS'''

=== LENS-X ===
LENS-X is an 8 foot diameter by 100 foot expansion tunnel with a top speed of Mach 30. The drive chamber, filled with helium or hydrogen gas, is compressed to 3,000 psi at 1000 degrees Fahrenheit; this breaks the first diaphragm, causing the driven chamber to experience an influx of hot gas, generating pressures over 20,000 psi before the second diaphragm is ruptured.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, Eric, "Fastest Wind Tunnel to Put NASA's Orion to the Test,"Discovery News. {{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/01/05/wind-tunnel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231155/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/01/05/wind-tunnel.html |archivedate=2011-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Vehicles tested at LENS-X:
*'''Orion'''
*'''DARPA Falcon'''

===High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel (HIEST)===
It is located at Kakuda Space research centre – [[JAXA]] (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency). Both high pressure and high temperature can be simulated simultaneously in this tunnel. Major applications include Aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic tests on scale models of returnable spacecraft; and Combustion process tests on scramjet engines. [[HYFLEX]] (Hypersonic Flight Experiment) which was a re-entry demonstrator prototype vehicle of JAXA was tested in this facility. Another speciality of this tunnel is 3 pistons of different masses can be used. &lt;ref&gt;

===T4 Shock Tunnel===
It is located at [[University of Queensland]], Australia. It is a large free piston driven shock tunnel capable of producing sub-orbital flow speeds at a range of Mach numbers.The T4 shock tunnel began operation in April 1987 and commenced routine operation, after a commissioning period, in September 1987.  The 10000th shot of T4 was fired in August 2008 and it remains significantly better than X2. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uq.edu.au/hypersonics/index.html?page=32641&amp;pid=0&lt;/ref&gt;

===T5 Hypervelocity Shock Tunnel Facility===
It is a free piston shock tunnel located at [[California Institute of Technology]], USA. It is the largest free-piston shock tunnel in the world at a university. It is an impulse facility capable of reaching very high stagnation enthalpies (25 MJ/kg) and pressures (40 MPa). The test time is on the order of 1 ms. It uses helium and argon as the driver gas and a .25" steel plate as its primary diaphragm. Test gases include air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or mixtures thereof. The 120kg piston can reach maximum speeds in excess of 300 m/s. &lt;ref&gt;http://shepherd.caltech.edu/T5/facilities/T5/T5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2870">'''Fire rock''' is manufactured [[Volcanic rock|lava rock]] that is sold in various shapes and sizes, and is used as a medium for retaining direct heat. Fire rocks are used in natural gas [[fireplace]]s or in natural gas or propane burning [[fire pit]]s. It may be used as the main fuel distributor or as padding for [[fire glass]] to go on top. Fire rocks are proven to increase combustion efficiency and maintain a desirable aesthetic quality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpcfire.com/outdoor/product/more-components/fire-pit-media/lava-rock/&lt;/ref&gt; They also are known for dispersing the flame of the fireplace or fire pit well, by allowing for gaps that act as channels for air and gas to funnel the flame through.&lt;ref&gt;http://paloform.com/fire-pits/modern-fire-pit-toppings-part-2-the-options/&lt;/ref&gt; Fire rocks come in many different colors and range in sizes from a half-inch to an inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

Fire rock is noted for its ability to withstand high temperatures of direct heat for prolonged periods of time. Unlike river rock, which is non-porous and highly explosive when heated, fire rock is considered a [[Porosity|porous]] substance that is capable of releasing heat through tiny holes in its outer layer.&lt;ref&gt;http://watershapes.com/lessons-learned/beware-of-exploding-lava-rocks.html&lt;/ref&gt; Damp fire rocks have been known to "pop" and throw pea sized pieces of rock as they heat. The moisture that is caught in the fire rock creates air pockets that can easily split the rock when heated.&lt;ref&gt;http://watershapes.com/lessons-learned/beware-of-exploding-lava-rocks.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Fire rocks must be stored away from high moisture areas and kept dry to keep this problem from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;https://pro.com/blog/7-things-know-fire-pits/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://glazchipsfireglass.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/comparing-lava-rocks-and-fire-glass/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://watershapes.com/lessons-learned/beware-of-exploding-lava-rocks.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco Friendly==

Because fire rock does not emit any [[carbon dioxide]] when heated, it is considered an eco-friendly burning solution. Fire rock can be used multiple times and when cared for can be burned for years on end. It produces no ash, which cuts back on the number of toxins in the home.&lt;ref&gt;http://paloform.com/fire-pits/modern-fire-pit-toppings-part-2-the-options/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aztec Translation==
The aztec civilisation named their children after these rocks to strike fear into their enemys. Many aztec soldiers were named Milintica as this was the name for fire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aztec]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}}

'''Green Communication Challenge''' is an organization founded and led by [[Francesco De Leo]] that actively promotes the development of energy conservation technology and practices in the field of [[Information and Communications Technology]] (ICT). 
Green Comm Challenge achieved worldwide notoriety in 2007, when it enlisted as one of the challengers in the 33rd edition of the America's Cup,&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://33rd.americascup.com/en/entry.php|title=33rd Americas Cup roster|website=americascup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; an effort meant to show how researchers, technologists and entrepreneurs from around the world can be brought together by an exciting vision: building the ultimate [[renewable energy]] machine, a competitive America’s Cup boat.

== The Challenge ==
ICT is helping society become more energy efficient: think of the positive impact on {{CO2}} emissions of telecommuting and ecommerce for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cit.cmu.edu/media/press/2009/03_03_online_shopping.html|title=Page not found!|website=www.cit.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/04/world-wildlife-fund-looks-at-telecommuting-as-carbon-emissions-solution.php|title=World Wildlife Fund Looks at Telecommuting as Carbon Emissions Solution|website=treehugger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computers are helping us design more energy efficient products. But there is little doubt that, while other industries strive to become more energy efficient, computers and networks themselves risk becoming the “energy hogs” of the future, unless something is done.

Powering the over 1 billion [[personal computers]], the millions of corporate [[data centers]], the over 4 billion fixed and mobile [[telephones]] and telecommunications networks around the world requires approximately 1.4 Petawatt-hr a year ({{val|1.4|e=15|u=W-hr}}) of electricity,&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/rss/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=220900310&amp;cid=RSSfeed_eetimes_newsRSS Mobile networks to be reworked for energy efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 8% of the global electrical energy produced in 2005. And consider that over 4 billion people around the world have never used a cell phone, almost three times as many as those who currently have access to one.

Some estimates project that the above percentage will grow to 15% by 2020,&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; but these projections may fail to take into account some of the disruptive trends we are witnessing today.   Take Google for example: to power the over 75 billion searches performed in July 2009 the company needed an estimated one million servers, consuming an estimated 1.3 Terawatt-hr a year ({{val|1.3|e=12|u=W-hr}}).  The number of searches has grown over 60% between 2008 and 2009 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/8/Global_Search_Market_Draws_More_than_100_Billion_Searches_per_Month|title=Global Search Market Draws More than 100 Billion Searches per Month|website=comscore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is no surprise that the company is planning to manage as many as 10 million servers in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/10/20/google-envisions-10-million-servers|title=Google Envisions 10 Million Servers|date=20 October 2009|website=datacenterknowledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion of video on the net is another disruptive element. The Amesterdam Internet exchange (AMS-IX), which handles approximately 20% of Europe’s traffic, saw its aggregate data traffic increase from 1.75 Petabyte per day in November 2007 to an expected 4 Petabyte per day in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams-ix.net/about/AR_AMS-IX_2008.pdf AMS-IX Report 2008 Page 23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608010412/http://www.ams-ix.net/about/AR_AMS-IX_2008.pdf |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this rapid increase in traffic is driven by widespread use of voice and, in particular, video over the Internet.

== Current efforts==
Green Comm Challenge’s founders believe that defining a corollary to [[Moore’s Law]] is in order:  increases in processor performance must be accompanied by a less-than proportional increase in energy consumption.

This, of course, is no easy undertaking. It will require a new engineering approach to designing computers, cell phones and networks. It will also require a new management culture, capable of recognizing the attractive [[Rate of return|ROI]]s that green technology can generate, in addition to being more sensitive to the environmental impact of management's decisions.

This is why Green Comm has fully embraced the ICT energy-efficiency challenge by establishing an interdisciplinary approach that involves some of the most innovative thinkers around the world.  We are currently involved in the following four initiatives:

* '''[[University of California, Los Angeles]]''': we are coordinating the research efforts of 4 departments: Computer Science, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. Biology is expected to follow suit. For the first time in the history of UCLA, these teams have the opportunity to share research facilities and cooperate on Green ICT research projects. We are currently focusing on the study of new materials, superconductors, energy storage and [[cloud computing architecture]]s. Last but not least, we are looking into the evolution of smart appliances, a project that promises to significantly reduce the energy consumption of user devices by eliminating hard disks and significantly “dumbing down” the processor, making it less energy hungry.
* '''[[IESE]]''', in Barcelona, is looking into the management implications of the widespread adoption of Green ICT practices. One of our goals is to educate CEOs on the following key issues:
**How sensitive is their business to the dynamics of the energy sector
**What are the implications of energy price disruptions form a customer standpoint? Will customers be more likely to purchase their companies' products because they are more energy efficient, and respectful of the environment?
* '''Investment Company''': research by itself, while essential, will not carry the day. As members of the global business community we must be willing to invest in the future and assume risks. To this end we are planning on closing a $175M investment fund within the end of 2009. The fund will focus on the following areas:
** Cloud computing
** New-generation materials
** [[Machine to Machine]] communications, a.k.a. “the Internet of things”, that is the notion that a multiplicity of device types can be allowed to communicate, making the network smarter and more capable of utilizing resources efficiently.
* '''[[America's Cup]]'''. Green Comm Challenge sees the America’s Cup as more than just a sailing race: it’s a unique opportunity to rally some of the best minds in the world behind e very exciting goal: designing and manufacturing the ultimate renewable energy machine, a winning America’s cup boat. While the future of the America’s cup, at least as the multi-country competition the world had come to love, is being decided in a court of law, there is no official timeline for a competition involving the several challengers that have expressed interest in participating.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; Green Comm Challenge remains committed to the event regardless of what venue and hull type will be chosen eventually.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5206">In electrical engineering, '''isolated-phase bus''' (IPB), also known as Phase-isolated Bus (PIB) in some countries, is a method of construction for circuits carrying very large currents, typically between a [[Electrical generator|generator]] and its step-up [[transformer]] in a steam or large [[hydroelectric]] power plant.
[[File:Isolated phase bus Bui dam Ghana.jpg|thumb|right| Isolated phase bus during installation at the [[Bui Dam]] Ghana. Segments of bus are temporarily supported by scaffolding. The interior aluminum conductors are temporarily braced for installation. The inner conductors and outer enclosure will be welded to form a unit. Inside the enclosure, the inner conductor is supported by polymer insulators; a small hatch for access to the insulator is visible. Each phase is separated.]]
Each [[three-phase power|phase]] current is carried on a separate conductor, enclosed in a separate grounded metal housing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald G. Fink]] and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'',McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}} pages 10-87 through 10-89&lt;/ref&gt; Conductors are usually hollow aluminum tubes or aluminum bars, supported within the housing on porcelain or polymer insulators. The metal housings are electrically connected so that induced current, nearly of the magnitude of the phase current, can flow through the housing, in the opposite direction from the phase current.  The [[magnetic field]] produced by this current nearly exactly cancels the magnetic field produced by the phase current, so there is almost no external magnetic field produced.  This also limits the amount of force produced between conductors during a [[short circuit]]. The external housings of the conductors remain at a low potential with respect to earth ground and are usually bonded to ground.

By enclosing the conductors in separate housings a high degree of protection from two-phase and three-phase faults is obtained. Almost any fault would instead be a single-phase earth fault which does not produce a large fault current. The conductors between the generator and the first [[circuit breaker]] are even more important to protect against two- and three-phase faults because there is no breaker that can stop the fault current from the generator. While most modern circuit breakers will interrupt the fault current in less than 50 ms, the fault current from the generator will take several seconds to interrupt because the field current in the rotor takes this amount of time to discharge. The consequences of a two- or three-phase fault between the generator and the first circuit breaker are therefore much more serious and often result in severe damage to the busbars and nearby equipment.

Isolated-phase bus is made in ratings from 3000 amperes to 45,000 amperes, and rated for voltages from 5000 volts up to about 35,000 volts. In the larger current ratings, dry air is forced through the enclosures and within the tubular conductors for [[forced-air]] cooling of the conductors. The cooling air is recirculated through a heat exchanger.  Some items of switchgear, such as [[circuit breaker]]s and isolating switches, are made in housings compatible with the isolated-phase bus. Accessories such as instrument transformers, surge arresters, and capacitors are also made in compatible housings. Due to the expense of its construction and the energy loss, isolated-phase bus is usually used in short segments; a large underground powerhouse may have isolated-phase bus up to about 250 metres or so to connect generators to transformers in an underground cavern.

Forced-air cooling can approximately double the rating over the same size conductors used in a self-cooled system. The extra cost of losses and cooling fan power consumption must be balanced against the lower capital cost of the bus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specfabipb.com/ps-isolated-phase-bus.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of flexible terminals, expansion joints, and weatherproof or fire-proof bushings and terminals are used with isolated-phase bus. Some types of apparatus such as disconnecting switches, circuit breakers, and instrument  transformers are made in enclosures that can be welded to become an integral part of the isolated-phase bus system. Isolated-phase bus is usually custom manufactured for a particular project and requires accurate dimensions of the connected equipment for manufacturing.

A smaller type of isolated-phase bus is manufactured for direct-current circuits; this may be used in the field circuit of a generator.

Currently, the isolated Phase Bus current world record is 52,000 Amps, for bus made by [[Alstom Power]] (since 2015 [[General Electric]] Power) and installed at the [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant]], in 1997. 

Other types of bus are:
* Metal-enclosed segregated phase bus
* Low and high impedance bus duct
* Bare flat or tubular bus bars
* Non-segregated Phase Bus (NSPB)

These are used at lower ratings or where adequate protection of the circuit  by overcurrent devices is possible.

A '''Kater's pendulum''' is a reversible free swinging [[pendulum]] invented by British physicist and army captain [[Henry Kater]] in 1817&lt;ref name="Kater"&gt;{{cite journal

Its advantage is that, unlike previous pendulum gravimeters, the pendulum's [[centre of gravity]] and [[center of oscillation]] do not have to be determined, allowing greater accuracy. For about a century, until the 1930s, Kater's pendulum and its various refinements remained the standard method for measuring the strength of the Earth's gravity during [[Geodetics|geodetic]] surveys. It is now used only for demonstrating pendulum principles.

==Description==
A pendulum can be used to measure the [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration of gravity]] ''g'' because for narrow swings its [[Frequency|period]] of swing ''T'' depends only on ''g'' and its length ''L'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:&lt;math&gt;T = 2 \pi \sqrt { \frac{L}{g} } \qquad \qquad \qquad (1)\,&lt;/math&gt;

So by measuring the length ''L'' and period ''T'' of a pendulum, ''g'' can be calculated.

The Kater's pendulum consists of a rigid metal bar with two pivot points, one near each end of the bar. It can be suspended from either pivot and swung. It also has either an adjustable weight that can be moved up and down the bar, or one adjustable pivot, to adjust the periods of swing. In use, it is swung from one pivot, and the [[Frequency|period]] timed, and then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the period timed. The movable weight (or pivot) is adjusted until the two periods are equal. At this point the period ''T'' is equal to the period of an 'ideal' simple pendulum of length equal to the distance between the pivots. From the period and the measured distance ''L'' between the pivots, the acceleration of gravity can be calculated with great precision from the equation (1) above.

The acceleration due to gravity by Kater's pendulum is given by,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{8\pi^2}{\frac{T_1^2+T_2^2}{l_1+l_2}+\frac{T_1^2-T_2^2}{l_1-l_2}}&lt;/math&gt;'''

where T1 and T2 are the time periods of oscillations when it is suspended from K1 and K2 respectively and l1 and l2 are the distances of knife edges K1 and K2 from the center of gravity respectively.

==History==
===Gravity measurement with pendulums===
[[File:PenduloCaminos.jpg|thumb|A Kater's pendulum and stand]]

The first person to discover that gravity varied over the Earth's surface was French scientist [[Jean Richer]], who in 1671 was sent on an expedition to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]], by the French [[Académie des Sciences]], assigned the task of making measurements with a [[pendulum clock]]. Through the observations he made in the following year, Richer determined that the clock was 2½ minutes per day slower than at Paris, or equivalently the length of a pendulum with a swing of one second there was 1¼ Paris ''lines'', or 2.6&amp;nbsp;mm, shorter than at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Since the surface was farther from the Earth's center at Cayenne than at Paris, gravity was weaker there. Since that time pendulums began to be used as precision [[gravimeter]]s, taken on voyages to different parts of the world to measure the local gravitational acceleration. The accumulation of geographical gravity data resulted in more and more accurate models of the overall shape of the Earth.

Pendulums were so universally used to measure gravity that, in Kater's time, the local strength of gravity was usually expressed not by the value of the acceleration ''g'' now used, but by the length at that location of the ''[[seconds pendulum]]'', a pendulum with a period of two seconds, so each swing takes one second. It can be seen from equation (1) that for a seconds pendulum, the length is simply proportional to ''g'':

:&lt;math&gt;g = \pi^2 L \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Inaccuracy of gravimeter pendulums===
In Kater's time, the period ''T'' of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with precision clocks set by the passage of stars overhead. Prior to Kater's discovery, the accuracy of ''g'' measurements was limited by the difficulty of measuring the other factor ''L'', the length of the pendulum, accurately. ''L'' in equation (1) above was the length of an ideal mathematical 'simple pendulum' consisting of a point mass swinging on the end of a massless cord. However the 'length' of a real pendulum, a swinging rigid body, known in mechanics as a [[compound pendulum]], is more difficult to define. In 1673 Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] in his mathematical analysis of pendulums, ''Horologium Oscillatorium'', showed that a real pendulum had the same period as a simple pendulum with a length equal to the distance between the pivot point and a point called the ''[[center of oscillation]]'', which is located under the pendulum's [[center of gravity]] and depends on the mass distribution along the length of the pendulum. The problem was there was no way to find the location of the center of oscillation in a real pendulum accurately. It could theoretically be calculated from the shape of the pendulum if the metal parts had uniform density, but the metallurgical quality and mathematical abilities of the time didn't allow the calculation to be made accurately.

To get around this problem, most early gravity researchers, such as [[Jean Picard]] (1669), [[Charles Marie de la Condamine]] (1735), and [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1792) approximated a simple pendulum by using a metal sphere suspended by a light wire. If the wire had negligible mass, the center of oscillation was close to the center of gravity of the sphere. But even finding the center of gravity of the sphere accurately was difficult. In addition, this type of pendulum inherently wasn't very accurate. The sphere and wire didn't swing back and forth as a rigid unit, because the sphere acquired a slight [[angular momentum]] during each swing. Also the wire stretched elastically during the pendulum's swing, changing ''L'' slightly during the cycle.

===Kater's solution===
However, in ''Horologium Oscillatorium'', Huygens had also proved that the pivot point and the center of oscillation were interchangeable. That is, if any pendulum is suspended upside down from its center of oscillation, it has the same period of swing, and the new center of oscillation is the old pivot point. The distance between these two conjugate points was equal to the length of a simple pendulum with the same period.

As part of a committee appointed by the [[Royal Society]] in 1816 to reform British measures, Kater had been contracted by the House of Commons to determine accurately the length of the seconds pendulum in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

If a pendulum were hung upside down from a second pivot point that could be adjusted up and down on the pendulum's rod, and the second pivot were adjusted until the pendulum had the same period as it did when swinging right side up from the first pivot, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivot points would be ''L''.
 
Kater wasn't the first to have this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1IqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA315 Lenzen &amp; Multauf 1964], p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12# Poynting &amp; Thompson 1907], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; French mathematician [[Gaspard de Prony]] first proposed a reversible pendulum in 1800, but his work was not published till 1889. In 1811 [[Bohnenberger|Friedrich Bohnenberger]] again discovered it, but Kater independently invented it and was first to put it in practice.

===The pendulum===

Kater built a pendulum consisting of a brass rod about 2 meters long, 1½ inches wide and one-eighth inch thick, with a weight ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(d)&lt;/span&gt;'' on one end.&lt;ref name="Kater" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | doi = 
  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a low friction pivot he used a pair of short triangular 'knife' blades attached to the rod. In use the pendulum was hung from a bracket on the wall, supported by the edges of the knife blades resting on flat agate plates. The pendulum had two of these knife blade pivots ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(a)&lt;/span&gt;'', facing one another, about a meter (40&amp;nbsp;in) apart, so that a swing of the pendulum took approximately one second when hung from each pivot.

Kater found that making one of the pivots adjustable caused inaccuracies, making it hard to keep the axis of both pivots precisely parallel. Instead he permanently attached the knife blades to the rod, and adjusted the periods of the pendulum by a small movable weight ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(b,c)&lt;/span&gt;''  on the pendulum shaft. Since gravity only varies by a maximum of 0.5% over the Earth, and in most locations much less than that, the weight only had to be adjusted slightly. Moving the weight toward one of the pivots decreased the period when hung from that pivot, and increased the period when hung from the other pivot. This also had the advantage that the precision measurement of the separation between the pivots only had to be made once.

===Experimental procedure===
To use, the pendulum was hung from a bracket on a wall, with the knife blade pivots supported on two small horizontal agate plates, in front of a precision pendulum clock to time the period. It was swung first from one pivot, and the oscillations timed, then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the oscillations timed again. The small weight ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(c)&lt;/span&gt;'' was adjusted with the adjusting screw, and the process repeated until the pendulum had the same period when swung from each pivot. By putting the measured period ''T'', and the measured distance between the pivot blades ''L'', into the period equation (1), ''g'' could be calculated very accurately.

Kater performed 12 trials.&lt;ref name="Kater" /&gt; He measured the period of his pendulum very accurately using the clock pendulum by the ''method of coincidences''; timing the interval between the ''coincidences'' when the two pendulums were swinging in synchronism. He measured the distance between the pivot blades with a microscope comparator, to an accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; in. (2.5 μm). As with other pendulum gravity measurements, he had to apply small corrections to the result for a number of variable factors:
*the finite width of the pendulum's swing, which increased the period
*temperature, which caused the length of the rod to vary due to [[thermal expansion]]
*atmospheric pressure, which reduced the effective mass of the pendulum by the buoyancy of the displaced air, increasing the period
*altitude, which reduced the gravitational force with distance from the center of the Earth. Gravity measurements are always referenced to [[sea level]].
He gave his result as the length of the [[seconds pendulum]]. After corrections, he found that the mean length of the solar seconds pendulum at London, at sea level, at {{convert|62|°F|0}}, swinging in vacuum, was 39.1386&amp;nbsp;inches. This is equivalent to a gravitational acceleration of 9.81158&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The largest variation of his results from the mean was {{convert|0.00028|in|um}}. This represented a precision of gravity measurement of 0.7&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; (7 [[milligal]]s).

In 1824, the British Parliament made Kater's measurement of the seconds pendulum the official standard of length for defining the [[yard (unit of length)|yard]].

===Use===
[[File:Repsold.jpg|thumb|Gravimeter with variant of Repsold pendulum]]

The large increase in gravity measurement accuracy made possible by Kater's pendulum established [[gravimetry]] as a regular part of [[geodesy]]. To be useful, it was necessary to find the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the 'station' where a gravity measurement was taken, so pendulum measurements became part of [[surveying]]. Kater's pendulums were taken on the great historic [[Geodetic surveying|geodetic surveys]] of much of the world that were being done during the 19th century. In particular, Kater's pendulums were used in the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India.

Reversible pendulums remained the standard method used for absolute gravity measurements until they were superseded by free-fall [[gravimeter]]s in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Torge"&gt;{{cite book

===Repsold&amp;ndash;Bessel pendulum===
[[File:Repsold pendulum.png|thumb|80px|Repsold pendulum.]]
Repeatedly timing each period of a Kater pendulum, and adjusting the weights until they were equal, was time consuming and error-prone. [[Friedrich Bessel]] showed in 1826 that this was unnecessary. As long as the periods measured from each pivot, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are close in value, the period ''T'' of the equivalent simple pendulum can be calculated from them:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA15# Poynting &amp; Thompson 1907], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T^2 = \frac{T_1^2 + T_2^2}{2} + \frac{T_1^2 - T_2^2}{2} \left ( \frac {h_1 + h_2}{h_1-h_2} \right ) \, \qquad \qquad \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;h_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are the distances of the two pivots from the pendulum's center of gravity.   The distance between the pivots, &lt;math&gt;h_1 + h_2\,&lt;/math&gt;,  can be measured with great accuracy.   &lt;math&gt;h_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and thus their difference &lt;math&gt;h_1 - h_2\,&lt;/math&gt;,  cannot be measured with comparable accuracy.  They are found by balancing the pendulum on a knife edge to find its center of gravity, and measuring the distances of each of the pivots from the center of gravity. However, because &lt;math&gt;T_1^2 - T_2^2\,&lt;/math&gt; is so much smaller than &lt;math&gt;T_1^2 + T_2^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, the second term on the right in the above equation is small compared to the first, so &lt;math&gt;h_1 - h_2\,&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have to be determined with high accuracy, and the balancing procedure described above is sufficient to give accurate results.

Therefore, the pendulum doesn't have to be adjustable at all, it can simply be a rod with two pivots. As long as each pivot is close to the [[center of oscillation]] of the other, so the two periods are close, the period ''T'' of the equivalent simple pendulum can be calculated with equation (2), and the gravity can be calculated from ''T'' and ''L'' with (1).

In addition, Bessel showed that if the pendulum was made with a symmetrical shape, but internally weighted on one end, the error caused by effects of air resistance would cancel out. Also, another error caused by the finite diameter of the pivot knife edges could be made to cancel out by interchanging the knife edges.

Bessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract to the Swiss Geodetic Commission, developed a symmetric pendulum 56&amp;nbsp;cm long with interchangeable pivot blades, with a period of about ¾ second. The Repsold pendulum was used extensively by the Swiss and Russian Geodetic agencies, and in the [[Great Trigonometric Survey|Survey of India]]. Other widely used pendulums of this design were made by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and C. Defforges.

It is equal to 10 [[candareen]]s and is {{frac|10}} of a [[tael]] or approximately 3.78 [[gram]]s.  A [[troy weight|troy]] mace is approximately 3.7429 grams.  In [[Hong Kong]], one mace is 3.779936375 [[gram]]s.&lt;ref name = "hk_law"/&gt; and in Ordinance 22 of 1884, it is {{frac|2|15}} [[ounce]]s [[avoirdupois]].

In imperial [[China]], 10 [[candareen]]s equaled 1 mace which was {{frac|10}} of a [[tael]] and, like the other units, was used in weight-denominated silver currency system.  A common denomination was 7 mace and 2 candareens, equal to one silver [[Chinese yuan]].

==Name==
Like other similar measures such as tael and [[catty]], the English word "mace" derives from [[Malay language|Malay]], in this case through [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''maes'', plural ''masen'', from Malay ''mas'' which, in turn, derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|māṣa}}'', a word related to "mash," another name for the [[urad (bean)|urad bean]], and [[masha (mass)|masha]], a traditional Indian unit of weight equal to 0.97 gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Mace ''n³''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This word is unrelated to [[mace (disambiguation)|other uses of mace]] in English.

The Chinese word for mace is ''qian'' ({{zh | c=錢| hp=qián| l=| links=no}}), which is also a generic word for "money" in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]].  (The same [[Chinese character]] ([[kanji]]) was used for the [[Japan]]ese ''sen'', the former unit equal to {{frac|100}} of a [[Japanese yen]]; the [[Korea]]n ''chŏn''([[Revised Romanization of Korean|revised]]: jeon), the former unit equal to {{frac|100}} of a [[Korean won]]; and for the [[Vietnamese tiền]], a currency used in late [[Nguyễn Dynasty|imperial Vietnam]]; although neither of these has ever been known as "mace" in English.)

It is distributed within the United States by the [[Radiation Safety Information Computational Center]] in Oak Ridge, TN and internationally by the [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] in Paris, France. It is used primarily for the simulation of nuclear processes, such as [[Nuclear fission|fission]], but has the capability to simulate particle interactions involving neutrons, photons, and electrons among other particles. "Specific areas of application include, but are not limited to, radiation protection and dosimetry, [[radiation protection|radiation shielding]], [[radiography]], medical physics, nuclear [[Critical mass|criticality]] safety, detector design and analysis, nuclear oil [[well logging]], [[particle accelerator|accelerator]] target design, [[fission reactor|fission]] and [[fusion reactor]] design, decontamination and decommissioning."

==Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended==
Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) was also developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and is capable of simulating particle interactions of 34 different types of particles (nucleons and ions) and 2000+ heavy ions at nearly all energies,&lt;ref name="MCNPX 2.7.x"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://laws.lanl.gov/vhosts/mcnp.lanl.gov/pdf_files/la-ur-09-6788.pdf |title=MCNPX 2.7.x - New Features Being Developed |last=James |first=M.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including those simulated by MCNP.

Both codes can be used to judge whether or not nuclear systems are [[critical mass|critical]] and to determine doses from [[Ionizing radiation#Sources|source]]s, among other things.

''MCNP6'' is a merger of MCNP5 and MCNPX.&lt;ref name="MCNPX 2.7.x"/&gt;

'''''Our Angry Earth: A Ticking Ecological Bomb''''' (1991) is a non-fiction book and polemic against the effects humankind is having on the environment by the science fiction writers [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Frederik Pohl]]. 
In his last non-fiction book, Asimov co-writes with his long-time friend science fiction author Frederik Pohl, and deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]] and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].

It suggests monumental disasters are threatening to destroy humankind and argues that "it is too late to save our planet from harm". The book has four sections: "The Background", "The Problems", "The Technocures" and "The Way to Go".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">[[File:phototubes.jpg|thumb|Two different types of phototubes]]
A '''phototube''' or photoelectric cell is a type of [[gas filled tube|gas-filled]] or [[vacuum tube]] that is sensitive to light.  Such a tube is more correctly called a 'photoemissive cell' to distinguish it from [[photovoltaic]] or [[photoconductive]] cells.  Phototubes were previously more widely used but are now replaced in many applications by solid state photodetectors.    The [[photomultiplier tube]] is one of the most sensitive light detectors, and is still widely used in physics research.

==Operating principles==
Phototubes operate according to the [[photoelectric effect]]: Incoming [[photon]]s strike a [[photocathode]], knocking [[electron]]s out of its surface, which are attracted to an [[anode]]. Thus current is dependent on the frequency and intensity of incoming photons. Unlike [[photomultiplier]] tubes, no amplification takes place, so the current through the device is typically of the order of a few [[microampere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.du.edu/~etuttle/electron/elect30.htm |title=Electronics 30 - Phototubes |author=J.B. Calvert |publisher=[[University of Denver]] |date=2002-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The light wavelength range over which the device is sensitive depends on the material used for the photoemissive cathode. A [[caesium]]-[[antimony]] cathode gives a device that is very sensitive in the violet to ultra-violet region with sensitivity falling off to blindness to red light.  Caesium on oxidised [[silver]] gives a cathode that is most sensitive to infra-red to red light, falling off towards blue, where the sensitivity is low but not zero.&lt;ref&gt;''Mullard Technical Handbook'' Volume 4 Section 4:Photoemissive Cells (1960 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuum devices have a near constant anode current for a given level of illumination relative to anode voltage.  Gas filled devices are more sensitive but the frequency response to modulated illumination falls off at lower frequencies compared to the vacuum devices.  The frequency response of vacuum devices is generally limited by the transit time of the electrons from cathode to anode. &lt;!-- From previous citation ---&gt;

==Applications==
One major application of the phototube was the reading of optical [[Sound film|sound tracks]] for projected films. Phototubes were used in a variety of light-sensing applications until they were superseded by [[photoresistor]]s and [[photodiode]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16952">The '''quantum Hall effect''' (or '''integer quantum Hall effect''') is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] version of the [[Hall effect]], observed in [[2DEG|two-dimensional electron systems]] subjected to low [[temperature]]s and strong [[magnetic field]]s, in which the Hall [[Electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]] {{math|''σ''}} undergoes [[quantum Hall transitions]] to take on the quantized values

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma = \frac{I_\text{channel}}{V_\text{Hall}} = \nu \frac{e^2}{h}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;channel&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the channel [[electric current|current]], {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;Hall&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Hall effect|Hall voltage]], {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]] and {{math|''h''}} is [[Planck's constant]]. The prefactor {{math|[[Nu (letter)|''ν'']]}} is known as the filling factor, and can take on either integer ({{math|''ν'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3,…}}) or fractional ({{math|''ν'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|2|5}}, {{sfrac|3|7}}, {{sfrac|2|3}}, {{sfrac|3|5}}, {{sfrac|1|5}}, {{sfrac|2|9}}, {{sfrac|3|13}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|12|5}},…}}) values. The quantum Hall effect is referred to as the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect depending on whether {{math|''ν''}} is an integer or fraction, respectively.

The striking feature of the integer quantum Hall effect is the persistence of the quantization (i.e. the Hall plateau) as the electron density is varied. Since the electron density remains constant when the Fermi level is in a clean spectral gap, this situation corresponds to one where the Fermi level is an energy with a finite density of states, though these states are localized (see [[Anderson localization]]).

The [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] is more complicated, as its existence relies fundamentally on electron–electron interactions. The fractional quantum Hall effect is also understood as an integer quantum Hall effect, although not of electrons but of charge-flux composites known as [[composite fermions]]. In 1988, it was proposed that there was quantum Hall effect without [[Landau quantization|Landau levels]].&lt;ref name=Haldane:1988 /&gt; This quantum Hall effect is referred to as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. There is also a new concept of the [[quantum spin Hall effect]] which is an analogue of the quantum Hall effect, where spin currents flow instead of charge currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Zyun F. | last=Ezawa | title=Quantum Hall Effects: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Developments | edition=3rd | publisher=World Scientific | year=2013 | isbn=978-981-4360-75-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The quantization of the Hall conductance has the important property of being exceedingly precise. Actual measurements of the Hall conductance have been found to be integer or fractional multiples of {{math|{{sfrac|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''h''}}}} to nearly one part in a billion. This phenomenon, referred to as ''exact quantization'', has been shown to be a subtle manifestation of the principle of [[gauge invariance]].&lt;ref name=Laughlin:1981 /&gt; It has allowed for the definition of a new practical [[physical unit|standard]] for [[electrical resistance]], based on the resistance quantum given by the von Klitzing constant {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} {{val|25812.807557|(18)|ul=Ω}}}}.&lt;ref name=Tzalenchuk:2010 /&gt; This is named after [[Klaus von Klitzing]], the discoverer of exact quantization. {{anchor|RK-1990}}Since 1990, a fixed [[conventional electrical unit|conventional value]] {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;K-90&lt;/sub&gt;}} has been used in resistance calibrations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rk90|title= conventional value of von Klitzing constant|website= NIST}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 2018, the conventional value was abrogated in consequence of the decision to fix the values of h (the Planck constant) and e (the elementary charge) at the 26th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CGPM-2018/26th-CGPM-Resolutions.pdf|title= 26th CGPM Resolutions|website= BIPM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum Hall effect also provides an extremely precise independent determination of the [[fine structure constant]], a quantity of fundamental importance in [[quantum electrodynamics]].

==History==
The integer quantization of the Hall conductance was originally predicted by Ando, Matsumoto, and Uemura in 1975, on the basis of an approximate calculation which they themselves did not believe to be true.&lt;ref name=Ando:1975 /&gt; Several researchers subsequently observed the effect in experiments carried out on the inversion layer of [[MOSFET]]s.&lt;ref name=Wakabayashi:1978 /&gt; It was only in 1980 that [[Klaus von Klitzing]], working at the high magnetic field laboratory in Grenoble with silicon-based samples developed by [[Michael Pepper]] and Gerhard Dorda, made the unexpected discovery that the Hall conductivity was ''exactly'' quantized.&lt;ref name=vonKlitzing:1980 /&gt; For this finding, von Klitzing was awarded the 1985 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. The link between exact quantization and gauge invariance was subsequently found by [[Robert B. Laughlin|Robert Laughlin]], who connected the quantized conductivity to the quantized charge transport in Thouless charge pump.&lt;ref name=Laughlin:1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thouless:1983 /&gt; Most integer quantum Hall experiments are now performed on [[gallium arsenide]] [[heterostructure]]s, although many other semiconductor materials can be used. In 2007, the integer quantum Hall effect was reported in [[graphene]] at temperatures as high as room temperature,&lt;ref name=Novoselov:2007 /&gt; and in the [[magnesium]] [[zinc]] [[oxide]] ZnO–Mg&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;1−{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=Tsukazaki:2007 /&gt;

==Integer quantum Hall effect – Landau levels==
[[File:QuantumHallEffectExplanationWithLandauLevels.ogv|360px|alt=Animated graph showing filling of Landau levels as &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;B&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; changes and the corresponding position on a graph of hall coefficient and magnetic field|Illustrative only. The Landau Levels spread out with increasing field. Between the levels the quantum hall effect is seen.]]
In two dimensions, when classical electrons are subjected to a magnetic field they follow circular cyclotron orbits. When the system is treated quantum mechanically, these orbits are quantized. The energy levels of these quantized orbitals take on discrete values:
:&lt;math&gt;E_n = \hbar \omega_\text{c} \left(n+\tfrac12\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''eB''|''m''}}}} is the cyclotron frequency. These orbitals are known as [[Landau quantization|Landau levels]], and at weak magnetic fields, their existence gives rise to many "quantum oscillations" such as the [[Shubnikov–de Haas effect|Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations]] and the [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]] (which is often used to map the Fermi surface of metals). For strong magnetic fields, each Landau level is highly degenerate (i.e. there are many single particle states which have the same energy {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}). Specifically, for a sample of area {{math|''A''}}, in magnetic field {{math|''B''}}, the degeneracy of each Landau level is
:&lt;math&gt;N = g_\text{s} \frac{BA}{\phi_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents a factor of 2 for spin degeneracy, and {{math|''&amp;#x3D5;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ {{val|2|e=-15|ul=Wb}}}} is the [[magnetic flux quantum]]. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, each Landau level may have so many states that all of the free electrons in the system sit in only a few Landau levels; it is in this regime where one observes the quantum Hall effect.

==Mathematics==
[[Image:Hofstadter's butterfly.png|thumb|[[Hofstadter's butterfly]]]]
The integers that appear in the Hall effect are examples of [[topological quantum number]]s. They are known in mathematics as the first [[Chern class#Chern numbers|Chern numbers]] and are closely related to [[Geometric phase|Berry's phase]]. A striking model of much interest in this context is the Azbel–Harper–Hofstadter model whose quantum phase diagram is the [[Hofstadter butterfly]] shown in the figure. The vertical axis is the strength of the [[magnetic field]] and the horizontal axis is the [[chemical potential]], which fixes the electron density. The colors represent the integer Hall conductances. Warm colors represent positive integers and cold colors negative integers. Note, however, that the density of states in these regions of quantized Hall conductance is zero, hence they cannot produce the plateaus observed in the experiments. The phase diagram is fractal and has structure on all scales. In the figure there is an obvious [[self-similarity]]. In the presence of disorder, which is the source of the plateaus seen in the experiments, this diagram is very different and the fractal structure is mostly washed away.

Concerning physical mechanisms, impurities and/or particular states (e.g., edge currents) are important for both the 'integer' and 'fractional' effects. In addition, Coulomb interaction is also essential in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The observed strong similarity between integer and fractional quantum Hall effects is explained by the tendency of electrons to form bound states with an even number of magnetic flux quanta, called ''[[composite fermions]]''.

==The Bohr atom interpretation of the von Klitzing constant==

The value of the von Klitzing constant may be obtained already on the level of a single atom within the [[Bohr model]] while looking at it as a single electron Hall effect. While during the [[cyclotron|cyclotron motion]] on a circular orbit the centrifugal force is balanced by the [[Lorentz force]] responsible for the transverse induced voltage and the Hall effect one may look at the Coulomb potential difference in the Bohr atom as the induced single atom Hall voltage and the periodic electron motion on a circle a Hall current. Defining the single atom Hall current as a rate a single electron charge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is making the Kepler revolutions with the angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\omega e}{2\pi},&lt;/math&gt;

and the induced Hall voltage as a difference between the nucleus hydrogen Coulomb potential at the electron orbital point and at the infinity:

:&lt;math&gt;U=V_\text{C}(\infty) - V_\text{C}(r) = 0 - V_\text{C}(r) = \frac{e}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}&lt;/math&gt;

One obtains the quantization of the defined Bohr orbit Hall resistance in steps of the von Klitzing constant as 

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{Bohr}(n) = \frac{U}{I} = n\frac{h}{e^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which for the Bohr atom is linear but not inverse in the integer ''n''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">In [[mathematical analysis]], the word '''''region''''' usually refers to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\C^n&lt;/math&gt; that is [[open set|open]] (in the standard [[Euclidean topology]]), [[connected set|connected]] and [[empty set|non-empty]]. A '''closed region''' is sometimes defined to be the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a region.

Regions and closed regions are often used as domains of functions or differential equations.

According to Kreyszig,&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Kreyszig]] (1993) ''Advanced Engineering Mathematics'', 7th edition, p. 720, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], {{ISBN|0-471-55380-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:A region is a set consisting of a [[domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] plus, perhaps, some or all of its boundary points. (The reader is warned that some authors use the term "region" for what we call a domain [following standard terminology], and others make no distinction between the two terms.)
According to Yue Kuen Kwok,
:An open connected set is called an ''open region'' or ''domain''. ...to an open region we may add none, some, or all its [[limit point]]s, and simply call the new set a ''region''.&lt;ref&gt;Yue Kuen Kwok (2002) ''Applied Complex Variables for Scientists and Engineers'', § 1.4 Some topological definitions, p 23, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-00462-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Porter Allen''' (24 April 1905 in [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania|South Williamsport]], [[Pennsylvania]]) – 28 June 1963&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=61662318&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[ornithologist]] and [[environmentalist]]. He achieved worldwide attention for his rescue operations of the [[whooping crane]] (''Grus Americana'') in the 1940s and 1950s.
Allen helped save the Roseate Spoonbill from extinction{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. He set up a tent on Bottle Key in the Florida Bay in 1938 so that he could observe the nesting Spoonbills up close. He was the first ecologist to do this work with Roseate Spoonbills.

==Conservation Efforts==

Allen was a pioneer in early field biology and led large conservation efforts around the world to save the whooping crane (Grus americana), [[roseate spoonbill]] (Platalea ajaja), and the [[flamingo]] (Phoenicopterus ruber). Allen joined the Junior Audubon Club at a young age, and this is where his passion for birds began. He attended Lafayette College to study ornithology for a short period of time, but quickly lost interest. He secured a librarian job at Audubon, and soon became one of the youngest Audubon sanctuary directors ever appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stouffer|first=Philip C|date=2013-02-21|title=The Man Who Saved the Whooping Crane: The Robert Porter Allen Story by Kathleen Kaska|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofo.12010_2|journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|volume=84|issue=1|pages=115–116|doi=10.1111/jofo.12010_2|issn=0273-8570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen had a very specific approach to restoring endangered populations, and felt that widespread cooperation was necessary for success. Allen would first conduct extensive field research and documentation on the bird before any interaction. He would then publish and sell his research and include lots of illustrations and pictures for easy understanding. Allen would also capture endangered wild birds and exhibit them locally in order to raise awareness and raise money for habitat restoration. Allen fought for legislation to protect endangered species. He Helped bring awareness to all three birds, helped protect and zone off their breeding grounds, and helped generate funds from wealth families and the federal government for habitat restoration. Allen and others even flew ultra light planes to guide migratory birds to their nesting grounds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/777602106|title=The man who saved the whooping crane : the Robert Porter Allen story|last=Kathleen.|first=Kaska,|date=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=9780813040240|location=Gainesville|oclc=777602106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen began working with the whooping crane in 1946; he wanted to learn what was causing the population to decline. He noticed that the whooping cranes were not returning after [[plume hunting]] in large numbers like other birds. He began studying the whooping crane at the Aransas Refuge in Texas. He photographed and drew detailed pictures of the wild whooping crane. He studied and documented the nesting habits of the whooping crane. He also studied and photographed the various marine life and vegetation that the birds eat. He discovered that the Grus americana migrates to Aransas Refuge during the winter, because of viable food sources and mild climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walkinshaw|first=Lawrence H.|date=1953|title=Review of The Whooping Crane|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4081346|journal=The Auk|volume=70|issue=3|pages=382–385|doi=10.2307/4081346}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Allen's fieldwork was carried out with the intention of learning the ideal conditions for whooping crane reproduction. He hoped to replicate these conditions for whooping cranes in captivity, and use the knowledge to help the remaining whooping cranes to survive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Grus americana was a bird almost driven to extinction by early Americans and their hunting habits. Allen discovered that unlike the flamingos the Grus americana can reproduce in small numbers and live a long time. This made conservation efforts much easier, once a large group was established in protected areas. 

Later Allen began three years of fieldwork in the Caribbean, and his studies focused on the entire range of the American Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber). He was working for the Society for the Protection of the Flamingo. The organization studied flamingos and brought flamingos to the New Providence Island in order to spark public interest in flamingos, and to generate donations to the foundation. Allen discovered that Flamingos work and function better in large communities, the larger the group the better. This evidence proves that the flamingos are low on the evolutionary scale, and their breeding practices a complicated and can confuse the birds. When Allen first began following the pack of flamingos the average flock size was 24 birds. Allen discovered that flamingos unlike other birds need over three hundred individuals to successfully carry out the mating ritual. It is reasonable to believe that the original number of flamingos was around 95,000 in 1600 A.D. In 1955 Allen estimated the population total to be 21,500, 80 percent less than their original number.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1343604|title=The flamingos: their life history and survival, with special reference to the American or West Indian flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber).|last=Porter.|first=Allen, Robert|date=1956|publisher=National Audubon Society|oclc=1343604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen discovered that even the smallest of things could disrupt the flamingos' reproductive cycle. Gunshots, planes flying overhead, hurricanes, flooding, damming and diking bodies of water all caused the population to decline.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the island of San Lucar many people stole the eggs from flamingos for food; this could stunt the growth of a colony of flamingos for up to three decades. Allen's studies show that the same number of flamingos produced each year is equal to the number that dies off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenmann|first=E.|date=1958|title=Review of The Flamingos: Their Life History and Survival. With Special Reference to the American or West Indian Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber)|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4081908|journal=The Auk|volume=75|issue=2|pages=228–229|doi=10.2307/4081908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Allen took interest in the roseate spoonbill because he felt that the U.S. government was ignoring the low population numbers. Allen wanted to secure federal funding for the roseate spoonbill, and wanted Florida Bay to be included in the [[Everglades National Park]]. Roseate spoonbills were not seen from 1865-1890 due to over hunting; they were very close to extinct. When Allen began studying the roseate spoonbill there were only 8 nesting locations in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nice|first=Margaret M.|date=1943|title=Review of The Roseate Spoonbill|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4509777|journal=Bird-Banding|volume=14|issue=1/2|pages=54–55|doi=10.2307/4509777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen believed that public education on endangered species of birds was fundamental in fully restoring the population.

Allen found that plumage hunting depleted the populations of roseate spoonbills, flamingos, and whooping cranes. Allen deducted that over hunting not only reduced the overall population of these birds, but it made them vulnerable to a whole new host of things. Once the populations were decreased the birds could no longer defend themselves from certain predators, or reproduce properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1576297|title=The flame birds|last=Porter.|first=Allen, Robert|date=|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Co|year=1947|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|oclc=1576297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen had great success growing the population of whooping cranes. The population was at 15 when Allen began his work in 1941, and the population is around 500 in 2010. Allen gained national popularity and news coverage when he spent eight years looking for the last remain nesting site for whooping cranes. Allen concluded that overdevelopment; habitat loss and unregulated hunting were the main causes for low numbers of whooping cranes, roseate spoonbills, and flamingos. Allen changed the ways Americans thought about wildlife through education programs. in 1973 his efforts ultimately lead to the passage of the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''SS ''Charles H. Cugle''''' was a Type Z-EC2-S-C5 [[Liberty ship]] built by [[J.A. Jones Construction]] of [[Panama City, Florida]], launched on 13 August 1945. It was ordered by the [[War Shipping Administration]] under [[United States Maritime Commission|Maritime Commission]] Contract number 3145.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/jonespanamacity.htm |title=Jones Construction, Panama City FL |work=shipbuildinghistory.com |year=2011 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Army Nuclear Power Program]] the ship was transferred to the U.S. Army in March 1963, and fitted with a [[pressurized water reactor]], fuelled by used [[Enriched uranium|low enriched]] [[uranium]], designed by [[Martin Marietta]], becoming the world's first [[floating nuclear power plant]], at a cost of $17 million.&lt;ref name="WNsym"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Hans B. |last1=Honerlah |first2=Brian P. |last2=Hearty |url=http://www.wmsym.org/archives/2002/Proceedings/44/168.pdf |title=Characterization of the Nuclear Barge ''Sturgis'' |work=wmsym.org |date=February 2002 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now renamed [[MH-1A|''Sturgis'' (MH-1A)]] the reactor began operation on 24 January 1967 at [[Fort Belvoir]], Virginia, generating 10 [[MWe]] of [[electrical power]]. The reactor barge was then towed to [[Gatun Lake]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to provide power, owing to a lack of water for the [[hydroelectric]] plant. The ship returned to Fort Belvoir in early 1977, and the reactor deactivated and de-fueled. The ship was decontaminated, sealed, and assigned to the [[James River Reserve Fleet]]&lt;ref name="WNsym"/&gt; for an expected 50 years of [[SAFSTOR]].

However, 38 years later the Army Corps of Engineers deemed there were low enough levels of radioactivity in the mothballed vessel's contaminated areas for it to be scrapped.  It was scheduled to be towed from Virginia to Galveston in April–May 2015 where subcontractor Malin International Ship Repair and Drydock will begin the 12- to 18-month work of removing the contaminated material and placing it in rail cars to be hauled to a hazardous materials disposal site, after which the remaining portions of the vessel will be cut up and sold for scrap value.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chron.com/about/article/Nuclear-reactor-ship-to-start-journey-from-Va-to-6204058.php, 16 April 2015.

==The importance of Shuakhevi HPP for Georgia==
[[Electricity]] [[demand]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been on the rise since 2009 and [[investment]] in new [[Electricity generation|generation]] capacity is lagging behind.&lt;ref name="objective"&gt;Galdava, Irakli, Eric Livny and Norberto Pignatti.

As of April 2016, more than 700 Georgians are working in the project, most of the

people from the local communities.&lt;ref name="ebrd" /&gt; To this date, almost 500 locals have been trained in a school especially designed to build required technical skills.&lt;ref name="norway" /&gt; The project company has also funded an extensive [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] programme in the valley with significant infrastructure upgrades for the local communities, support for local businesses etc.&lt;ref name="bankwatch" /&gt; The project has also enabled the construction of a new 220 kV transmission line from [[Akhaltsikhe Municipality|Akhalsikhe]] to [[Batumi]], significantly strengthening the grid connection in the whole of South Western Georgia.&lt;ref name="pdd" /&gt;

==Controversial issues==

===Project justification===
The [[contract]] for the Shuakhevi HPP project is the only contract for a [[hydropower]] project in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] where articles related to obligations of the state and the company on [[electricity]] [[tariff]]s and [[economic profitability]] are kept [[Confidentiality|confidential]]. It is hard to say how the project will benefit [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], since it is not clear how the money will end up in the [[state budget]].&lt;ref name="bankwatch"/&gt;

The project has responsibility to deliver electricity for three winter months in Georgia for a fixed tariff, contributing to reducing the need to import electricity and reducing the carbon emissions from electricity production in Georgia.&lt;ref name="alstom" /&gt;

The project will pay 1% of invested amount in [[property tax]]es to the local [[municipality]] where the infrastructure is located, which is estimated to significantly increase the budgets in the municipalities hosting the infrastructure.&lt;ref name="objective" /&gt;

===Environmental impact===
The project is designed to divert water flows from the upper parts of the Adjaristskali, Skhalta and Chirukhistskali rivers towards the [[reservoir]]s and then the powerhouse and leave only 10 percent of the average annual [[River flow|flow of the rivers]]. That will have a negative impact on the [[river ecosystem]], including red-listed species like [[trout]].&lt;ref name="bankwatch"/&gt;

===Social impact===
Since there are no villages within the project site, the project does not envisage [[Population transfer|resettlement]] of local [[population]]. However, the project site is characterised by [[landslide]]s. The tunnel, which has been drilled under the village Ghurta, which is one of three planned diversion tunnels as part of the project, did not trigger a landslide as feared by the local population. Detailed geological investigations were undertaken by [[Mott MacDonald]], one of the leading underground geological engineers in the world before the construction started to ensure that it was safe to construct a dam in the Didachara area.&lt;ref name="norway" /&gt; The memory of the 1971 [[landslide]] which cost 22 people’s lives is still very much alive among local population. Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC is denying the risks, however they are reluctant to sign [[warranty]] contracts to offer [[Financial compensation|compensation]] in case the constructions cause damages.&lt;ref name="landslide"&gt;Chipashvili, David.

Retrieved on 2014-25-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

===Protest on 8 March 2014===
On 8 March there was a [[protest]] against the Shuakhevi HPP. About 500 villagers blocked the road to prevent the construction of a tunnel for the 187 MW Shuakhevi HPP in Didachara were dispersed by [[policemen]] and [[special forces]]. The main concern of the people is that the construction would trigger [[landslide]]s.&lt;ref name="landslide"/&gt;

A '''solar chimney'''{{snd}} often referred to as a '''thermal chimney'''{{snd}} is a way of improving the natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] of [[building]]s by using [[convection]] of [[air]] heated by [[passive solar]] [[energy]]. A simple description of a solar chimney is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural [[Natural ventilation#Stack driven ventilation|stack ventilation]] through a building.

The [[Solar power|solar]] [[chimney]] has been in use for centuries, particularly in the [[Middle east]] and [[Near East]] by the [[Persian people|Persians]], as well as in [[Europe]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Description==
In its simplest form, the solar chimney consists of a black-painted [[chimney]]. During the day solar energy heats the chimney and the air within it, creating an [[updraft]] of air in the chimney. The [[suction]] created at the chimney's base can be used to ventilate and cool the building below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Solar powered Air Conditioning | url = http://www.sxlist.com/techref/other/spac.htm#Vent | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most parts of the world it is easier to harness [[wind power]] for such ventilation as with a [[windcatcher]], but on hot windless days a Solar chimney can provide ventilation where otherwise there would be none.

There are however a number of solar chimney variations. The basic design elements of a solar chimney are:

* The solar collector area: This can be located in the top part of the chimney or can include the entire shaft. The orientation, type of glazing, insulation and thermal properties of this element are crucial for harnessing, retaining and utilizing solar gains.
* The main ventilation shaft: The location, height, cross section and the thermal properties of this structure are also very important.
* The inlet and outlet air apertures: The sizes, location as well as aerodynamic aspects of these elements are also significant.

A [[principle]] has been proposed for [[solar power]] generation, using a large [[greenhouse]] at the base rather than relying solely on heating the chimney itself. (For further information on this issue, see [[Solar updraft tower]].)

Solar chimneys are painted black so that they absorb the sun's heat more effectively. When the air inside the chimney is heated, it rises and pulls cold air out from under the ground via the heat exchange tubes.

== Solar chimney and [[sustainable architecture]] ==
[[File:solarchimney.svg|right|thumb|268px|This solar chimney draws air through a geothermal heat exchange to provide passive home cooling.&lt;ref&gt;"A Theory of Power" {{ISBN|0-595-33030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vail | first = Jeff | title =  Passive Solar &amp; Independence | date = 2005-06-28 | url = http://www.jeffvail.net/2005/06/passive-solar-independence.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Solar chimneys, also called heat chimneys or heat stacks, can also be used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been for decades the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with bioclimatic principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful design solutions. The solar chimney is one of these concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.

A solar chimney can serve many purposes.  Direct gain warms air inside the chimney causing it to rise out the top and drawing air in from the bottom. This drawing of air can be used to ventilate a home or office, to draw air through a geothermal heat exchange, or to ventilate only a specific area such as a composting toilet.

Natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by [[convection]] and escape to the outside. At the same time cooler air can be drawn in through vents at the lower level.  Trees may be planted on that side of the building to provide shade for cooler outside air.

This natural ventilation process can be augmented by a solar chimney. The chimney has to be higher than the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the sun. Absorption of heat from the sun can be increased by using a [[glazing in construction|glazed]] surface on the side facing the sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface is more important than the diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for heating by solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of the vents in the chimney should face away from the direction of the [[prevailing wind]].

To further maximize the cooling effect, the incoming air may be led through [[Earth cooling tubes|underground ducts]] before it is allowed to enter the building. The solar chimney can be improved by integrating it with a [[trombe wall]]. The added advantage of this design is that the system may be reversed during the cold season, providing solar heating instead.

A variation of the solar chimney concept is the solar [[attic]]. In a hot sunny climate the attic space is often blazingly hot in the summer. In a conventional building this presents a problem as it leads to the need for increased [[air conditioning]]. By integrating the attic space with a solar chimney, the hot air in the attic can be put to work. It can help the convection in the chimney, improving ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murti Nugroho | first = Agung | author2=Mohd Hamdan bin Ahmad |author3=Makmal Sain Bangunan  | title = Possibility to Use Solar Induced Ventilation Strategies in Tropical Conditions by Computational Fluid Dynamic Simulation | url = http://eprints.utm.my/2315/1/17-Appendix_B.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a solar chimney may benefit natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies of buildings thus help reduce energy use, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and pollution in general. Potential benefits regarding natural ventilation and use of solar chimneys are:

[[Image:Solar chimney TAS model.jpg|thumb|300px|CAD (TAS) Solar Chimney model]]
* improved ventilation rates on still, hot days
* reduced reliance on wind and wind driven ventilation
* improved control of air flow through a building
* greater choice of air intake (i.e. leeward side of building)
* improved air quality and reduced noise levels in urban areas
* increased night time ventilation rates
* ventilation of narrow, small spaces with minimal exposure to external elements

Potential benefits regarding passive cooling may include:

* improved passive cooling during warm season (mostly on still, hot days)
* improved night cooling rates
* enhanced performance of thermal mass (cooling, cool storage)
* improved thermal comfort (improved air flow control, reduced draughts)

==Precedent Study: The Environmental Building==
The [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) office building in Garston, Watford, United Kingdom, incorporates solar-assisted passive ventilation stacks as part of its ventilation strategy.

Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim to reduce energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions without the use of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and hollow concrete slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.

The building utilizes five vertical shafts as an integral part of the ventilation and cooling strategy. The main components of these stacks are a south facing glass-block wall, thermal mass walls and stainless steel round exhausts rising a few meters above roof level. The chimneys are connected to the curved hollow concrete floor slabs which are cooled via night ventilation. Pipes embedded in the floor can provide additional cooling utilizing groundwater.

On warm windy days air is drawn in through passages in the curved hollow concrete floor slabs. Stack ventilation naturally rising out through the stainless steel chimneys enhances the air flow through the building. The movement of air across the chimney tops enhances the stack effect.
During warm, still days, the building relies mostly on the stack effect while air is taken from the shady north side of the building. Low-energy fans in the tops of the stacks can also be used to improve airflow.

Overnight, control systems enable ventilation paths through the hollow concrete slab removing the heat stored during the day, which then remains cold for the following day. The exposed curved ceiling gives more surface area than a flat ceiling would, acting as a [[heat sink]], again providing summer cooling.
Research based on actual performance measurements of the passive stacks found that they enhanced the cooling ventilation of the space during warm and still days and may also have the potential to assist night-time cooling due to their thermally massive structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ní Riain | first = C. | author2=M.

==Passive down-draft cool tower==
[[Image:Zion Visitors Center Cool Tower.PNG|thumb|right|245px|Cool tower at Zion National Park's Visitor Center provides cool air]]
A technology closely related to the solar chimney is the evaporative down-draft cooltower. In areas with a hot, arid climate this approach may contribute to a sustainable way to provide [[air conditioning]] for buildings.

The principle is to allow water to evaporate at the top of a tower, either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water. [[Evaporation]] cools the incoming air, causing a [[downdraft]] of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Torcellini | first = Paul A. | author2=Ron Judkoff |author3=Sheila J.

The Visitor Center was designed by the High Performance Buildings Research of the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL).

The principle of the downdraft cooltower has been proposed for solar power generation as well. (See [[Energy tower (downdraft)|Energy tower]] for more information.)

Evaporation of moisture from the pads on top of the Toguna buildings built by the Dogon people of Mali, Africa contribute to the coolness felt by the men who rest underneath. The women's buildings on the outskirts of town are functional as more conventional solar chimneys.

The '''tamarillo''' is a small tree or [[shrub]] in the [[flowering plant]] family [[Solanaceae]] (the nightshade family). It is best known as the species that bears the '''tamarillo''', an egg-shaped edible [[fruit]].&lt;ref name=tamarillocom&gt;[http://www.tamarillo.com/history/ www.tamarillo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the '''tree tomato''',&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''tomate andino''', '''tomate serrano''', '''tomate de yuca''', '''sachatomate''', '''berenjena''', '''tamamoro''', and '''tomate de árbol''' in South America. They are popular globally, especially in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and [[United States|America]].

== Description ==

=== Plant origin and regions of cultivation ===
The tamarillo is native to the [[Andes]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]],  and [[Bolivia]].
Today it is still cultivated in [[gardens]] and small [[orchards]] for local production,&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prohens|first1=Jaime |last2=Nuez |first2=Fernando  |title=The Tamarillo (''Cyphomandra betacea''): A Review of a Promising Small Fruit Crop|journal=Small Fruits Review|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|pages=43–68|doi=10.1300/J301v01n02_06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the most popular fruits in these regions.&lt;ref name=economicBotany&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=E. P. |last2=Winters|first2=H. F.  |title=The "Palo de Tomate" or Tree Tomato|journal=Economic Botany|year=1949|volume=3|issue=3|pages=140–142|doi=10.1007/BF02859515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other regions of cultivation are the subtropical areas throughout the world, such as [[Rwanda]], [[South Africa]], [[Darjeeling]] and [[Sikkim]] in [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Hong Kong]], [[China]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Bhutan]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt;

The first internationally marketed crop of tamarillos in Australia was produced around 1996, although permaculture and exotic fruit enthusiasts had increasingly grown the fruit around the country from the mid-1970s on.

In New Zealand, about 2,000 tons are produced on 200 hectares of land and exported to the United States, [[Japan]]&lt;ref name=LostCrops&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Lost Crops of the Incas|year=1989|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-07461-2|pages=307–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Europe]]. For the export, the existing marketing channels developed for the [[kiwifruit]] are used.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt;

The tamarillo is also successfully grown at higher elevations of [[Malaysia]] and the [[Philippines]], and in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=economicBotany /&gt; In the hot tropical lowlands, it develops only small fruits and fruit setting is seldom.

Prior to 1967, the fruit was known as the "tree tomato" but the new name tamarillo (which was not the name in Spanish or any other language) was chosen by the New Zealand Tree Tomato Promotions Council in order to distinguish it from the ordinary [[tomato|garden tomato]] and increase its exotic appeal.&lt;ref name=tamarillocom/&gt;

=== Plant ===
[[File:Cyphomandra betacea1.jpg|thumb|right|Flower cluster]]
The plant is a fast-growing [[tree]] that grows up to 5 meters. Peak production is reached after 4 years,&lt;ref name=LostCrops /&gt; and the life expectancy is about 12 years.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt; The tree usually forms a single upright [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] with lateral branches. The flowers and fruits hang from the lateral branches. The leaves are large, [[Leaf shape|simple]] and [[perennial]], and have a strong pungent smell.&lt;ref name=LostCrops /&gt; The flowers are pink-white, and form clusters of 10 to 50 flowers. They produce 1 to 6 fruits per cluster. Plants can set fruit without cross-pollination, but the flowers are fragrant and attract insects. [[Pollination|Cross-pollination]] seems to improve fruit set.&lt;ref name=LostCrops /&gt;  The roots are shallow and not very pronounced, therefore the plant is not tolerant of drought stress and can be damaged by strong winds. Tamarillos will hybridize with many other solanaceae, though the hybrid fruits will be sterile, and unpalatable in some instances.{{citation needed|reason=Hybrid fruits are normally indistinguishable from non-hybrid|date=June 2016}}

=== Fruit ===
[[File:Solanum betaceum unripe fruits.jpg|thumb|Unripe fruits]]
[[File:Tamarillos(janek2005).jpg|thumb|Ripe fruits]]
The fruits are egg-shaped and about 4-10 centimeters long. Their color varies from yellow and orange to red and almost purple. Sometimes they have dark, longitudinal stripes. Red fruits are more [[wikt:acetous|acetous]], yellow and orange fruits are sweeter. The flesh has a firm texture and contains more and larger seeds than a common [[tomato]].&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt; The fruits are very high in [[vitamins]] and [[Human iron metabolism|iron]] and low in [[Food energy|calories]] (only about 40 calories per fruit).&lt;ref name=LostCrops /&gt;

== Cultivation ==

=== Soil and climate requirements ===
The tamarillo prefers [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]], with rainfall between 600 and 4000 millimeters and annual temperatures between 15 and 20 [[°C]].&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt; It is intolerant to [[frost]] (below -2&amp;nbsp;°C) and drought stress. It is assumed that fruit set is affected by night temperatures. Areas where [[citrus]] are cultivated provide good conditions for tamarillos as well, such as in the [[Mediterranean climate]].
Tamarillo plants grow best in light, deep, fertile soils, although they are not very demanding. However, soils must be permeable since the plants are not tolerant to water-logging.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt; They grow naturally on soils with a [[pH]] of 5 to 8.5.

=== Growth ===
[[Plant propagation|Propagation]] is possible by both using [[seeds]] or [[cuttings (plant)|cuttings]].&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamarillo.com/becoming_a_grower/ |title=Becoming a Grower &amp;#124; Tamarillo Growers Association |publisher=Tamarillo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seedlings]] first develop a straight, about 1.5 to 1.8 meters tall trunk, before they branch out. [[Plant propagation|Propagation]] by [[seeds]] is easy and ideal in protected environments. However, in [[orchards]] with different [[cultivars]], [[cross-pollination]] will occur and characteristics of the [[cultivars]] get mixed up. [[Seedlings]] should be kept in the [[Plant nursery|nursery]] until they reach a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, as they are very frost-sensitive.

Plants grown from [[cuttings (plant)|cuttings]] branch out earlier and result in more [[shrub]]-like plants that are more suitable for exposed sites. [[cuttings (plant)|Cuttings]] should be made from [[Basal shoot|basal]] and aerial shoots, and should be free of [[pathogenic viruses]]. Plants grown from [[cuttings (plant)|cuttings]] should be kept in the [[Plant nursery|nursery]] until they reach a height of 0.5 to 1 meter.

The tree grows very quickly and is able to bear fruit after 1.5 to 2 years.&lt;ref name=economicBotany /&gt; The plant is daylength-insensitive. The fruits do not mature simultaneously, unless the tree has been [[pruned]]. A single tree can produce more than 20&amp;nbsp;kg of fruit per year; an [[orchard]] yields in 15 to 17 tons per hectare.&lt;ref name=LostCrops /&gt; One single mature tree in good [[soil]] will bear more fruit than a typical family can eat in about 3 months.

Tamarillos are suitable for growing as indoor container plants, though their swift growth, their light, water and humidity requirements and their large leaves can pose a challenge to those with limited space.

=== Plant management ===
[[File:Cyphomandra betacea2.jpg|thumb|Tamarillo tree]]
The tamarillo trees are adaptable and very easy to grow. However, some plant management strategies can help to stabilize and improve plant performance.

==== Planting ====
Planting distances depend on the growing system. In New Zealand, with mechanized production, single row planting distances of 1 to 1.5 meters between plants and 4.5 to 5 meters between rows are recommended. In traditional growing regions such as the [[Andes|Andean region]], plantations are much more dense, with 1.2 to 1.5 meters between plants. Dense planting can be a strategy to protect plants against wind.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt; On poorly drained soils, plants should be planted on ridges.

==== Pruning ====
[[Pruning]] can help to control fruit size, plant size, [[harvest]] date and to simplify the [[harvest]]ing of fruits.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt; Cutting the tip of young plants leads to the desired branch height. Once the tree shape has been formed, [[pruning]] is reduced to the removal of old or dead wood and previously fruited branches, since branches that have already carried fruits will produce smaller fruits with lower quality the next time. Light [[pruning]] leads to medium-sized, heavy [[pruning]] to large sized fruits. [[Basal shoot]]s should be removed. When plants are grown in [[greenhouses]], [[pruning]] prevents excessive vegetative growth.

When the tree is about 1 to 1.5 metres in height, it is advisable to cut the roots on one side and lean the tree to the other (in the direction of the midday sun at about 30 to 45 degrees). This allows fruiting branches to grow all along the trunk rather than just at the top.[[File:Tamarillo seedlings, 6 months old.jpg|thumb|Tamarillo seedlings, 6 months old]]

==== Mulching ====
Since the plants are sensitive to drought stress, [[mulching]] can help to preserve moisture in the soil.&lt;ref name=LostCrops /&gt; It can also be a strategy to suppress weeds, as other soil management techniques, such as [[plowing]], are not possible due to the shallow and sensitive root system.

====Shelter====
The plants have to be protected from wind. Their shallow root system does not provide enough stability, and the lateral branches are fragile and break easily when carrying fruits.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt;

====Irrigation and fertilization====
To maximize and stabilize production, water and [[nutrient]] inputs should be provided when needed. The plants need continuous supply of water due to their shallow root system. Drought stress results in a decrease of plant growth, fruit size and productivity.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt; Recommended [[fertilizer]] rates per hectare are 170&amp;nbsp;kg of [[nitrogen]], 45&amp;nbsp;kg of [[phosphorus]] and 130 to 190&amp;nbsp;kg of [[potassium]] for intensive [[New Zealand]] production systems. [[Phosphorus]] and [[potassium]] are applied in the beginning of the season; [[nitrogen]] applications are distributed throughout the year.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt;

====Pest management====
The tamarillo tree is, compared to similar crops such as [[tomato]]es, quite resistant to [[Pest (organism)|pests]] in general. Still, to reduce risk in intensive production systems, some [[Pest (organism)|pests]] have to be controlled to avoid major crop damage. To control pests, the same control methods as for other [[solanaceae]] can be used.

=== Harvest ===
[[Ripening]] of fruits is not simultaneous. Several harvests are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/tree_tomato.html |title=Tree Tomato |publisher=Hort.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In climates with little annual variation, tamarillo trees can flower and set fruit throughout the year. In climates with pronounced [[seasons]] (such as [[New Zealand]]), fruits ripen in autumn. Premature harvest and [[ethylene]] induced [[ripening]] in controlled-atmosphere chambers is possible with minimal loss of fruit quality.&lt;ref name=Ripening&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prohens|first1=J. |last2=Ruiz |first2=J.J.|last3=Nuez |first3=F. |title=Advancing the Tamarillo Harvest by Induced Postharvest Ripening|journal=HortScience|year=1996|volume=31|issue=1|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragile lateral branches can break easily when loaded with fruits, so premature harvest helps to reduce this risk and allows storage of fruits up to 20 days at room temperature. A cold-water dipping process, developed by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] also allows further storage of 6–10 weeks.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt;

==Usage==

===Culinary use===
The fruit is eaten by scooping the flesh from a halved fruit. When lightly [[sugar]]ed and cooled, the flesh is used for a breakfast dish. Some people in [[New Zealand]] cut the fruit in half, scoop out the pulpy flesh and spread it on toast at breakfast.  Yellow-fruited cultivars have a sweeter flavor, occasionally compared to mango or apricot.  The red-fruited variety, which is much more widely cultivated, is more tart, and the savory aftertaste is far more pronounced.  In the Northern Hemisphere, tamarillos are most frequently available from July until November, and fruits early in the season tend to be sweeter and less astringent.

They can be made into [[compote]]s, or added to stews (e.g. [[Boeuf Bourguignon]]), [[hollandaise]], [[chutney]]s and [[curries]]. Desserts using this fruit include [[bavarois]] and, combined with apples, a [[strudel]].

Tamarillos can be added as a secondary fermentation flavouring to [[Kombucha]] Tea for a tart and tangy taste.  The fruit should be mashed and added at a ratio of 3 Tamarillos to 1 Litre of Kombucha, however great care should be taken to not allow too much carbon dioxide gas to build up in sealed bottles during secondary fermentation.  The sugar content of fresh Tamarillos added to Kombucha can generate a rapid carbon dioxide production in secondary fermentation within just 48–72 hours.

In [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]] and parts of [[Indonesia]] (including [[Sumatra]] and [[Sulawesi]]), fresh tamarillos are frequently blended together with water and sugar to make a juice. It is also available as a commercially pasteurized [[purée]].

In Nepal, a version of the South American fruit is decently popular. It is typically consumed as a chutney or a pickle during the autumn and winter months. It is known as ''Tammatar'' and ''Ram Bheda''. Similar to Nepal, the Indian regions of Ooty, Darjeeling and Sikkim also consume Tamarillo.

In Ecuador, the tamarillo, known as ''tomate de árbol'', is blended with chili peppers to make a hot sauce commonly consumed with local dishes of the Andean region. The sauce is simply referred to as ''aji'' and is present at every meal in Ecuador.

The flesh of the tamarillo is tangy and variably sweet, with a bold and complex flavor, and may be compared to [[kiwifruit]], tomato, [[guava]], or [[passion fruit]]. The skin and the flesh near it have a bitter taste and are not usually eaten raw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamarillo.com/Tamarillo/servlet/Serve?file=Supplier_FAQ.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629030009/http://www.tamarillo.com/Tamarillo/servlet/Serve?file=Supplier_FAQ.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Treetomatoes.jpg
Image:Tamarillos im Anschnitt(janek2005).jpg
Image:Tamarillos(janek2005).jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The tamarillo has been described as having a taste similar to that of a [[passion fruit]] and a piquant [[tomato]] combined. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The red and purple types of fruits are preferred in import countries of Europe: Even though they taste more acidic, their color is favoured by consumers.&lt;ref name=SmallFruitsReview /&gt;

===Industrial use===
The fruits are high in [[pectin]] and therefore have good properties for [[preserves]]. However, they [[oxidize]] and lose color when not treated. Yellow fruit types are better suited to industrial use.

== Prospects ==
Research and [[Plant breeding|breeding]] should improve plantation management, fruit quality and [[postharvest]] treatment.&lt;ref name=LostCrops /&gt; A better understanding of [[plant physiology]], nutritional requirements of plants and fruit set mechanisms will help to improve growing systems. Breeding goals are to break [[seed dormancy]], to improve sweetness of fruits and to increase yield. For industrial uses, little "stones" of [[sodium]] and [[calcium]] that occasionally appear in the fruit skin form a problem. Those stones have to be eliminated by [[Plant breeding|breeding]].

'''Tricalcium phosphate''' (sometimes abbreviated '''TCP''') is a [[calcium]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[phosphoric acid]] with the [[chemical formula]] Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also known as '''tribasic calcium phosphate''' and '''bone phosphate of lime''' ('''BPL'''). It is a white solid of low solubility.  Most commercial samples of "tricalcium phosphate" are in fact [[hydroxyapatite]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

It exists as three crystalline polymorphs α, α', and β. The α and α' states are stable at high temperatures. As mineral, it is found in [[Whitlockite]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book|author1=Klaus Schrödter|author2=Gerhard Bettermann|author3=Thomas Staffel|author4=Friedrich Wahl|author5=Thomas Klein|author6=Thomas Hofmann|title=Phosphoric Acid and Phosphates|series=Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a19_465.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
{{Main article|Calcium phosphate}}
''Calcium phosphate'' refers to numerous materials consisting of calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) together with [[orthophosphate]]s (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[metaphosphate]]s or [[pyrophosphate]]s (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;) and occasionally oxide and [[hydroxide]] ions. Especially, the common mineral [[apatite]] has formula Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''X'', where ''X'' is [[Fluoride|F]], [[Chloride|Cl]], [[Hydroxide|OH]], or a mixture; it is [[hydroxyapatite]] if the extra ion is mainly hydroxide. Much of the "tricalcium phosphate" on the market is actually powdered [[hydroxyapatite]].

==Preparation ==
Tricalcium phosphate is produced commercially by treating hydroxyapatite with phosphoric acid and slaked lime.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

It cannot be precipitated directly from aqueous solution. Typically double decomposition reactions are employed, involving a soluble phosphate and calcium salts, e.g. (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Destainville"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Synthesis, characterization and thermal behavior of apatitic tricalcium phosphate |authors=Destainville, A., Champion, E., Bernache-Assollant, D., Laborde, E.  |doi=10.1016/S0254-0584(02)00466-2 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254058402004662 |date=2003 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=269–277 |issn=1742-7061| journal =Materials Chemistry and Physics }} {{Subscription or libraries|sentence|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is performed under carefully controlled pH conditions.

There are differences in chemical and biological properties between the beta and alpha forms, the alpha form is more soluble and biodegradeable. Both forms are available commercially and are present in formulations used in medical and dental applications.&lt;ref name="Carrodeguas2011" /&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[Calcium phosphate]] is one of the main [[combustion]] products of [[bone]] (see [[bone ash]]). Calcium phosphate is also commonly derived from [[inorganic]] sources such as mineral rock.&lt;ref&gt;Yacoubou, Jeanne, MS.  [http://www.vrg.org/ingredients/index.php Vegetarian Journal's Guide To Food Ingredients]  "Guide to Food Ingredients". The Vegetarian Resource Group, n.d. Web. 14 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tricalcium phosphate occurs naturally in several forms, including:
* as a rock in [[Morocco]], [[Israel]], [[Philippines]], [[Egypt]], and [[Kola peninsula|Kola]] ([[Russia]]) and in smaller quantities in some other countries.  The natural form is not completely pure, and there are some other components like sand and lime which can change the composition.  In terms of P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, most calcium phosphate rocks have a content of 30% to 40% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in weight.
* in the skeletons and teeth of [[vertebrate]] animals
* in [[Milk#Cow.27s milk|milk]].

==Biphasic tricalcium phosphate, BCP==
Biphasic tricalcium phosphate, BCP, was originally reported as tricalcium phosphate, but X-Ray diffraction techniques showed that the material was an intimate mixture of two phases, hydroxyapatite (HA) and β-tricalcium phosphate.&lt;ref name="Bioceramicschap17"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daculsi|first1=G.|last2= Legeros|first2=R. |last3=|first3= |last4=|first4= |year=2008  |chapter=17 - Tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite biphasic ceramics|chapterurl=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978184569204950017X|editor1-last=Kokubo  |editor1-first= Tadashi  |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |title=Bioceramics and their Clinical Applications |url=  |volume= |issue= |edition= |location= |publisher=Woodhead Publishing |publication-date=|pages=395–423 |bibcode= |doi=10.1533/9781845694227.2.395 |isbn=978-1-84569-204-9 |issn= |jstor= |access-date= }} {{Subscription or libraries|sentence|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ceramic.&lt;ref name="Salinas2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Salinas|first1= Antonio J.|last2=Vallet-Regi|first2=Maria|year=2013 |title=Bioactive ceramics: from bone grafts to tissue engineering |journal= RSC Advances   |volume=3  |issue=28   |pages=11116–11131  |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |jstor= |doi=10.1039/C3RA00166K   |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C3RA00166K   |format= |accessdate= 15 February 2015  |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

β-TCP can contain impurities, for example calcium pyrophosphate, CaP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and apatite. β-TCP is bioresorbable. The biodegradation of BCP involves faster dissolution of the β-TCP phase followed by elimination of HA crystals. β-TCP does not dissolve in body fluids at physiological pH levels, dissolution requires cell activity producing acidic pH.&lt;ref name="Bioactive" /&gt;

==Uses==
Tricalcium phosphate is used in powdered spices as an [[anticaking agent]], e.g. to prevent table salt from caking.  It is also found in [[baby powder]] and [[toothpaste]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3102">A ''triple phase boundary'' ('''TPB''') is a region of contact between three different phases. This concept is particularly important in the field of [[fuel cells]], where the three phases are an [[electrolyte]], an [[electrode]], and a gaseous [[fuel]]. The electrochemical reactions that fuel cells use to produce electricity occur in the presence of these three phases, so the triple phase boundaries can be thought of as the active areas of the cell.

The oxygen reduction reaction that occurs at a [[solid oxide fuel cell|solid oxide fuel cell's]] cathode, can be written as follows:

{{chem|O|2}}(gas) + 4{{chem|e|}}&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(electrode) → 2{{chem|O|2-}}(electrolyte)

Different mechanisms bring these reactants to a TPB to carry out this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Fehribach, J. D. &amp; O’Hayre, R. TRIPLE PHASE BOUNDARIES IN SOLID-OXIDE CATHODES. SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS 70, 510–530 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The kinetics of this reaction is one of the limiting factors in cell performance, so increasing the TPB density will increase the [[reaction rate]], and thus increase cell performance.&lt;ref&gt;O’Hayre, R. &amp; Prinz, F. The Air/Platinum/Nafion triple-phase boundary: Characteristics, scaling, and implications for fuel cells. JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY 151, A756–A762 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, TPB density will also influence the kinetics of the oxidation reaction that occurs between oxygen ions and fuel on the anode side of the cell. Transport to and from each TPB will also affect kinetics, so optimization of the pathways to get reactants and products to the active area is also an important consideration. Researchers working with fuel cells are increasingly using 3D imaging techniques like [[Focused ion beam|FIB-SEM]] to measure TPB density as a way of characterizing cell activity.&lt;ref&gt;Vivet, N. et al.

'''Vera Florence Cooper Rubin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|uː|b|ɪ|n}}; July 23, 1928 – December 25, 2016) was an American [[astronomer]] who pioneered work on [[galaxy]] rotation rates.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt; She uncovered the discrepancy between the predicted [[angular motion]] of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying [[Galaxy rotation curve|galactic rotation curves]]. This phenomenon became known as the [[galaxy rotation problem]], and was evidence of the existence of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Swart|first1=Jaco|last2=Bertone|first2=Gianfranco|last3=van Dongen|first3=Jeroen|date=2017|title=How dark matter came to matter|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0059|journal=Nature Astronomy|volume=1|issue=0059|pages=|arxiv=1703.00013|bibcode=2017NatAs...1E..59D|doi=10.1038/s41550-017-0059|access-date=October 23, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially met with skepticism, Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades. Her legacy was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "ushering in a [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]]-scale change" in [[Cosmology|cosmological theory]].&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Vera Rubin, 88, Dies; Opened Doors in Astronomy, and for Women |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/science/vera-rubin-astronomist-who-made-the-case-for-dark-matter-dies-at-88.html |date=December 27, 2016 | journal =[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1997|title=1996 November 8 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society|journal=[[The Observatory (journal)|The Observatory]]|volume=117|pages=129–135|bibcode=1997Obs...117..129.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning her academic career as the sole undergraduate in astronomy at [[Vassar College]], Rubin went on to graduate studies at [[Cornell University]] and [[Georgetown University]], where she observed deviations from [[Hubble's law|Hubble flow]] in galaxies and provided evidence for the existence of [[Supercluster|galactic superclusters]].&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rubin spent her life advocating for women in science and was known for her mentorship of aspiring women astronomers. Her data provided some of the first evidence for [[dark matter]], which had been theorized by [[Fritz Zwicky]] in the 1930s. She was honored throughout her career for her achievements, and received the [[Bruce Medal]], the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]], and the [[National Medal of Science]], among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DomonoskeNPR161226" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Vera Rubin was born Vera Florence Cooper, on July 23, 1928, in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. She was the younger of two sisters. Her parents were [[Jewish]] immigrants: Philip Cooper, a [[Lithuanian-American]] [[electrical engineer]] who worked at [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] and Rose Applebaum Cooper, of [[Bessarabia]]n origin, who worked at Bell until their marriage.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartusiak"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bartusiak |first=Marcia | title=Through a Universe Darkly: A Cosmic Tale of Ancient Ethers, Dark Matter, and the Fate of the Universe | location = Toronto, Ontario, Canada | publisher=HarperCollins Canada |year = 1993 | isbn=0060183101 | pages=88–94 [verification needed] | url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=noTvAAAAMAAJ}} | access-date = December 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was born in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania, as Pesach Kobchefski.&lt;ref name="Bartusiak"/&gt;

The Coopers moved to Washington, D.C. in 1938,&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227"/&gt; where 10-year-old Vera developed an interest in astronomy watching the stars from her window.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jwa" /&gt; She built a crude telescope out of cardboard with her father, and began to observe and track [[Meteoroid|meteors]].&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/vera-rubin-astronomer-who-verified-existence-of-dark-matter-dies-at-88/2016/12/26/545e617c-cb9d-11e6-a747-d03044780a02_story.html|title=Vera Rubin, astronomer who proved existence of dark matter, dies at 88|last=Schudel|first=Matt|date=December 26, 2016|website=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoles161004" /&gt; She attended [[Coolidge Senior High School (Washington, D.C.)|Coolidge Senior High School]], graduating in 1944.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Rubin's older sister, Ruth Cooper Burge, eventually became an [[administrative law]] judge in the [[United States Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name="Bartusiak"/&gt;

== Education ==
Rubin was inspired to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, [[Vassar College]], because [[Maria Mitchell]] had been a professor there.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt; She also ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irion" &gt;{{Cite journal |last= Irion |first=Robert | year=2002 | title=The Bright Face behind the Dark Sides of Galaxies | journal=Science | location = Washington, DC, US | publisher = AAAS   | volume = 295 | issue = 5557, February 8 | pages = 960–961 | doi = 10.1126/science.295.5557.960 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5557/960.full | accessdate = December 29, 2016 | pmid=11834801}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovators.vassar.edu/innovator.html?id=68|title=Vera Cooper Rubin: Shedding Light on Dark Matter|website=innovators.vassar.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned her bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948,&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt; the only graduate in astronomy that year.&lt;ref name="DomonoskeNPR161226" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/science/vera-rubin-astronomist-who-made-the-case-for-dark-matter-dies-at-88.html |title=Vera Rubin, 88, Dies; Opened Doors in Astronomy, and for Women |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |date=December 27, 2016 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], but was barred due to her gender.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt; Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years.&lt;ref name="DomonoskeNPR161226" /&gt; Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position as a graduate student at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt;

This information and the data she discovered was immensely controversial, and after fighting to be allowed to present her work at the [[American Astronomical Society]] despite being pregnant, she was summarily rejected and the paper forgotten.&lt;ref name="Scoles161004" /&gt;

== Career ==
Rubin held various academic appointments for the next eleven years. She served for a year as an Instructor of Mathematics and Physics at  [[Montgomery County Community College]], then worked from 1955-1965 at [[Georgetown University]], as a Research Associate Astronomer, Lecturer (1959-1962), and finally, Assistant Professor of Astronomy (1962-1965).&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CWP"/&gt; She joined the Carnegie Institute in 1965, as a staff member in the Department of [[Earth's magnetic field|Terrestrial Magnetism]],&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CWP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/users/rubin/%7D%7D|title=Vera C.

In 1963, Rubin began a year-long collaboration with [[Geoffrey Burbidge|Geoffrey]] and [[Margaret Burbidge]], during which made her first observations of the rotation of galaxies at the [[McDonald Observatory]]'s 82 inch telescope.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt; During her work at the Carnegie Institute, Rubin applied to observe at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in 1965, despite the fact that the building did not have facilities for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popsci.com/in-memory-vera-rubin-woman-nobel-prize-forgot|title=In memory of Vera Rubin, the woman the Nobel Prize forgot|last=Feltman|first=Rachel|date=December 27, 2016|work=Popular Science|access-date=October 23, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created her own women's restroom, sidestepping the lack of facilities available for her and becoming the first female astronomer to observe there.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin began work related to her controversial thesis regarding galaxy clusters&lt;ref name="CWP" /&gt; with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube [[spectrograph]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dtm.carnegiescience.edu/news/kent-ford-vera-rubins-image-tube-spectrograph-named-smithsonians-101-objects-made-america|title=Kent Ford &amp; Vera Rubin's Image Tube Spectrograph named in Smithsonian's "101 Objects that Made America"|last=|first=|date=|website=DTM (Carnegie Science)|language=en|access-date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Rubin–Ford effect]], an apparent [[anisotropy]] in the [[expansion of the Universe]] on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth.&lt;ref name="Scoles161004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordRef"&gt;{{cite book | editor = Ridpath, Ian | year = 2016 | orig-year = 2012 | title = A Dictionary of Astronomy | edition = 2nd, revised | chapter = Rubin-Ford Effect | page = 406 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 9780199609055 }}  See also the [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100432262 publishers online entry].&lt;/ref&gt; First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoles161004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/10/vera-rubin|title=How Vera Rubin Discovered Dark Matter|last=Scoles|first=Sarah|date=October 4, 2016|work=Astronomy Magazine|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is now known as [[large scale streaming]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The pair also briefly studied [[quasar]]s, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoles161004" /&gt;

Wishing to avoid controversial areas of astronomy, including quasars and galactic motion, Rubin began to study the rotation and outer reaches of galaxies, an interest sparked by her collaboration with the Burbidges.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt; She investigated the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, again beginning with Andromeda, by looking at their outermost material, and observed flat rotation curves: the outermost components of the galaxy were moving as quickly as those close to the center.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bahcall|first=Neta A.|date=February 28, 2017|title=Vera C.

Rubin's calculations showed that galaxies must contain at least five to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carnegiescience.edu/news/vera-rubin-who-confirmed-%E2%80%9Cdark-matter%E2%80%9D-dies|title=Vera Rubin Who Confirmed "Dark Matter" Dies|last=|first=|date=December 26, 2016|website=Carnegie Science|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Randall |first= Lisa |date=2015 |title=Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780062328502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades,&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt; and became the first persuasive results supporting the theory of [[dark matter]], initially proposed by [[Fritz Zwicky]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="OverbyeNYT161227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoles161004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peebles1993"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Physical Cosmology|last=Peebles|first=P.J.E.|date=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691019339}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]], and images of [[gravitational lens]]ing.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoles161004" /&gt; Her research also prompted a theory of non-Newtonian gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another area of interest for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved in the opposite direction to the rotation of the rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for [[galaxy merger]]s and the process by which galaxies initially formed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rubin's perspective on the history of the work on galaxy movements was presented in a review, "One Hundred Years of Rotating Galaxies," for the ''Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific'' in 2000. This was an adaptation of the lecture she gave in 1996 upon receiving the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, the second woman to be so honored, 168 years after Caroline Herschel received the Medal in 1828.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rubin |first=Vera  | year = 2000 | title = One Hundred Years of Rotating Galaxies | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | volume = 112 | issue = June | pages = 747–750 | url = https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Rubin/paper.pdf | access-date = December 28, 2016 | doi = 10.1086/316573|bibcode = 2000PASP..112..747R }}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her research and mentorship until her death in 2016.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt;

When Rubin was elected to the National Academy of Science, she became the second woman astronomer in its ranks, after her colleague Margaret Burbidge.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt; Rubin never won the Nobel Prize, though physicists such as [[Lisa Randall]] and [[Emily Levesque]] have argued that this was an oversight.&lt;ref name="Scoles161004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170104"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/opinion/why-vera-rubin-deserved-a-nobel.html|title=Why Vera Rubin Deserved a Nobel|last=Randall|first=Lisa|date=January 4, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|authorlink=Lisa Randall|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was described by [[Sandra Faber]] and [[Neta Bahcall]] as one of the astronomers who paved the way for other women in the field, as a "guiding light" for those who wished to have families and careers in astronomy.

== Personal life ==
From 1948 until his death in 2008, she was married to Robert Rubin.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gruber.yale.edu/cosmology/vera-rubin|title=Vera Rubin|last=|first=|date=|website=The Gruber Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sullivan |first=Patricia | date = February 5, 2008 | title = Robert J.

Motivated by her own battle to gain credibility as a woman in a field dominated by male astronomers,  Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Irion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DomonoskeNPR161226"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Domonoske |first=Camila | date = December 26, 2016 | title=Vera Rubin, Who Confirmed Existence Of Dark Matter, Dies At 88 | journal = [[NPR News]] | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/26/507022497/vera-rubin-who-confirmed-existence-of-dark-matter-dies-at-88 | accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of [[women in the sciences]] and for [[scientific literacy]].&lt;ref name="DomonoskeNPR161226" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Nadia|date=December 27, 2016|title=Vera Rubin, Pioneering Astronomer, Dies at 88|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/vera-rubin-dark-matter-galaxy-rotation-nobel-science|journal=National Geographic|volume=|pages=|access-date=December 28, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Andrew|date=December 27, 2016|title=Vera Rubin in the pages of Physics Today|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.9080/full/|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1063/pt.5.9080|access-date=October 23, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches.

A '''water-fuelled car''' is an [[automobile]] that hypothetically derives its energy directly from [[water]].  Water-fuelled cars have been the subject of numerous international patents, newspaper and popular science magazine articles, local television news coverage, and websites.  The claims for these devices have been found to be [[pseudoscience]] and some were found to be tied to [[investment fraud]]s.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Edwards |title= End of road for car that ran on Water |url= http://groups.google.com/group/sci.energy.hydrogen/msg/8ee0acb80e943e21?hl=endc310437cd1cee1e7&amp;|work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |publisher= Times Newspapers Limited|page= Features 12|date=December 1, 1996|accessdate=May 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety [http://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases06/pr20061109d.html press release], November 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dingel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081220-179008/Inventor-82-gets-20-years-for-estafa|title=Inventor, 82, gets 20 years for ‘estafa’|last=Lopez|first=Allison|date=December 20, 2008|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=January 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226045539/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081220-179008/Inventor-82-gets-20-years-for-estafa|archivedate=December 26, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SriFraud"/&gt;  These vehicles may be claimed to produce fuel from water on board with no other energy input, or may be a [[Hybrid Vehicle|hybrid]] claiming to derive some of its energy from water in addition to a conventional source (such as gasoline).

Water is fully oxidized hydrogen. Hydrogen itself is a high-energy, flammable substance, but its useful energy is released when water is formed. Water will not burn. The process of [[electrolysis]] can split water into hydrogen and oxygen, but it takes as much energy to take apart a water molecule as was released when the hydrogen was oxidized to form water. In fact, some energy would be lost in converting water to hydrogen and then burning the hydrogen because some [[waste heat]] would always be produced in the conversions. Releasing chemical energy from water, in excess or in equal proportion to the energy required to facilitate such production, would therefore violate the [[first law of thermodynamics|first]] or [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] [[laws of thermodynamics|law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4271579.html |title=The Truth About Water-Powered Cars: Mechanic's Diary |accessdate=July 21, 2008 |work=Popular Mechanics |date=July 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720231105/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4271579.html |archivedate=July 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}

==What water-fuelled cars are ''not''==
A water-fuelled car is not any of the following:
* [[Water injection (engines)|Water injection]] which is a method for cooling the [[combustion chamber]]s of engines by adding water to the incoming fuel-air mixture, allowing for greater [[compression ratio]]s and reduced [[engine knocking]] (detonation).
* The [[hydrogen car]], although it often incorporates some of the same elements. To fuel a hydrogen car from water, electricity is used to generate hydrogen by [[water electrolysis|electrolysis]]. The resulting hydrogen is an [[energy carrier]] that can power a car by reacting with oxygen from the air to create water, either through burning in a [[Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|combustion engine]] or catalyzed to produce electricity in a [[fuel cell]].
* [[Hydrogen fuel enhancement]], where a mixture of hydrogen and conventional hydrocarbon fuel is burned in an internal combustion engine, usually in an attempt to improve fuel economy or reduce emissions.

==Extracting energy from water==
According to the currently accepted laws of physics, there is no way to extract chemical energy from water alone. Water itself is highly stable—it was one of the [[classical element]]s and contains very strong chemical bonds. Its [[enthalpy of formation]] is negative (-68.3 [[calorie|kcal]]/[[mole (unit)|mol]] or -285.8 [[joule|kJ]]/mol), meaning that energy is required to break those stable bonds, to separate water into its elements, and there are no other compounds of hydrogen and oxygen with more negative enthalpies of formation, meaning that no energy can be released in this manner either.&lt;ref name=CMU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/07stability.shtml|title=Science Notes: Energy and Chemical Stability|accessdate=May 7, 2014 |work=Carnegie Mellon University|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most proposed water-fuelled cars rely on some form of [[electrolysis]] to separate water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and then recombine them to release energy; however, because the energy required to separate the elements will always be at least as great as the useful energy released, this cannot be used to produce net energy.&lt;ref name="Theo"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nature"/&gt;

Garrett allegedly demonstrated a water-fuelled car "for several minutes", which was reported on September 8, 1935, in The [[Dallas Morning News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keelynet.com/energy/garrett.htm|title=Garrett Water Carburetor - 01/12/98|author=|date=|website=keelynet.com|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car generated hydrogen by electrolysis as can be seen by examining Garrett's patent, issued that same year.&lt;ref name="US2006676"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2006676}} Electrolytic carburetor – Charles H. Garrett&lt;/ref&gt; This patent includes drawings which show a [[carburetor]] similar to an ordinary float-type carburetor but with electrolysis plates in the lower portion, and where the float is used to maintain the level of the water. Garrett's patent fails to identify a new source of energy.

At least as far back as 1980, Stanley Meyer claimed that he had built a dune buggy that ran on water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2007/07/08/hydroman.ART_ART_07-08-07_A1_4V77MOK.html|title=The car that ran on water|author=|date=|website=dispatch.com|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he gave inconsistent explanations as to its mode of operation. In some cases, he claimed that he had replaced the spark plugs with a "water splitter",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterpoweredcar.com/equinox3StanleyMeyer.WMV|title="It runs on water, Part 2"|author=|date=|website=waterpoweredcar.com|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in other cases it was claimed to rely on a [[Stanley Meyer's water fuel cell|"fuel cell"]] that split the water into hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waterfuelcell.org/WFCprojects/Video/NewsReport.wmv{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "fuel cell", which he claimed was subjected to an [[electrical resonance]], would split the water mist into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which would then be combusted back into water vapour in a conventional [[internal combustion engine]] to produce net energy. Meyer's claims were never independently verified, and in an Ohio court in 1996 he was found guilty of "gross and egregious fraud".&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; He died of an [[aneurysm]] in 1998, although [[Free energy suppression|conspiracy theories]] claim that he was poisoned.&lt;ref name = "Nature" /&gt;

===Dennis Klein===
In 2002, the firm Hydrogen Technology Applications patented an electrolyser design and trademarked the term "Aquygen" to refer to the hydrogen oxygen gas mixture produced by the device.&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25237309_ITM Hydrogen Technology Applications and UTEK Corporation Announce Strategic Alliance Agreement] (April 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EVWORLD FEATURE: [http://www.evworld.com/article.cfm?archive=1&amp;storyid=1200&amp;first=5220&amp;end=5219 Electric Cars and the Goldilocks Planet: Global Warming | Carbon Dioxide | Cold Fusion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News: [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11875185_ITM Clearwater man puts technology to work] Tampa Tribune (Tampa, Florida) (November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Originally developed as an alternative to [[oxyacetylene welding]], the company claimed to be able to run a vehicle exclusively on water, via the production of "Aquygen", and invoked an unproven state of matter called "magnegases" and a discredited theory about [[magnecule]]s to explain their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Comments on "A new gaseous and combustible form of water," by R.M.

At present, the company no longer claims it can run a car exclusively on water, and is instead marketing "Aquygen" production as a technique to increase fuel efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hytechapps.com/products.html|title=Welcome hytechapps.com - BlueHost.com|author=|date=|website=hytechapps.com|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it [[Hydrogen fuel enhancement]] rather than a water-fuelled car.

===Genesis World Energy (GWE)===
Also in 2002, Genesis World Energy announced a market ready device which would extract energy from water by separating the hydrogen and oxygen and then recombining them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisworldenergy.org/pressroom.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202200636/http://www.genesisworldenergy.org/pressroom.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 2, 2003|title=Genesis World Energy - Press Room|author=|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the company announced that this technology had been adapted to power automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisworldenergy.org/pressroom.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605132731/http://www.genesisworldenergy.org/pressroom.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 5, 2003|title=Genesis World Energy - Newsroom|author=|date=June 5, 2003|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company collected over $2.5 million from investors, but none of their devices were ever brought to market.

===Genepax Water Energy System===
In June 2008, Japanese company Genepax unveiled a car which it claims runs on only water and air,&lt;ref name=techon&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Nikkei Business Publications,Inc. | date = June 13, 2008 | url = http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20080613/153276/ | title = New Fuel Cell System 'Generates Electricity with Only Water, Air' | accessdate =June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many news outlets dubbed the vehicle a "water-fuel car".&lt;ref name=reuters61308&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Reuters | url = https://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=84561| title = Water-fuel car unveiled in Japan | date = June 13, 2008 | accessdate =June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company says it "cannot [reveal] the core part of this invention,” yet,&lt;ref name="cleantech"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.cleantech.com/3002/water-fueled-car-criticisim-fuel-cell-genepax|title=Water-fueled car: too good to be true?|last=Ghelfi|first=Carli|date=June 18, 2008|publisher=Cleantech.com|accessdate=June 22, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622145915/http://media.cleantech.com/3002/water-fueled-car-criticisim-fuel-cell-genepax|archivedate=June 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has disclosed that the system uses an onboard energy generator (a "membrane electrode assembly") to extract the hydrogen using a "mechanism which is similar to the method in which hydrogen is produced by a reaction of metal hydride and water".&lt;ref name=indiatimes&gt;{{cite news | publisher = India Times | url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/International_Business/Now_eco-friendly_car_that_run_on_water/articleshow/3138083.cms | title = Japanese company creates eco-friendly car that uses water as fuel! | date = June 17, 2008 | accessdate =June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrogen is then used to generate energy to run the car.

===Thushara Priyamal Edirisinghe===
Also in 2008, [[Sri Lanka]]n news sources reported that Thushara Priyamal Edirisinghe claimed to drive a water-fuelled car about 300 kilometers&lt;ref&gt;The news sources cited below report that the trip was from Christ King College, [[Pannipitiya]], Thushara, to [[Anuradhapura]] and back.&lt;/ref&gt; on three litres of water.&lt;ref name=bime&gt;Business Intelligence Middle East:[http://www.bi-me.com/main.php?id=22816&amp;t=1&amp;c=33&amp;cg=4&amp;mset= The water-powered car race heats up still further]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dailynews Sri Lanka: [http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/07/19/fea03.asp In search of creativity]&lt;/ref&gt; Like other alleged water-fuelled cars described above, energy for the car is supposedly produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis, and then burning the gases in the engine.

==Hydrogen as a supplement==
{{main|Hydrogen fuel enhancement}}

In addition to claims of cars that run exclusively on water, there have also been claims that burning hydrogen or oxyhydrogen in addition to petrol or diesel fuel increases mileage. Whether such hydrogen on demand systems actually improve emissions or fuel efficiency is debated.&lt;ref name="Browns Gas"&gt;newsreview: [http://www.newsreview.com/reno/Content?oid=706056 Hydrogen generators get a test drive in the search for fuel economy and lower emissions] By Scott D.F. Reeves&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of websites exist promoting the use of oxyhydrogen (which they often refer to as "[[HHO gas|HHO]]"), selling plans for do-it-yourself electrolysers or entire kits with the promise of large improvements in fuel efficiency. According to a spokesman for the [[American Automobile Association]], "All of these devices look like they could probably work for you, but let me tell you they don't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/148710/gas_crisis_fuels_dubious_online_offers.html|title=Gas Crisis Fuels Dubious Online Offers|last=Spring|first=Tom|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=PC World|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gasoline pill and related additives==
{{main|Gasoline pill}}

Related to the water-fuelled car hoax are claims that additives, often a pill, convert the water into usable fuel, similar to a [[carbide lamp]], in which a high-energy additive produces the combustible fuel. This "gasoline pill" has been allegedly demonstrated on a full-sized vehicle, as reported in 1980 in ''[[Mother Earth News]]''. Once again, water itself cannot contribute any energy to the process; the additive or the pill is the fuel.

==Hydrogen on demand technologies==
A hydrogen on demand vehicle uses a chemical reaction to produce hydrogen from water.  The hydrogen is then burned in an internal combustion engine or used in a fuel cell to generate electricity which powers the vehicle.  While these may seem at first sight to be 'water-fuelled cars', they actually take their energy from the chemical that reacts with water, and vehicles of this type are not precluded by the laws of nature. [[Aluminium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium borohydride]] are substances that react with water to generate hydrogen, and all have been used in hydrogen on demand prototypes. Eventually, the chemical runs out and has to be replenished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a hydrogen on demand device, created by scientists from the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], uses [[boron]] to generate hydrogen from water.  An article in ''[[New Scientist]]'' in July 2006 described the power source under the headline "A fuel tank full of water,"&lt;ref name="adamdavid"/&gt; and they quote Abu-Hamed as saying:

{{cquote|The aim is to produce the hydrogen on-board at a rate matching the demand of the car engine. We want to use the boron to save transporting and storing the hydrogen.}}

A vehicle powered by the device would take on water and boron instead of petrol, and generate [[boron trioxide]]. Elemental boron is difficult to prepare and does not occur naturally. Boron trioxide is an example of a [[borate mineral|borate]], which is the predominant form of boron on earth. Thus, a boron-powered vehicle would require an economical method of preparing elemental boron. The chemical reactions describing the oxidation of boron are:

:4[[Boron|B]]  +  6[[water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]  →  2[[Boron trioxide|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]  + 6[[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]    [Hydrogen Generation Step]
:6[[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 3[[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 6[[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]        [Combustion step]

The balanced [[chemical equation]] representing the overall process (hydrogen generation and combustion) is:

:4[[Boron|B]]  + 3[[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]  →  2  [[Boron trioxide|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

As shown above, boron trioxide is the only net byproduct, and it could be removed from the car and turned back into boron and reused. Electricity input is required to complete this process, which Al-Hamed suggests could come from solar panels. Although it is possible to obtain elemental boron by electrolysis, a substantial expenditure of energy is required. The process of converting borates to elemental boron and back might be compared with the analogous process involving carbon: [[carbon dioxide]] could be converted to [[charcoal]] (elemental carbon), then burnt to produce carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="adamdavid"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
It is referred to in the [[That '70s Pilot|pilot episode]] for the [[That '70s Show]] sitcom, as well as in the twenty-first episode of the [[That '70s Show (season 5)|fifth season]].

"[[Gashole]]" (2010), a documentary film about the history of oil prices and the future of alternative mentions multiple stories regarding engines that use water to increase mileage efficiency.

"Like Water for Octane," an episode of ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243069/plotsummary The Lone Gunmen – Plot Summary]." _[[IMDB]]_. 2007. Internet Movie Database Inc. Accessed November 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a "water-powered" car that character [[Melvin Frohike]] saw with his own eyes back in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0635311/ The Lone Gunmen – Like Water for Octane (2001) – Overview – Plot Outline]." _[[IMDB]]_. 2007. Internet Movie Database Inc. Accessed November 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Water Engine]]'', a [[David Mamet]] play made into a television film in 1994, tells the story of Charles Lang inventing an engine that runs using water for fuel. The plot centers on the many obstacles the inventor must overcome to patent his device.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105788/plotsummary The Water Engine – Plot Summary for]" _[[IMDB]]_. 2007. Internet Movie Database Inc. Accessed March 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of the 1996 action film ''[[Chain Reaction (1996 film)|Chain Reaction]]'' revolves around a technology to turn water (via a type of self-sustaining [[bubble fusion]] &amp; electrolysis) into fuel and official suppression of it.

A water-powered car was depicted in a 1997 episode of [[Team Knight Rider]] (a spinoff of the original [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]] TV series) entitled "Oil and Water". In the episode, the vehicle explodes after a character sabotages it by putting [[Carbonated water|seltzer tablets]] in the fuel tank. The car shown was actually a [[Bricklin SV-1]].

The plot of the 2017 novel "Paradox Bound" by Peter Clines revolves around a group of time travelers, the majority of whom drive cars modified in the 2020s to use Garrett carburetors.

'''''We Feed the World''''' is a 2005 documentary in which Austrian filmmaker [[Erwin Wagenhofer]] traces the origins of the food we eat and views modern industrial production of food and [[factory farming]] in a critical light. His journey takes him to France, Spain, Romania, Switzerland, Brazil and back to Austria.

The film features interviews with several people, including one with sociologist and politician [[Jean Ziegler]].

The film was the most successful Austrian documentary ever. In German-speaking countries it was seen by about 600,000 cinemagoers.&lt;ref name="lumiere"&gt;[http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=24738 lumiere.obs.coe.int – Database of film attendance in Europe], retrieved 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Merriam Burton''' (November 17, 1865 &amp;ndash; December 29, 1954) was an American [[chemist]] who developed the first [[thermal cracking]] process for [[crude oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Meriam Burton|url=https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/multi_search?q=%22Burton%2C+William+Merriam%2C+1865-1954%22&amp;search_field=subject|publisher=jhu.edu|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  In 1886, he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at [[Western Reserve University]].  He earned a [[PhD]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1889.

Burton initially worked for the [[Standard Oil]] refinery at [[Whiting, Indiana]].  He became president of Standard Oil from 1918 to 1927, when he retired.

The process of thermal cracking invented by Burton, which became {{US patent|1049667}} on January 7, 1913, doubled the yield of [[gasoline]] that can be extracted from crude oil.

The first thermal [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking method]], the Shukhov cracking process, was invented by [[Russia]]n engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] (1853-1939), in the Russian empire, Patent No. 12926, November 27, 1891.
Burton died  in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]].

{{infobox ytterbium}}
'''Ytterbium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Yb''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate element in the [[lanthanide]] series, which is the basis of the relative stability of its -6 [[oxidation state]]. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, as in its [[oxide]], [[halide]]s, and other compounds. In [[aqueous solution]], like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides.

In 1878, the Swiss chemist [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]] separated from the rare earth "erbia" another independent component, which he called "ytterbia", for [[Ytterby]], the village in [[Sweden]] near where he found the new component of [[erbium]]. He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called "ytterbium" (in total, four elements were named after the village, the others being [[yttrium]], [[terbium]] and [[erbium]]). In 1907, the new earth "lutecia" was separated from ytterbia, from which the element "lutecium" (now [[lutetium]]) was extracted by [[Georges Urbain]], [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]], and [[Charles James (chemist)|Charles James]]. After some discussion, Marignac's name "ytterbium" was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953. At present, ytterbium is mainly used as a [[dopant]] of stainless steel or [[active laser medium|active laser media]], and less often as a [[gamma ray]] source.

Natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 [[parts per million]]. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals [[monazite]], [[euxenite]], and [[xenotime]]. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other [[rare earth elements]]; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Ytterbium is a soft, [[malleability|malleable]] and [[ductility|ductile]] [[chemical element]] that displays a bright silvery [[luster (mineralogy)|luster]] when pure. It is a [[rare earth element]], and it is readily dissolved by the strong [[mineral acid]]s. It [[chemical reaction|reacts]] slowly with cold [[water]] and it [[oxidation|oxidizes]] slowly in air.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = Hammond, C. R. |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 81st| publisher =CRC press| date = 2000| isbn = 978-0-8493-0481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ytterbium has three [[Allotropy|allotropes]] labeled by the Greek letters alpha, beta and gamma; their transformation temperatures are −13&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] and 795&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; although the exact transformation temperature depends on the [[pressure]] and [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].&lt;ref name="alpha-Yb"/&gt; The beta allotrope (6.966&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) exists at room temperature, and it has a [[face-centered cubic]] [[crystal structure]]. The high-temperature gamma allotrope (6.57&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) has a [[body-centered cubic]] crystalline structure.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; The alpha allotrope (6.903&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) has a [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; The beta allotrope has a metallic [[electrical conductivity]] at normal atmospheric pressure, but it becomes a [[semiconductor]] when exposed to a pressure of about 16,000 [[atmospheric pressure|atmospheres]] (1.6&amp;nbsp;[[gigapascal|GPa]]). Its electrical [[resistivity]] increases ten times upon compression to 39,000 atmospheres (3.9&amp;nbsp;GPa), but then drops to about 10% of its room-temperature resistivity at about 40,000&amp;nbsp;atm (4.0&amp;nbsp;GPa).&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In contrast with the other rare-earth metals, which usually have [[antiferromagnetic]] and/or [[ferromagnetic]] properties at low [[temperature]]s, ytterbium is [[paramagnetic]] at temperatures above 1.0 [[kelvin]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M. (2000). [http://www.irm.umn.edu/quarterly/irmq10-3.pdf "Magnetism of Rare Earth"]. The IRM quarterly 10(3): 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, the alpha allotrope is [[diamagnetic]].&lt;ref name="alpha-Yb"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bucher | first1 = E. | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = P. | last3 = Jayaraman | first3 = A. | last4 = Andres | first4 = K. | last5 = Maita | first5 = J. | last6 = Nassau | first6 = K. | last7 = Dernier | first7 = P. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.2.3911 | title = New First-Order Phase Transition in High-Purity Ytterbium Metal | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 3911 | year = 1970 | pmid = | pmc = |bibcode = 1970PhRvB...2.3911B }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[melting point]] of 824&amp;nbsp;°C and a [[boiling point]] of 1196&amp;nbsp;°C, ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

Contrary to most other lanthanides, which have a close-packed hexagonal lattice, ytterbium crystallizes in the face-centered cubic system. Ytterbium has a density of 6.973&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is significantly lower than those of the neighboring lanthanides, [[thulium]] (9.32&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[lutetium]] (9.841&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Its melting and boiling points are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium. This is due to the closed-shell electron configuration of ytterbium ([Xe] 4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for [[metallic bond]]ing (in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available) and increases ytterbium's [[metallic radius]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Ytterbium metal tarnishes slowly in air. Finely dispersed ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] or [[hexachloroethane]] burn with a luminous emerald-green flame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = E.

Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

Ytterbium is quite [[electropositive]], and it reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form ytterbium(III) hydroxide:&lt;ref name="webelements"/&gt;

Ytterbium reacts with all the [[halogen]]s:&lt;ref name="webelements"/&gt;

The ytterbium(III) ion absorbs light in the [[near infrared]] range of wavelengths, but not in [[visible light]], so [[ytterbia]], Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is white in color and the salts of ytterbium are also colorless. Ytterbium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions that contain the colorless Yb(III) ions, which exist as nonahydrate complexes:&lt;ref name="webelements"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/ytterbium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Ytterbium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yb(II) vs. Yb(III)===
Although usually trivalent, ytterbium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual for [[lanthanide]]s, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has a valence [[electron configuration]] of 4''f''&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; because the fully filled ''f''-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion is a very strong [[reducing agent]] and decomposes water, releasing [[hydrogen]] gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in [[aqueous solution]]. [[Samarium]] and [[thulium]] also behave this way in the +2 state, but [[europium]](II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue [[electride]] salts.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of ytterbium}}
Natural ytterbium is composed of seven stable [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;168&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, &lt;sup&gt;170&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, &lt;sup&gt;171&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, &lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, &lt;sup&gt;173&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, &lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, and &lt;sup&gt;176&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, with &lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb being the most common, at 31.8% of the [[natural abundance]]). 27 [[radioisotope]]s have been observed, with the most stable ones being &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Yb with a [[half-life]] of 32.0 days, &lt;sup&gt;175&lt;/sup&gt;Yb with a half-life of 4.18 days, and &lt;sup&gt;166&lt;/sup&gt;Yb with a half-life of 56.7 hours. All of its remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than two hours and most of these have half-lives are less than 20 minutes. Ytterbium also has 12 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;169m&lt;/sup&gt;Yb (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; 46 seconds).&lt;ref name="nucleonica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nucleonica.net/unc.aspx |title=Nucleonica: Universal Nuclide Chart |date=2007–2011 |publisher=Nucleonica |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IS"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| issue = 1| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A. H.| url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.8504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isotopes of ytterbium range in [[atomic weight]] from 147.9674 [[atomic mass unit]] (u) for &lt;sup&gt;148&lt;/sup&gt;Yb to 180.9562&amp;nbsp;u for &lt;sup&gt;181&lt;/sup&gt;Yb. The primary [[decay mode]] of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb, is [[electron capture]], and the primary decay mode for those heavier than &lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb is [[beta decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s of ytterbium isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb are [[thulium]] isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than &lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;Yb are [[lutetium]] isotopes.&lt;ref name="nucleonica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IS"/&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[File:Euxenite - Vegusdal, Norvegia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Euxenite]] ]]
Ytterbium is found with other [[rare earth element]]s in several rare [[mineral]]s. It is most often recovered commercially from [[monazite]] sand (0.03% ytterbium). The element is also found in [[euxenite]] and [[xenotime]]. The main mining areas are [[China]], the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Australia]]. Reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million [[tonne]]s. Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths, but [[ion-exchange]] and [[solvent extraction]] techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation. [[chemical compound|Compounds]] of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth's crust is about 3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC| pages= 492–494|title = Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements| author =Emsley, John | publisher= Oxford University Press| date = 2003| isbn = 978-0-19-850340-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an even-numbered lanthanide, in accordance with the [[Oddo-Harkins rule]], ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, [[thulium]] and [[lutetium]], which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a [[dopant]] in the [[YAG#Yb:YAG|Yb:YAG laser]], a [[solid-state laser]] in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes [[stimulated emission]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lacovara | first1 = P. | last2 = Choi | first2 = H.

Ytterbium is often the most common substitute in [[yttrium]] minerals. In very few known cases/occurrences ytterbium prevails over yttrium, as, e.g., in [[xenotime]]-(Yb). A report of native ytterbium from the Moon's regolith is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-41858.html |title=Mindat.org |author=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |date=1993–2018 |website=www.mindat.org |access-date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
It is relatively difficult to separate ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as [[monazite]] or [[xenotime]] are dissolved into various acids, such as [[sulfuric acid]]. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by [[ion exchange]], as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a [[resin]], which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using [[complexing agent]]s, and due to the different types of bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gelis | first1 = V.

Ytterbium is separated from other rare earths either by [[ion exchange]] or by reduction with sodium amalgam. In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium-mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating. The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with [[lanthanum]], [[aluminium]], [[cerium]] or [[zirconium]] in high vacuum. The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate.&lt;ref name=patnaik&gt;{{cite book|last =Patnaik|first =Pradyot |date = 2003|title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds|publisher = McGraw-Hill|pages = 973–975|isbn =978-0-07-049439-8| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical behavior of ytterbium is similar to that of the rest of the [[lanthanide]]s. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like [[europium]], [[samarium]], and [[thulium]], the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by [[hydrogen]], [[zinc]] dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the [[alkaline earth metal]] compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as [[calcium oxide]] (CaO).&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|edition=91–100|pages=1265–1279|isbn=978-3-11-007511-3|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first=Arnold F.|last=Holleman|author2=Wiberg, Egon|author3=Wiberg, Nils|language=German|chapter=Die Lanthanoide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halides===
[[File:Kristallstruktur Lanthanoid-C-Typ.png|thumb|right|Crystal structure of [[ytterbium(III) oxide]]]]
Ytterbium forms both dihalides and trihalides with the [[halogen]]s [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]]. The dihalides are susceptible to oxidation to the trihalides at room temperature and disproportionate to the trihalides and metallic ytterbium at high temperature:&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

Some ytterbium halides are used as [[reagent]]s in [[organic synthesis]]. For example, [[ytterbium(III) chloride]] (YbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[Lewis acid]] and can be used as a [[catalyst]] in the [[Aldol reaction|Aldol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lou | first1 = S. | last2 = Westbrook | first2 = J.

===Oxides===
Ytterbium reacts with oxygen to form [[ytterbium(III) oxide]] (Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which crystallizes in the "rare-earth C-type sesquioxide" structure which is related to the [[fluorite]] structure with one quarter of the anions removed, leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate (non-octahedral) environments.&lt;ref&gt;Wells A.F. (1984) ''Structural Inorganic Chemistry'' 5th edition, Oxford Science Publications, {{ISBN|0-19-855370-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ytterbium(III) oxide can be reduced to [[ytterbium(II) oxide]] (YbO) with elemental ytterbium, which crystallizes in the same structure as [[sodium chloride]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Galissard de Marignac.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]]]]
Ytterbium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by the Swiss chemist [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]] in the year 1878. While examining samples of [[gadolinite]], Marignac found a new component in the earth then known as [[erbia]], and he named it ytterbia, for [[Ytterby]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]] village near where he found the new component of erbium. Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called "ytterbium".&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enghag"/&gt;

In 1907, the French chemist [[Georges Urbain]] separated Marignac's ytterbia into two components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later became known as the element ytterbium, and lutecia became known as the element [[lutetium]]. The Austrian chemist [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]] independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium;&lt;ref name=history/&gt; the American chemist [[Charles James (chemist)|Charles James]] also independently isolated these elements at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = {{sic|Separaton|nolink=y}} of Rare Earth Elements by Charles James | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/earthelements.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party.&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Un nouvel élément, le lutécium, résultant du dédoublement de l'ytterbium de Marignac|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume=145|date=1908|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3099v/f759.table|pages=759–762|author=Urbain, M.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lutetium und Neoytterbium oder Cassiopeium und Aldebaranium – Erwiderung auf den Artikel des Herrn Auer v.

The chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined with any precision until 1953, when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using [[ion-exchange]] processes.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The price of ytterbium was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US $1,000/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher = USGS| title =Rare-Earth Metals| author = Hedrick, James B. | accessdate = 2009-06-06| url =http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/740798.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Source of gamma rays===
The &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Yb [[isotope]] (with a [[half-life]] of 32 days), which is created along with the short-lived &lt;sup&gt;175&lt;/sup&gt;Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by [[neutron activation]] during the [[irradiation]] of ytterbium in [[nuclear reactor]]s, has been used as a [[radiation]] source in portable [[X-ray]] machines. Like X-rays, the [[gamma rays]] emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for [[radiography]] of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350&amp;nbsp;keV. &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Yb is also used in [[nuclear medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=168–169|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wJqBSA1exqoC| title =Industrial radiology: theory and practice| author= Halmshaw, R. | publisher = Springer| date = 1995| isbn =978-0-412-62780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-stability atomic clocks===
Ytterbium clocks hold the record for stability with ticks stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion ({{val|2|e=-18}}).&lt;ref&gt;NIST (2013-08-22) [https://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/clock-082213.cfm Ytterbium Atomic Clocks Set Record for Stability].&lt;/ref&gt; The clocks developed at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] rely on about 10,000 rare-earth atoms cooled to 10 microkelvin (10 millionths of a degree above absolute zero) and trapped in an optical lattice—a series of pancake-shaped wells made of laser light. Another laser that "ticks" 518 trillion times per second provokes a transition between two energy levels in the atoms. The large number of atoms is key to the clocks' high stability.

Visible light waves oscillate faster than microwaves, and therefore optical clocks can be more precise than [[caesium]] [[atomic clocks]]. The [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] is working on several such optical clocks. The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point.&lt;ref&gt;Peik, Ekkehard (2012-03-01). [http://www.ptb.de/en/aktuelles/archiv/presseinfos/pi2012/pitext/pi120301.html New "pendulum" for the ytterbium clock]. ptb.de.&lt;/ref&gt;
A pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology has set a record for stability. NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 [[quintillion]] (1 followed by 18 zeros), roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks. The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable to the age of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIST ytterbium atomic clocks set record for stability|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-08-nist-ytterbium-atomic-clocks-stability.html|publisher=Phys.org|date=August 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doping of stainless steel===
Ytterbium can also be used as a [[dopant]] to help improve the grain refinement, strength, and other mechanical properties of [[stainless steel]]. Some ytterbium [[alloy]]s have rarely been used in [[dentistry]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The ytterbium +3 [[ion]] is used as a [[doping (semiconductors)|doping material]] in [[active laser medium|active laser media]], specifically in [[solid state laser]]s and [[double clad fiber]] lasers.

Much progress has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1&amp;nbsp;kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2&lt;1.1) at power levels of 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW to greater than 2&amp;nbsp;kW at ~1064&amp;nbsp;nm in a broadband configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2011.170|title=Doped fibres: Rare-earth fibres power up|journal=Nature Photonics|volume=5|issue=8|pages=466|year=2011|last1=Samson|first1=Bryce|last2=Carter|first2=Adrian|last3=Tankala|first3=Kanishka|bibcode=2011NaPho...5..466S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated [[Brillouin scattering]] and stimulated [[Raman scattering]], which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.

In order to achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be achieved only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, in order to reduce the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fiber for Fiber Lasers: Matching Active and Passive Fibers Improves Fiber Laser Performance|url=http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-48/issue-01/features/matching-active-and-passive-fibers-improves-fiber-laser-performance.html/|date=2012-01-01|publisher=[[Laser Focus World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1&amp;nbsp;µm systems.

Currently, ytterbium is being investigated as a possible replacement for [[magnesium]] in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic [[flare (countermeasure)|infrared decoy flares]]. As [[ytterbium(III) oxide]] has a significantly higher [[emissivity]] in the infrared range than [[magnesium oxide]], a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on [[magnesium/Teflon/Viton]] (MTV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = E.
