'''''"Master Harold"...and the boys''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Athol Fugard]].  Set in 1950, it was first produced at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] in March 1982 and made its premiere on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on 4 May at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]],&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Frank|authorlink1=Frank Rich|title=STAGE: 'MASTER HAROLD,' FUGARD'S DRAMA ON ORIGIN OF HATE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9504E6DC1738F936A35756C0A964948260|accessdate=13 September 2015|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 5, 1982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it ran for 344 performances. The play takes place in [[South Africa]] during [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] era, and depicts how institutionalized [[racism]], bigotry or hatred can become absorbed by those who live under it. It is said to be a semi-autobiographical play, as Athol Fugard's birth name was Harold and his boyhood was very similar to Hally's, including his father being disabled, and his mother running a tea shop to support the family. His relationship with his family's servants was also similar to Hally's, as he sometimes considered them his friends, but other times treated them like subservient help, insisting that he be called "Master Harold", and once spitting in the face of one he had been close to.

The play was initially [[censorship|banned]] from production in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Master Harold...and the Boys | url=http://www.colonytheatre.org/news/PRMasterHarold.html | publisher=The Colony Theatre Company | date=26 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of Fugard's plays to premiere outside of South Africa.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt;

==Plot==
The play recounts the long, rainy afternoon that Hally ("Master Harold") spends with Sam and Willie, two middle-aged African servants of his parent's household, in a tea shop owned by Hally's mother.  Sam and Willie have cared for seventeen year old Hally his whole life.

At the start of the play Sam and Willie are practicing [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]] steps in preparation for a major competition, while maintaining the tea shop. Business is slow due to the rain. Sam is quickly revealed as being the more worldly of the two.  When Willie, in broken English, describes his ballroom partner and girlfriend as lacking enthusiasm, Sam correctly diagnoses the problem: Willie beats her if she doesn't know the steps.

Hally then arrives home from school, and cheerfully asks if the two are ready for the competition.  Sam is the unacknowledged yet de facto mentor to the boy since childhood, and has always treated Hally as his nephew/ward.  Sam hopes to skillfully guide Hally through the difficult passage from childhood into manhood.  And hopefully thereby, takes up those values and viewpoints of an adult; and a man, that Sam, has over the years lain down; and, that all men try to leave as their legacy of shepherding an adolescent boy into manhood.  Willie, for his part, has always played the "loyal black"; who has always called the white Afrikaner boy (now young man) "Master Harold"; As if, as a man of forty-five, he was addressing a superior; even when Hally was six.

The conversation between the three moves from Hally's school-work, to an intellectual discussion on "A Man of Magnitude", where they mention various historical figures of the time and their contribution to society, to flashbacks of Hally, Sam and Willie when they lived in a Boarding House. Hally warmly remembers the simple act of flying a kite Sam had made for him out of junk; we later learn that Sam made it to cheer Hally up after he was embarrassed greatly by his father's public and continuing drunkenness. Conversation then turns to Hally's 500-word [[English studies|English]] composition.  The play reaches an emotional apex as the beauty of the [[ballroom dancing]] floor ("a world without collisions") is used as a transcendent [[metaphor]] for life.

Almost immediately despair returns: Sam had early on mentioned why Hally's mother is not present; the hospital had called about his father, who has been there receiving treatment for complications from a leg he lost in [[World War II]], to discharge him, and she had left to bring him home. However, Hally, indicating that his father had been in considerable pain the previous day, insisted that his father wasn't well enough to be discharged, and that the call must've been about a bad turn, rather than a discharge notice. A call from Hally's mother at the hospital confirms that Hally's father, is manipulating the hospital into discharging him, although he is indeed, not feeling any better than before, so it's still unofficial, and Hally remains hopeful that the discharge won't happen. A second call from Hally's mother later reveals that the discharge is official, and Hally's father is now home.

Hally is distraught about this news, since his father, who in addition to being crippled, is revealed to be a tyrannical alcoholic, and his being home will make home life unbearable with his drinking, fighting, and need for constant treatment, which includes demeaning tasks of having to massage his stump, and empty chamber pots of urine. Hally vents to his two black friends years of anger, and pain, viciously mocking his father and his condition. But when Sam chastises him for doing so, Hally, although ashamed of himself, turns on him, unleashing vicarious racism, that he learned from his father, creating possibly permanent rifts in his relationship with both Sam and Willie. For the first time, apart from hints throughout the play, Hally begins explicitly to treat Sam and Willie as subservient help rather than as friends or playmates, insisting that Sam call him "Master Harold" and spitting on him, among other things. Sam is hurt and angry and both he and Willie are just short of attacking Hally, but they both understand that Hally is really causing himself the most pain.

There is a glimmer of hope for reconciliation at the end, when Sam addresses Hally by his nickname again and asks to start over the next day, harkening back to the simple days of the kite. Hally, horrified about what he's done, is barely able to face Sam, responding without looking up "It's still raining, Sam. You can't fly kites on rainy days, remember," then asks Willie to lock up the tea shop, and walks out into the rain, as Sam mentions that the bench Hally sat on as he flew the kite said "Whites Only" but Hally was too excited to notice it, and that he can (figuratively) leave it at any time. The play ends while Sam and Willie console each other by ballroom dancing together.

==Critical reception==
John Simon, writing for [[New York Magazine]], was measured in his review:{{quote |text=Fugard has now perfected his way of writing plays about the tragedy of apartheid; he avoids the spectacular horrors and concentrates instead on the subtle corrosion and corruption, on the crumbling of the spirit for which the cure would be heroic action that may not be forthcoming, which the blacks try to assuage with the salve of dreams, the whites with the cautery of oppression.|author=[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], "'Two Harolds and no Medea." (May 17, 1982)&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=John|title=Two Harolds and no Medea|journal=New York Magazine|date=17 May 1982|volume=15|issue=20|page=76|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=m-cCAAAAMBAJ|publisher=New York Media, LLC|language=English|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the performance at the original Broadway premiere: {{quote |text=There may be two or three living playwrights in the world who can write as well as Athol Fugard, but I'm not sure that any of them has written a recent play that can match '' 'Master Harold' ... and the Boys.'' Mr. Fugard's drama - lyrical in design, shattering in impact - is likely to be an enduring part of the theater long after most of this Broadway season has turned to dust.|author=Frank Rich, "'Master Harold,' Fugard's drama on the origin of hate."

The '''Asia Tour''' was planned to be the eleventh concert tour by Canadian singer Celine Dion. The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142420/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have marked Dion's first concerts in Asia since the [[Taking Chances World Tour]] in 2008. While Japan and the Philippines were the only confirmed stops of the tour, it has been revealed that the singer was planned to be performing dates in several Asian countries for the very first time.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Background==
The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014. Japan and the Philippines were officially announced. However, there were unofficial dates and venues for Taiwan, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand but because of the cancellation the ticket were never put on sale. In total, 14 concerts were supposed to take place.

==Commercial performance==
Celine's concerts in Tokyo and Osaka sold out immediately after tickets went on sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hipjpn.co.jp/live/celine/ticket.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
On 13 August 2014, Dion has announced that the tour has been cancelled due to ongoing illness and family issues.

According to a statement released by the singer:

{{cquote|"I want to devote every ounce of my strength and energy to my [[René Angélil|husband]]'s healing, and to do so, it's important for me to dedicate this time to him and to our children," Dion said in a statement.
"I also want to apologize to all my fans everywhere, for inconveniencing them, and I thank them so much for their love and support."&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|title=Celine Dion announces show biz hiatus to focus on ailing husband|work=Celine: Las Vegas Official Website|publisher=[[AEG Live]]|accessdate=13 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813231818/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|archive-date=13 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dion did not return to Asia for a performance until her [[Celine Dion Live 2018|2018 tour]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/8455647/celine-dion-2018-asia-tour-dates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening acts==
In the official announcement for the Japan and Philippine tour, it was revealed that the impersonator [[Véronic DiCaire]] had been invited to join Celine as the opening act for these shows.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Set list==
The official setlist had yet to be announced, although in an exclusive video message to her Japanese fans, Dion promised a new show featuring songs from her latest English album, ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', as well as fan favorites from the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dem_HyX9WcY&lt;/ref&gt; Celine was also rehearsing one song in Japanese and one in Mandarin for the tour.

"'''Awake, our drowsy souls'''" was a Christian [[hymn]] by [[Elizabeth Scott (hymnwriter)|Elizabeth Scott]]. 
[[File:Awake, our drowsy souls (1769).png|thumb|Lyrics for "Awake, our drowsy souls" (1769), by Elizabeth Scott]]
==History==
It was first published in the Baptist ''Collections'' of Ash and Evans, [[Bristol]], 1769, No. 307, in 5 [[stanza]]s of 6 1., and appointed as "A hymn for Lord's Day Morning." From that collection it passed into several later hymnals, including [[John Rippon]], [[John Dobell]], and others. By the early 20th-century, it was almost entirely unknown to modern hymn-books except in the United States, having been superseded by 
"Awake, ye saints, awake, And hail", and others as a recast of the same in 4 stanzas (stanza iii. being the original with "and" for "while," 1. 3) made by [[Thomas Cotterill]], and given in the first edition of his ''Selection'', 1810. This form of the hymn had somewhat extensive use in Great Britain and the U.S., and is usually ascribed correctly to "Elizabeth Scott and Thomas Cotterill."{{sfn|Julian|1907|p=103}}

==Alternate versions==
In many of the modern American hymnals, stanza iv. is omitted; but the English generally give the text from Cotterill as in Baptist ''Psalms and Hymns'', 1858. In this case, the only alteration is "blest " for "bless'd " in stanza i., line 5. Another form of the hymn is:— "Servants of God, awake." It consists of st. i.—iii- of Cotterill's recast, slightly altered. It appeared in the Harrow School ''Hymn Book'', 1855, and from then on passed into ''Church Hymns'', 1871, No. 39. In the ''Hymn-Book of the Evangelical Association'', [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], 1881, No. 604, stanzas i., ii. are given as "Children of God, awake "; and in the ''Marlborough College Hymns'', 1869, stanzas i.—iii. as " Come, sons of God, awake."{{sfn|Julian|1907|p=103}}

The authorship of "Awake, ye saints, awake" is ascribed to Cotterill, on the ground that he wrote the most of what is its present form. In Caleb Evans’s ''Collection'', fifth edition, 1786, it appears in five stanzas, commencing, “Awake, our drowsy souls." Rippon has it with the same text and the same title: “A Hymn for the Lord’s Day Morning." Evans credits it to “D,” that is, Dr. [[Philip Doddridge]], but Dobell, who reprints it in six stanzas, has assigned it to “Scott”. It was altered about the year 1810 by Cotterill, for his Sheffield collection. The original was discovered in manuscript, in the library of [[Yale College]], where it remained. Professor [[Frederic Mayer Bird]] gave much care to Scott's  biography and hymns, and elaborately annotated this manuscript volume in the columns of the ''[[The Independent (New York City)|New York Independent]]''.

The '''Berlin Trilogy''', or '''Berlin Triptych''', consists of three consecutively released [[studio album]]s by English singer and songwriter [[David Bowie]]: ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977), ''[["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979). The albums were recorded after Bowie took up residence in [[West Berlin]] in late 1976, and saw him experiment with elements of [[electronic music|electronic]], [[krautrock]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[world music]] in collaboration with American producer [[Tony Visconti]] and English musician [[Brian Eno]].

Bowie began referring to the three albums as a Berlin-centered trilogy during the promotion of ''Lodger'', although ''"Heroes"'' was the only installment primarily recorded in the city. Each album reached the UK top five. Bowie would later call the music of the trilogy his "DNA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacLean|first1=Rory|title=Bowie in Berlin: 'He drove round the car park at 70mph screaming that he wanted to end it all'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/13/david-bowie-berlin-years-heroes-just-a-gigolo|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' characterized the trilogy as an "[[art rock]] trifecta",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|title=Ranking: Every David Bowie Album From Worst to Best|date=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that the Berlin Trilogy "stands as some of the most innovative music in the artist's influential canon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Brian Eno on David Bowie: 'I Feel a Huge Gap Now'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=11 January 2016|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-eno-on-david-bowie-i-feel-a-huge-gap-now-20160111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|The Idiot (album)}}
Following Bowie's [[Thin White Duke]] period and the commercial success of the singles "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]" and "[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]" in 1976, he was eager to escape the drug culture of Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="UCR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mastropolo|first1=Frank|title=The History of David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy: ''Low'', ''"Heroes"'' and ''Lodger''|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-bowie-berlin-trilogy/|website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he had developed a [[cocaine]] addiction.&lt;ref name="Wilcken 2005 24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcken|first=Hugo|date=2005|title=''Low''|location=New York|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-1684-5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also become embroiled in controversy regarding comments he made seemingly in favour of [[fascism]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=289–91}} He blamed his erratic behaviour on his addictions and precarious mental state,{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=11}} saying "I was out of my mind, totally crazed."{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=158}} He called the period "the darkest days of my life" and confessed to having no memory of recording of ''[[Station to Station]]'' in Los Angeles in late 1975 due to his "astronomic" cocaine addiction.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=258–75}} As his health deteriorated, Bowie attempted to reduce his cocaine intake and phase out the Thin White Duke persona, whom he had come to see as "a nasty character indeed."&lt;ref name="Wilcken 2005 24"/&gt; He said: "It was a dangerous period for me. I was at the end of my tether physically and emotionally and had serious doubts about my sanity."&lt;ref name="Bowie's UNCUT interview on Low"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowie's UNCUT interview on Low|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/low.html|website=BowieGoldenYears.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hauptstraße 155 Berlin-Schöneberg.jpg|thumb|right|Apartment building on {{ill|Hauptstraße|de|Hauptstraße (Berlin-Schöneberg)}} 155 in Berlin [[Schöneberg]] where Bowie lived with Iggy Pop from 1976 to 1978]]

Bowie moved to Switzerland in the second half of 1976. There, he began exploring other art forms and visiting galleries in [[Geneva]] and the [[Brücke Museum]] in Berlin, becoming (in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford) "a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art&amp;nbsp;... Not only did he become a well-known patron of [[expressionist art]], locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in [[classical music]] and [[literature]], and started work on an autobiography."{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=154–55}} Later that year, Bowie, along with friend and singer [[Iggy Pop]], retreated to [[Berlin]] in a further attempt to escape his addiction and the spotlight:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For many years Berlin had appealed to me as a sort of sanctuary-like situation. It was one of the few cities where I could move around in virtual anonymity. I was going broke; it was cheap to live. For some reason, Berliners just didn't care. Well, not about an English rock singer, anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|title=Uncut Interviews David Bowie &amp; Tony Visconti On Berlin|date=March 2001|url=http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/features/tvuncut.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While sharing an apartment with Pop, Bowie became interested in the German music scene, including acts such as [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Neu!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://groove.de/2015/01/26/zeitgeschichten-tangerine-dream/|title=ZEITGESCHICHTEN Tangerine Dream - Groove|date=2015-01-26|work=Groove|access-date=2018-09-20|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before moving to the apartment on Hauptstraße, Pop and Bowie stayed with [[Edgar Froese]] of [[Tangerine Dream]] and his family at their home in [[Schöneberg]]. Froese also helped Bowie with his recovery and introduced him to the Berlin underground scene. Bowie named Froese's solo album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' a big influence and a soundtrack to his life in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/bayerisches-viertel/tangerine-dream-im-kiez-als-david-bowie-bei-edgar-froese-im-bayerischen-viertel-wohnte/9919802.html|title=Als David Bowie bei Edgar Froese im Bayerischen Viertel wohnte|last=Hugues|first=Pascale|date=2017-01-08|work=Der Tagesspiegel Online|access-date=2018-09-20|language=de-DE|issn=1865-2263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History Extra"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/20th-century/bowies-berlin-the-city-that-shaped-a-1970s-masterpiece/|title=Bowie's Berlin: the city that shaped a 1970s masterpiece|work=History Extra|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the months of his recovery, he had also become interested in [[Brian Eno]]'s [[minimalist]] album ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (1975).

==History==

===1976–77: ''Low''===
{{Main|Low (David Bowie album)}}
[[File:H910 Harmonizer.jpg|thumb|right|At the forefront of ''Low''{{'}}s sound was Visconti's recent acquisition: an [[Eventide H910 Harmonizer]]. When Bowie asked what it did, he replied: "it fucks with the fabric of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quantick|first1=David|title=David Bowie: 1977, back from the abyss and changing music forever...|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2012-06-20/david-bowie-1977-back-from-the-abyss-and-changing-music-forever|website=[[Team Rock]]|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977) was recorded as Bowie grappled with difficult personal issues, including a troubled marriage and drug dependence: "There's oodles of pain in the ''Low'' album. That was my first attempt to kick cocaine, so that was an awful lot of pain. And I moved to Berlin to do it. I moved out of the coke centre of the world [''i.e.'', Los Angeles] into the [[heroin|smack]] centre of the world. Thankfully, I didn't have a feeling for smack, so it wasn't a threat".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Cohen. "David Bowie", ''Details'' magazine, September 1991: p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Visconti contended that the title was partly a reference to Bowie's "low" moods during the album's writing and recording.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/low.html BowieGoldenYears].

''Low'': pp. 113–118&lt;/ref&gt; Partly influenced by the [[Krautrock]] sound of [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Neu!]], ''Low'' evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=91–92}}{{sfn|Pegg|2004}} &lt;ref name="History Extra"/&gt;

''Low'' and ''The Idiot'' were mostly recorded in France, and of Bowie's trilogy only ''Low'' and ''"Heroes"'' were recorded at [[Hansa Studios]] in Berlin, nicknamed "Hansa by the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]]" for its proximity to the imposing structure that divided [[West Berlin|West]] from [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref name="UCR"/&gt; Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it.&lt;ref name="Ruether 82–85"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruether|first=Tobias|url=http://032c.com/2006/the-man-who-came-from-hell/|title=The Man Who Came from Hell|work=[[032c]]|date=Winter 2006–2007|pages=82–85|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received considerable negative criticism upon its release—a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's ex-manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings, ''Low'' yielded the UK number three single "[[Sound and Vision]]", and its own performance surpassed that of ''Station to Station'' in the UK chart, where it reached number two.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Echoing ''Low''{{'}}s minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, ''[["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]'' (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by frequent Eno collaborator and [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]]. Like ''Low'', ''"Heroes"'' evinced the [[zeitgeist]] of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin.{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=90–92}} Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and [[koto (instrument)|koto]], the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its [["Heroes" (song)|title track]], though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=181–82}} Referencing the burgeoning [[new wave]] music scene, [[RCA Records]] marketed ''"Heroes"'' with the slogan "There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=91–92}}

After releasing ''"Heroes"'' in 1977, Bowie spent much of 1978 on the [[Isolar II – The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II world tour]], bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage.&amp;nbsp;... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=293}} Recordings from the tour made up the live album ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]'', released the same year.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=189}}

===1979: ''Lodger''===
{{Main||Lodger (album)}}
It was around the time of ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) that Bowie began framing his previous two albums as the beginning of a Berlin-centered trilogy concluding with ''Lodger'', largely as a marketing technique to support the unusual new album.&lt;ref name="Q"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Ben|title=30-Years On: David Bowie's ''Lodger'' Comes In grom the Cold|date=January 11, 2016|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03161-30-years-on-david-bowie-s-lodger-comes-in-from-the-cold|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lodger'', the final piece in what Bowie called his "[[triptych]]", eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. Recorded in Switzerland and New York, the result was a mixture of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[world music]], in places incorporating [[Phrygian dominant scale|Hijaz]] [[Musical scale#Non-Western scales|non-Western scales]]. Some tracks were composed using Eno and [[Peter Schmidt (artist)|Peter Schmidt]]'s [[Oblique Strategies]] cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from Bowie's early composition "[[All the Young Dudes]]" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=102–107}} The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, "It would be fair to call it Bowie's ''Sergeant Pepper''&amp;nbsp;... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology."

''Lodger'' initially received mixed reviews, and as described by biographer Christopher Sandford, "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno." ''Lodger'' reached number 4 in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles "[[Boys Keep Swinging]]" (number 7 in the UK) and 
"[[DJ (David Bowie song)|DJ]]".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=281}}{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=191–92}} Towards the end of the year, Bowie and his wife Angela initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Sandford (1997): p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1980s, Bowie would decamp to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="UCR"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14570">The '''Brilyantes''' are fictional gemstones in the Filipino fantasy television series ''[[Encantadia]]'' as well as its [[Encantadia (2016 TV series)|2016 requel]]. They are the elemental gems that holds the balance in Encantadia. Each gem manifests the [[classical elements]]: aether, fire, air, water, and earth. The tranquility and future of Encantadia rests on these gemstones.
In both series, each Brilyante are being carefully kept by  each kingdom in Encantadia. The kingdom of fairies, Lireo, in the east of Encantadia, is the keeper of ''Brilyante ng Hangin'' (Gemstone of Air). Adamya, the kingdom of elves in the south is the keeper of ''Brilyante ng Tubig'' (Gemstone of Water). Sapiro, the northern kingdom of valiant warriors and healers, kept the ''Brilyante ng Lupa'' (Gemstone of Earth). Hathoria, the kingdom of proud and violent blacksmiths and orcs in the west, is the keeper the ''Brilyante ng Apoy'' (Gemstone of Fire). But after the Hathoria attempted to seize the all the gemstones, they are turned-over to Queen Mine-a of Lireo for safekeeping. Later, the four daughters of Queen Mine-a became the keeper of these gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/196358/4-protectors-of-encantadias-gems-revealed|title=4 protectors of Encantadia’s gems revealed|first=Allan|last=Policarpio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/gma/encantadia|title=Encantadia - GMA Network|first=GMA New Media,|last=Inc.|website=www.gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005–2006 series==

===History===
The four ''brilyante'' first appeared in ''Encantadia'', but the history of the gemstones appeared on its prequel, ''Etheria''. The history of the four elemental gems date back to the First Great War in Encantadia with the fall of the Etherian Empire.

====''Etheria'' and the First Great War====

The four ''brilyantes'' were initially created as a single gem that the deity Emre, the highest god in Encantadia, bequethed to the leaders of each kingdom in Encantadia; it was called as the ''Brilyante ng mga Elemento'' (Gem of the Elements): King Bartimus of Hathoria, King Meno of Sapiro, Queen Cassiopeia of Lireo and Elder Aegen of Adamya, used it to aid them in their struggle against the abusive empire of Etheria (followers of the fallen snake deity, Ether) under the rule of Queen Avria. The gem contains the four elements that will keep the balance in Encantadia. After the fall of Etheria, the jewel was entrusted to the most stable nation at the time, Sapiro.
Fearful that the gem's power will corrupt Sapiro, Cassiopeia, the first Queen of Lireo, made the fateful decision and used the Kabilan Sword (the sword once belong to Etheria) to break the gem into four fragments that embodies the four elements it contain: water, fire, wind and earth. Because of this act, the four kingdoms of Encantadia lost their alliance with each other and Cassiopeia was cursed by Bathalang Emre and banished from Lireo. The four gem fragments were vested upon the four kingdoms. Sapiro was given the ''Brilyante ng Lupa'', Hathoria was given the ''Brilyante ng Apoy'', Lireo was given the ''Brilyante ng Hangin'', and Adamya was given the ''Brilyante ng Tubig''.

====''Encantadia'' (2005)====
King Arvak of Hathoria, resentul of Cassiopeia's decision and deeply concerned by Hathoria's lack of apparent natural resources, launched a campaign of conquest throughout Encantadia, aided by his son and heir Hagorn. They successfully conquered Adamya and acquired the Brilyante ng Tubig, but were stopped cold when the Sapirians came to Adamya's rescue. Though successful in slaying King Armeo and acquiring the Brilyante ng Lupa, King Arvak died at the hands of Prince Raquim, and he then took the three gems.
To ensure its protection, Prince Raquim of Sapiro traveled to Lireo and took the three gems to the queen of the Diwatas (Fairies), Queen Mine-a's custody and guardianship of all four elemental jewels, assured that the powerful Lirean throne would never let the brilyante fall into Hathorian hands.
The ''brilyantes'' remained safe in Lireo until Sang'gre Pirena, the first-born of Mine-a, stole the ''Brilyante ng Apoy'' to aid her in defeating Mine-a during the challenge for the throne. Failing in her attempt and bitter of Minea's imagined favoritism, Pirena fled to Hathoria, carrying with her the Brilyante ng Apoy as bargaining chip with now King Hagorn. To protect the three remaining ''brilyantes'', Mine-a entrusted them to her three remaining children, Amihan (''Brilyante ng Hangin''), Alena (''Brilyante ng Tubig'') and Danaya (''Brilyante ng Lupa'').

==2016 series==
Like in the original series, the four gemstones were used to be a single gem called ''Inang Brilyante'' (Mother Gem). It was a glowing egg shaped diamond. It has all the powers of nature and is the only item in Encantadia that can fight the powers of a deity. The ''Inang Brilyante'' is protected by Cassiopeia in her island. Adhara, an evil ''diwata'', attempted to seize the ''Inang Brilyante'' for her personal ambitions, but she failed when Cassiopeia used the gem against her and destroyed her airship armada and sea fleet. To protect the ''Inang Brilyante'', Cassiopeia shattered it into the four elemental gems using the Kabilan, a god-sword previously owned by Queen Avria of the fallen Etherian empire. She gave each piece to Adamya, Hathoria, Sapiro and Lireo's respective rulers to prevent Adhara from acquiring them and to help ensure an era of peace in the land. However, Bathalang Emre did not like what Cassiopeia did so he cursed her with immortality and to serve as a seer. He also banished her from her kingdom, Lireo, and cannot set foot on her kingdom until the "Inang Brilyante" is whole again. 

After Pirena stole the ''Brilyante ng Apoy'' , Mine-a entrusted the three other ‘’brilyantes’’  to her other daughters, Amihan (''Brilyante ng Hangin''), Alena (''Brilyante ng Tubig'') and Danaya (''Brilyante ng Lupa'').
It was later revealed that there was a fifth gem, a diamond shaped clear quartz that was thrown to an island during the explosion when Cassiopeia cleaved the Mother Gem. It was later known as the "Brilyante ng Diwa" or the Soul Gem. It was discovered by a mortal child named Paopao that was abducted into Encantadia to become a slave. He became the first keeper of the said gem. 

All brilyantes float and are all sentient meaning they all understand and have a connection with their current and sometimes former keepers. If the brilyante is not transferred to another keeper properly by its current dying wielder and was taken to the afterlife, the element is represents will slowly wither and disappear until it is retrieved from the afterlife. It can never be stolen and must be given willfully. The brilyantes can be "stolen" if the brilyante choses to go with its new keeper. All brilyantes can create a copy of itself with a fraction of the powers of the original.

The shapes of the ''brilyantes'' in the 2016 series changed from their shape in 2005 series. The ''Brilyante ng Apoy'' from diamond-shaped became a tear-shaped ruby, the ''Brilyante ng Hangin'' from being circular became sapphire shaped like a tornado, the ''Brilyante ng Tubig'' from being lens-shaped became a circular shaped emerald inspired by water ripples, and the ''Brilyante ng Lupa'' from being rectangular became an oval-shaped golden topaz. Another difference from the 2005 series is the presence of respective magic circles for each of the gems to show that the gem has accepted the current wielder as its keeper.

===The ''Brilyantes'' in the 2016 version===

The term '''Byzantine commonwealth''' was coined by 20th-century historians to refer to the area where Byzantine general influence ([[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine liturgical]] and [[Byzantine art|cultural tradition]]) was spread during the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine statehood]] and missionaries. This area covers approximately the modern-day countries of [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Republic of Macedonia|R. Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], southwestern [[Russia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (known as the region of ''[[Eastern Orthodoxy in Europe]]'').

== The Obolensky model ==
The most important treatment of the concept is a study by [[Dimitri Obolensky]], ''The Byzantine Commonwealth''.&lt;ref&gt;Obolensky, Dimitri, ''The Byzantine Commonwealth: Eastern Europe, 500-1453''.  (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Six Byzantine Portraits'' he examined life and works of six persons mentioned in ''The Byzantine Commonwealth''.&lt;ref&gt;Obolensky, Dimitri, ''Six Byzantine Portraits''.  (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the commonwealth as the international community within the sphere of authority of the Byzantine emperor, bound by the same profession of [[Eastern Christianity]], and accepted the principles of the Romano-Byzantine law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Athonite Commonwealth: The Spiritual and Cultural Diaspora of Mount Athos|last=Speake|first=Graham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=9781108425865|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are scholars, however, who criticize this conceptualization, disputing the notion of an unchallenged superiority of the Byzantine empire. It is argued that the complex and multi-faceted dynamics of documented cultural exchange was not aligned with the theory that Constantinople was the superior core while those in periphery understood their marginal position and merely imitated their superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imagining the Byzantine Past: The Perception of History in the Illustrated Manuscripts of Skylitzes and Manasses|last=Boeck|first=Elena|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781107085817|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of Byzantine Commonwealth, historian Christian Raffensperger, proposed that it be recast as the "Byzantine ideal". Here, the empire maintains its belief in the traditional hierarchy and the imperial authority while its reach and sway were already considerably diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Byzantine Art and Diplomacy in an Age of Decline|last=Hilsdale|first=Cecily|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107033306|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 85th FIDE Congress held during the [[41st Chess Olympiad]], FIDE received bids to host the World Cup 2017 and [[43rd Chess Olympiad|2018 Olympiad]] from the national federations of Georgia and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fide.com/fide/minutes/8372-85th-fide-congress-general-assembly-minutes-and-annexes.html |title=85th FIDE Congress: General Assembly Minutes and Annexes |date=27 October 2014 |publisher=FIDE |access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa proposed [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] and [[Durban]] as venues, while Georgia proposed [[Tbilisi]] and [[Batumi]] respectively.&lt;ref name="fc_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frbe-kbsb.be/sites/manager/Pub/2014%20General%20Assembly%20Minutes.pdf | title=FIDE Congress Tromso, Norway General Assembly 11- 14 August 2014 | accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Garry Kasparov]] expressed support for the South African bid during his [[41st Chess Olympiad#FIDE presidential election|FIDE presidential campaign]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kasparov2014.com/2014/06/08/kasparov-replies-who-will-you-support/ |title=Kasparov Replies: "Whom Will You Support?" |date=8 June 2014 |access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia's bid won, receiving 93 votes to South Africa's 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chess-news.ru/en/node/16418 |title=Batumi to Host Olympiad-2018 |date=14 August 2014 |publisher=Chess-News.ru |access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The tournament is a knock-out, with the exception that there was a provision for the two semi-final losers to play off for third place if necessary (see [[#Candidates qualification]]).

Matches consist of two regular time limit games (except for the final, and playoff for third if required, which consist of four regular time limit games). For these two games, players have 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an [[Glossary of chess#Increment|increment]] of 30 seconds per move from the start of the game.

If a match is tied after the regular games, tie breaks will be played the next day. The format for the tie breaks is as follows:
* Two [[Fast chess|rapid]] games (25 minutes plus 10 seconds [[Glossary of chess#Increment|increment]]).
* If the score is tied after two [[Rapid chess|rapid]] games, further two rapid games (10 minutes plus 10 seconds increment) are played.
* If the score is tied after four rapid games, the opponents play two [[Fast chess|blitz]] games (five minutes plus three seconds increment).
* If the score is tied after a pair of blitz games, an [[Armageddon (chess)|armageddon]] game (in which a draw counts as a win for Black) is played. White has 5 minutes and Black has 4 minutes, with an increment of 3 seconds/move starting from move 61.

==Candidates qualification==

The tournament qualified two players for the [[World Chess Championship 2018#Candidates Tournament|2018 Candidates Tournament]].

However [[Magnus Carlsen]] (world champion) and [[Sergey Karjakin]] (already seeded to the Candidates) had no need for qualification, and both participated in the tournament (even though it is highly unusual for the defending champion to do so). So the rules were actually that the top two finishers other than Carlsen and Karjakin would qualify for the Candidates. This meant there was provision for a match for third place, between the two semi-final losers, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMJQ4r_N-J4 Video of players' meeting], [[Chessbase]] India, [[YouTube]], September 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

As it turned out, both Carlsen and Karjakin were eliminated in the first three rounds, so the two Candidates qualifiers were simply the two finalists: Armenia's [[Levon Aronian]] and China's [[Ding Liren]].

==Schedule==

Each of the first six rounds takes three days: one day each for the two regular time limit games, then a third day for tie breaks, if required. The final round has four days of regular time limit games, then a fifth day for tie breaks, if required.
* Round 1: September 3–5
* Round 2: September 6–8
* Round 3: September 9–11
* Round 4: September 12–14
* Round 5: September 15–17
* Rest day: September 18
* Round 6: September 19–21
* Rest day: September 22
* Final (and play-off for third place if required): September 23–27

All rounds begin at 15:00 [[Time in Georgia (country)|local time]] (11:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).

==Dress code controversy==

Shortly before the third-round game between [[Anton Kovalyov]] and [[Maxim Rodshtein]] was due to start, Kovalyov was questioned by the arbiter about the knee-length [[Bermuda shorts]] he was wearing, the same pair he wore in the first two rounds. Tournament organizer [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] then approached Kovalyov, stating that his attire violated the FIDE dress code and that he would be punished financially if he did not change what he was wearing.&lt;ref name=chess.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=thestar&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/09/11/chess-federation-fuming-over-treatment-of-canadian-grandmaster-who-was-berated-over-wearing-shorts-at-tournament.html "Chess federation fuming over treatment of Canadian grandmaster who was berated over wearing shorts at tournament"]. ''[[TheStar.com]]''. 2017-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Kovalyov explained that he also wore shorts in the 2015 World Cup without incident, but Azmaiparashvili objected and said that Kovalyov's clothing made him "look like a [[gipsy (term)|gypsy]]."&lt;ref name=chess.com&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/view/dress-code-incident-at-world-cup-kovalyov-forfeits "Dress Code Incident At World Cup: Kovalyov Forfeits"]. ''Chess.com''. 2017-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Kovalyov interpreted this as a racial slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.chessbase.com/post/the-shorts-episode-at-the-world-cup |title=The shorts episode at the FIDE World Cup 2017 |last=Shah |first=Sagar |date=2017-09-09|website=Chess News|publisher=ChessBase}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovalyov then left the tournament hall and did not return, thus forfeiting the game. He also checked out of his hotel and booked a flight for [[Dallas]], where he is studying for a [[master's degree]] in Computer Science technology at the [[University of Texas at Dallas|University of Texas]].&lt;ref name=chess.com/&gt; The [[Chess Federation of Canada]] filed a formal complaint about the incident.&lt;ref name=thestar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/10413-letter-from-chess-federation-of-canada.html "Letter from Chess Federation of Canada"].

==Notes==
&lt;references group=note&gt;
&lt;ref name=uschess&gt;In the 2017 US Zonal, which normally awards five spots for the World Cup, only three players, other than those who already qualified with the previous criteria, attained the required score of 50% or better. In accordance with the World Cup regulations, the two unused positions at the US Zonal Championship passed on to the American Continental Championship.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=tan&gt;The Women's World Champion, [[Tan Zhongyi]], renounced her participation and, in accordance with the regulations, she was replaced from the average rating list.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group=note name=Zherebukh&gt;[[Yaroslav Zherebukh|Zherebukh]] did not travel to the event because he was concerned that he would not be re-admitted to the USA afterwards.

'''Civic technology''', or '''civic tech''' for short, is technology that enables engagement, participation or enhances the relationship between the people and government by enhancing citizen communications and public decision, improving government delivery of service, and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civic Tech: Entrepreneurship Opportunities|url=http://codeforamerica.org/startups/civic-entrepreneurship-2014/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140727043407/http://codeforamerica.org/startups/civic-entrepreneurship-2014/|archivedate=2014-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nick Bilton: New York Times: Changing Government and Tech With Geeks|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/changing-government-and-tech-with-geeks/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=But What Is "Civic"?|url=http://civichall.org/civicist/what-is-civic/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses mainly [[information technology]] and includes [[civic application]]s, platforms supporting government bodies, institutions and other software that enables those goals. Civic technology has had increasing promise and importance with time. In the [[Information Age]], digital communications have become the foundation for political and economic exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandarano|first=Lynn|year=2011|title=Building Social Capital in the Digital Age of Civic Engagement|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lynn_Mandarano/publication/256548552_Building_Social_Capital_in_the_Digital_Age_of_Civic_Engagement/links/55fc10c908aeba1d9f3aaf1e.pdf|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As advanced technologies have become commonplace in society and available throughout the population, many local governments and officials have begun utilizing them for public outreach and feedback. Specifically, the [[Internet]] is being used more for communication between governing officials and citizens.

==Definition==

There are four different types of e-government services and civic technology falls within the category of government-to-citizen (or G2C), the other categories include government-to-business (G2B), government-to-government (G2G), and government-to-employees (G2E).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 

A 2013 report from the [[Knight Foundation]], an American non-profit, attempts to map different focuses within the civic technology space.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It broadly categorizes civic technology projects into two categories: open government and community action.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knightfoundation.org/features/civictech/|title=Knight Foundation: Trends in Civic Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Knight Foundation]], they "care about ensuring that people have access to the news and information that they need to lead their lives in a democracy." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/building-better-democracy-civic-tech|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seek to establish a precedent of accessibility to information and the sharing of these sources for the common benefit of the people. With this accessibility, they enable for a more transparent, open system of sharing information for the benefit of more insightful, informed users and citizens that can engage more often in political and social matters that pertain to their concerns and to their lives.

Citizens are also now given access to their representatives through social media. They are able to express their concerns directly to government officials through sites like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. There have even been past cases of online voting being a polling option for local elections, which have seen vastly increased turnouts, such as in an Arizona election in 2000 which saw a turnout double that of the previous election. It is asserted though that civic technology in government provides for a good management technique but lacks in providing fair democratic representation.&lt;ref name="cavanaugh2000"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social media]] is also becoming a growing aspect of government, towards furthering the communication between the government and its citizenry and towards greater transparency within the governmental sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Criado|first=J. Ignacio|last2=Sandoval-Almazan|first2=Rodrigo|last3=Gil-Garcia|first3=J. Ramon|date=2013-10-01|title=Government innovation through social media|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X1300083X|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=30|issue=4|pages=319–326|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2013.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation is facilitating a change towards a more progressive and open government, based on civic engagement and technology for the people. With social media as a communicating platform, it enables the government to provide information to the constituents and citizens on the legislative processes and what is occurring in the [[United States Congress|Congress]], for the sake of the citizens' concerns with the government procedures.

The definition of what constitutes civic technology is contested to a certain extent,&lt;ref name="brookings.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/04/20-civic-technology|title=The future of civic technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially with regards to companies engaged in the [[sharing economy|sharing]] or [[access economy]], such as [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Lyft]], and [[Airbnb]]. For example, AirBnb's ability to provide New York residents with housing during the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy could be considered a form of civic technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airbnb.com/disaster-response|title=Airbnb Disaster Response|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nathaniel Heller, Managing Director of the Research for Development Institute's Governance Program contends that for-profit platforms definitively fall outside of the scope of civic technology: Heller has said that "while citizen-to-citizen sharing is indeed involved, the mission of these companies is focused on maximizing profit for their investors, not any sort of experiment in building social capital."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalintegrity.org/2013/12/the-sharing-economy-is-not-civic-tech/ The Sharing Economy is Not Civic Tech]&lt;/ref&gt; From a goal perspective, civic technology can be understood as “the use of technology for the public good”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2016/04/27/towards-taxonomy-civic-technology/#sm.000001n0mhkt1p4e0ytqgdi7vu1qn|title=Towards a taxonomy of civic technology - Microsoft on the Issues|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=Microsoft on the Issues|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft's Technology &amp; Civic Engagement Team have attempted to produce a precise taxonomy of civic technology through a bottom-up approach.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They inventoried the existing initiatives and classified them according to:
* their functions
* the social processes they involved
* their users and customers
* the degree of change they sought
* the depth of the technology.
Microsoft's Civic Graph is guiding the developing network of civic innovators, expanding "its visualizations of funding, data usage, collaboration and even influence" &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/Microsoft-Civic-Graph-Charts-the-New-World-of-Civic-Tech.html|title=Civic Graph Charts the New World of Civic Tech|website=www.govtech.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a new tool that is opening up the access to track the world of civic technology towards improving the credibility and progress of this sector. This graph will enable more opportunities for access by governmental institutions and corporations to discover these innovators and use them for progressing society towards the future of technology and civic engagement. To create an informed and insightful community, there needs to be a sense of civic engagement in this community, where there is the sharing of information through civic technology platforms and applications.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/civic-technology-needs-community-engagement-order-work|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Community engagement applied to public-interest technology requires that members of a community participate." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With communal participation in civic tech platforms, this enables more informed residents to convene in a more engaged, unified community that seeks to share information, politically and socially, for the benefit of its citizenry and their concerns.This work resulted in a [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzmvVAKOOFdixCs7oz88cz9g1fFPHDlg0AHgHCwhf4A/edit#gid=291660636 field guide].

The Technology &amp; Civic Engagement Team have also produced a network visualization tool for civic technology organizations, [http://civicgraph.io/ Civic Graph].

Technology that is designed to benefit the citizenry places the governments under pressure "to change and innovate the way in which their bureaucracies relate to citizens." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonsón|first=Enrique|last2=Torres|first2=Lourdes|last3=Royo|first3=Sonia|last4=Flores|first4=Francisco|date=2012-04-01|title=Local e-government 2.0: Social media and corporate transparency in municipalities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X1200010X|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123–132|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-government initiatives have been established and supported in order to strengthen the democratic values of governmental institutions, which can include [[Transparency in government|Transparency]], along with improving the efficiency of the legislative processes to make the government more accountable and reactive to citizens' concerns. These will further civic engagement within the political spectrum for the sake of greater [[Direct representation]] and a more democratic political system.

=== Worldwide ===
A worldwide organization for civic tech is the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP). It “is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/|title=Open Government Partnership|website=Open Government Partnership|accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 2011 by eight founding governments (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States), the OGP gathers every year for a summit. Countries involved are located mainly in America (North and South), Europe and South-Asia (Indonesia, Australia, South Korea). Only a few African countries are part of the OGP, though South Africa is one of the founding countries.

Technological progress is rampant throughout the nations of the world, but there are dividing efforts and adoption techniques in how rapid certain countries are progressing compared to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrales|first=Javier|last2=Westhoff|first2=Frank|date=2006-01-01|title=Information Technology Adoption and Political Regimes|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=50|issue=4|pages=911–933|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00431.x|jstor=4092785}}&lt;/ref&gt; How countries are able to use information pertains to how devoted nations are to integrating technology into the lives of their citizens and businesses. Local and national governments are funding tens of billions of dollars towards information technology, for the sake of improving the functions and operations of this technology to work for the people and the governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemontgomery/2015/06/24/why-civic-tech-is-the-next-big-thing/#21ffa203e24b|title=Why Civic Tech Is The Next Big Thing|last=Montgomery|first=Mike|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more governments attaining a grasp on these technologies, it is paving the way towards more progressive and democratic political systems, for the concerns of future society and for those of the citizens of these nations.

The platform allows for communication between citizens and water service providers with the intention to improve service delivery in impoverished areas and user satisfaction. Users are given four options to report their water complaints. They can dial a number and report a complaint, send a text message (SMS) through their cell phone, or login to an online portal through a web browser on their phone or their laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.majivoice.com/?page=Send%20Complaint%20or%20Feedback|title=How it Works - Send Complaint or Feedback|last=|first=|date=|website=www.majivoice.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One evaluation highlights the citizen engagement achieved after its implementation, from 400 complaints a month to 4000 complaints, and resolution rates from 46 percent to 94 percent&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Canadian Digital Service|Canadian Digital Service (CDS)]] was launched in 2017, as part of an attempt to bring better IT to the Canadian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/canadian-digital-service-recruiting-it-brains-prevent-phoenix-1.4445010|title=Canadian Digital Service takes startup approach to building better IT for government|last=Ireton|first=Julie|date=2017-12-14|work=CBC|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://publictechnology.net/articles/features/inside-canadian-digital-service-%E2%80%93-how-transformation-agency-began-life-%E2%80%98-corner|title=Inside the Canadian Digital Service – how the transformation agency began life ‘on the corner of someone’s desk’|last=Trendall|first=Sam|date=2018-08-01|work=PublicTechnology.net|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDS was established within the Treasury Board of Canada the Canadian agency that oversees spending within departments and the operations of the public service.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Scott Brison, the president of the Canadian Treasury Board, launched CDS and was Canada’s first minister of digital government.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Citizen-led initiatives ====

As in other countries, the Canadian civic technology movement is home to several organizations. Code for Canada is a non-profit group, following somewhat the model of [[Code for America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawhney|first1=Gabe|title=It’s time for Code for Canada|url=https://medium.com/code-for-canada/its-time-for-code-for-canada-88ffe2ab2c2a|website=Medium|publisher=Code for Canada|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several cities or regions host civic technology groups with regular meetings (in order from West to East): Edmonton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta City YEG|url=https://betacity.ca|website=Beta City YEG|publisher=Beta City YEG|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo Region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CivicTechWR|url=https://civte.ch|website=CivicTechWR|publisher=CivicTechWR|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civic Tech Toronto|url=http://civictech.ca|website=Civic Tech Toronto|publisher=Civic Tech Toronto|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottawa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottawa Civic Tech|url=http://yowcivictech.ca|website=Ottawa Civic Tech|publisher=Ottawa Civic Tech|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fredericton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.civictechfredericton.com/|title=CIVIC TECH FREDERICTON|website=CIVIC TECH FREDERICTON|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

==== Government-led initiatives ====

The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations sought initiatives to further openness of the government, through either increased use of technology in political institutions or efficient ways to further civic engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Bertot/publication/268424264_Engaging_the_Public_in_Open_Government_Social_Media_Technology_and_Policy_for_Government_Transparency/links/54d49c6b0cf2970e4e635529.pdf|title=Engaging the Public in Open Government: Social Media Technology and Policy for Government Transparency|last=Bertot|first=John Carlo|date=August 12, 2010|website=Researchgate.net |publisher=ResearchGate |access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama administration pursued an [[Open Government Initiative]] based on principles of transparency and civic engagement.&lt;ref name="ejp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UN-DPADM/UNPAN046727.pdf|title=Open data: an international comparison of strategies|last=Huijboom|first=Noor|date=March–April 2011|website=epracticejournal.edu|publisher=European Journal of Practice|access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy has paved the way for increased governmental transparency within other nations to improve democratically for the citizens' benefit and allow for greater participation within politics from a citizen's perspective. During his run for president, Obama was "tied directly to the extensive use of social media by the campaign." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bertot |first=John Carlo|last2=Jaeger|first2=Paul T.|last3=Hansen|first3=Derek|date=2012-01-01|title=The impact of policies on government social media usage: Issues, challenges, and recommendations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X11000992|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=29|issue=1|pages=30–40|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2011.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study conducted by the [[International Data Corporation]] (IDC), an estimated $6.4 billion will be spent on civic technology in 2015 out of approximately $25.5 billion that governments in the United States will spend on external-facing technology projects.&lt;ref name="brookings.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/civic-tech-in-2015-6-9-billion-to-connect-citizens-to-services-and-to-one-another/|title=Civic tech in 2015: $6.4 billion to connect citizens to services, and to one another - TechRepublic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] survey of the civic technology field found that the number of civic technology companies grew by roughly 23% annually between 2008 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/knight-civic-tech.pdf The Emergence of Civic Tech: Investments in a Growing Field]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Citizen-led initiatives ====

Civic technology is built by a variety of companies, organizations and volunteer groups. One prominent example is [[Code for America]], a not-for-profit based in San Francisco, working toward addressing the gap between the government and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.codeforamerica.org/about-us|website=www.codeforamerica.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; College students from [[Harvard University]] created the national non-profit [[Coding it Forward]] that creates data science and technology internships for undergraduate and graduate students in United States federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=https://www.codingitforward.com/about/ |website=Coding it Forward |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a civic technology organization is the Chi Hack Night,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chihacknight.org/|title=Chi Hack Night|website=Chi Hack Night|accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in Chicago. The Chi Hack Night is a weekly, volunteer-run event for building, sharing and learning about civic technology. Civic Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civichall.org/|title=Civic Hall|website=Civic Hall|accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a coworking and event space in New York City for people who want to contribute to civic-minded projects using technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2015/02/09/a-coworking-site-for-civic-tech-in-new-york-city/#59a9e60b6c96|title=A Coworking Site For Civic Tech In New York City|last=Field|first=Anne|website=forbes.com|accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[OpenGov]] creates software designed to enable public agencies to make data-driven decisions, improve budgeting and planning, and inform elected officials and citizens.

OneBusAway, a mobile app that displays real-time transit info, exemplifies the open data use of civic technology. It is maintained by volunteers and has the civic utility of helping people navigate their way through cities. It follows the idea that technology can be a tool for which government can act as a society-equalizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/civic/What-is-Civic-Tech.html|title=What is Civic Tech?|last=Wood|first=Colin|date=16 August 2016|website=govtech.com|publisher=e.Republic|access-date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===

==== Government-led initiatives ====
Within the Mexican president’s office, there is a national digital strategy coordinator who works on Mexico's national digital strategy.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/how-mexico-can-become-latin-americas-digital-government-powerhouse|title=How Mexico can become Latin America’s digital-government powerhouse|last=Cesar|first=Max|last2=Chaia|first2=Alberto|date=2018-11-01|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-15|last3=de Oliveira Vaz|first3=Andre|last4=Garcia-Muñoz|first4=Gonzalo|last5=Haugwitz|first5=Philipp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office has created the gob.mx portal, a website designed for Mexican citizen to engage with their government, as well as a system to share open government data.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; According to [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], in a 2018 survey Mexico had the worst-rated citizen experience (4.4 out of 10) for convenience and accessibility of Mexican government services, of the group of countries surveyed (Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Citizen-led initiatives ====
'''[[Arena Electoral]]''' was an online platform created by Fundación Ethos during the Mexican electoral process of 2012 to promote responsible voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arenaelectoral.com/article/detail/18/|title=Bienvenidos|last=|first=|date=|website=Arena Electoral|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online simulation was created by taking the four presidential candidates in that election cycle and each were given policy issues based on the Mexican national agenda that they had to come up with a solution to. Once each candidate gave their solutions, the platform published it on their website and left it to the Mexican citizens to vote for the best policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vanguardia.com.mx/conestaherramientadescubreconcualcandidatoeresmasafin-1319495.html|title=Con esta herramienta, descubre con cuál candidato eres más afín|last=|first=|date=|work=Vanguardia|access-date=2018-04-19|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partido de la Red ([[Net Party]]) is an Argentinean political party using the DemocracyOS open-source software with the goal of electing representatives who vote according to what citizens decides online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://participedia.net/en/organizations/partido-de-la-red-net-party/|title=Partido de la Red|website=Participedia|accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of civic technology==

===Effects on social behavior and civic engagement===

Because of the conveniences provided by civic technology, there are benefits as well as growing concern about the effects it may have on social behavior and civic engagement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2013/why_we_engage|title=Why We Engage: How Theories of Human Behavior Contribute to Our Understanding of Civic Engagement in a Digital Era|last=Baldwin-Philippi|first=Jesse|last2=Balestra|first2=Martina|date=2013-10-27|website=Berkman Klein Center|publisher=Harvard University|access-date=2018-02-27|last3=Gordon|first3=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; New technology allows for connectivity and new communications, as well as changing how we interact with issues and contexts beyond one's intimate sphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Civic technology affords transparency in government with open-government data, and allows more people of diverse socioeconomic levels to be able to build and engage with civic matters in a way that was not possible prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article199488089.html|title=‘Civic tech’ efforts open up government data for the great public good|last=|first=|date=2018-02-10|work=news and observer|access-date=2018-02-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communication ====
The importance of face-to-face interactions has also been called to question with the increase in e-mails and [[social media]] and a decrease in traditional, in-person social interaction. Technology as a whole may be responsible for this change in social norm, but it also holds potential for turning it around with audio and video communication capabilities. More research needs to be conducted in order to determine if these are appropriate substitutes for in-person interaction, or if any substitute is even feasible.&lt;ref name="cavanaugh2000" /&gt;

Preece &amp; Shneiderman discuss the important social aspect of civic technology with a discussion of the "reader-to-leader framework", which follows that users inform readers, who inform communicators, who then inform collaborators, before finally reaching leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preece|first=Jennifer|year=2009|title=The Reader-to-Leader Framework: Motivating Technology-Mediated Social Participation|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Jennifer2009Reader.pdf|journal=Theory and Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chain of communication allows for the interests of the masses to be communicated to the implementers.

==== Elections ====
Regarding elections and online polling, there is the potential for voters to make less informed decisions because of the ease of voting. Although many more voters will turn out, they may only be doing so because it is easy and may not be consciously making a decision based on their own synthesized opinion. It's suggested that if online voting becomes more common, so should constituent-led discussions regarding the issues or candidates being polled.&lt;ref name="cavanaugh2000" /&gt;

===Effects on socioeconomics===

With advanced technologies coming at higher costs and with an increased reliance on civic technologies may leave low-income families in the dark if they cannot afford the platforms for civic technology, such as [[computers]] and [[tablet computers|tablets]]. This causes an increase in the gap between lower and middle/high [[socioeconomic]] class families.&lt;ref name="cavanaugh2000" /&gt;

Knowledge of how to use computers is equally important when considering factors of accessing civic technology applications online, and is also generally lower in low-income households. [[State school|Public Schools]] have taken the lead in ensuring proper technology access and education in the classroom to better prepare children for the high-tech world, but there is still a clear difference between online contributions from those with and without experience on the internet.&lt;ref name="cavanaugh2000" /&gt;

==Future of civic technology==

As the field of civic technology advances further through the coming years it seems as though apps and handheld devices will become a key focus for development as more companies and municipalities reach out to developers to help with specific issues. Apps are being used in conjunction with hand held devices to make life easier. Tasks such as communication, data tracking, and safety are just a few of the topics app developers and communities have tried to make easier. The cheapest way for citizens to get help and information is through neighbors and others around them. By linking people through apps and websites that harbor conversation and promote civil service cities have found an inexpensive way to provide services to its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/dc/8-Cities-Showcase-Next-Civic-Tech-Apps-Initiatives.html|title=The Future of Civic Tech: 8 Localities Showcase Their Initiatives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2026474_2026675_2039309,00.html|title=Intelligent Cities|first=Amy|last=Feldman|date=21 December 2010|publisher=|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As civic technology is "just a piece of the $25.5 billion that government spends on external information technology (IT)," it is not difficult to see how this sector will grow from here on out towards fostering more innovation in the public and private sectors and towards furthering civic engagement within these sectors and with these platforms of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/04/20/the-future-of-civic-technology/|title=The future of civic technology {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2016-12-07|newspaper=Brookings|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic hacking==
{{stub section|date=June 2016}}
Civic hacking is a technological approach to solving civic problems, often involving the use of government data to make governments more accountable.  Civic hackers can be programmers, designers, data scientists, good communicators, civic organizers, entrepreneurs and government employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://opengovdata.io/2014/civic-hacking/|title=Civic Hacking - Open Government Data: The Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some civic hackers are employed by nonprofits, such as [[Code for America]] and projects such as [[mySociety]] work at the intersection of civic technology and [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref name="WhatWeDo"&gt;{{cite web |title=What We Do |url=http://codeforamerica.org/what-we-do/ |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Civic Hacking Becoming 'Our Pieces, Loosely Joined'?|url=http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22617/civic-hacking-becoming-our-pieces-loosely-joined|publisher=Tech President|date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some work for innovative for-profit companies, such as the geospatial software provider Azavea in Philadelphia. Others are civic hackers only by night.

=== Code for America ===
{{See also|Code for America}}
Code for America is a [[non-partisan]], non-political [[501(c)(3)]] [[organization]] founded in 2009 to address the widening gap between the public and private sectors in their effective use of technology and design. The organization believes that for the U.S. government to truly serve the people in the 21st century, it must do three things:
# Be good at digital. Digital skills must be embedded at all levels of government, and owned by the people responsible for delivering programs and services to the public.
# Ensure policy and implementation work together, and are centered around the needs of the people. Linear processes, moving from policy, to implementation to stasis, must transform into iterative cycles where policy and implementation are informed by each other and are focused on people's needs.
# Be a platform for civic engagement and participation. Government must learn to incorporate productive contributions from the public, so that everyone can help make government work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.codeforamerica.org/how|title=How we do it - Code for America|last=America|first=Code for|newspaper=Code for America|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|MySociety}}
mySociety is an [[e-democracy]] project of the [[UK]]-based [[Charitable organisation|registered charity]] named [[UK Citizens Online Democracy]].&lt;sup&gt;[[MySociety#cite note-ukcod-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It began as a UK-focused organisation with the aim of making online democracy tools for UK citizens.&lt;sup&gt;[[MySociety#cite note-beg-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Princeton Group Hackings ===
Princeton University Professor [[Andrew Appel]] set out to prove how easy it was to hack into a voting machine.  He and a graduate student, [[Alex Halderman]], purchased a voting machine, and Halderman picked the lock in 7 seconds.  They removed the 4 [[ROM cartridge|ROM]] chips and replaced them with modified versions of their own: a version of modified firmware that could throw off the machine's results, subtly altering the tally of votes, never to betray a hint to the voter.  It took less than 7 minutes to complete the process.

Appel wrote a testimony for the Congress House Subcommittee on Information Technology hearing on “Cybersecurity: Ensuring the Integrity of the Ballot Box”, suggesting to for Congress to eliminate touchscreen voting machines after the election of 2016, and that it require all elections be subject to sensible auditing after every election to ensure that the systems are functioning properly and to prove to the American people that their votes are counted as cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-28-Appel-Princeton-Testimony.pdf|title=Andrew Appel Princeton Testimony|last=Appel|first=Andrew|date=September 28, 2016|website=House Subcommittee of Information Technology|publisher=|access-date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Drinking Made Easy''''' is a [[pub crawl|pub-crawl]] television series that premiered in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699208/episodes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and airs on [[AXS TV]] in the [[United States]]. Comedian [[Zane Lamprey]] hosts a humorous bus trip around the United States and [[Canada]], exploring the local drinking culture of various cities in the countries. In each episode, Lamprey samples popular or original cocktails and beers from bars and breweries in the area.

Season two premiered with an hour long episode on October 5, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=drinkingmadeasy|author=Drinking Made Easy|number=108942517013188608|date=31 August 2011|title=It's official! Season two of Drinking Made Easy premiers with a one-hour episode on October 5th. Set your kegerators!}}&lt;/ref&gt; on HDNet.

==Format==
Each episode begins with an overview of the highlights of the episode. Throughout the show Zane and his friend Steve McKenna visit popular bars, breweries, and distilleries where they sample different offerings from the establishments. At bars, Zane is typically behind the bar interviewing the bartender, as well as making cocktails with the help of the bartender. At some point during the episode, McKenna (and sometimes Lamprey) will engage in an eating challenge where he attempts to eat a large portion of a signature dish from a restaurant in the area. Sometimes McKenna is trying to set a record at the restaurant, othertimes he and Zane are racing to finish first or eat the most.

Another segment found only in season one is an interview led by Marc Ryan. He typically visits a brewery or distillery on his own, and tries to learn the history and story of the business, as well as sample what they produce.

Zane and Steve hold a competition in each episode called the "Six Six-Pack Challenge" where Lamprey and McKenna face off in some sort of game and bet each other six six-packs on the outcome. The games are usually inspired by the location of the episode or the bars they visit.

==Cast==

*'''Zane Lamprey''': Host.
*'''Steve McKenna''': Sidekick to Zane Lamprey. He typically accompanies him to all of the bars and breweries, tries the drinks Zane mixes, and participates in the food challenge(season 1 only) and six six-pack challenge.
*'''Marc Ryan''': Correspondent who does his own interviews. Only in season one.
*'''Wes DuBois''': Wears the Pleepleus costume in each episode.

==Drinking game rules==
The show also doubles as a drinking game, introduced after the first commercial break in each episode. The rules are as follows:

#The first person to see Pleepleus in a shot can make someone else drink.
#The first person to notice a continuity error can make someone else drink.
#Whenever Zane and Steve compete during the show, pick a side. If you lose, you drink.
#When Zane burps, the last person to make the "Good Burp" sign (putting your thumb to your forehead) has to drink.
#When Marc touches someone the first person to say "touché" can make someone else drink.

==Eating Challenges (Only in Season 1)==

In each episode Zane challenges Steve to an eating contest. This usually involves Steve trying to finish a restaurant's specialty or Zane racing Steve to eat the most of a certain food. The eating challenges were discontinued after the first season. Zane said the reason for this was because he had always won them, which made it unfair for Steve.

According to the official website of the show, "Due to the re-branding of AXS TV and despite the overwhelming support of the fans, Drinking Made Easy will not be continuing with a 4th season on AXS TV.  While there is still a chance that the show could be picked up by other networks, Zane and the rest of the crew decided to use this opportunity to return to an international format through the new show Chug. Most of the crew of Drinking Made Easy will continue on with the new project and even crew from [[Three Sheets]], like Executive Producer, Mike Kelly, will be joining the team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4502">{{for|the medical term|Entoptic phenomenon}}

In archaeology, the term '''entoptic phenomena''' relates to visual experiences derived from within the eye or brain (as opposed to externally, as in normal vision). In this respect they differ slightly from the medical definition, which defines entoptic phenomena as only applying to sources within the eye, not the brain. To avoid this confusion, the term '''subjective visual phenomena''' is sometimes used. ''Entoptic'' was chosen by author David Lewis Williams due to its origin from [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "coming from within".&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a great deal of work trying to find evidence of motifs and compositions derived from entoptic phenomena in [[prehistoric art]], especially [[rock art]] and [[megalithic art]]. The justification of this research is that entoptic phenomena normally occur during [[Altered state of consciousness|states of altered consciousness]], the practice of which may impact our views of ancient religious and social practice. The importance of looking outside traditional methods of research for interpreting [[prehistoric]] cultures is made more so due to the lack of abundant data which makes current cultural studies viable. "Art and the ability to comprehend it are more dependent on kinds of mental imagery and the ability to manipulate mental images than on intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Lewis-Williams's system==
===Stage 1===
Experiences include [[geometric]] visual patterns such as dots, zagging lines, as well as grid patterns which are all common shapes which are universally understood by the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns and shapes can be seen without aid of [[psychotropic]] substances but under their influence the heightened effects precipitate modes of altered consciousness. Entoptic experiences differ from [[hallucination]]s in that they are a purely visual phenomenon, while hallucinations represent experience of culturally occurring themes as well as physical coming from the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage 2===
Entoptic Phenomena are interpreted in ways that can be understood, matched to objects or ideas that may be familiar in day-to-day life and may also be attributed to the individuals state such as hunger, sexual arousal, or anxiety and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Placing objects in reality from base shapes seen under influence from pscychotropics which link to [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] physical responses lead now to full hallucinations. The relation between the first stage entoptic image and later stage full hallucinations are not mutually exclusive, both may be present.

===Stage 3===
Stage 3 images become iconic, relating to themes from the subjects life and become linked to powerful emotional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphor and simile give way to the belief that objects are exactly what they appear to be "subject losing insight into the differences between literal and analogical meanings"&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt; These stages may not always be sequential, and all stages may not be experienced depending on the subject and of course the type of psychotropic being used.

Williams notes that altered states are and their resulting impact on human [[consciousness]] is often marginalized within state, scientific, and religious realms.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; "The contemporary Western emphasis on the supreme value of intelligence has tended to suppress certain forms of consciousness and to regard them as irrational, marginal,aberrant or even pathological and thereby to eliminate them from investigations of the deep past."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; As with any well rounded approach to cultural or historical study, all aspects of the human condition must be explored, especially when such exploration takes us outside of our usual cultural perspective.

'''Fannie Battle''' (1842-1924) (born '''Mary Frances Battle''') was an American [[social reform|social reformer]] and former [[spy]] for the [[Confederate Army]]. 

==A Spy for the Confederate Army==

Battle was born in 1842 in Cane Ridge near [[Nolensville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fannie Battle  Day  Home Records, ca. 1905 - ca. 1998  (bulk  1905 - 19 72 ) |url=http://findingaids.library.nashville.org/Special_Collections_Division_Finding_Aid_Fannie_Battle.pdf |website=Finding Aids |publisher=Nashville Public Library |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Nashville Female Academy]]. Her three brothers and father enlisted in the [[Confederate Army]] at the start of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Bucy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bucy |first1=Carole Stanford |title=Mary Frances "Fannie" Battle |url=https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/mary-frances-battle/ |website=Tennessee Encyclopedia |publisher=Tennessee Historical Society |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Mike |title=Fannie Battle: Confederate ‘spy’ turned social reformer |url=https://www.murfreesboropost.com/community/fannie-battle-confederate-spy-turned-social-reformer/article_67134df9-af93-564c-947f-0c26e8ff3a54.html |website=The Murfreesboro Post |accessdate=5 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Joel Allen Battle, started a company in Nolensville, called the "Zollicoffer Guards."&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt; It eventually became the [[20th Tennessee Infantry]] and Battle became captain.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; He would eventually serve as a Colonel.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt; He was a prisoner of war and two of Battle's brothers were killed in the [[Battle of Shiloh]].&lt;ref name="Bucy"/&gt; 

Battle joined the Confederacy as a [[spy]] when the [[Union Army]] occupied Nashville in March 1862. She joined alongside her sister-in-law, Harriet Booker. Battle entered Nashville with a fake Federal pass, traveling in and out of the city, gathering information about the Union Army's work in the area and smuggling medicine and other supplies out of the city. On April 7, 1863, Battle and Booker were arrested for smuggling and holding fake Federal passes. They were first detained at the [[Tennessee State Penitentiary]] and then they were moved to [[Camp Chase]] in [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, they were transferred to the [[Old Capitol Prison]] in Washington, D.C., where five other female Confederate spies were held.&lt;ref name="Bucy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; 

Battle and Booker were released on May 13, 1863 in [[City Point, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; Battle returned to Nashville and started teaching at Howard School. She taught math, geography and spelling throughout Nashville until 1886.&lt;ref name="Bucy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

==Social reformer==

In December 1881, the [[Cumberland River]] flooded. Battle met with Nashville leadership and organized the Nashville Relief Society to help poor flood victims living in flood zones near the river. Over 1,000 people were provided clothing, food and coal. As a result, Battle worked with other local leaders to create United Charities. The organization struggled to secure funding to hire an executive director. Therefore, Battle quit her job teaching in 1886 and served as the nonprofit's secretary-general, a position she would hold until her death in 1924.&lt;ref name="Bucy"/&gt; 

During her work with United Charities, Battle created a [[daycare]] program for the children of working parents. She rented a room in a neighborhood in North Nashville, located near [[cotton mills]] that employed women mill workers. Physicians and other professionals provided pro bono services to the growing number of children in the program. Eventually, the program was named the Addison Avenue Day Home, the first daycare in Nashville. Today, it is named the Fannie Battle Day Home for Children.&lt;ref name="Bucy"/&gt; 

In 1900, Battle created a [[summer camp]] for low-income mothers and their children. Located in [[Craggie Hope, Tennessee|Craggie Hope]], it was named the Fresh Air Camp.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt; 

Sixteen years later, Battle created a fundraising campaign for the Day Home, during which [[carolers]] would perform during the [[Christmas]] holiday.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Battle died in September 1924.&lt;ref name="Bucy"/&gt; Memorial services were held at [[McKendree United Methodist Church]]. She was buried at [[Mt. Olivet Cemetery (Nashville)|Mt. Olivet Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt; 

After Battle's death, the Addison Avenue Day Home was renamed the Fannie Battle Day Home for Children. In 1947, Battle's service in the Confederate Army was memorialized with a plaque at the [[Confederate Museum]]. The archives of Battle, and a portrait of her, are held in the [[Nashville Public Library]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}
The '''feminization of the workplace''' is a set of social theories that seek to explain occupational sex segregation.

== Abstract ==
{{Confusing section|reason=|date=October 2018}}
Feminization of the work industry is the pressure created from the [[cultural turn]] where the issues of fairness, opportunity and redistribution in society overcome economic [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] and find more balance to combat income inequality, social exclusion and cultural imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones III &amp; Smith &amp; Pain &amp; Marston 2010, p.54-78&lt;/ref&gt; The issues of sexual differences, gender roles and employment and services inequalities are questioned, abandoned and demolished.&lt;ref name=peake2009&gt;Peake 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Feminization of the workplace links to the [[Marxist]] approach where everyone has the ability to sell their labor power to own the means of production. This approach allows women to work in jobs with flexible and family-friendly working hours because of their childcare responsibilities.&lt;ref name=PrattHanson&gt;Pratt and Hanson 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminization in the workplace destabilized the [[occupational segregation]] in society.&lt;ref name=peake2009/&gt;

:"Throughout the 1990s the cultural turn in geography, entwined with the post-structuralist concept of difference, led to the discarding of the notion of a coherent, bounded, autonomous and independent identity... that was capable of self-determination and progress, in favor of a socially constructed category defined by the constitutive outside. The earlier distinction between gender as socially created, resting upon the biological distinction of sex, was abandoned, creating room for research that highlighted how gendered subjectivities, far from being based on a stable content, were produced, performed, destabilized and redrawn in complex ways, drawing meaning from routine interactions with others in specific historical and geographical contexts" (Peake 2009).

Women are tackling any forms of profession and feminizing labor forces that were restricted and dominated by men. From exporting personal labor, entering the labor market, challenging the field of science and engineering, and participating in sports environment, the power and role of women in the society have dramatically changed.

== Categories of Feminization ==

=== Feminization of survival ===
Feminization of survival is a term that feminists use to describe a social condition where women are forced into inhumane conditions for the survival of themselves and their families. 

In 1888, the government of [[Canada]] decided to invite skilled Chinese men to work in [[The Gold Rush]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to reduce the cost of labor wages and to make these projects affordable. They were motivated by desires to leave China and to earn higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;Hui 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although these immigrants were earning a higher compensation in Canada compared to China, they experienced exclusion and [[occupational inequality]]. Even though the issue of racial exclusion is currently desensitized, there are workers who encounter violence and abuse in their working environment and a majority of them are women.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett &amp; Schmidt 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Exporting labor to developed countries is still booming since it creates economic growth and diversity. The globalization of labor eases the government debts and unemployment rates of developing countries. Women, especially in Southeast Asian countries, are attracted to this money making opportunity.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;Rodriguez 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The mostly poor and low-wage women were often considered burdens rather than resources, but now an increasing number of women are earning a profit and securing government revenues.&lt;ref name="Sassen"&gt;Sassen 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Several developing countries in Southeast Asia, especially the Philippines, have seen the emergence of exporting labor to developed countries due to high foreign debt and unemployment.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez" /&gt; Filipino women working overseas in the United States of America have sent home almost $8 billion a year in 2003 and most of these women tackle the fields of health care, domestic service and child care.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez" /&gt; [[Filipina]] Overseas workers have earned the title of "migrant heroism" for sacrificing themselves away from the family and to normalize migration remittance-sending to their motherland. Not only do these women hold a higher responsibility in their family and country, but they are faced with [[racialization]], violence and abuse.&lt;ref name="Sassen" /&gt;{{rp|503}}

=== Feminization of the labor market ===
In the new era, women restricted the 'spatial reach' of their job searches due to childcare responsibilities.&lt;ref name="PrattHanson" /&gt; The open employment for middle class women catalyzes the growing use of domestic workers for household cleaning and childcare. There has been a complexity in the modern economics with women's responsibility at home and at work.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural theories maintain that lower wages in female-dominated occupations are the product of societal bias against the work typically carried out by women and that the sex-composition of occupations affects wages directly. In contrast, recent human capital theories maintain that the wage-penalties associated with working in female-dominated occupations result from different requirements in specialized training and that the effect is indirect.&lt;ref&gt;Perales 2010 p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminist scholars insist that sexual difference is the primary reason for differences between both sexes in the labor market outcomes.&lt;ref name="Hakim"&gt;Hakim 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Women face discrimination in the workplace, such as the “[[glass ceiling]],” female participation in the labor market has increased markedly during the past 20 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bertrand |first=Marianne |last2=Black |first2=Sandra E. |last3=Jensen |first3=Sissel |last4=Lleras-Muney |first4=Adriana |date=June 2014 |title=Breaking the Glass Ceiling? The Effect of Board Quotas on Female Labor Market Outcomes in Norway |work=NBER Working Paper No. 20256 |doi=10.3386/w20256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with the increased participation in the labor force and the high levels of commitment women give to their workplace, women’s work is still undervalued.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15174418|title=Female power|date=2009-12-30|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-15|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many times a woman’s work schedule is structured in such a way that it conflicts with her care giving responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The women who are also union members at work feel “side-lined” and “downgraded” about the workplace issues they face that are apart from the union’s agenda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Furthermore, high levels of unionization strongly correlates with a lower wage gap as well as lower gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Rae|last2=Parker|first2=Jane|date=2012-04-01|title=Women, Work and Collectivism |journal=Journal of Industrial Relations|language=en|volume=54|issue=2|pages=107–113|doi=10.1177/0022185612437844|issn=0022-1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One way in which people have tried to help working women is through legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdzECvH5h7YC&amp;pg=PA55 |title=The SAGE Handbook of Social Geographies|last=Smith|first=Susan|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412935593|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2003, Norway passed a law that advocated for 40% of representation of gender public board companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The main objective for this was to increase the representation  of women in top positions in the top sector and decrease gender disparity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The result, however, had very little impact on women in business, especially those who made it into corporate sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite these setbacks, women have been performing their jobs well.  Women make up almost half, 40.9%, of the American workforce, and they are CEOs of some of the best companies such as PepsiCo, Archer Daniels Midland, and W.L. Gore.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Women also earn almost 60% of the university degrees from America and Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They make up the majority of the professional workers in many countries, for example, 51% in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Even with this high percentage,  women’s earnings are far less than what men are paid on average. They are also intensely under-represented at the top of their organizations.  Surprisingly, feminization of the workplace has been driven by the relentless drive of the service sector and the equal decline of manufacturing.  More women than ever before are willing to work outside their homes. Even after having children, 74% of women in the workforce managed to return to work, and 40% returned to their full-time jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Feminization of science and technology===
According to the [[American Association of University Women]], young boys' and girls' capabilities and interests in science, mathematics and engineering are equally well; however, most girls begin to lose their interest in their high school years because of the gender gap science and engineering is perceived.&lt;ref name=HansonKraus&gt;Hanson and Kraus 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}} As a result, women are underrepresented in science-related occupations due to the gendered interactions early in life.&lt;ref name=Hanson2007&gt;Hanson (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Researches claim that the segregation of men and women into different occupations is the principal reason for earnings differences between men and women.&lt;ref name=Hakim/&gt; They argue that occupational segregation restricts people's choice of career.&lt;ref name=Hakim/&gt; Researchers also observed both gender's general behaviors that can represent preferred profession and they found the boys are encouraged (and assumed) to be outgoing, analytic, and aggressive, while girls are encouraged (and assumed) to be passive, dependent, and nurturing.&lt;ref name=Hanson2007/&gt;

In the last quarter century, increasing involvement of women and minorities has prevented a severe shortage of science and engineering workers; but if current rates of gender and ethnic participation in these bachelor's degree programs do not change, the number of qualified workers will soon be inadequate to meet the science, technology, and engineering needs of our society.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, Colbeck and Terezini (2001) p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an under-representation of women in the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beede|first=David|last2=Julian|first2=Tiffany|last3=Langdon|first3=David|last4=McKittrick|first4=George|last5=Khan|first5=Beethika|last6=Doms|first6=Mark|date=2011-08-01|title=Women in STEM: A Gender Gap to Innovation|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1964782|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study done by the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]], in the United States women account for approximately twenty-four percent of the STEM workforce, while making up forty-eight percent of the overall workforce.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are a variety of factors that contribute to this discrepancy such as lack of female role models, gender stereotyping and sexism in hiring.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roots of under-representation being in grade school, where girls fall behind boys in math because they are lead to believe they are not as smart as boys, and therefore incapable of being good at math.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other influences include teachers, family, culture, stereotypes and role models throughout school.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Shulamit|date=June 2017|title=Women and STEM|doi=10.3386/w23525 |work=NBER Working Paper No. 23525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are earning the same number of bachelor degrees as men, but only account for thirty percent of STEM degrees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women who earn these degrees are more likely to go into healthcare or education rather than STEM professions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The wage gap with in STEM jobs is smaller than in non-STEM jobs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women earn thirty-five percent more than females in non-stem careers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They also earn more than men with non-STEM jobs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Female engineering majors match their male counterparts in number who go into the engineering occupation, but physical and life sciences majors turned toward a broader range of careers outside STEM.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Wendy M.|last2=Ceci|first2=Stephen J.|date=2015-04-28|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360–5365|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|issn=0027-8424|pmid=25870272|pmc=4418903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these career fields there is a pattern of sexist hiring that leads to less women being hired in these fields.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The lack of women in these fields create a cold work environment, which causes women to quit.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the life sciences, women are earning more doctorates than men, but only one third are hired as associate professors after completing their PhD, but once hired they are more likely to prosper in the STEM profession.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women who have a family are more likely to switch to a non-STEM major or work fewer hours than men in the same fields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Feminization of sports===
In the [[United States]], women were seen as 'ill-equipped' to participate in [[sports]], and their involvement was viewed as unfeminine and undesirable.&lt;ref name=Hanson2007/&gt;{{rp|155}} The reasons why women experience less academic advantage from sports than do men focus on the clash between the expectations for women, athletes and the stigma for female athletes who are seen to be unfeminine.&lt;ref name=HansonKraus/&gt;

Today, women represent forty-one percent of high school athletes and thirty-seven percent of college athletes. Increasing numbers of women are participating in sport at the professional level as well. The passage of [[Title IX]] sparked the increase in women participating in sports throughout high school and college in the United States. Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments prohibits discrimination based on gender to any educational program receiving federal funding. Since the passage of Title IX, women in collegiate sports has increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Betsey|date=2007-10-01|title=Title Ix and the Evolution of High School Sports |journal=Contemporary Economic Policy|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=486–505|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00080.x|issn=1465-7287}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 the number of women participating in collegiate sports was 74,329 and by 2001 that number increased to 150,916. In addition women have increased from only making up about twenty-five percent of the student athlete population to forty-two percent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whisenant|first=Warren A.|date=2003-08-01|title=How Women Have Fared as Interscholastic Athletic Administrators Since the Passage of Title IX |journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=49|issue=3–4|pages=179–184|doi=10.1023/A:1024417115698|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1972 and the passage of Title IX, women were, for the most part, absent from sports in high school. In 1972 only one in twenty seven women participated in high school sports, but by 1998 that statistic became one in three.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopiano|first=Donna A.|date=2000-04-01|title=MODERN HISTORY OF WOMEN IN SPORTS: Twenty-five Years of Title IX |journal=Clinics in Sports Medicine|volume=19|issue=2|pages=163–173|doi=10.1016/S0278-5919(05)70196-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the passage of Title IX the number of girls participating in athletics rose from 294,015 to 817,073. After only six years that number increased even more to over two million girls getting involved in high school sports. Prior to 1972 girls only made up seven percent of student athletes and that number rose to thirty-two percent in 1978.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This was a momentous time for women in sports because there was finally more representation across the board. Compared to women, one in two males participate in high school sports.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

After the passing of Title IX, the number of women managing and coaching sports in general has decreased.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The number of women in administrative positions within sports declined seventeen percent from 1972-1987. It was also found that in Texas schools women only made up six percent of the athletic directors and in Florida only thirteen percent were women. In addition to administrative positions, women coaches have seen a significant decline after Title IX was passed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 1973, women coaches were at an all time high of around eighty percent, but over the next ten years that number rapidly declined to around forty percent despite the increasing opportunities for women. Ever since Title IX was passed, women head coaches have been harder and harder to find especially from 1977-1982 when there was a thirty-six percent decrease. This issue has still not improved much since the 1972, even though Title IX was implemented to prevent this from happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heishman|first=Mary Frances|last2=Bunker|first2=Linda|last3=Tutwiler|first3=Roland W.|title=The Decline of Women Leaders (Coaches and Athletic Directors) in Girls' Interscholastic Sport Programs in Virginia from 1972 to 1987 |journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=103–107|doi=10.1080/02701367.1990.10607486|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7799">In [[linguistics]], '''genetic relationship''' is the usual term for the relationship which exists between [[language]]s that are members of the same [[language family]]. The term '''genealogical relationship''' is sometimes used to avoid confusion with the unrelated use of the term in biological [[genetics]]. Languages that possess genetic ties with one another belong to the same linguistic grouping, known as a [[language family]]. These ties are established through use of the [[comparative method]] of linguistic analysis.

Two languages are considered to be genetically related if one is descended from the other or if both are descended from a common ancestor. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] is descended from [[Latin]]. Italian and Latin are therefore said to be genetically related. Spanish is also descended from Latin. Therefore, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and Italian are genetically related. In a similar way, [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] are genetically related through the [[North Germanic]] branch of the [[Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). [http://www.ethnologue.com ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World''], Seventeenth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language families ==

The classification of languages into language families begins by making a list of words in the potential languages that exhibit lexical and grammatical similarities; that is, they are similar in sound and meaning.&lt;ref name="ruhlen"&gt;[[Merritt Ruhlen|Ruhlen, Merritt]]. ''On the Origin of Languages: Studies in Linguistic Taxonomy''. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The next step is to determine how the similarities originated. There are three possibilities: convergence, [[borrowing (linguistics)|borrowing]] and common origin.&lt;ref name="ruhlen"/&gt; Convergence is the chance similarity of sound and meaning of a word in two different languages and "is based on the principle that a word is an arbitrary association of sound and meaning".&lt;ref name="ruhlen"/&gt; An example of convergence is that many unrelated languages have words similar to [[mama and papa|''mama'' and ''papa'']] for 'mother' and 'father'.&lt;ref name="ruhlen"/&gt; Borrowing results from the exchanging of words between languages in close contact with one another.&lt;ref name="ruhlen"/&gt; Once convergence and borrowing have been eliminated as possible explanations for similarities in sound and meaning of words, the last explanation is common origin. It can be assumed that the similarities occurred due to descent from a common ancestor, and the words are known as [[cognate]]s.&lt;ref name="ruhlen"/&gt; The set of all cognates of a word is the [[etymology]] of the word.&lt;ref name="ruhlen"/&gt;

=== Linguistic interference and borrowing ===

When languages are in [[Language contact|contact with one another]], either of them may influence the other through [[Language transfer#Broader effects of language transfer|linguistic interference]] such as borrowing. For example, [[French language|French]] has influenced [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has influenced [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has influenced [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in this way. However, such influence does not constitute (and is not a measure of) a genetic relationship between the languages concerned. Linguistic interference can occur between languages that are genetically closely related, between languages that are distantly related (like English and French, which are distantly related [[Indo-European language]]s) and between languages that have no genetic relationship.

One theory concerning genetic relationships among languages is [[Proto-Human language|monogenesis]]{{snd}}the idea that all known languages, with the exceptions of [[Creole language|creoles]], pidgins and [[sign language]]s, are descendant from a single ancestral language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johanna Nichols|Nichols, Johanna]]. Monogenesis or Polygenesis: A Single Ancestral Language for All Humanity? Ch. 58 of ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution'', ed. by [[Maggie Tallerman]] and Kathleen Rita Gibson. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2012. 558-72. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual representation==
A common visual representation of a language family is given by a genetic language tree. The [[tree model]] is sometimes termed a [[dendrogram]] or [[phylogeny]]. The family tree shows the relationship of the languages within in a family, much as a family tree of an individual shows their relationship with their relatives. There are criticisms to the family tree model. Critics focus mainly on the claim that the internal structure of the trees is subject to variation based on the criteria of classification.&lt;ref&gt;Edzard, Lutz. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UAFVgdGljl4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Polygenesis, Convergence, and Entropy: An Alternative Model of Linguistic Evolution Applied to Semitic Linguistics]''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Even among those who support the family tree model, there are debates over which languages should be included in a language family. For example, within the dubious [[Altaic language family]], there are debates over whether the [[Japonic]] and [[Koreanic]] languages should be included or not.&lt;ref&gt;Georg, Stefan, Peter A. Michalove, Alexis Manaster Ramer, and Paul J. Sidwell. Telling General Linguists about Altaic. ''Journal of Linguistics'' 35.1 (1999): 65-98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wave model]] has been proposed as an alternative to the tree model.&lt;ref name="francois"&gt;[[Alexandre François|Francois, Alexandre]]. Trees, Waves and Linkages: Models of Language Diversification. In ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'', ed. by Claire Bowern and Bethwyn Evans. New York: Routledge, 2014, pp.161-189. ({{ISBN|978-0-41552-789-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The wave model uses [[isogloss]]es to group language varieties; unlike in the tree model, these groups can overlap. While the tree model implies a lack of contact between languages after derivation from an ancestral form, the wave model emphasizes the relationship between languages that remain in contact, which is more realistic.&lt;ref name="francois"/&gt;

==Complications==
Some problems encountered by the genetic relationship group of languages include [[language isolate]]s and [[Mixed language|mixed]], [[pidgin]] and [[creole language]]s. Mixed languages, pidgins and creole languages constitute special genetic types of languages. They do not descend linearly or directly from a single language and have no single ancestor. Language isolates are languages that are unrelated to other languages. Each language isolate is considered to be a single language family with one language according to the ''[[Ethnologue]]''.&lt;ref name="ethnologue"/&gt; Including language isolates when counting language families considerably increases the number of language families.&lt;!-- For example, according to Zuckermann (2009), "Israeli", his term for [[Modern Hebrew]], is a hybrid language, both [[Semitic]] and [[Indo-European]], and it "demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple [[tree model|family tree system]] allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]]. 2009. [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns.] ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2:40-67, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

'''''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men''''' is a 1985 [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] designed to raise awareness about hunger in Africa. Proceeds from the comic went to the [[American Friends Service Committee]], to assist in their work on behalf of  [[Africa]]n [[famine]] relief and recovery. Published in the form of a "[[comic jam]]," or [[exquisite corpse]], the book featured an [[all-star]] lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as [[Stephen King]], [[George R. R. Martin]], and [[Edward Bryant]]. It also saw a rare [[Alan Moore]] Marvel Comics credit outside his early [[Marvel UK]] work.

''Heroes for Hope'' featured some memorable artist/writer and penciler/inker pairings, including [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]]; [[Stephen King]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]]; Moore and [[Richard Corben]]; [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]]; [[Mike Baron]] and [[Steve Rude]], [[Howard Chaykin]] inked by [[Walt Simonson]]; and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] reuniting on the X-Men.

== Publication history ==
''Heroes for Hope'' came about in response to the devastating [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 223|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Horrified by the plight of starving children in Africa, writer/artist Jim Starlin and illustrator Bernie Wrightson convinced Marvel to publish ''Heroes For Hope''. It was a 'jam' book...and all of Marvel's profits were donated to famine relief in Africa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was in the spirit of contemporaneous [[benefit concert|musical fund-raisers]] like [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", [[USA for Africa]]'s "[[We Are the World]]", and the [[Live Aid]] concerts. Then-Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] described the genesis of the project this way:

{{quote|One night, a few months ago, artist [[Jim Starlin]] called me at home to propose an idea that his friend and fellow artist [[Berni Wrightson]] had suggested to him — that Marvel Comics publish a special issue of ''The X-Men'', a benefit book for famine relief in Africa. Jim and Berni wanted to do the book as a "jam," with as many artists and writers contributing, which would enable us to bring a small army of outstanding talents together on the project, making it a real event. I thought it was a great idea. The next morning I pitched it to Publisher [[Mike Hobson]] and President [[Jim Galton]]. . . . Jim and Berni recruited the artists. [[Chris Claremont]] . . . quickly volunteered to recruit writers, and to help . . . coordinate the entire project.&lt;ref name="afterword"&gt;Shooter, Jim. Afterword, ''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men'' (Marvel Comics, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to the contributors donating their work for the project, so did logo designer [[Janet Jackson (comics)|Janet Jackson]] and Marvel's production staff; while [[Curtis Circulation Company]] and all the [[direct market]] distributors and [[comics specialty shop]]s donated their profits.&lt;ref name="afterword" /&gt;

== Plot ==
The comic book opens with [[Rachel Summers]] poking her head out of the [[X-Mansion]] to grab the mail, only to be confronted with a horrible sight. The X-Men rush to the entrance to see that the mansion has somehow been transported to the middle of a barren desert.

After retrieving the comatose mail carrier, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] senses that all is not right, and claws him in the face. But it turns out that it was all an illusion. The X-Men go back to business as usual after this fiasco, but then things begin to go wrong. One by one, a series of psychic assaults is launched on each member of the team, as they are subjected to their greatest subconscious fears.

First [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (with art by Byrne and Austin) is mocked by steely apparitions of his teammates. This is more than he can bear, and he curls up in a [[fetal position]]. [[Kitty Pryde]], as told by King, Wrightson, and inker [[Jeffrey Catherine Jones|Jeff Jones]], goes to grab something from the refrigerator only to be surprised by an evil Death-type being in a cloak. He exposes Kitty's great fear of going hungry. As told by [[Bill Mantlo]], [[Charles Vess]], and [[Jon J Muth]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] finds Kitty turned into a wizened old hag, which leads to his own experience, focusing on [[Christian]] imagery and moral dilemmas. Kurt is offered the chance to sacrifice himself so that one other person might breath the air and eat the food he would. He declines, and thinks himself a coward. Thanks to Moore and [[Richard Corben]], the next to fall prey to the spiritual onslaught is [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who is offered a glimpse of a world where his dream of mutant supremacy has been realized — and that it's not all it's cracked up to be. Rachel is swept back to her past, where she's confronted by a horde of mutant-hunting [[doppelgänger]] [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], reminding her of her part in that dystopian future. Wolverine, by Ellison, Miller, and inker Sienkiewicz, must confront the tension between his human and animal sides. Claremont, [[Brian Bolland]], and [[P. Craig Russell]] depict [[Ororo|Storm]] confronted by a carnival ringmaster, who traps her in a [[house of mirrors]]. She is shown various images of her possible self, each one more distorted than the last. Ororo gets drawn into the crazy carnival games, and in the first concrete expression of the story's theme, she realizes that it is wrong to waste food. Having defeated the psychic attacker by feeding illusory cream pies to illusory people, Storm returns to her teammates for discussion of what has transpired.

Courtesy of Rachel's powers, the X-Men track the psychic presence that's been harassing them to the continent of Africa. They fly the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] to the source, where they are met with horrible scenes of deprivation. Before long, a fleet of [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft arrive, full of supplies, which the X-Men help distribute.

That night, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] becomes so frustrated that she has not had her turn of psychic punishment yet that she decides to hunt down the entity herself. She sneaks around the campsite stealing her teammates' powers. Using the psychic powers of Rachel Summers, the Rogue hybrid traces the presence of the X-Men's harasser to a desert hideaway. Upon entering the crypt, Rogue is attacked by the avatar of the psychic being. Things are not going well for Rogue when Storm appears to give aid. The "entity" is revealed to be a primeval god-force that feeds on human despair. One by one, the X-Men awake from their Rogue-induced comas and join in the battle.

The X-Men finally defeat the entity and return to their campsite, where they resume the enormous task of feeding the starving refugees. They realize their battle with the entity was a metaphor for the fight against famine, and indeed any human struggle. Kitty expresses fear that the entity survived the battle and is ready to strike again, but Wolverine comforts her with words of hope.

{{Short description|Adherent of Hinduism}}
'''Hindu''' ({{Audio|hi-Hindu.ogg|pronunciation}}) refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jefferylong&gt;[[Jeffery D. Long]] (2007), A Vision for Hinduism, IB Tauris, {{ISBN|978-1845112738}}, pages 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFKBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42935-6|pages=10–11}}, Quote: "It is often said that Hinduism is very ancient, and in a sense this is true (...). It was formed by adding the English suffix -ism, of Greek origin, to the word ''Hindu'', of Persian origin; it was about the same time that the word ''Hindu'', without the suffix -ism, came to be used mainly as a religious term. (...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion. (...) However, it is a religious term that the word ''Hindu'' is now used in English, and Hinduism is the name of a religion, although, as we have seen, we should beware of any false impression of uniformity that this might give us."&lt;/ref&gt; It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David N. Lorenzen|authorlink=David Lorenzen|title=Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO-YmMWpcVEC |year=2006| publisher=Yoda |isbn=978-81-902272-6-1|pages=xx, 2, 13–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical meaning of the term ''Hindu'' has evolved with time. Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the [[Indus]] in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the [[Indian subcontinent]] around or beyond the Sindhu ([[Indus]]) river.&lt;ref name=hawleynarayanan&gt;{{citation|last1=Hawley|first1=John Stratton|last2=Narayanan|first2=Vasudha|title=The Life of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hairjdT-ekC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24914-1|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims.&lt;ref name=hawleynarayanan/&gt;{{Efn|{{harvtxt|Flood|1996|p=6}} adds: "(...) 'Hindu', or 'Hindoo', was used towards the end of the eighteenth century by the British to refer to the people of 'Hindustan', the people of northwest India. Eventually 'Hindu' became virtually equivalent to an 'Indian' who was not a Muslim, Sikh, Jain or Christian, thereby encompassing a range of religious beliefs and practices. The '-ism' was added to Hindu in around 1830 to denote the culture and religion of the high-caste Brahmans in contrast to other religions, and the term was soon appropriated by Indians themselves in the context of building a national identity opposed to colonialism, though the term 'Hindu' was used in Sanskrit and Bengali hagiographic texts in contrast to 'Yavana' or Muslim as early as the sixteenth century".}}{{Efn|{{harvtxt|von Stietencron|2005|p=229}}: For more than 100 years the word Hindu (plural) continued to denote the Indians in general. But when, from AD 712 onwards, Muslims began to settle permanently in the Indus valley and to make converts among low-caste Hindus, Persian authors distinguished between Hindus and Muslims in India: Hindus were Indians other than Muslim. We know that Persian scholars were able to distinguish a number of religions among the Hindus. But when Europeans started to use the term Hindoo, they applied it to the non-Muslim masses of India without those scholarly differentiations.}}

The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population, in a religious or cultural sense, is unclear.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;&lt;ref name=lorenzenhidentity&gt;{{harvnb|Lorenzen|2006|pp=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era, or that it developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars.&lt;ref name=lorenzenhidentity/&gt;&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt;&lt;ref name=brajadulal/&gt; A sense of Hindu identity and the term ''Hindu'' appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and regional languages.&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt;&lt;ref name="OConnell1973"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Word 'Hindu' in Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Texts |author=O'Connell, Joseph T. |date=July–September 1973| journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=340–344 |doi=10.2307/599467 |jstor=599467}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as [[Vidyapati]], [[Kabir]] and [[Eknath]] used the phrase ''Hindu dharma'' (Hinduism) and contrasted it with ''Turaka dharma'' (Islam).{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006}} The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu' in religious context in 1649.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=15}} In the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of [[Indian religions]] collectively as ''Hindus'', in contrast to ''Mohamedans'' for Mughals and Arabs following Islam.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;&lt;ref name=hawleynarayanan/&gt; By the mid-19th century, colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains,&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt; but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term ''Hindu'' until about mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt; Scholars state that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs is a modern phenomenon.&lt;ref name=lipner17/&gt;&lt;ref name=leslie/&gt; '''Hindoo''' is an archaic spelling variant, whose use today may be considered derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Herbst|first=Philip|title=The color of words: an encyclopaedic dictionary of ethnic bias in the United States|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=1997|isbn=978-1-877864-97-1|pp=106–107|quote= "'''Hindu, Hindoo'''  A term borrowed from the Persian word ''Hindu'' ...

&lt;!-- Omitted for now
Despite the commonplace use of the term "Hindu" for the followers of the Hindu religion, the term also continues to designate a cultural identity, the ownership of India's millennia-old cultural heritage. [[Arvind Sharma]] notes that the exclusivist conception of religion was foreign to India, and Indians did not yield to it during the centuries of Muslim rule but only under the British colonial rule. Resistance to the exclusivist conception led to [[Savarkar]]'s ''Hindutva'', where Hinduism was seen both as a religion and a culture.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=25-26}} ''Hindutva'' is a national Hindu-ness, by which a Hindu is one born in India and behaves like a Hindu. [[M. S. Golwalkar]] even spoke of "Hindu Muslims," meaning "Hindu by culture, Muslim by religion."{{sfn|Sridharan|2000|pp=13-14}}

The word ''Hindu'' is derived from the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=3}} and [[Sanskrit]]{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=3}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} word ''Sindhu'', which means "a large body of water", covering "river, ocean".&lt;ref name="TakacsCline2015"&gt;{{citation |last1=Takacs |first1=Sarolta Anna |last2=Cline |first2=Eric H. |title=The Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPcvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA377 |date=17 July 2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-45839-5 |pages=377–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|{{harvtxt|Flood|2008|p=3}}: The Indo-Aryan word ''Sindhu'' means "river", "ocean".}} It was used as the name of the [[Indus river]] and also referred to its tributaries.

Among the earliest known records of 'Hindu' with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text ''Record of the Western Regions'' by the Buddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]]. Xuanzang uses the transliterated term ''In-tu'' whose "connotation overflows in the religious" according to [[Arvind Sharma]].&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/&gt; While Xuanzang suggested that the term refers to the country named after the moon, another Buddhist scholar [[I-tsing]] contradicted the conclusion saying that ''In-tu'' was not a common name for the country.{{sfn|Jha|2009|p=15}}

[[Al-Biruni]]'s 11th-century text ''Tarikh Al-Hind'', and the texts of the Delhi Sultanate period use the term 'Hindu', where it includes all non-Islamic people such as Buddhists, and retains the ambiguity of being "a region or a religion".&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/&gt; The 'Hindu' community occurs as the amorphous 'Other' of the Muslim community in the court chronicles, according to [[Romila Thapar]].&lt;ref name="Thapar tyranny"&gt;{{citation |last=Thapar |first=Romila |authorlink=Romila Thapar |date=September–October 1996 |title=The Tyranny of Labels |journal=Social Scientist |volume=24 |number=9/10 |pp=3–23 |JSTOR=3520140 |doi=10.2307/3520140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]] notes that 'Hindu' retained its geographical reference initially: 'Indian', 'indigenous, local', virtually 'native'. Slowly, the Indian groups themselves started using the term, differentiating themselves and their "traditional ways" from those of the invaders.{{sfn|Wilfred Cantwell Smith|1981|p=62}}

&lt;!-- Do we still need this?
'Hindu', or 'Hindoo', was used towards the end of the eighteenth century by the British to refer to the people of 'Hindustan', the people of northwest India. Eventually 'Hindu' became virtually equivalent to an 'Indian' who was not a Muslim, Sikh, Jain or Christian, thereby encompassing a range of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}}
--&gt;
The text ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', by Chanda Baradai, about the 1192 CE defeat of [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] at the hands of [[Muhammad Ghori]], is full of references to "Hindus" and "Turks", and at one stage, says "both the religions have drawn their curved swords;" however, the date of this text is unclear and considered by most scholars to be more recent.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=33}} In Islamic literature, [[Isami (historian)|'Abd al-Malik Isami]]'s Persian work, ''Futuhu's-salatin'', composed in the Deccan in 1350, uses the word ''{{'}}{{not a typo|hindi}}' '' to mean Indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word ''{{'}}{{not a typo|hindu}}' '' to mean 'Hindu' in the sense of a follower of the Hindu religion".{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=33}} The poet [[Vidyapati]]'s poem ''Kirtilata'' contrasts the cultures of Hindus and Turks (Muslims) in a city and concludes "The Hindus and the Turks live close together; Each makes fun of the other's religion (''dhamme'')."{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=31}} One of the earliest uses of word 'Hindu' in religious context in a European language (Spanish), was the publication in 1649 by Sebastiao Manrique.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=15}}

Other prominent mentions of 'Hindu' include the epigraphical inscriptions from Andhra Pradesh kingdoms who battled military expansion of Muslim dynasties in the 14th century, where the word 'Hindu' partly implies a religious identity in contrast to 'Turks' or Islamic religious identity.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|pp=32-33}} The term ''Hindu'' was later used occasionally in some Sanskrit texts such as the later [[Rajatarangini]]s of Kashmir (Hinduka, c. 1450) and some 16th- to 18th-century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] texts, including ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' and ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]''. These texts used it to contrast Hindus from Muslims who are called [[Yona#Later meanings|Yavanas]] (foreigners) or [[Mlecchas]] (barbarians), with the 16th-century ''Chaitanya Charitamrita'' text and the 17th-century ''Bhakta Mala'' text using the phrase "Hindu [[dharma]]".&lt;ref name="OConnell1973" /&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Malviya dwipa island across Har ki Pauri during Kavad mela, Haridwar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Hindus at [[Har Ki Pauri]], [[Haridwar]] near river [[Ganges]] in [[Uttarakhand]] state of India.]]

===Medieval-era usage (8th to 18th century)===
One of the earliest but ambiguous uses of the word Hindu is, states [[Arvind Sharma]], in the 'Brahmanabad settlement' which Muhammad ibn Qasim made with non-Muslims after the Arab invasion of northwestern Sindh region of India, in 712 CE. The term 'Hindu' meant people who were non-Muslims, and it included Buddhists of the region.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2&gt;Arvind Sharma (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th-century text of Al Biruni, Hindus are referred to as "religious antagonists" to Islam, as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between Hindus holding a centralist and pluralist religious views.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2/&gt; In the texts of Delhi Sultanate era, states Sharma, the term Hindu remains ambiguous on whether it means people of a region or religion, giving the example of Ibn Battuta's explanation of the name "Hindu Kush" for a mountain range in Afghanistan. It was so called, wrote Ibn Battuta, because many Indian slaves died there of snow cold, as they were marched across that mountain range. The term ''Hindu'' there is ambivalent and could mean geographical region or religion.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism, and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Hindu appears in the texts from the Mughal Empire era. It broadly refers to non-Muslims. Pashaura Singh states, "in Persian writings, Sikhs were regarded as Hindu in the sense of non-Muslim Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan, Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), page 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahangir]], for example, called the Sikh [[Guru Arjan]] a Hindu:&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.gisp.d7_sp/files/sitefiles/journals/volume12/no1/3_singh.pdf Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan], Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), pages 29-31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=
There was a Hindu named Arjan in Gobindwal on the banks of the Beas River. Pretending to be a spiritual guide, he had won over as devotees many simple-minded Indians and even some ignorant, stupid Muslims by broadcasting his claims to be a saint. [...] When Khusraw stopped at his residence, [Arjan] came out and had an interview with [Khusraw]. Giving him some elementary spiritual precepts picked up here and there, he made a mark with saffron on his forehead, which is called qashqa in the idiom of the Hindus and which they consider lucky.

During the colonial era, the term Hindu had connotations of native religions of India, that is religions other than Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref name=gauri&gt;Gauri Viswanathan (1998), Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691058993}}, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; In early colonial era Anglo-Hindu laws and British India court system, the term Hindu referred to people of all Indian religions and two non-Indian religions:

{{Quote|
The colonial project was itself undermined by its own constitutive contradictions since many of these laws were no more intrinsic to Indian society than the proposed meld of English and Indian systems. (...) The application of laws derived from Sanskrit classical texts leveled the community of '''Hindus''' to include all those who were not Muslims or Christians, and it absorbed under the category of "Hindu" both outcastes and members of religions as diverse as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism.
|Gauri Viswanathan, ''Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief''|&lt;ref name=gauri/&gt;}}

The 20th-century colonial laws of British India segregated people's rights by their religion, evolving to provide Muslims with Sharia law, Christians, Jews and Parsis of British India with their own religious laws. The British government created a compendium of religious laws for Hindus, and the term 'Hindu' in these colonial 'Hindu laws', decades before India's independence, applied to Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs.&lt;ref name=rachel&gt;Rachel Sturman (2010), Hinduism and Law: An Introduction (Editors: Timothy Lubin et al), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521716260}}, pages 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the stipulations of British law, colonial [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] and particularly the influential Asiatick Researches founded in the 18th century, later called [[The Asiatic Society]], initially identified just two religions in India – Islam, and Hinduism. These orientalists included all Indian religions such as Buddhism as a subgroup of Hinduism in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=brian111&gt;{{citation|last=Pennington|first=Brian K.|title=Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7drluePK-acC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803729-3|pages=111-118}}&lt;/ref&gt; These texts called followers of Islam as ''Mohamedans'', and all others as ''Hindus''. The text, by the early 19th century, began dividing Hindus into separate groups, for chronology studies of the various beliefs. Among the earliest terms to emerge were ''Seeks and their College'' (later spelled Sikhs by Charles Wilkins), ''Boudhism'' (later spelled Buddhism), and in the 9th volume of Asiatick Researches report on religions in India, the term ''Jainism'' received notice.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;

According to Pennington, the terms Hindu and Hinduism were thus constructed for colonial studies of India. The various sub-divisions and separation of subgroup terms were assumed to be result of "communal conflict", and Hindu was constructed by these orientalists to imply people who adhered to "ancient default oppressive religious substratum of India", states Pennington.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt; Followers of other Indian religions so identified were later referred Buddhists, Sikhs or Jains and distinguished from Hindus, in an antagonistic two-dimensional manner, with Hindus and Hinduism stereotyped as irrational traditional and others as rational reform religions. However, these mid-19th-century reports offered no indication of doctrinal or ritual differences between Hindu and Buddhist, or other newly constructed religious identities.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt; These colonial studies, states Pennigton, "puzzled endlessly about the Hindus and intensely scrutinized them, but did not interrogate and avoided reporting the practices and religion of Mughal and Arabs in South Asia", and often relied on Muslim scholars to characterise Hindus.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;

===Contemporary usage===

In contemporary era, the term Hindus are individuals who identify with one or more aspects of [[Hinduism]], whether they are practising or non-practicing or ''[[Laissez-faire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Turner (2010), The New Blackwell Companion to the Sociology of Religion, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-1405188524}}, pages 424-425&lt;/ref&gt; The term does not include those who identify with other Indian religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism or various animist tribal religions found in India such as ''Sarnaism''.&lt;ref name="Marty1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Minahan (2012), Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia, {{ISBN|978-1598846591}}, pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt; The term Hindu, in contemporary parlance, includes people who accept themselves as culturally or ethnically Hindu rather than with a fixed set of religious beliefs within Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jefferylong/&gt; One need not be religious in the minimal sense, states [[Julius J.

:When we think of the Hindu religion, unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one god; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or [[creed]]. It may broadly be described as a [[way of life]] and nothing more.

===Disputes===

In the [[Constitution of India]], the word "Hindu" has been used in some places to denote persons professing any of these religions: [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] or [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr3indi.htm India-Constitution:Religious rights] Article 25:''"Explanation II: In sub-Clause (b) of clause (2), the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion"''&lt;/ref&gt; This however has been challenged by the Sikhs&lt;ref name="Marty1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin E.

The [[Republic of India]] is in the peculiar situation that the [[Supreme Court of India]] has repeatedly been called upon to define "Hinduism" because the [[Constitution of India]], while it prohibits "discrimination of any citizen" on grounds of religion in article 15, article 30 foresees special rights for "All minorities, whether based on religion or language". As a consequence, religious groups have an interest in being recognised as distinct from the Hindu majority in order to qualify as a "religious minority".

Starting after the 10th century and particularly after the 12th century Islamic invasion, states Sheldon Pollock, the political response fused with the Indic religious culture and doctrines.&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri&gt;Sheldon Pollock (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2059648 Rāmāyaṇa and political imagination in India], Journal of Asian studies, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 266-269&lt;/ref&gt; Temples dedicated to deity [[Rama]] were built from north to south India, and textual records as well as hagiographic inscriptions began comparing the Hindu epic of [[Ramayana]] to regional kings and their response to Islamic attacks. The [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava]] king of [[Devagiri]] named ''[[Ramachandra of Devagiri|Ramacandra]]'', for example states Pollock, is described in a 13th-century record as, "How is this Rama to be described.. who freed [[Varanasi]] from the ''mleccha'' (barbarian, Turk Muslim) horde, and built there a golden temple of Sarngadhara".&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt; Pollock notes that the Yadava king ''Ramacandra'' is described as a devotee of deity [[Shiva]] (Shaivism), yet his political achievements and temple construction sponsorship in Varanasi, far from his kingdom's location in the Deccan region, is described in the historical records in Vaishnavism terms of Rama, a deity [[Vishnu]] avatar.&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt; Pollock presents many such examples and suggests an emerging Hindu political identity that was grounded in the Hindu religious text of Ramayana, one that has continued into the modern times, and suggests that this historic process began with the arrival of Islam in India.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2059648 Rāmāyaṇa and political imagination in India], Journal of Asian studies, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 261-297&lt;/ref&gt;

Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya has questioned the Pollock theory and presented textual and inscriptional evidence.&lt;ref name=brajadulal2004/&gt; According to Chattopadhyaya, the Hindu identity and religious response to Islamic invasion and wars developed in different kingdoms, such as wars between Islamic Sultanates and the Vijayanagara kingdom ([[Karnataka]]), and Islamic raids on the kingdoms in [[Tamil Nadu]]. These wars were described not just using the mythical story of Rama from Ramayana, states Chattopadhyaya, the medieval records used a wide range of religious symbolism and myths that are now considered as part of Hindu literature.&lt;ref name=brajadulal&gt;Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (1998), Representing the other?: Sanskrit sources and the Muslims (eighth to fourteenth century), Manohar Publications, {{ISBN|978-8173042522}}, pages 92-103, Chapter 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brajadulal2004&gt;Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (2004), Other or the Others? in ''The World in the Year 1000'' (Editors: James Heitzman, Wolfgang Schenkluhn), University Press of America, {{ISBN|978-0761825616}}, pages 303-323&lt;/ref&gt; This emergence of religious with political terminology began with the first Muslim invasion of Sindh in the 8th century CE, and intensified 13th century onwards. The 14th-century Sanskrit text, ''Madhuravijayam'', a memoir written by ''Gangadevi'', the wife of Vijayanagara prince, for example describes the consequences of war using religious terms,&lt;ref name=brajadulal306/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I very much lament for what happened to the groves in Madhura,
The coconut trees have all been cut and in their place are to be seen,
  rows of iron spikes with human skulls dangling at the points,
In the highways which were once charming with anklets sound of beautiful women,
  are now heard ear-piercing noises of Brahmins being dragged, bound in iron-fetters,
The waters of Tambraparni, which were once white with sandal paste,
  are now flowing red with the blood of cows slaughtered by miscreants,
Earth is no longer the producer of wealth, nor does [[Indra]] give timely rains,
The [[Yama|God of death]] takes his undue toll of what are left lives if undestroyed by the Yavanas [Muslims],&lt;ref&gt;the terms were Persians, Tajikas or Arabs, and Turushkas or Turks, states Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (2004), Other or the Others? in ''The World in the Year 1000'' (Editors: James Heitzman, Wolfgang Schenkluhn), University Press of America, {{ISBN|978-0761825616}}, pages 303-319&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kali age now deserves deepest congratulations for being at the zenith of its power,
gone is the sacred learning, hidden is refinement, hushed is the voice of [[Dharma]].

For his part Vidyapati, in his Apabhransha text Kirtilata, makes use of the phrase 'Hindu and Turk dharmas' in a clearly religious sense and highlights the local conflicts between the two communities.

Andrew Nicholson, in his review of scholarship on Hindu identity history, states that the vernacular literature of [[Bhakti movement]] sants from 15th to 17th century, such as [[Kabir]], Anantadas, Eknath, Vidyapati, suggests that distinct religious identities, between Hindus and Turks (Muslims), had formed during these centuries.&lt;ref name=andrewnicholson/&gt; The poetry of this period contrasts Hindu and Islamic identities, states Nicholson, and the literature vilifies the Muslims coupled with a "distinct sense of a Hindu religious identity".&lt;ref name=andrewnicholson&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 198-199&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars state that Hindu, Buddhist and Jain identities are retrospectively-introduced modern constructions.&lt;ref name=leslie/&gt; Inscriptional evidence from the 8th century onwards, in regions such as South India, suggests that medieval era India, at both elite and folk religious practices level, likely had a "shared religious culture",&lt;ref name=leslie&gt;Leslie Orr (2014), Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195356724}}, pages 25-26, 204&lt;/ref&gt; and their collective identities were "multiple, layered and fuzzy".&lt;ref name=leslieorr&gt;Leslie Orr (2014), Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195356724}}, pages 42, 204&lt;/ref&gt; Even among Hinduism denominations such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, the Hindu identities, states Leslie Orr, lacked "firm definitions and clear boundaries".&lt;ref name=leslieorr/&gt;

Overlaps in Jain-Hindu identities have included Jains worshipping Hindu deities, intermarriages between Jains and Hindus, and medieval era Jain temples featuring Hindu religious icons and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dundas (2002), The Jains, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266055}}, pages 6-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K Reddy (2011), Indian History, Tata McGraw Hill, {{ISBN|978-0071329231}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Allen (1992), Ornament in Indian Architecture, University of Delaware Press, {{ISBN|978-0874133998}}, page 211&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond India, on Java island of [[Indonesia]], historical records attest to marriages between Hindus and Buddhists, medieval era temple architecture and sculptures that simultaneously incorporate Hindu and Buddhist themes,&lt;ref&gt;Trudy King et al (1996), Historic Places: Asia and Oceania, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1884964046}}, page 692&lt;/ref&gt; where Hinduism and Buddhism merged and functioned as "two separate paths within one overall system", according to Ann Kenney and other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Kenney et al (2003), Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824827793}}, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is an organic relation of Sikhs to Hindus, states Zaehner, both in religious thought and their communities, and virtually all Sikhs' ancestors were Hindus.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner/&gt; Marriages between Sikhs and Hindus, particularly among ''Khatris'', were frequent.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner/&gt; Some Hindu families brought up a son as a Sikh, and some Hindus view Sikhism as a tradition within Hinduism, even though the Sikh faith is a distinct religion.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner&gt;Robert Zaehner (1997), Encyclopedia of the World's Religions, Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0760707128}}, page 409&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Lipner states that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs is a modern phenomena, but one that is a convenient abstraction.&lt;ref name=lipner17&gt;Julius J. Lipner (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415456777}}, pages 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguishing Indian traditions is a fairly recent practice, states Lipner, and is the result of "not only Western preconceptions about the nature of religion in general and of religion in India in particular, but also with the political awareness that has arisen in India" in its people and a result of Western influence during its colonial history.&lt;ref name=lipner17/&gt;

===Sacred geography===
Scholars such as Fleming and Eck state that the post-Epic era literature from the 1st millennium CE amply demonstrate that there was a historic concept of the Indian subcontinent as a sacred geography, where the sacredness was a shared set of religious ideas. For example, the twelve ''Jyotirlingas'' of Shaivism and fifty-one ''Shaktipithas'' of Shaktism are described in the early medieval era Puranas as pilgrimage sites around a theme.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=51-56}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knut A.

Varanasi as a sacred pilgrimage site is documented in the ''Varanasimahatmya'' text embedded inside the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', and the oldest versions of this text are dated to 6th to 8th-century CE.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|p=56}}&lt;ref name=Eck2012p34/&gt;

The idea of twelve sacred sites in Shiva Hindu tradition spread across the Indian subcontinent appears not only in the medieval era temples but also in copper plate inscriptions and temple seals discovered in different sites.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=57-58}} According to Bhardwaj, non-Hindu texts such as the memoirs of Chinese Buddhist and Persian Muslim travellers attest to the existence and significance of the pilgrimage to sacred geography among Hindus by later 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Surinder M. Bhardwaj|title=Hindu Places of Pilgrimage in India: A Study in Cultural Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6XJFokSJzEC |year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04951-2|pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fleming, those who question whether the term Hindu and Hinduism are a modern construction in a religious context present their arguments based on some texts that have survived into the modern era, either of Islamic courts or of literature published by Western missionaries or colonial-era Indologists aiming for a reasonable construction of history. However, the existence of non-textual evidence such as cave temples separated by thousands of kilometers, as well as lists of medieval era pilgrimage sites, is evidence of a shared sacred geography and existence of a community that was self-aware of shared religious premises and landscape.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=51-58}}&lt;ref name=Eck2012p34/&gt; Further, it is a norm in evolving cultures that there is a gap between the "lived and historical realities" of a religious tradition and the emergence of related "textual authorities".{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=57-58}} The tradition and temples likely existed well before the medieval era Hindu manuscripts appeared that describe them and the sacred geography. This, states Fleming, is apparent given the sophistication of the architecture and the sacred sites along with the variance in the versions of the Puranic literature.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=51-58}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Surinder M.

Eck]] and other Indologists such as André Wink, Muslim invaders were aware of Hindu sacred geography such as Mathura, Ujjain, and Varanasi by the 11th-century.

===Hindu nationalism===
{{main article|Hindu nationalism|Hindutva}}
Christophe Jaffrelot states that modern Hindu nationalism was born in [[Maharashtra]], in the 1920s, as a reaction to the Islamic [[Khilafat Movement]] wherein Indian Muslims championed and took the cause of the Turkish Ottoman sultan as the Caliph of all Muslims, at the end of the [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=chrisjaffrelot/&gt;&lt;ref name=minault&gt;Gail Minault (1982), The Khilafat Movement: Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231050722}}, pages 1-11 and Preface section&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of Indian Muslim population, of pan-Islamic hegemony, and questioned whether Indian Muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial Indian nationalism.&lt;ref name=minault/&gt; The Hindu nationalism ideology that emerged, states Jeffrelot, was codified by Savarkar while he was a political prisoner of the British colonial empire.&lt;ref name=chrisjaffrelot&gt;Christophe Jaffrelot (2007), Hindu Nationalism: A Reader, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691130989}}, pages 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amalendu Misra (2004), Identity and Religion, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761932260}}, pages 148-188&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Bayly traces the roots of Hindu nationalism to the Hindu identity and political independence achieved by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha confederacy]], that overthrew the Islamic Mughal empire in large parts of India, allowing Hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored Hindu holy places such as Varanasi.&lt;ref&gt;CA Bayly (1985), The pre-history of communialism? Religious conflict in India 1700-1860, Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No. 2, pages 186-187, 177-203&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars view Hindu mobilisation and consequent nationalism to have emerged in the 19th century as a response to [[British colonialism]] by Indian nationalists and [[neo-Hinduism]] gurus.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Jaffrelot (2007), Hindu Nationalism: A Reader, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691130989}}, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Copley]] (2000), Gurus and their followers: New religious reform movements in Colonial India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195649581}}, pages 4-5, 24-27, 163-164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Hardy&gt;Hardy, F. "A radical assessment of the Vedic heritage" in ''Representing Hinduism: The Construction of Religious and National Identity'', Sage Publ., Delhi, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffrelot states that the efforts of Christian missionaries and Islamic proselytizers, during the British colonial era, each of whom tried to gain new converts to their own religion, by stereotyping and stigmatising Hindus to an identity of being inferior and superstitious, contributed to Hindus re-asserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining Islam and Christianity, forming organisations such as the ''Hindu Sabhas'' (Hindu associations), and ultimately a Hindu-identity driven nationalism in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=chrisjaffrelot2&gt;Christophe Jaffrelot (2007), Hindu Nationalism: A Reader, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691130989}}, pages 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial era Hindu revivalism and mobilisation, along with Hindu nationalism, states Peter van der Veer, was primarily a reaction to and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism.&lt;ref name=peterveer/&gt; The successes of each side fed the fears of the other, leading to the growth of Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=peterveer&gt;Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520082564}}, pages 11-14, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the sense of religious nationalism grew in India, states van der Veer, but only Muslim nationalism succeeded with the formation of the West and East Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh), as "an Islamic state" upon independence.&lt;ref name=peterveer31&gt;Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520082564}}, pages 31, 99, 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jawad Syed|author2=Edwina Pio|author3=Tahir Kamran et al|title=Faith-Based Violence and Deobandi Militancy in Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mx5DQAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-94966-3|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farahnaz Ispahani|title=Purifying the Land of the Pure: A History of Pakistan's Religious Minorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jl7ODQAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-062167-4|pages=28–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious riots and social trauma followed as millions of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs moved out of the newly created Islamic states and resettled into the Hindu-majority post-British India.&lt;ref name=peterveer53&gt;Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520082564}}, pages 26-32, 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; After the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu nationalism movement developed the concept of [[Hindutva]] in second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = RamPrasad&gt;Ram-Prasad, C.

The Hindu nationalism movement has sought to reform Indian laws, that critics say attempts to impose Hindu values on India's Islamic minority. Gerald Larson states, for example, that Hindu nationalists have sought a uniform civil code, where all citizens are subject to the same laws, everyone has equal civil rights, and individual rights do not depend on the individual's religion.&lt;ref name=larson55&gt;GJ Larson (2002), Religion and Personal Law in Secular India: A Call to Judgment, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0253214805}}, pages 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, opponents of Hindu nationalists remark that eliminating religious law from India poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of Muslims, and people of Islamic faith have a constitutional right to Islamic [[sharia]]h-based personal laws.&lt;ref name=larson55/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mansfield (2005), The Personal Laws or a Uniform Civil Code?, in Religion and Law in Independent India (Editor: Robert Baird), Manohar, {{ISBN|978-8173045882}}, page 121-127, 135-136, 151-156&lt;/ref&gt; A specific law, contentious between Hindu nationalists and their opponents in India, relates to the legal age of marriage for girls.&lt;ref name=sylviavatuk/&gt; Hindu nationalists seek that the legal age for marriage be eighteen that is universally applied to all girls regardless of their religion and that marriages be registered with local government to verify the age of marriage. Muslim clerics consider this proposal as unacceptable because under the shariah-derived personal law, a Muslim girl can be married at any age after she reaches puberty.&lt;ref name=sylviavatuk&gt;Sylvia Vatuk (2013), Adjudicating Family Law in Muslim Courts (Editor: Elisa Giunchi), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415811859}}, pages 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu nationalism in India, states Katharine Adeney, is a controversial political subject, with no consensus about what it means or implies in terms of the form of government and religious rights of the minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Adeney and Lawrence Saez (2005), Coalition Politics and Hindu Nationalism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415359818}}, pages 98-114&lt;/ref&gt;

In more ancient times, Hindu kingdoms arose and spread the religion and traditions across Southeast Asia, particularly [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Burma]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref name="Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia"&gt;{{cite web| URL=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=P4uJMJNpvdYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia|publisher=Hunter Publisher.Inc|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laos]],&lt;ref name="Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia"/&gt; [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ITLRpPrrcykC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_vpt_buy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Philippine History Module-based Learning I' 2002 Ed.|publisher=Rex Bookstore.Inc|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what is now central [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Iv3B4moBF_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Traces of Indian Culture in Vietnam|author=Gitesh Sharma|publisher=Rajkamal Prakshan Group|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 3 million Hindus are found in [[Bali]] Indonesia, a culture whose origins trace back to ideas brought by Tamil Hindu traders to Indonesian islands in the 1st millennium CE. Their sacred texts are also the [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pages 2-23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Purana]]s and the [[Itihasa]] (mainly ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'') are enduring traditions among Indonesian Hindus, expressed in community dances and shadow puppet (''[[wayang]]'') performances. As in India, Indonesian Hindus recognises four paths of spirituality, calling it ''Catur Marga''.&lt;ref name=murdana&gt;Murdana, I. Ketut (2008), BALINESE ARTS AND CULTURE: A flash understanding of Concept and Behavior, Mudra - JURNAL SENI BUDAYA, Indonesia; Volume 22, page 5-11&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindu believe that there are four proper goals of human life, calling it ''Catur Purusartha'' - [[dharma]] (pursuit of moral and ethical living), [[artha]] (pursuit of wealth and creative activity), [[kama]] (pursuit of joy and love) and [[moksha]] (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).&lt;ref&gt;Ida Bagus Sudirga (2009), Widya Dharma - Agama Hindu, Ganeca Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9795711773}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IGP Sugandhi (2005), Seni (Rupa) Bali Hindu Dalam Perspektif Epistemologi Brahma Widya, Ornamen, Vol 2, Number 1, pp. 58-69&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Historia Histrionica''''' is a [[1699 in literature|1699]] literary work by [[James Wright (antiquarian)|James Wright]] (1643-1713), on the subject of theatre in England in the seventeenth century. It is an essential resource for information on the actors and theatrical life of the period, providing data available nowhere else.

The work's full title is '''''Historia Histrionica: An historical account of the English stage shewing the ancient use, improvement, and perfection of dramatick representations in this nation. In a dialogue of plays and players.''''' The original 1699 [[book size|octavo]] edition, published anonymously, was printed by G. Groom for the bookseller William Hawes. (His shop was at the sign of the Rose, in Ludgate Street.)

As its title indicates, the work is cast in the form of a dialogue between two abstract figures, Lovewit and Trueman; Trueman imparts to Lovewit (and to the reader) his knowledge of theatrical matters. The author, James Wright (1643&amp;ndash;1713), was an attorney and occasional poet, and a collector of old plays. Along with [[Gerard Langbaine]] and [[John Downes (prompter)|John Downes]], Wright was one of the earliest historians of British theatre.

''Historia Histrionica'' was reprinted in the twelfth volume of [[Robert Dodsley]]'s collection of old plays,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dodsley, ed., ''A Select Collection of Old Plays'', London, 1744.&lt;/ref&gt; and included in subsequent editions of that work. Wright's essay remains a valuable resource for modern scholars of the subject and the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dale B. J. Randall, ''Winter Fruit: English Theatre 1642&amp;ndash;1660'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995; pp. 43-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Alan King, ''The Gendering of Men, 1600&amp;ndash;1750: The English Phallus'', Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2004; pp. 96-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Menzer, ed., ''Inside Shakespeare: Essays on the Blackfriars Stage'', Selinsgrove, PA, Susquehanna University Press, 2006; pp. 54-5, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Wright also published ''Country Conversations'' (1694), in which he compares late seventeenth-century theatre to earlier theatre by Shakespeare, Jonson, Massinger, and others.

'''Hothousing''' is a form of [[education]] for [[children]], involving intense study of a topic in order to stimulate the child's mind. Advocates of the practice claim that it is essential for the brightest to flourish intellectually, while critics claim that it does more harm than good and can lead a child to abandon the area studied under such a scheme later in life.

'''Ibero-America''' ({{lang-es|Iberoamérica}}, {{lang-pt|Ibero-América}}) or '''Iberian America''' is a region in the [[Americas]] comprising countries or territories where [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are predominant languages, usually former [[colony|territories]] of [[Portugal]] or [[Spain]]. Portugal and Spain are themselves included in some definitions, such as that of the [[Ibero-American Summit]] and the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]]. The Organization of Ibero-American States also includes Spanish-speaking [[Equatorial Guinea]], in [[Central Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oei.es/acercaoei.htm Presentación], Acerca de la OEI, Organización de Estados Iberoamericanos para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura.

Accessed on line October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but not the [[Portuguese-speaking African countries]].

The prefix ''Ibero-'' and the adjective ''Iberian'' refer to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in [[Europe]], which includes Portugal and Spain. Ibero-America includes all [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking]] countries in [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]], plus the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-speaking]] country of [[Brazil]]. Ibero-America is differentiated from [[Latin America]] by the exclusion of the French-speaking country of [[Haiti]], the [[Overseas department|French overseas departments]] of [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], and the [[Overseas collectivity|French collectivities]] of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] and [[Saint Barthélemy]]. In addition, the countries of [[Belize]], [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]], whose official languages are English and Dutch, respectively, are not considered to be either Ibero-American or Latin American.

Since 1991, the [[Iberoamerican Community of Nations]] has organized a yearly [[Ibero-American Summit]] meeting of the heads of state and governments of the Ibero-American countries, including [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Andorra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/relext/mre/orgreg/cupula/apresent.htm Ibero-American Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206090211/http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/relext/mre/orgreg/cupula/apresent.htm |date=2007-12-06 }}, Foreign Office, Republic of Brazil.

=== Terrorism ===
The relationship between immigration and terrorism remains understudied. A 2016 study finds that a higher level of migration is associated with a lower level of terrorism in the host country, but that migrants from terror-prone states do increase the risk of terrorism in the host country.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does Immigration Induce Terrorism?|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684679|journal = The Journal of Politics|volume = 78|issue = 2|date = 2016-02-11|issn = 0022-3816|pages = |doi = 10.1086/684679|first = Vincenzo|last = Bove|first2 = Tobias|last2 = Böhmelt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors note though that "only a minority of migrants from high-terrorism states can be associated with increases in terrorism, and not necessarily in a direct way."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In 2018, Washington and Lee University law professor Nora V. Demleitner wrote that there is "mixed evidence" as to a relationship between immigration and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315618647/chapters/10.4324%2F9781317211563-16|title=Immigration and Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315618647/chapters/10.4324%2F9781317211563-16|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by a group of German political scientists and economists, covering 1980–2010, found that there were more terrorist attacks in countries with a larger number of foreigners, but that, on average, the foreigners were not more likely to become terrorists than the natives.&lt;ref name=":47"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/migration-and-terror|title=Migration and terror|last=Dreher|first=Axel|last2=Gassebner|first2=Martin|date=2017-08-12|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2017-08-15|last3=Schaudt|first3=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt; The study also found little evidence that terrorism is systematically imported from predominantly Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreher|first=Axel|last2=Gassebner|first2=Martin|last3=Schaudt|first3=Paul|date=2017-09-01|title=The Effect of Migration on Terror – Made at Home or Imported from Abroad?|ssrn=2976273|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":47" /&gt; The same study found that compared to the average “non-terror-rich” country, migrants from Algeria, Iran, India, Spain, and Turkey were all more likely to be involved in a terrorist attack, while migrants from Angola and Cambodia were less likely than the reference groups to commit terror.The study found that repression of the migrants increased the terror risk.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":47" /&gt;

According to Olivier Roy in 2017 analyzing the previous two decades of terrorism in France, the typical jihadist is a second-generation immigrant or convert who after a period of petty crime was radicalized in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/apr/13/who-are-the-new-jihadis|title=Who are the new jihadis? {{!}} Olivier Roy {{!}} The long read|last=Roy|first=Olivier|date=2017-04-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of existing research on immigration and crime in Japan found that "prosecution and sentencing in Japan do seem to result in some disparities by nationality, but the available data are too limited to arrive at confident conclusions about their nature or magnitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Convergence of Control – Oxford Handbooks|url = http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199859016.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199859016-e-012|doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199859016.013.012|first = Ryoko|last = Yamamoto|first2 = David|last2 = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1997 news report, a large portion of crimes by immigrants are by Chinese in Japan, and some highly publicized crimes by organized groups of Chinese (often with help of [[Yakuza|Japanese organized crime]]) have led to a negative public perception of immigrants.&lt;ref name="worries"&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan Worries About a Trend: Crime by Chinese|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 12, 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/12/world/japan-worries-about-a-trend-crime-by-chinese.html | first=Sheryl | last=Wudunn | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that the increase in immigration flows into western European countries that took place in the 2000s did "not affect crime victimization, but it is associated with an increase in the fear of crime, the latter being consistently and positively correlated with the natives’ unfavourable attitude toward immigrants."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immigration and crime: evidence from victimization data |journal = Journal of Population Economics|date = 2015-03-04|issn = 0933-1433|pages = 697–736|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00148-015-0543-2|first = Luca|last = Nunziata}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of the existing economic literature on immigration and crime, one economist describes the existing literature in 2014 as showing that "the results for Europe are mixed for property crime but no association is found for violent crime".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immigration status and property crime: an application of estimators for underreported outcomes|url = http://www.izajom.com/content/3/1/12/abstract|journal = IZA Journal of Migration|date = 2014-07-02|issn = 2193-9039|pages = 12|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/2193-9039-3-12|first = Georgios|last = Papadopoulos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[Statistics Denmark]] released in December 2015 found that 83% of crimes are committed by individuals of Danish origin (88% of the total population), 3% by those of non-Danish Western descent and 14% by individuals of non-Western descent.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dst.dk/Site/Dst/Udgivelser/GetPubFile.aspx?id=20703&amp;sid=indv2015|title = Indvandrere i Danmark 2015|date = 2015|access-date = |website = |publisher = Statistics Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

The index is standardized by both age and socioeconomic status. Men of Yugoslav origin and men originating in Turkey, Pakistan, Somalia and Morocco are associated with high crime-indexes, ranging between 187 and 205, which translate to crime rates about double the country's average. The lowest crime index is recorded among immigrants and descendants originating from the United States. Their crime-index, at 32, is far below the average for all men in Denmark.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dst.dk/Site/Dst/Udgivelser/GetPubFile.aspx?id=20703&amp;sid=indv2015|title = Indvandrere i Danmark 2015|date = 2015|access-date = |website = |publisher = Statistics Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among immigrants from China a very small crime-index is recorded as well, at 38.

A 2014 study of the random dispersal of refugee immigrants over the period 1986–1998, and focusing on the immigrant children who underwent this random assignment before the age of 15, suggests that exposure to neighbourhood crime increases individual crime propensity.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; The share of convicted criminals living in the assignment neighborhood at assignment affects later crime convictions of males, but not of females, who were assigned to these neighborhoods as children.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; The authors "find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of youth criminals living in the assignment neighborhood, and who committed a crime in the assignment year, increases the probability of a conviction for male assignees by between 5 percent and 9 percent later in life (when they are between 15 and 21 years old)."&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

One study of Denmark found that providing immigrants with voting rights reduced their crime rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slotwinski|first=Michaela|last2=Stutzer|first2=Alois|last3=Gorinas|first3=Cédric|date=2017-02-27|title=Democratic Involvement and Immigrants' Compliance with the Law|ssrn=2923633|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4%, male migrants aged 15–64 with non-Western backgrounds had twice the conviction rate against the [[Danish Penal Code]] in 2018, compared to 2% for Danish men. In a given year, about 13% of all male descendants of non-Western migrants aged 17–24 are convicted against the penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/ligetil/grafik-indvandrede-og-efterkommere-halter-efter-etniske-danskere|title=GRAFIK Indvandrede og efterkommere halter efter etniske danskere|work=DR|access-date=2018-07-14|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that immigrant youth had higher incidence rates in 14 out of 17 delinquent acts. The gap is small for thefts and vandalism, and no significant differences for shoplifting, bullying and use of intoxicants.

A 2017 study in the ''[[European Economic Review]]'' found that the German government's policy of immigration of more than 3 million people of German descent to Germany after the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a significant increase in crime.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piopiunik|first=Marc|last2=Ruhose|first2=Jens|title=Immigration, regional conditions, and crime: evidence from an allocation policy in Germany |journal=European Economic Review|volume=92|pages=258|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.12.004|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects were strongest in regions with high unemployment, high preexisting crime levels or large shares of foreigners.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;

{{Further|Immigration to Greece|Crime in Greece}}

Illegal immigration to Greece has increased rapidly over the past several years. Tough immigration policies in Spain and Italy and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of African immigration flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from Asia and the Middle East—mainly Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bangladesh—to Greece appear to have increased as well.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org" /&gt; By 2012 it was estimated that more than 1 million illegal immigrants entered Greece.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=884|title=Greece: Illegal Immigration in the Midst of Crisis|work=migrationpolicy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders. In 2010, 90 percent of all apprehensions for unauthorized entry into the European Union took place in Greece, compared to 75 percent in 2009 and 50 percent in 2008.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org" /&gt;

In 2010, 132,524 persons were arrested for "illegal entry or stay" in Greece, a sharp increase from 95,239 in 2006. Nearly half of those arrested (52,469) were immediately deported, the majority of them being Albanians.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org" /&gt; Official statistics show that immigrants are responsible for about half of the criminal activity in Greece.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-19269891|title=Greeks confront crime wave amid austerity|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreigners are under-represented in the Irish prison population, according to 2010 figures.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

=== Italy ===
A study of [[immigration to Italy]] during the period 1990–2003 found that "immigration increases only the incidence of robberies, while leaving unaffected all other types of crime. Since robberies represent a very minor fraction of all criminal offenses, the effect on the overall crime rate is not significantly different from zero."&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Over the period 2007-2016, the crime rate among foreigners decreased by around 65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/03/03/has-immigration-really-led-to-an-increase-in-crime-in-italy/|title=Has immigration really led to an increase in crime in Italy?|date=2018-03-03|work=EUROPP|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of Italy before and after the January 2007 European Union enlargement found that giving legal status to the previously illegal immigrants from the new EU members states led to a "50 percent reduction in recidivism".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Legal Status and the Criminal Activity of Immigrants |journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|pages = 175–206|volume = 7|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/app.20140039|first = Giovanni|last = Mastrobuoni|first2 = Paolo|last2 = Pinotti|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors find that "legal status... explains one-half to two-thirds of the observed differences in crime rates between legal and illegal immigrants".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study on the 2007 so-called "click day" amnesty for undocumented immigrants in Italy found that the amnesty reduced the immigrant crime rate.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The authors estimate "that a ten percent increase in the share of immigrants legalized in one region would imply a 0.3 percent reduction in immigrants’ criminal charges in the following year in that same region".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Research shows that stricter enforcement of migration policy leads to a reduction in the crime rate of undocumented migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immigration Enforcement and Crime |journal = American Economic Review|pages = 205–209|volume = 105|issue = 5|doi = 10.1257/aer.p20151040|first = Paolo|last = Pinotti|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the latest report by Idos/Unar, immigrants made up 32,6% of prison population in 2015 (four percentage points less than five years before),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gli stranieri?

According to a 2013 report, "undocumented immigrants are responsible for the vast majority of crimes committed in Italy by immigrants... the share of undocumented immigrants varies between 60 and 70 percent for violent crimes, and it increases to 70–85 for property crime. In 2009, the highest shares are in burglary (85), car theft (78), theft (76), robbery (75), assaulting public officer / resisting arrest (75), [[handling stolen goods]] (73)."&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.frdb.org/upload/file/Report%201.pdf|title = Immigration policy and crime|date = 2013|access-date = |website = |publisher = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160202205357/http://www.frdb.org/upload/file/Report%201.pdf|archive-date = 2016-02-02|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 report notes that "immigrants accounted for almost 23 percent of the criminal charges although they represented only 6‐7 percent of the resident population" in 2010.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

According to 2007 data, the crime rate of legal immigrants was 1.2–1.4% whereas the crime rate was 0.8% for native Italians. The overrepresentation is partly due to the large number of young legal immigrants, the crime rate is 1.9% for legal immigrants aged 18–44 whereas it is 1.5% for their Italian peers; 0.4% for legal immigrants aged 45–64 years whereas it is 0.7% for their Italian peers; and for those over 65 years old, the crime rates is the same among natives and foreigners. 16.9% of crimes committed by legal immigrants aged 18–44 are linked to violations of immigration laws. By excluding those crimes, the crime rate of legal immigrants aged 18–44  is largely the same as that of same aged Italians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La criminalità degli immigrati, indagine "contro corrente"|url = http://www.redattoresociale.it/Notiziario/Articolo/274795/La-criminalita-degli-immigrati-indagine-contro-corrente|website = Redattore Sociale|access-date = 2016-01-17|language = it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{Further|Immigration to the Netherlands}}

Non-native Dutch youths, especially young Antillean and Surinamese Rotterdammers, commit more crimes than the average. More than half of [[Moroccan-Dutch]] male youths aged 18 to 24 years in Rotterdam have ever been investigated by the police, as compared to close to a quarter of native male youths. Eighteen percent of foreign-born young people aged from 18 to 24 have been investigated for crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/04-06-2009/veel-jonge-criminele-allochtonen-rotterdam|title=Veel jonge criminele allochtonen in Rotterdam|work=RTV Rijnmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/236094/Schokkende-cijfers-criminaliteit-Marokkanen-Rotterdam.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222175101/http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/236094/Schokkende-cijfers-criminaliteit-Marokkanen-Rotterdam.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-22|title=Schokkende cijfers criminaliteit Marokkanen Rotterdam|work=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2009 report commissioned by Justice Minister [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin]], 63% of the 447 teenagers convicted of serious crime are children of parents born outside the Netherlands. All these cases concern crime for which the maximum jail sentence is longer than eight years, such as robbery with violence, extortion, arson, public acts of violence, sexual assault, manslaughter and murder. The ethnic composition of the perpetrators was: native Dutch – 37%; Moroccans – 14%; Unknown origin – 14%; "other non-Westerners" – 9%; Turkish – 8%; Surinamese – 7%; Antillean – 7%; and "other Westerners" – 4%.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Two out of Three Serious Teenage Criminals are Immigrants |url=http://www.nisnews.nl/public/180309_1.htm |date=2013-02-08 |accessdate=2016-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208101230/http://www.nisnews.nl/public/180309_1.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the majority of cases, the judges did not consider the serious offences to be grave enough to necessitate an unconditional jail sentence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Analysis of police data for 2002 by ethnicity showed that 37.5 percent of all crime suspects living in the Netherlands were of foreign origin (including those of the second generation), almost twice as high as the share of immigrants in the Dutch population. The highest rates per capita were found among first and second generation male migrants of a non‐Western background. Of native male youths between the ages of 18 and 24, in 2002 2.2% were arrested, of all immigrant males of the same age 4.4%, of second generation non-Western males 6.4%. The crime rates for so‐called ‘Western migrants’ were very close to those of the native Dutch. In all groups, the rates for women were considerably lower than for men, lower than one percent, with the highest found among second generation non‐western migrants, 0.9% (Blom et al. 2005: 31).&lt;ref&gt;https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/16374/Leun%20van%20der.pdf?sequence=2&lt;/ref&gt;

For Moroccan immigrants, whether they originate from the underdeveloped parts of Morocco has a modest impact on their crime rate. One study finds that "crime rates in the Netherlands are higher among Moroccans who come from the countryside and the [[Rif]], or whose parents do, than among those who come from the urban provinces in Morocco and from outside the Rif, or whose parents do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Crime among young Moroccan men in the Netherlands: Does their regional origin matter? |journal = European Journal of Criminology|volume = 13|issue = 3|date = 2015-12-31|issn = 1477-3708|pages = 1477370815623566|doi = 10.1177/1477370815623566|language = en|first = Frank|last = Bovenkerk|first2 = Tineke|last2 = Fokkema}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, individuals with a Moroccan background were, not taking their age into account, almost six times as likely to be suspected for a crime compared to the native Dutch.

Using 2015 data, [[Statistics Netherlands]] concluded that non-Western male immigrant youths had been relatively often suspected of a crime: 5.42% in the group aged between 18 and 24, compared with 1.92% for native Dutch of the same age. For both male and female non-Western immigrants of all ages combined the numbers were 2.4% for the first generation and 4.54% for the second. The absolute crime rate had dropped by almost a half since the early twenty-first century, for both native Dutch and non-western immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/_pdf/2016/47/ji2016s_web.pdf|title=Annual Report on Integration 2016|last=|first=|publisher=Statistics Netherlands|year=2016|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=14–15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504191046/https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/_pdf/2016/47/ji2016s_web.pdf|archive-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a study concluded that asylum seekers in the Netherlands were less criminal than native Dutch with the same combination of age, gender and socio-economic position.&lt;ref&gt;Achbari, W., Leerkes, A.S., 2017, ''Van perceptie naar feit — Asielzoekers en buurtcriminaliteit'' WODC, Cahiers 2017-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Vedå kontrollere for alder og kjønn (M2) skjer det vesentlige endringer i andelgjerningspersoner, og da særlig for de landgruppene med høyest andel gjernings-personer. For eksempel synker andelen gjerningspersoner fra Afghanistan fra 127,6til 93,2 per 1000 (en reduksjon på 27 prosent), og for Irak synker andelen fra 125,3til 102,1 per 1000 (en reduksjon på 21 prosent). Dette betyr at for disse landenehenger overrepresentasjonen i vesentlig grad sammen med kjønns- og alders-strukturen. Korreksjon for alder og kjønn gir også en vesentlig reduksjon i andelengjerningspersoner blant innvandrere fra Litauen, Somalia og Irak, og en vissreduksjon ses også for alle andre grupper med unntak for innvandrere fra Danmark, Finland, Filipinene, Thailand og Nord-Amerika.[...] Å justere for bosted (M3) gir ingen eller liten endring for samtlige landgrupper.[...] Å kontrollere for sysselsetting (M4) reduserer imidlertid andelengjerningspersoner ytterligere for de landgruppene som fremdeles har relativt høyandel gjerningspersoner – herunder Somalia og øvrige Afrika, Irak og Iran.[...] Samlet sett er derfor rimelig åsi at sysselsetting forklarer noe av overrepresentasjonen for enkelte land ogregioner, selv om forskjellene jevnt over ikke er veldig store.

Det er også viktig å påpeke at kjønn, alder,bosted og sysselsetting kan forklare hele overrepresentasjonen kun blantinnvandrere fra Polen.

A 2011 report by Statistics Norway found that immigrants are over-represented in crime statistics but that there is substantial variation by country of origin.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kriminalitet og straff blant innvandrere og øvrig befolkning|url = https://www.ssb.no/sosiale-forhold-og-kriminalitet/artikler-og-publikasjoner/kriminalitet-og-straff-blant-innvandrere-og-ovrig-befolkning|website = ssb.no|access-date = 2016-01-26|language = nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report furthermore found that "the overrepresentation is substantially reduced when adjusting for population structure—for some groups as much as 45 per cent, but there are also some groups where the over-representation still is large."&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; According to the report, the data for 2009 shows that first-generation immigrants from Africa were three times more likely than ethnic Norwegians (or rather individuals who are neither first- nor second-generation immigrants) to be convicted of a felony while Somali immigrants in particular being 4.4 times more likely to be convicted of a felony than an ethnic Norwegian was. Similarly, Iraqis and Pakistanis were found to have rates of conviction for felonies greater than ethnic Norwegians by a factor of 3 and 2.6 respectively. Another finding was that second-generation African and Asian immigrants had a higher rate of convictions for felonies than first-generation immigrants. While first-generation African immigrants had conviction rates for felonies of 16.7 per 1,000 individuals over the age of 15, for second-generation immigrants the rate was 28 per 1,000—an increase of over 60%. And for Asian immigrants an increase from 9.3 per 1,000 to 17.1 per 1,000 was observed. In 2010 13% of sexual crimes charges were filed against first generation immigrants who make up 7.8% of the population—a rate of over-representation of 1.7.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

In 2010, a spokesperson for the Oslo Police Department stated that every case of assault rapes in Oslo in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 was committed by a non-Western immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.6944861&lt;/ref&gt; When only perpetrators in the solved cases were counted, it was found that four of the victims in the 16 unsolved cases described the perpetrator as being of White (not necessarily Norwegian) ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myten om ikke-vestlige voldtektsmenn sprekker|date=May 2, 2012|publisher=[[Utrop]]|language=Norwegian|author=Tanveer Hussain|trans-title=The myth about non-Western rapists is breaking up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the Oslo Police District shows that of the 131 individuals charged with the 152 rapes in which the perpetrator could be identified, 45.8% were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin while 54.2% were of Norwegian, other European or American origin. In the cases of "assault rape", i.e. rape aggravated by physical violence, a category that included 6 of the 152 cases and 5 of the 131 identified individuals, the 5 identified individuals were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin. In the cases of assault rape where the individual responsible was not identified and the police relied on the description provided by the victim, 8 of the perpetrators were of African/dark-skinned appearance, 4 were Western/light/Nordic and 4 had an Asian appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voldtekt i den globale byen|url = https://www.politi.no/oslo/aktuelt/nyhetsarkiv/2011_05/Nyhet_9976.xml|website = www.politi.no|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an investigation into court cases involving domestic violence against children showed that 47% of the cases involved parents who were both born abroad. According to a researcher at [[Norwegian Police University College]] the over-representation was due to cultural ([[Family honor|honor culture]]) and legal differences in Norway and foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrk.no/mr/nrk-undersoking_-47-prosent-av-alle-born-i-familievaldsaker-er-innvandrarar-1.14204426|title=NRK-undersøking: 47 prosent av alle born i familievaldsaker er innvandrarar|last=Trovåg|first=Einar Orten|work=NRK|access-date=2018-09-22|language=nn-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study finds that the rates of crimes committed by immigrants are substantially higher than nationals.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immigration and Crime in Spain, 1999–2006|url = https://ideas.repec.org/p/fda/fdaddt/2008-34.html|publisher = FEDEA|date = 2008-01-01|first = Cesar|last = Alonso|first2 = Nuno|last2 = Garoupa|first3 = Marcelo|last3 = Perera|first4 = Pablo|last4 = Vazquez}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study finds that "the arrival of immigrants has resulted in a lack of progress in the reduction of offences against property and in a minor increase in the number of offences against Collective Security (i.e. drugs and trafficking). In the case of nationals, their contribution to the increase in the crime rate is primarily concentrated in offences against persons."&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; By controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors, the gap between immigrants and natives is reduced but not fully. The authors also find "that a higher proportions of American, non-UE European, and African immigrants tend to widen the crime differential, the effect being larger for the latter ones".&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The same paper provides supports for the notion that labour market conditions impact the relationship between crime and immigration. Cultural differences were also statistically detected.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This study has been criticized for not using strong instruments for identifying causality: the "instruments (lagged values of the covariates and measures of the service share of GDP in a province) are not convincing in dealing with the endogeneity of migrant location choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immigration and crime|url = http://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781845426293.00028.xml|url-access=subscription|journal = International Handbook on the Economics of Migration|pages = 353–372|doi = 10.4337/9781782546078.00028|first = Brian|last = Bell|first2 = Stephen|last2 = Machin|year = 2013|isbn = 9781782546078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) published a study that analyzes records in the Register of Convicted in 2008. The data show that immigrants are overrepresented in the crime statistics: 70% of all crimes were committed by Spaniards and 30% by foreigners.&lt;ref name="tercerainformacion.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tercerainformacion.es/spip.php?article10906|title=El 70% de la delincuencia es perpetrada por españoles según el INE|work=tercerainformacion.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners make up 15% of the population.&lt;ref name="tercerainformacion.es"/&gt;

{{further|Immigration to Switzerland|Crime in Switzerland#Immigrant criminality}}

In [[Switzerland]], 69.7% of the prison population did not have Swiss citizenship, compared to 22.1% of total resident population (as of 2008).
The figure of arrests by residence status is not usually made public. In 1997, when there were for the first time more foreigners than Swiss among the convicts under criminal law (out of a fraction of 20.6% of the total population at the time), a special report was compiled by the [[Federal Department of Justice and Police]] (published in 2001) which for the year 1998 found an arrest rate per 1000 adult population of 2.3 for Swiss citizens, 4.2 for legally resident aliens and 32 for asylum seekers. 21% of arrests made concerned individuals with no residence status, who were thus either ''[[sans papiers]]'' or "crime tourists" without any permanent residence in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vimentis.ch/d/publikation/154/Ausl%E4nderkriminalit%E4t+in+der+Schweiz.html|title=Ausländerkriminalität in der Schweiz |work=Vimentis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found that asylum seekers exposed to conflict during childhood were far more prone to violent crimes than co-national asylum seekers who were not exposed to conflict.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ftp.cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=11079|title=The Violent Legacy of Victimization: Post-Conflict Evidence on Asylum Seekers, Crimes and Public Policy in Switzerland|website=ftp.cepr.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict exposed cohorts have a higher propensity to target victims from their own nationality.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Offering labor market access to the asylum seekers eliminates the entire effect of conflict exposure on crime propensity.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

In 2010, a statistic was published which listed delinquency by nationality (based on 2009 data).
To avoid distortions due to demographic structure, only the male population aged between 18 and 34 was considered for each group. From the study, it became clear that crime rate is highly correlated on the country of origin of the various migrant groups.
Thus, immigrants from [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Austria]] had a significantly lower crime rate than Swiss citizens (60% to 80%), while immigrants from [[Angola]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Algeria]] had a crime rate of above 600% of that of Swiss population.
In between these extremes were immigrants from [[Former Yugoslavia]], with crime rates of between 210% and 300% of the Swiss value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Neue-Statistik-Tamilen-sind-krimineller-als-ExJugoslawen/story/27784193 Neue Statistik: Tamilen sind krimineller als Ex-Jugoslawen], ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'' 12 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those with immigrant background are over-represented in Swedish crime statistics, but research shows that socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment, poverty, exclusion language, and other skills explain most of difference in crime rates between immigrants and natives.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/swedish-immigration-is-not-out-of-control-it-s-actually-getting-more-restrictive-a7605071.html|title=Why Swedish immigration is not out of control|date=2017-03-01|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sweden-crime-trump-idUKKBN16024W|title=Sweden - not perfect, but not Trump's immigrant-crime nightmare|date=2017-02-21|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/02/21/sweden-migrants-trump/98187090/|title=Sweden to Trump: Immigrants aren't causing a crime wave|work=USA Today|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/20/what-statistics-say-about-immigration-and-sweden/|title=Facts on Sweden, immigration and crime|work=PolitiFact|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/20/trump-asked-people-to-look-at-whats-happening-in-sweden-heres-whats-happening-there/|title=Analysis {{!}} Trump asked people to ‘look at what’s happening … in Sweden.’ Here’s what’s happening there.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170220-after-trump-comments-reality-crime-migrants-sweden|title=After Trump comments, the reality of crime and migrants in Sweden|date=2017-02-20|work=France 24|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data gathered by Swedish police from October 2015 to January 2016, 5,000 police calls out of 537,466 involved asylum seekers and refugees.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/ett-fatal-brott-i-sverige-kopplas-till-flyktingar/|title=Ett fåtal brott i Sverige kopplas till flyktingar |date=2016-02-09|work=DN.SE|access-date=2017-04-02|language=sv-se}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Felipe Estrada, professor of criminology at [[Stockholm University]], this shows how the media gives disproportionate attention to and exaggerates the alleged criminal involvement of asylum seekers and refugees.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Henrik Selin, head of the Department for Intercultural Dialogue at the [[Swedish Institute]], noted that allegations of a surge in immigrant crime after the intake of more than 160,000 immigrants in 2015 have been “highly exaggerated... there is nothing to support the claim that the crime rate took off after the 160,000 came in 2015.” While it’s true that immigrants have been over-represented among those committing crimes—particularly in some suburban communities heavily populated by immigrants, he said—the issue of crime and immigration is complex.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Speaking in February 2017, Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at [[Malmö University|Malmo University]], noted that while immigrants where disproportionately represented among crime suspects, many of the victims of immigrant crimes were other immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/europe/trump-pursues-his-attack-on-sweden-with-scant-evidence.html|title=From an Anchor’s Lips to Trump’s Ears to Sweden’s Disbelief|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=2017-02-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-02|last2=Chan|first2=Sewell|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish Police report from May 2016 found that there have been 123 incidents of sexual molestation in the country's public baths and pools in 2015 (112 of them were directed against girls). In 55% of cases, the perpetrator could be reasonably identified. From these identified perpetrators, 80% were of foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Lagesbild%20over%20sexuella%20ofredanden.pdf (page 15, section 3.8.1.5)&lt;/ref&gt; The same report found 319 cases of sexual assault on public streets and parks in 2015. In these cases, only 17 suspected perpetrators have been identified, 4 of them Swedish nationals with the remainder being of foreign origin. Another 17 were arrested, but not identified.&lt;ref&gt;https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Lagesbild%20over%20sexuella%20ofredanden.pdf (page 11, section 3.8.1.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, newspaper [[Expressen]] investigated [[Gang rape|gang]] [[Rape in Sweden|rape]] court cases from the two preceding years and found that there were 43 men having been convicted. Their average age was 21 and 13 were under the age of 18 when the crime was committed. Of the convicted, 40 out of the 43 were either immigrants (born abroad) or born in Sweden to immigrant parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/brottscentralen/qs/de-ar-mannen-som-valdtar-tillsammans/|title=De är män som våldtar kvinnor tillsammans: "Jag tyckte det var en rolig grej att filma"|last=|first=|date=|work=Expressen|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320113923/https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/brottscentralen/qs/de-ar-mannen-som-valdtar-tillsammans/|archive-date=20 March 2018|dead-url=|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another investigation by newspaper Aftonbladet found that of 112 men and boys convicted for gang rape since July 2012, 82 were born outside Europe.

Also professor Henrik Tham stated that there was a clear over-representatation of foreigners and cultural differences, while also adding that few cultures allow such behaviour. Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] instead emphasized socioeconomic factors and that police may be more diligient in investigating crimes by foreigners.&lt;ref name=":51" /&gt;

==== Past immigration to Sweden ====
A 2014 survey of several studies found that people with foreign background are, on average, two times more likely to commit crimes than those born in Sweden. This figure has remained stable since the 1970s, despite the changes in numbers of immigrants and their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amber Beckley, Johan Kardell and Jerzy Sarnecki|title=The Routledge Handbook on Crime and International Migration|pages=46–47|publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies reporting a link on immigration and crime have been criticized for not taking into account the population's age, employment and education level, all of which affect level of crime. In general, research that takes these factors into account does not support the idea that there is a link between immigration and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amber Beckley, Johan Kardell and Jerzy Sarnecki|title=The Routledge Handbook on Crime and International Migration|page=42|publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention found that people of foreign background were 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people with a Swedish background, including immigrants being four times more likely to be suspected of for lethal violence and robbery, five times more likely to be investigated for sex crimes, and three times more likely to be investigated for violent assault.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brottslighet bland personer födda i Sverige och i utlandet - Brå|url = https://www.bra.se/bra/publikationer/arkiv/publikationer/2005-12-14-brottslighet-bland-personer-fodda-i-sverige-och-i-utlandet.html|website = www.bra.se|access-date = 2016-01-26|language = sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20051214/2683|title=Immigrants behind 25% of Swedish crime|work=thelocal.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was based on statistics for those "suspected" of offences. The Council for Crime Prevention said that there was "little difference" in the statistics for those suspected of crimes and those actually convicted.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; A 2006 government report suggests that immigrants face discrimination by law enforcement, which could lead to meaningful differences between those suspected of crimes and those actually convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Är rättvisan rättvis?

A 2013 study done by [[Stockholm University]] showed that the 2005 study's difference was due to the socioeconomic differences (e.g. family income, growing up in a poor neighborhood) between people born in Sweden and those born abroad.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about migration and crime in Sweden|url=http://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/|publisher=[[Government of Sweden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Crime as a Price of Inequality?

A study published in 1997 attempted to explain the higher than average crime rates among immigrants to Sweden. It found that between 20 and 25 percent of asylum seekers to Sweden had experienced [[physical torture]], and many suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Other refugees had witnessed a close relative being killed.&lt;ref name=tonry&gt;{{cite journal|title= Ethnicity, Crime and Immigration: Comparative and Cross-National Perspectives|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|author= Michael Tonry|journal=[[Crime and Justice]]|page=24|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 study reported that persons from [[North Africa]] and Western Asia were over-represented in crime statistics,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; whereas a 1997 paper additionally found immigrants from Finland, South America, Arab world and Eastern Europe to be over-represented in crime statistics.&lt;ref name=tonry/&gt; Studies have found that native-born Swedes with high levels of unemployment are also over-represented in crime statistics.&lt;ref name=politifact&gt;{{cite web|author=Miriam Valverde|title=What the statistics say about Sweden, immigration and crime|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/20/what-statistics-say-about-immigration-and-sweden/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention determined that between 1985 and 1989 individuals born in Iraq, North Africa (Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia), Africa (excluding Uganda and the North African countries), other Middle East (Jordan, Palestine, Syria), Iran and Eastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria) were convicted of rape at rates 20, 23, 17, 9, 10 and 18 greater than individuals born in Sweden respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pdf-archive.com/2011/05/08/br-1996-2-invandrares-och-invandrares-barns-brottslighet-1/br-1996-2-invandrares-och-invandrares-barns-brottslighet-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=April 2017}} Both the 1996 and 2005 reports have been criticized for using insufficient controls for socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Historically, Irish immigrants to the United Kingdom in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were considered over-represented amongst those appearing in court. Research suggests that policing strategy may have put immigrants at a disadvantage by targeting only the most public forms of crime, while locals were more likely able to engage in the types of crimes that could be conducted behind locked doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Criminal were the Irish?

One of the first political analyses in the U.S. of the relationship between immigration and crime was performed in the beginning of the 20th century by the [[Dillingham Commission]], which found a relationship especially for immigrants from non-Northern European countries, resulting in the sweeping 1920s [[immigration reduction]] acts, including the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921, which favored immigration from [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html Open Collections Program: Immigration to the US, Dillingham Commission (1907–1910)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research is skeptical of the conclusion drawn by the Dillingham Commission. One study finds that "major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses."&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immigration, crime, and incarceration in early twentieth-century america |journal = Demography|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 0070-3370|pages = 739–763|volume = 46|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/dem.0.0076|first = Carolyn|last = Moehling|first2 = Anne Morrison|last2 = Piehl|pmc = 2831353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Immigration to Australia|Crime in Australia}}

Foreigners are under-represented in the Australian prison population, according to 2010 figures.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; A 1987 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology noted that studies had consistently found that migrant populations in Australia had lower crime rates than the Australian-born population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/archive/migration-ethnicity-and-crime-in-australian-society|title=Migration, ethnicity and crime in Australian society|last=Hazlehurst|first=Kayleen|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged link between immigration and criminality has been a longstanding meme in Australian history with many of the original immigrants being convicts. During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the "Greek conspiracy case" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.&lt;ref name="Emacia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.&lt;ref name="Emacia"/&gt;

The only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.&lt;ref name="Emacia"/&gt;

[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in ''[[The Age]]'', noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community.&lt;ref name="Taycc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oakes|first=Dan|title=African youth crime concern|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/african-youth-crime-concern-20120819-24glt.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were "vastly over-represented" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Statistics raise questions about calls to deport youth offenders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-04/statistics-raise-questions-about-calls-to-deport-youth-offenders/8087410|work=ABC News|date=4 December 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar overrepresentation occurs in [[Kenyan]]-born youths. In January 2018, Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton that there was an "issue with overrepresentation by African youth in serious and violent offending as well as public disorder issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police admit Melbourne has African gang problem amid political stoush|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-02/street-gangs-are-a-problem-in-melbourne-police-admit/9297984|work=ABC News|date=2 January 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s, following a series of arrests in [[Melbourne]] on terrorism-related charges, Australian security officials expressed concerns of possible attacks by [[Al-Qaeda]]-affiliated extremists from North Africa.&lt;ref name="Aafabtp"&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia arrests 'foil army base terror plot'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/australia-arrests-foil-army-base-terror-plot-1767027.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, six applicants brought charges of impropriety against several members of the Victorian Police, the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, and the State of Victoria in the Melbourne areas of [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]] and [[Kensington]]. The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005–2008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary "stop and search" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police "field contact". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its "field contact" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Hmvk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flemington &amp; Kensington Community Legal Centre – Race Discrimination Case Documents – Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soerdhmvnk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael &amp; Ors v Nick Konstantinidis &amp; Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth. The 2014 figures show that in general native-born Australians, New Zealanders, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Sudanese, Iraqi and people from Fiji are responsible for higher share of crime than their share in the population (overrepresented), while people from the UK, the Chinese and people from Philippines are responsible for a lower share (underrepresented).&lt;ref name="Prisoners "&gt;{{cite web|title= Prisoners in Australia, 2014|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4517.02014?OpenDocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perception of immigrant criminality ==
Research suggests that people overestimate the relationship between immigration and criminality. A 2016 study of Belgium found that living in an ethnically diverse community lead to a greater fear of crime, unrelated to the actual crime rate.&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hooghe|first=Marc|last2=de Vroome|first2=Thomas|date=2016-01-01|title=The relation between ethnic diversity and fear of crime: An analysis of police records and survey data in Belgian communities |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|volume=50|pages=66–75|doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2015.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study found that the increase in immigration flows into western European countries that took place in the 2000s did "not affect crime victimization, but it is associated with an increase in the fear of crime, the latter being consistently and positively correlated with the natives’ unfavourable attitude toward immigrants."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immigration and crime: evidence from victimization data |journal = Journal of Population Economics|date = 2015-03-04|issn = 0933-1433|pages = 697–736|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00148-015-0543-2|first = Luca|last = Nunziata}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans dramatically overestimate the relationship between refugees and terrorism.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; A 2018 study found that media coverage of immigrants in the United States has a general tendency to emphasize illegality and/or criminal behavior in a way that is inconsistent with actual immigrant demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=Picturing immigration: how the media criminalizes immigrants|url=|journal=Politics, Groups, and Identities|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/21565503.2018.1484375|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, University of California, San Diego political scientist Claire Adida, Stanford University political scientist David Laitin and Sorbonne University economist Marie-Anne Valfort argue "fear-based policies that target groups of people according to their religion or region of origin are counter-productive. Our own research, which explains the failed integration of Muslim immigrants in France, suggests that such policies can feed into a vicious cycle that damages national security. French Islamophobia—a response to cultural difference—has encouraged Muslim immigrants to withdraw from French society, which then feeds back into French Islamophobia, thus further exacerbating Muslims’ alienation, and so on. Indeed, the failure of French security in 2015 was likely due to police tactics that intimidated rather than welcomed the children of immigrants—an approach that makes it hard to obtain crucial information from community members about potential threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adida|first=Claire L.|last2=Laitin|first2=David D.|last3=Valfort|first3=Marie-Anne|date=2017-02-01|title=The Wrong Way to Stop Terrorism|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-02-01/wrong-way-stop-terrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement for immigration restriction that the Dillingham Commission helped to stimulate culminated in the [[National Origins Formula]], part of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which capped national immigration at 150,000 annually and completely barred immigration from [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html Open Collections Program: Immigration to the US, Dillingham Commission (1907-1910)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability sidebar}}
The '''InterACT Disability Arts Festival''' is an annual three-day event which showcases the talents of disabled performers, authors, artists, and artisans in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The event has been described by the [[Minister for Disability Issues]], [[Tariana Turia]], as "a chance for people of all abilities to celebrate and share their talents with us all"&lt;ref name="tariana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?id=79010 |title=Minister encourages wider community to support New Zealand's first Disability Arts Festival this weekend |publisher=Infonews.co.nz |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was inspired by the [[Awakenings Festival]] of [[Horsham, Victoria]], Australia. It wasn't until five years after a visit to the 2007 Awakenings festival by three representatives of the Interacting Theatre Company, that the inaugural InterACT festival was held in Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Chris Laidlaw, Chris Tally Evans, Paula Crimmens, Trina Armstrong|date=2011-10-30 |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Sunday Morning : 30 Oct 2011 : Ideas for 30 October 2011 |medium=Radio broadcast |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2501301/ideas-for-30-october-2011 |accessdate=2013-09-20 |time=00:28:40 |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |quote=I work for Interacting, which is a disabled arts theatre company. And I went with Trina and our Chair[person] to Australia, to the Awakenings festival in 2007. It's taken us this long to decide we wanted to put on a festival, because essentially we're a theatre company and we do two productions a year. But last year we decided we were in a position with sufficient support networks and relationships with other organisations to go for it, and to put on a New Zealand version of the annual Awakenings festival in Australia. |ref= }}&lt;!--{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2501301/ideas-for-30-october-2011 |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Sunday Morning : 30 Oct 2011 : Ideas for 30 October 2011 |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 edition of the festival is scheduled for 23–25 October and the venue will be Corban's Estate Arts Centre, [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interacting.org.nz/interactfestival/ |title=InterACT Disability Arts Festival |publisher=Interacting.org.nz |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jananam''''' (English: Birth) is a South Indian Tamil film directed by [[Ramesh Selvan]], who earlier directed ''[[Ulavuthurai]]'' with [[Vijayakanth]]. The film stars [[Arun Vijay]] and [[Priyanka Trivedi]] in lead roles. The film was launched in 2002 and got delayed and released in 2004.

==Plot==
Surya (Arun Kumar) is an angry young man who is a post-graduate looking for a job. His girlfriend is Sruthi (Priyanka Trivedi) who always tries to control his rage as he fights against injustice in society. He fights for a friend (Charly) who is a gold medalist but does not get a job as he is not able to get a loan from a bank as he does not have any collateral to pledge. Another gold medalist friend dies in an accident after running helter-skelter hunting for a job.

All this changes Surya’s life especially after he meets a well-known writer and intellectual, Udaya Murthy (Raghuvaran) who urges him along with others to start a movement against corruption and injustice in society. They start an Unemployed Graduate Association which rubs the local politician and don Muthukaruppan (Asish Vidyarthi) the wrong way. The idealist Surya turns into a raging force after Murthy is shot dead by police and he is jailed. In jail, he is brutally tortured by the police as he becomes a rallying point for the youth who are fighting unemployment.

==Production==
The film was announced in 2002 with Arun and Priyanka playing lead roles. [[Ramesh Selvan]] was also directing ''Kaalaatpadai'' with newcomers at the same time. The film got delayed by a year due to financing problems; also Priyanka's marriage caused the delay and it was finally released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/11206.html |title=Arun Kumar hoping for a new birth in Jananam - Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=2004-11-01 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/11966.html |title=All troubles over for'em - Bollywood Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/preview.php?ctid=5&amp;cid=2423&amp;id=13607359 |title=Welcome to |publisher=Sify.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tachi Ichō no Maru inverted.png|thumb|Tachi Ichō no Maru]]
'''Kataoka Ichizō''' is a [[kabuki]] stage name which originated in the [[Osaka]] theatre, but whose actors are now based in [[Tokyo]]. The name has been passed down from the early 19th-century to the present day through six generations. The {{Nihongo|[[jōmon]]|定紋}} family crest used to represent the line is the {{Nihongo|''ichō no maru''|銀杏丸}} inverted ginko leaf design.&lt;ref&gt;Katō&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kataoka Ichizō I ==

=== Biography ===

{{Nihongo|Kataoka Ichizō I|片岡市蔵}} was born {{Nihongo|Fujikawa Shōzaburō|藤川鐘三郎}} in 1792, the son of a low-ranking kabuki actor who gave him his initial training. In 1810 he began an apprenticeship under respected actor {{Nihongo|Kataoka Nizaemon VII|片岡仁左衛門}}, and took the name Kataoka Ichizō I.&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
He began his career by performing in minor Osaka area {{Nihongo|''hamashibai''|浜芝居}} theatres and on stages erected within [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] grounds. In 1820, he became attached to Osaka's {{Nihongo|Ōnishi|大西}} theatre. He also travelled throughout Japan, performing in [[Edo]], [[Kyoto]], [[Nagoya]] and [[Ise, Mie|Ise]].&lt;ref&gt;Katō&lt;/ref&gt; He took actors Kataoka Ichizō II and Kataoka Ichōmaru under his wing as disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
His large build and loud voice were well suited to the {{Nihongo|''katakiyaku''|敵役}} and {{Nihongo|''jitsuaku''|実悪}} villain roles in which he specialized. He was so admired for these performances that he earned the nickname {{Nihongo|"Jitsuaku no oyadama"|実悪の親玉}}: King of the Villains. He was, however, also credited with the ability to deliver subtle {{Nihongo|''[[sewamono]]''|世話物}} dramatic performances, particularly in {{Nihongo|''fukeyaku''|老役}} elderly man roles.&lt;ref&gt;Katō&lt;/ref&gt;
Ichizō I held the name from 1810 to 1858 when he took the name {{Nihongo|Takekawa Ichizō|竹川市蔵}}.&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From 1860 to the spring of 1862, Ichizō took a break from performing due to eye problems and encroaching senility.&lt;ref&gt;Katō&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th [[Japanese calendar|lunar month]] of 1862 he appeared on stage for the last time in the play "Ōmi Genji Senjin Yakata." He died in the 7th lunar month of 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kataoka Ichizō II ==

=== Biography ===

Very little is known of Ichizō II's personal details, including the dates of his birth and death. He began his career with the Kataoka family as a disciple of Ichizō I, but went on to study with the Nakamura clan under [[Nakamura Utaemon IV]]. His speciality was supporting ''katakiyaku'' villain roles. After spending some time in the late 1850s performing in Edo to great acclaim, he returned to Osaka where he rejoined the Kataoka family. He took the name {{Nihongo|Kataoka Ichizō II|2代目片岡市蔵}} early in 1865, almost three years after the death of his predecessor. His name ceased appearing on kabuki playbills in the last years of the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names ===

Ichizō II was associated with the following names throughout his career:&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kataoka Ichizō III ==

=== Biography ===

{{Nihongo|Kataoka Ichizō III|3代目片岡市蔵}} was born in 1851 in the Osaka-area town of {{Nihongo|Soemon|宗右衛門町}}. His father was artist {{Nihongo|Kameya Kichibe|亀屋吉兵衛}}, and his two older brothers were kabuki actors {{Nihongo|Mimasu Inemaru|三桝稲丸}} and {{Nihongo|Kataoka Gadō II|2代目片岡我當}}. His first professional appearance was on an Osaka stage in 1855. He was known for his wide-ranging skills, and particularly his portrayal of ''katakiyaku'' villains and ''fukeyaku'' elderly men. Following the sudden death of his brother, Inemaru, Ichizō III was forced to give up kabuki and begin an apprenticeship in the trades. He returned to the stage, however, becoming a disciple of Kataoka Nizaemon VIII in 1886. In 1887, he became Ichizō III, a title he held until his death in December, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kataoka Ichizō IV ==

=== Biography ===

{{Nihongo|Kataoka Ichizō IV|4代目片岡市蔵}} was born in the Shitaya district of Tokyo in 1880. Later he was adopted by Ichizō III, who trained him until his debut at Tokyo's [[Nakamura-za]] theatre in 1887. He continued to perform until 1904 when the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] resulted in his being sent to the front. In 1906, he was discharged from the military. The general euphoria over Japan's military victory carried over to the theatre, where houses were frequently packed. In 1909, almost 3 full years after the death of his adoptive father, he succeeded to the Ichizō line. He went on to hold this title until his death in 1926, meaning that his career spanned the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] and [[Taishō period|Taishō]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Nojima 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
Ichizō IV was noted for his loud voice and large personality, which made him well-suited to strong leading roles. He was praised in particular for his {{Nihongo|''[[onnagata]]''|女形}} female roles, as well as his {{Nihongo|''[[shosagoto]]''|所作事}} and {{Nihongo|buyō|舞踊}} [[Japanese dance|dance]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;Aragōro 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sheep head - Smalahove - kalleh pacheh.jpg|thumb|Fresh and prebaked sheep heads being sold in a market]]
'''Khash''' ({{lang-hy|խաշ}}; {{lang-az|xaş}}; {{lang-ka|ხაში}}, Khashi), '''pacha''' ({{lang-fa|پاچه}}; {{lang-al|paçe}}; {{lang-ar|باجة}}; {{lang-bs|pače}}; {{lang-bg|пача}}; {{lang-gr| πατσάς}}), '''kalle-pache''' ({{lang-fa|کله‌پاچه}}; {{lang-tr|kelle paça}}), or '''kakaj šürpi''' ({{lang-cv|какай шÿрпи}}) refers to a dish of boiled cow or sheep parts, which might include the head, feet, and stomach ([[tripe]]). It is a traditional dish in [[Afghanistan]], [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Turkey]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''khash'' originates from the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] verb {{transl|hy|xašel}} ({{lang|hy|խաշել}}), which means "to boil".&lt;ref name="Adjarian"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Hrachia Adjarian|Adjarian, Hrachia]] |url=http://www.nayiri.com/imagedDictionaryBrowser.jsp?dictionaryId=7&amp;pageNumber=1051 |title=Armenian Etymological Dictionary |volume=2 |year=1973 |page=346 |language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dish, initially called ''khashoy'', is mentioned by a number of medieval Armenian authors, including [[Grigor Magistros]] (11th century), [[Mkhitar Heratsi]] (12th century), and Yesayi Nchetsi (13th century).&lt;ref name="Adjarian"/&gt;

The [[Persian language|Persian]] term {{transl|fa|pāče}} literally means "trotter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vajehyab.com/amid/پاچه |title=پاچه |trans-title=pāče |language=fa |work=Amid Dictionary |access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of a sheep's head and trotters is called {{transl|fa|kalle-pāče}}, which literally means "head [and] trotter" in Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vajehyab.com/amid/کله+پاچه |title=کله پاچه |trans-title=kalle pāče |language=fa |work=Amid Dictionary |access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Caucasus ==
[[File:Azerbaijani khash.jpg|thumb|[[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]] khash]]
Khash is a purist meal with great parsimony in ingredients. The feet are depilated, cleaned, kept in cold water in order to get rid of bad smell, and boiled in water all night long, until the water has become a thick broth and the meat has separated from the bones.{{cn |date=April 2018}} No salt or spices are added during the boiling process. The dish is served hot. One may add [[salt]], [[garlic]], [[lemon]] juice, or [[vinegar]] according to one's taste. Dried [[lavash]] is often crumbled into the broth to add substance.{{cn |date=April 2018}} Khash is generally served with a variety of other foods, such as hot [[bell pepper|green and yellow pepper]]s, [[pickling|pickle]]s, [[radish]]es, [[cheese]], and fresh [[leaf vegetable|greens]] such as [[garden cress|cress]]. The meal is almost always accompanied by [[vodka]] (preferably [[morus (plant)|mulberry]] vodka) and [[mineral water]].{{cn |date=April 2018}}

In Georgia, Khashi is served together with onions, milk, salt and [[Chacha (brandy)|chacha]]. Usually they eat this dish early morning, or during hangovers.

In the medieval Armenian medical textbook ''[[Relief of Fevers]]'' (1184), khash was described as a dish with healing properties, e.g., against snuffle. It was recommended to eat it while drinking wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Mkhitar Heratsi|Heratsi, Mkhitar]] |title=Relief of Fevers |url=http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/etcs/arm/heraci/herac.htm |chapter=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of ailment, khash from the legs of yeanling was advised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Mkhitar Heratsi|Heratsi, Mkhitar]] |title=Relief of Fevers |url=http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/etcs/arm/heraci/herac.htm |chapter=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly a nutritious winter food, it is now considered a delicacy, and is enjoyed as a festive winter meal. Modern-day convention in [[Armenia]] dictates that it should be consumed during the month that has an ''r'' in its name, thus excluding May, June, July, and August (''[[month]] names in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] are derivatives of the [[Latin]] names''). Khash is traditionally consumed during cold months in [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].{{cn |date=April 2018}}

In the [[list of dishes from the Caucasus|Caucasus]], khash is often seen as a food to be consumed in the mornings after a party, as it is known to battle hangovers (especially by men) and eaten with a "[[hair of the dog]]" vodka chaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elliott |first=Mark |title=Azerbaijan with Excursions to Georgia |publisher=Trailblazer |year=2010 |page=356 |isbn=978-1-905864-23-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much [[ritual]] involved in khash parties. Many participants abstain from eating the previous evening, and insist upon using only their hands to consume the unusual (and often unwieldy) meal. Because of the potency and strong smell of the meal, and because it is eaten early in the mornings and so often enjoyed in conjunction with alcohol, khash is usually served on the weekend or on [[holiday]]s.{{cn |date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''Kongsi Raya''', also known as '''Gongxi Raya'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/7ae4ad3b-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad|title=Participants at Gongxi Raya Celebration at Government Press  …|website=www.nas.gov.sg|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a [[Malaysia]]n [[portmanteau]], denoting the [[Chinese New Year]] and [[Hari Raya Aidilfitri]] ([[Eid ul-Fitr]]) [[festival]]s. As the timing of these festivals fluctuate due to their reliance on [[lunar calendar]]s, they occasionally occur close to one another. For the sake of convenience, Malaysian media took to combining "kongsi" (from the traditional Chinese New Year greeting, ''gong xi fa cai'') and "raya", the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for "celebration", which is often used to denote the [[Muslim]] Eid ul-Fitr festival ("Hari Raya Aidilfitri"). As the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Deepavali]] also occasionally occurs around Eid ul-Fitr, the portmanteau of [[DeepaRaya]] has also come into common usage.

Malaysia's national-level Kongsi Raya celebrations are now held in [[Johor]]'s Danga Bay where they draw up to 300,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;"''Johor's Danga Bay to be venue for `Kongsi Raya' celebrations''", [[New Straits Times]], December 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A related portmanteau to Kongsi Raya is ''kongsi puasa'', referring to some non-Muslims who also observe the traditional Muslim [[fasting|fast]] during [[Ramadhan]].&lt;ref&gt;Razak, Dzulkifli (Oct. 22, 2006). "Troublesome kiasu affair", p. 35. ''New Sunday Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Puasa'' being the Malay word for fast.)

Like DeepaRaya, Kongsi Raya has been criticised by some conservative Muslims for allegedly placing a Muslim festival on par with a non-Muslim one. This includes [[PAS (political party)|PAS]], a major opposition [[political party]], which has expressed concern that the practice of celebrating Kongsi Raya might negatively affect Muslims' [[aqidah]] (faith).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/06/pas-also-doesnt-favour-kongsi-raya.htm "PAS also doesn’t favour Kongsi Raya"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701171145/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/06/pas-also-doesnt-favour-kongsi-raya.htm |date=2006-07-01 }}. (June 16, 2006). ''[[Malaysia Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the [[official religion]] of Malaysia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9283">[[File:Picture maze unsolved.png|thumb|right|400px|Latent learning is used by animals to navigate a maze more efficiently.]]
'''Latent learning''' is a form of [[learning]] that is not immediately expressed in an overt response; it occurs without any obvious [[reinforcement]] of the behavior or associations that are learned.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite book|last=Wade|first=Carol Tavris, Carole|title=Psychology In Perspective|year=1997|publisher=Longman|location=New York|isbn=0-673-98314-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in latent learning arose largely because the phenomenon seemed to conflict with the widely held view that reinforcement was necessary for learning to occur.

== Early studies==
In a classic study by [[Edward C. Tolman]], three groups of rats were placed in [[Mazes#Mazes in science experiments|mazes]] and their [[behavior]] observed each day for more than two weeks. The rats in Group 1 always found food at the end of the maze; the rats in Group 2 never found food; and the rats in Group 3 found no food for 10 days, but then received food on the eleventh. The Group 1 rats quickly learned to rush to the end of the maze; Group 2 rats wandered in the maze but did not preferentially go to the end. Group 3 acted the same as the Group 2 rats until food was introduced on Day 11; then they quickly learned to run to the end of the maze and did as well as the Group 1 rats by the next day.  This showed that the Group 3 rats had learned about the organisation of the maze, but without the reinforcement of food.  Until this study, it was largely believed that reinforcement was necessary for animals to learn such tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=E.C.|author2=C.H. Honzik |title="Insight" in Rats|journal=University of California Publications in Psychology|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments showed that latent learning can happen in shorter durations of time, e.g. 3–7 days.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=B.|title=A repetition of the Blodgett experiment on 'latent learning.'|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1945|volume=35|issue=6|pages=504–516|doi=10.1037/h0060742}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other early studies, it was also found that animals allowed to explore the maze and then detained for one minute in the empty goal box learned the maze much more rapidly than groups not given such goal orientation.&lt;ref name=Karn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karn|first=H. W.|author2=Porter, J. M., Jr.|title=The effects of certain pre-training procedures upon maze performance and their significance for the concept of latent learning.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1946|volume=36|issue=5|pages=461–469|doi=10.1037/h0061422}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2018}} (so what?)

In 1949, John Seward conducted studies in which rats were placed in a [[T-maze]] with one arm coloured white and the other black. One group of rats had 30 mins to explore this maze with no food present, and the rats were not removed as soon as they had reached the end of an arm. Seward then placed food in one of the two arms. Rats in this exploratory group learned to go down the rewarded arm much faster than another group of rats that had not previously explored the maze.&lt;ref name=Seward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seward|first=John P.|title=An experimental analysis of latent learning.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1949|volume=39|issue=2|pages=177–186|doi=10.1037/h0063169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results were obtained by Bendig in 1952 where rats were trained to escape from water in a modified T-maze with food present while satiated for food, then tested while hungry. Upon being returned to the maze while food deprived, the rats learned where the food was located at a rate that increased with the number of pre-exposures given the rat in the training phase. This indicated varying levels of latent learning.&lt;ref name=Bendig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bendig|first=A. W.|title=Latent learning in a water maze.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1952|volume=43|issue=2|pages=134–137|doi=10.1037/h0059428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early studies of latent learning were conducted with rats, but a study by Stevenson in 1954 explored this method of learning in children.&lt;ref name=Stevenson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Harold W.|title=Latent learning in children.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1954|volume=47|issue=1|pages=17–21|doi=10.1037/h0060086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson required children to explore a series of objects to find a key, and then he determined the knowledge the children had about various non-key objects in the set-up.&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt; The children found non-key objects faster if they had previously seen them, indicating they were using latent learning.  Their ability to learn in this way increased as they became older.&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt;

In 1982, Wirsig and co-researchers used the taste of [[sodium chloride]] to explore which parts of the brain are necessary for latent learning in rats. Decorticate rats were just as able as normal rats to accomplish the latent learning task.&lt;ref name=Wirsig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wirsig|first=Celeste R.|author2=Grill, Harvey J. |title=Contribution of the rat's neocortex to ingestive control: I. Latent learning for the taste of sodium chloride.|journal=Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology|date=1 January 1982|volume=96|issue=4|pages=615–627|doi=10.1037/h0077911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== More recent studies ==

=== In humans ===
An experiment with infants explored latent learning at an early age. Three-month-olds were exposed to two different [[hand puppets]] simultaneously.  The infants were then periodically presented with one of the puppets until they reached 6-months of age, at which point a target behavior was demonstrated on the first puppet. Finally, the infants were presented with the alternative puppet and performed the target behavior on that puppet at a higher rate than the [[Treatment and control groups|control group]] which had not seen the two puppets paired.  This suggests that the pre-exposed infants had formed an association between the puppets without obvious reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Campanella&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campanella|first=Jennifer|author2=Rovee-Collier, Carolyn |title=Latent learning and deferred imitation at 3 months|journal=Infancy|date=1 May 2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=243–262|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0793_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment suggested that not all potential associations are easily formed by latent learning.  Human participants undeprived of [[caffeine]] were given a novel caffeinated drink for four days and then were given the drink on a caffeine-deprived fifth day. These participants did not show an increased liking for the flavor upon being caffeine-deprived, while subjects who underwent the same procedure while deprived of caffeine every day showed an increased liking for the flavor each day. In this case, flavor quality as a function of caffeine did not seem to be acquired through latent learning.&lt;ref name=Yeomans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeomans|first=Martin |author2=Ripley, Tamzin |author3=Lee, Michelle |author4=Durlach, Paula|title=No evidence for latent learning of liking for flavours conditioned by caffeine|journal=Psychopharmacology|year=2001|volume=157|issue=2|pages=172–179|doi=10.1007/s002130100765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
There have been several investigations of the neural processes involved in latent learning. In one study, patients with medial temporal [[amnesia]] had particular difficulty with a latent learning task which required representational processing.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Catherine E.|others=McGlinchey-Berroth, Regina, Warren, Stacey, Monti, Laura, Brawn, Catherine M., Gluck, Mark A.|title=Latent learning in medial temporal amnesia: Evidence for disrupted representational but preserved attentional processes.|journal=Neuropsychology|date=1 January 2000|volume=14|issue=1|pages=3–15|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.14.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study, conducted with mice, found intriguing evidence that the absence of a [[PRNP|prion protein]] disrupts latent learning and other memory functions in the water maze latent learning task,&lt;ref name=Nishida&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prion Protein Is Necessary for Latent Learning and Long-Term Memory Retention |last=Nishida|first=Noriyuki |author2=Katamine, Shigeru |author3=Shigematsu, Kazuto |author4=Nakatani, Akira |author5=Sakamoto, Nobuhiro |author6=Hasegawa, Sumitaka |author7=Nakaoke, Ryota |author8=Atarashi, Ryuichiro |author9=Kataoka, Yasufumi |author10=Miyamoto, Tsutomu|journal=Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology|date=1 January 1997|volume=17|issue=5|pages=537–545|doi=10.1023/A:1026315006619}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[phencyclidine]] was found to impair latent learning in a water finding task.&lt;ref name=Noda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noda|first=A|title=Phencyclidine impairs latent learning in mice interaction between glutamatergic systems and sigma1 receptors|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology| volume=24|issue=4|pages=451–460|doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(00)00192-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1199">'''Latigo y Daga'''  ("[[Whip]] and [[Dagger]]" in Spanish) is a 
[[Filipino martial art]] which focuses on the use of flexible weapons, 
particularly whips. It combines elements from a number of martial arts found in 
[[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Indonesia]].

The ''Latigo y Daga'' system was formulated in 1987 by Tom Meadows. Through his research and experience working with various whips in conjunction with multiple martial arts systems and styles, he formed ''Latigo y Daga'' and developed a standardized vocabulary for whip techniques.  The primary aspects of ''Latigo y Daga'' are the use of the 4-ft. whip, the combination of using a dagger with whip, and using the empty hand with a whip. 

Some of the more prominent practitioners of ''Latigo y Daga'' are [[Dan Inosanto]], [[Ron Balicki]] and [[Anthony De Longis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">'''Mapouka''' (also '''macouka''') is a traditional [[dance]] from the [[Dabou]] area of southeast [[Côte d'Ivoire]] that originated with the [[Aizi]], [[Alladian]] and [[Avikam people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akindes|first=Simon|title=Playing with Identities in Contemporary Music in Africa|year=2002|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|isbn=9789171064967|pages=99–100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlko7YMatxIC&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=mapouka&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Playing it 'Loud and Straight': Reggae, Zouglou, Mapouka and Youth Insubordination in Côte d'Ivoire}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as "la danse du fessier" or "the dance of the behind".

The dance is mostly performed by [[women]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newell|first=Sasha|title=The Modernity Bluff: Crime, Consumption, and Citizenship in Côte D’Ivoire|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-57519-3|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQZAhP-0TMkC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=mapouka&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q=mapouka&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  shaking their rear end side to side, facing away from their audience, often while bent over. The worldwide popular [[twerking]] dance has been attributed to the Mapouka dance via popular media, while some argue the historically correct origin remains the [[Bump_(dance)|bump]]. 

In the 1980s, artists of the [[Ivory Coast]] tried without much success to popularize it after noting the popularity of the bump in the [[United States]]. One of the most well known groups is [[Tueuses de Mapouka]]. In 1998, the government of Côte d'Ivoire prohibited its performance in public.&lt;ref&gt;Orishi, Norimitsu (28 May 2000). [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/28/world/dance-has-africans-shaking-behinds-and-heads.html "Dance Has Africans Shaking Behinds, and Heads"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the prohibition, the dance enjoyed very fast-growing global following, especially in the [[sub-Saharan]] countries and western nations with large [[Francophone]] communities.

The dance is similar to what is referred to in belly dance as "shimmies". The fundamental difference is that in belly dance it is performed while upright and facing the audience, whereas Mapouka is performed more often while bent over and facing away from the audience. The hip movements are however the same.

'''''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''''' is an American live-action [[superhero]] [[children's television series]] that premiered on August 28, 1993, on the [[Fox Kids]] weekday afternoon block (later weekend morning block). It is the first entry of the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise, and became a 1990s [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon alongside a large line of [[action figure]]s and other merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bandai.co.jp/e/company/global.html|title= BANDAI Co.,Ltd {{!}} Global Development|accessdate= 2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show adapted stock footage from the Japanese TV series ''[[Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger]]'', which was the 16th installment of [[Toei Company|Toei's]] ''[[Super Sentai]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toei.co.jp/en/company/license.html|title= Toei Company Profile{{!}} Toei|accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third seasons of the show drew elements and stock footage from ''[[Gosei Sentai Dairanger]]'' and ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger]]'', respectively, though the ''Zyuranger'' costumes were still used for the lead cast in these last two seasons. Only the [[mecha]] and the Kiba Ranger costume (worn by the White Ranger) from ''Dairanger'' were featured in the second season, while only the mecha from ''Kakuranger'' was featured in the third season; though the ''Kakuranger'' costumes were later used for the miniseries ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]''. The series was produced by MMPR Productions and distributed by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Saban Brands]]). The show's merchandise was produced and distributed by [[Bandai Visual|Bandai Entertainment]].

In 2010, a re-version of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', with a new logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative special effects, was broadcast on [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]], and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series. The first 32 of season one's 60 episodes were remade with the re-version graphics. It was the final ''Power Rangers'' season to air on ABC Kids as [[Haim Saban]] re-acquired the series from [[Disney]]. With the beginning of ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]]'', the series had moved to [[Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20091001006376&amp;newsLang=en|title=Correcting and replacing photos Bandai America Powers up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line|accessdate=2009-10-01|date=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandai.com/blog/press-release/mighty-morphin |title=Press release: Bandai America Powers Up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line {{!}} Bandai America |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2009-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004235708/http://www.bandai.com/blog/press-release/mighty-morphin |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/mighty-morphin-power-rangers/tv-listings/203104|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: TV Listings|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series overview==

===Season 1 (1993–94)===
{{Main article|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (season 1)|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (re-version)}}
The series takes place in the fictional town of Angel Grove, [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TELEVISION; . . .

Upon her release, she and her army of evil space aliens set their sights on conquering the nearest planet: Earth. The wise sage [[Zordon]], who was responsible for capturing Rita (and also being enemies back on Zordon's homeworld, Eltar), later becomes aware of her release and orders his robotic assistant [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] to select five "teenagers with attitude" to defend the Earth from Rita's attacks. The five teens chosen are [[Jason Lee Scott]], [[Kimberly Hart]], [[Zack Taylor]], [[Trini Kwan]] and [[Billy Cranston]]. Zordon gives them the ability to transform into a fighting force known as the Power Rangers; providing them with an arsenal of weapons at their disposal, as well as colossal assault machines called [[Zord]]s which can combine into a giant humanoid machine known as the Megazord.&lt;ref name="From Power Bow to Hip-Hop-Kido"&gt;{{cite news|title= From Power Bow to Hip-Hop-Kido |publisher= The Baltimore Sun|date=|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-12-29/features/1993363109_1_zord-power-rangers-popular-power|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Superhero Teens Are Hip, Hot |publisher= Orlando Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-12-18/lifestyle/9312170714_1_rita-repulsa-zord-saban|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

The series begins with five teenagers combating Rita and her seemingly endless array of monsters, while also dealing with typical teenage problems and clashing with local bullies [[Bulk and Skull]]. However, consecutive failures lead Rita to adopt a new method for conquering Earth and destroying the Power Rangers: by attacking them with one of their own. Using her magic, Rita kidnaps and brainwashes a local teen whose fighting skills prove to equal that of Jason's in a martial-arts contest held in Angel Grove. The new teen, [[Tommy Oliver]], passes Rita's tests, becoming the Green Ranger. Entrusted with Rita's Sword of Darkness, the source for the continuance of the evil spell he has fallen victim to, Tommy comes dangerously close to defeating the Power Rangers, especially when Rita causes a solar eclipse that temporarily drains the Megazord's power. However, the Green Ranger is ultimately defeated, and the Sword of Darkness is destroyed by Jason. Now free from Rita's spell, Tommy chooses to use his Green Ranger powers to assist the other Rangers in defeating the evil that gave them to him in the first place. His Zord, the Dragonzord, is reconfigured to enable it to help form more powerful Zord combinations alongside the other Dinozords.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season One; "Green With Evil, Parts I-V"&lt;/ref&gt;

As time goes on, Rita focuses on eliminating Tommy in order to regain the powers that she believes belong to her. Using a special wax that was touched by Tommy when he was evil, Rita uses a magic Green Candle to slowly remove his powers, returning them to her. In the end, Tommy loses his powers, but he prevents Rita from reclaiming them by transferring them to Jason who, feeling guilt for failing to protect Tommy's powers, accepts them. However, Tommy later returns to the team when the other Rangers' Power Coins are handed over to Rita in exchange for their kidnapped parents. With Zordon's help, Tommy regains his powers and successfully retrieves the other Rangers' Power Coins. However, Tommy's regained powers are only temporary and must be frequently re-charged by Zordon, who warns that the Green Ranger's powers will ultimately fail. Despite this, Tommy remains determined to continue assisting the other Rangers as long as possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season One; "The Green Candle, Parts I-II"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season One; "Return of an Old Friend, Parts I-II"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2 (1994–95)===
{{Main article|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (season 2)}}
[[Lord Zedd]], Rita's superior, arrives at Rita's Moon Palace, where he takes her place and throws her into a space dumpster again. He then begins his own campaign to conquer Earth. In order for the Power Rangers to compete with Zedd's monsters, which are superior to the ones [[Villains in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers#Finster|Finster]] made for Rita, Zordon and Alpha upgrade the Dinozords into the more powerful Thunderzords (which combine into the Thunder Megazord). However, Tommy is forced to retain use of the Dragonzord, due to his powers being too weak to support a new Zord.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Two; "The Mutiny, Parts I-III"&lt;/ref&gt;

After several defeats, Zedd's attack on the Rangers progressively becomes more violent. He focuses his attention on eliminating Tommy, whom he sees as Rita's biggest mistake in giving him the Dragon Coin. The Green Ranger's powers were rapidly deteriorating, but Zedd's efforts had enhanced the process. He eventually does so with a special Green Crystal, using it to take away the Green Ranger's powers. The crystal also powers up Zedd's Dark Rangers, but when Tommy smashes it, the Dark Rangers powers are transferred back to the regular Rangers. Nevertheless, Zedd finally succeeds in taking the Green Ranger's powers (which Rita later uses to empower Tommy's clone to battle against the Rangers before reclaiming it once more). Following the loss of the Green Ranger's powers, Zordon and Alpha create, in secret, a new White Ranger to aid the other Rangers in battle. The White Ranger is revealed to be Tommy, who in addition receives a new Zord, the Tigerzord, and also becomes the new leader of the Power Rangers (replacing Jason).&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Two; "Green No More, Parts I-II"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Two; "White Light, Parts I-II"&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Team Ninja Trials in Angel Grove, the Rangers become friends with three teenagers from Stone Canyon: Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park and Aisha Campbell. During an ensuing battle with Zedd and a magical serpent, Rocky, Adam and Aisha discover the Rangers' identities and, having been entrusted with their secret by Zordon himself, the three newcomers become allies of the Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Two; "The Ninja Encounter, Parts I-III"&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, Jason, Zack and Trini are selected to represent Angel Grove at the World Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Rangers are faced with the task of finding replacements. In order to transfer the powers of the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, they must find the Sword of Light, which is located on the Deserted Planet. Zedd pursues them across the galaxy in Serpentera, his massive personal Zord, and destroys most of the Deserted Planet. Serpentera runs out of power before being able to finish the Rangers, and they return to Earth safely with the Sword of Light. Zordon then chooses Rocky, Adam and Aisha to replace Jason, Zack and Trini as the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Two; "The Power Transfer, Parts I-II"&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime before the power transfer, Rita had returned to Earth when Tommy made his debut as the White Ranger, and fell into the hands of Bulk and Skull, but the Rangers sent her back into space. She later returns to the Moon while the Rangers are in Australia, and with the help of Finster, she gets a special "makeover" to gain a younger and "prettier" face. She then uses a love potion on Zedd, who is in a deep sleep during his centennial re-evilizer, and he falls in love with her when he wakes up. They get married and thus join forces to make an even more terrible threat for the Rangers, but not even this can prepare them for what is to come.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Two; "The Wedding, Parts I-III"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3 (1995–96)===
{{Main article|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (season 3)}}
[[Rito Revolto]], Rita's skeletal brother, comes to Earth and, with the help of a group of monsters, destroys the Rangers' Thunderzords and the Tigerzord. As a result, the Dinozords are also destroyed and the Power Coins are damaged beyond repair. Undaunted, the Power Rangers seek the aid of [[Ninjor (Power Rangers)|Ninjor]], alleged creator of the Power Coins, who gives them new Ninja Coins, providing them with the even more powerful Ninjazords (which combine into the Ninja Megazord) and the Falconzord.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Three; "Ninja Quest, Parts I-IV"&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian girl named Kat Hillard moves to Angel Grove. She befriends Kimberly, and displays an intense affection for Tommy. Later it is found that Rita had captured Kat and put her under a powerful spell, giving her the ability to transform into a normal cat as well as a cat-like monster. Under this spell, she steals Kimberly's Ninja Coin, vastly weakening and nearly killing the Pink Ranger, whose life force, like that of the other Ninja Rangers, is connected to her Ninja Coin. It is during this time that the Rangers acquire their most powerful Zords ever: the Shogunzords (which combine into the Shogun Megazord). Eventually, Kat overcomes Rita's evil spell and returns Kimberly's Ninja Coin to her. A short time thereafter, Kimberly gets a chance to pursue her personal athletic dreams. With Zordon's blessing, she leaves to train for the Pan Global Games, choosing Kat to replace her as the Pink Ranger. Though her initial fear and hesitation keeps her from contributing fully to the fight against evil, Kat eventually becomes both comfortable and capable of fulfilling her duty as a Ranger.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Three; "A Ranger Catastrophe, Parts I-II"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Three; "Changing of the Zords, Parts I-III"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'': Season Three; "A Different Shade of Pink, Parts I-III"&lt;/ref&gt;

After several more battles, Zedd and Rita are joined by Rita's father, [[Master Vile]]. Following his failed attempts to defeat the Rangers, he reverses time, turning the Rangers into powerless children. These events culminate in the mini-series ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]''.

In Season 2, Lord Zedd upgrades the Putty design, completely replacing Rita's original design. Zedd's Putties are superior to the original Putties and are more expendable.

The Rangers normally use their Ninja Ranger powers to fight them. Unlike the Putties, the Tenga Warriors are not expendable and they return to the Moon when defeated. The Tengas originated in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' (going by the name "[[Tengu]] Warriors") under the command of Ivan Ooze. The name changed between the movie and television show was because of copyright complications with the movie's producer [[20th Century Fox]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Production==

=== Conception ===
While on a business trip to Japan, [[Haim Saban]] came across a broadcast of ''[[Choudenshi Bioman]]'', later learning of a popular [[French language|French-language]] dub aired on [[Canal+]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Bernard-Minet-Bioman/release/1208693|title=Bernard Minet - Bioman|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the franchise's popularity both in and outside of its native country, Saban realized there was potential for an American adaption. He and his business partner [[Shuki Levy]] quickly produced a [[Pilot (tv)|pilot]] entitled ''Bio-Man'' in August 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-12/business/fi-18776_1_haim-saban|title=Kidd Stuff :  A Crop of New Shows Sprouts From Saban Firm's TV Success|last=BATES|first=JAMES|date=1986-08-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured an early appearance by actor and martial artist [[Mark Dacascos]] in a leading role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/power-rangers/263195/power-rangers-co-creator-reflects-on-lost-pilot-bio-man|title=Power Rangers Co-Creator Reflects on Lost Pilot Bio-Man|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Levy, they "shopped it around for at least five years, but nobody wanted it." Levy and Saban later re-edited the pilot using footage from the then-contemporary ''[[Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger]]'', entitling the pitch ''Galaxy Rangers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Barney &amp; Friends Legacy|title=Galaxy Rangers (MMPR pitch promo)|date=2015-01-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&amp;v=Mcn5Iemz0SU|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the pilot was picked up by [[Fox Kids]] for a 40 episode order, after which point it would be determined by the network whether or not to renew the series for additional episodes.&lt;ref name="oralhistory"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Elijah|title=The Oral History of the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/08/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-interviews-behind-the-scenes/|website=Complex|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casting ===
Due to the action-oriented nature of the show, many of the lead actors cast had background in either [[martial arts]], [[dance]], or other physically-intensive activities. [[Amy Jo Johnson]] (Kimberly) and [[David Yost]] (Billy) were former competitive [[Gymnastics|gymnasts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zyu2ranger.blogspot.com/2015/03/july-9-1994-tv-guide-go-go-power-rangers.html|title=July 9, 1994 TV Guide - "Go, Go, Power Rangers!"|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=No Pink Spandex|title=Interview with David Yost Part 3|date=2010-08-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmlcuY8bOUk|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.listal.com/david-yost|title=David Yost|website=www.listal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austin St. John]] (Jason) held a second-degree black belt in [[Taekwondo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/doc/278768219.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec%2024,%201994&amp;author=By%20Candida%20Rivera,%20Stephanie%20Matamoros%20and%20Mary-Ellen&amp;pub=Newsday%20(Combined%20editions)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=KIDSDAY%20TALKING%20WITH%20Austin%20St.%20John|title=Newsday - The Long Island and New York City News Source|website=pqasb.pqarchiver.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a first-degree black belt in [[Judo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWv5AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98&amp;dq=red+power+ranger+jason&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjYrsfik43JAhUFPhQKHdOsD3w#v=onepage&amp;q=red%20power%20ranger%20jason&amp;f=false|title=A Life Measured by the Minute|last=Henry|first=Gary D.|date=2009-11-12|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781450002172|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Emanuel Jones]] (Zack) was a dancer, and [[Thuy Trang]] (Trini) was a [[kung fu]] practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thuytrangtribute.com/thuy-trang-biography.html|title=Thuy Trang Tribute - Biography - Vietnamese-American actress best known as Trini Kwan in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|last=www.chiofsteel.com|website=www.thuytrangtribute.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Jason Narvy]] (Skull) originally auditioned for the role of Billy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=rap779|title=Power Morphicon 2010: Bulk and Skull Panel Part 2|date=2010-09-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpA81ZH8N_8|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
The series was shot on location in [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] and [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moviemaps.org/movies/1pi|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers filming locations — Movie Maps|website=moviemaps.org|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring locations included [[Grant High School (Los Angeles)|Grant High School]], [[Placerita Canyon State Park]], [[Puddingstone Reservoir]], and [[Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park]]. The House of the Book at [[Brandeis-Bardin Institute]] was used as the exterior location for the Command Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1n5k56/the_power_rangers_command_center_is_actually_a/?st=jctl55v0&amp;sh=1797cb5a|title=The Power Rangers command center is actually a building on a California Universities campus. • r/pics|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its unusual, futuristic architecture; the building had previously been used in the films ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' and [[The Lawnmower Man (film)|''The Lawnmower Man'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-book-american-jewish-university|title=House of the Book|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the initial licensing agreement between Saban and [[Toei Company]], the producers of the ''[[Super Sentai]]'', additional footage and [[insert shot]]s of the villain characters (particularly those played by [[Machiko Soga]], [[Ami Kawai]], and Hideaki Kusaka)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dSq2u.759.15.htm#9thPage|title=SEC Info - Abc Family Worldwide Inc - IPO: ‘S-1/A’ on 1/26/98 - EX-10.35|website=www.secinfo.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; were filmed in order to allow more in-depth, extensive scenes of the villains who would be unable to interact with the main cast due to the nature of the show.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grnrngr.com/zyu1.5/|title=Zyu1.5 Footage Guide|last=Green|first=John “GrnRngr”|website=www.grnrngr.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional footage included close-ups of the actor speaking English-language lines [[Phonetics|phonetically]] in order to more make the necessary [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dialogue looping]] more seamless.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

Episodes 39-40 (''Doomsday Part 1-2'') were originally intended as the season (and potentially series) finale, with the producers' intending to bring in actress [[Machiko Soga]] to reprise her role as Rita in new footage where she would interact directly with the main cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mmprr.blogspot.com/2015/02/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-episode-39.html|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Episode 39: Doomsday Part 1|website=mmprr.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sirstack.livejournal.com/5629.html|title=MMPR 40 "Doomsday (part 2)" Script (Scans)|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the unprecedented success of the show and its merchandising, Fox Kids ordered an additional 25 episodes. Since all available stock footage from ''Zyuranger'' had been depleted for use in the first 40 episodes of season one, Saban commissioned Toei to produce 25 new monster costumes and new battle footage using the existing Zyuranger suits. Saban was able to produce 25 additional episodes using new monster suits. This new footage has been referred to as "Zyu2" by ''Power Rangers'' fans. Saban used the first 15 for the rest of season one (episodes 41-60), then the remaining suits and footage for the first 13 episodes of season two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grnrngr.com/zyu2/essay |title=Zyu2 |publisher=GrnRngr.com |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following production of the first 20 episodes of season two, [[Austin St. John]], [[Thuy Trang]] and [[Walter Emanuel Jones]] left the show over contract disputes.&lt;ref name="huffinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/power-rangers-interview_n_6004472.html|title=11 Behind The Scenes Stories You've Never Heard Before From The Original Power Rangers - November 4, 2014|date=2014-11-04|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; To disguise this incident, a combination of body doubles, voice doubles and stock footage were used to continue featuring the characters Jason, Trini and Zack for eight episodes. The subplot of those three Rangers leaving Angel Grove for the World Peace Conference was made to bridge the transition to their replacements (Rocky, Aisha and Adam). While the reasons for their departure was debated for many years, in 2014, Austin St. John would confirm that the departure was due to the low salaries the stars were being paid; St. John stated "I could have worked the window at McDonalds and probably made the same money the first season. It was disappointing, it was frustrating, it made a lot of us angry."&lt;ref name="huffinterview" /&gt; In a 2012 interview with [[Amy Jo Johnson]], she stated St. John, Trang and Jones wanted to become part of a [[trade union|union]]; this led to them being replaced.&lt;ref name="amyjointerview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awwman.com/nps/main/2012/09/transcript-of-episode-151-interview-with-amy-jo-johnson/|title=Transcript of Amy Jo Johnson Interview - No Pink Spandex - September 17, 2012|date=2012-09-17|publisher=awwman.com|accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the casting of [[Steve Cardenas]], [[Karan Ashley]] and [[Johnny Yong Bosch]], the production moved to [[Sydney]], Australia for roughly four months to shoot ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'', which was released the following summer before the start of season three.

==Reception and controversy==
Despite the success of the series, it was also subject to much controversy from parents who felt the show was too violent for young children. The show had aired before television stations issued content warnings such as parental guidance or fit for viewing persons twelve years or over, the [[V-chip]], and [[television rating system|television ratings]]. In the US, numerous complaints were sent to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). In 1993, the Canadian broadcast rights to  ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' were jointly purchased by the [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] cable channel, and the series played to a receptive audience every weekday afternoons on YTV, the latter trailing the American broadcast by several months. However, due to complaints sent to the recently formed [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] and a negative assessment from that body over the show's violent content,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/decisions/1994/940405.htm CBSC.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412034032/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/decisions/1994/940405.htm |date=2007-04-12 }}, Canadian Broadcast Standards Council&amp;nbsp;— Ontario Regional Council October 24, 1994 decision regarding CanWest Global's broadcasting of the show.&lt;/ref&gt; YTV removed the series from their line-up.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title= With Power Rangers Scarce, A Frenzied Search by Parents|work= The New York Times|date=1994-12-05|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/us/with-power-rangers-scarce-a-frenzied-search-by-parents.html?scp=6&amp;sq=Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=2|accessdate=2010-08-07 | first=Glenn | last=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiz43"&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | title = Morphin Prohibited in the Great North | work = Heroes on Screen | pages = 68–69 | publisher = ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #43 |date=March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not actually being a member of the CBSC, YTV complied and pulled the series before the end of its first season; Global (which was a CBSC member) ultimately did the same. While a phone-in poll was conducted to see if viewers wanted ''MMPR'' back on YTV, no further installments of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise aired on the network until 2011's ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]]'', although commercials for toys and videos were still advertised on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Television: So what's on in Tokyo?|work=Time|date=1996-02-19|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984155,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first=Ginia | last=Bellafante}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Disney-era versions of the series were broadcast on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]].

Early on in the series, some fans and critics noted that some racial overtones could be construed in the colors of several of the Rangers in the first few seasons being based on the actors' skin color or ethnicity. [[Austin St. John]], who is of partial Native American ancestry, was cast as the Red Ranger, and [[Walter Emanuel Jones]] (an African American) and [[Thuy Trang]] (whose family was of Vietnamese ancestry) were the Black and Yellow Rangers respectively. Years later, when brought up on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'', Jones and [[Amy Jo Johnson]] (as well as other celebrity commentators) made fun of how the original line-up had Jones' role as the Black Ranger and Trang's role as the Yellow Ranger because the actors and characters were of [[Black people|African]] and [[List of ethnic slurs#Y|Asian]] descent, respectively.

In Malaysia, the phrase "Mighty Morphin" was censored and removed from the logo due to the word "morphin" being too similar to the name of the drug [[morphine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/Newsbriefs/9512/12-22/am.html|title=CNN - World News Briefs - Dec. 22, 1995|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-October 1994, the murder of a young Norwegian girl by two of her young friends prompted Swedish-owned [[TV3 (Viasat)|TV3]] to pull ''MMPR'' from its broadcast schedule in all of its market countries. However, ''MMPR'' was not related to the event. Instead, the young children responsible were fans of the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' cartoon.&lt;ref name="Deseret News"&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/382495/NORWAY-PULLS-THE-PLUG-ON-POWER-RANGERS.html |title=Norway Pulls The Plug On `Power Rangers' |publisher=Deseret News |date=1994-10-20 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[New Zealand]] [[Broadcasting Standards Authority]] (BSA) upheld several complaints from members of the public about the level of violence in the show. The main concern of those complainants was that the show portrayed violence as the primary means of resolving conflict, and that this was influencing children to behave more violently more frequently. Immediately following the BSA decision, the second season of the show was all but cancelled by [[Television New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="wiz43"/&gt; New Zealand is the only country in the world where this show has been prematurely withdrawn from public broadcast to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/12863/bpinnz.pdf |title=Broadcasting Policy in New Zealand |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD and video releases of the more-recent ''Power Rangers'' series that were filmed in New Zealand can be found at [[The Warehouse]], although general sales through video stores and other retailers are scarce. Later series in the ''Power Rangers'' franchise, such as ''[[Power Rangers: Mystic Force]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers: Jungle Fury]]'', were filmed in New Zealand, but the programs were still not shown in the country, until 2011, when ''Samurai'' premiered.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

As a non-union production, members of the original cast were reportedly subject to low pay, long hours, unfair contracts, and a hostile work environment and, as many of the cast were young, aspiring actors, they had no [[Talent agent|agents]] or [[Lawyer|lawyers]] to protect their interests and they themselves limited experience in the [[entertainment industry]]. Austin St. John, Thuy Trang and Walter Emmanuel Jones were the first to leave the series, citing low pay, in the middle of the second season, and St. John struggled with [[homelessness]] for a time after leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/power-rangers-interview_n_6004472.html|title=11 Behind The Scenes Stories You've Never Heard Before From The Original Power Rangers|last=Luling|first=Todd Van|date=2014-11-04|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Jo Johnson later left the series for the same reason, along with concerns over her safety, having almost been set on fire during the filming of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''.

[[David Yost]] was the last of the original Power Rangers to leave the series (during ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]''), citing [[Homophobia|homophobic attitudes]] from production staff, prompting him to unsuccessfully undergo [[conversion therapy]] in an effort to change his [[sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newnownext.com/david-yost-conversion-therapy-homophobia/06/2018/|title=Blue Power Ranger David Yost Says Conversion Therapy Led to a Nervous Breakdown|work=LOGO News|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview with fan blog "No Pink Spandex", Yost stated that he walked off set one day because "[he] was called 'faggot' one too many times."

[[File:Flag of Italy.svg|thumb|right|The modern flag of Italy, a vertical [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] flag of green, white, and red, adopted on 1 January 1948.]]

The '''national colours of Italy''' are green, white, and red,{{sfn|Ferorelli|1925|p=654-680}} collectively known in [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''il tricolore'' (the tricolour). In [[sport in Italy]], azure has been used or adopted as the colour for many national teams, the first being the [[Italy national football team|men's football team]] in 1910.

==Revolution==
[[File:Flag of the Repubblica Cispadana.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the [[Cispadane Republic]], established on 7 January 1797]]
{{see also|Flags of Napoleonic Italy}}

The ''tricolore'' was symbolically important preceding and throughout the ''Risorgimento'' leading to [[Italian unification]]. In September 1794, Luigi Zamboni and Giambattista de Rolandis created a flag by uniting the white and red of the [[flag of Bologna]] with green, a symbol of liberty and hope that the populace of Italy join the revolution begun in Bologna to oust the foreign occupying forces.{{sfn|Venosta|1864|p=30-32|ps= Noi al bianco ed al rosso, colori della nostra Bologna, uniamo il verde, in segno della speranza che tutto il popolo italiano segua la rivoluzione nazionale da noi iniziata, che cancelli que' confini segnati dalla tirannide forestiera.}}{{sfn|La Repubblica|2013}} This tricolore was considered a symbol of redemption that from its creation was "consecrated to immortality of the triumph of faith, virtue, and sacrifice" of those who created it.{{sfn|Venosta|1864|p=32}}

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]], in a letter from [[Milan]] to an executive director on 11 October 1796, stated that the [[Legione Lombarda]] had chosen these colours as the national colours.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1822|p=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=238&amp;fk_files=1483993 238]|ps=Vous y trouverez l'organisation de la légion lombarde. Les couleurs nationales qu'ils ont adoptées sont le vert, le blanc et le rouge.}} In a solemn ceremony at the [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan|Piazza del Duomo]] on 16 November 1796, a [[War flag|military flag]] was presented to the Legione Lombarda, which would become a unit in the [[Cisalpine Republic]] (1797–1802) military, and was the first tricolore military standard to fly at the head of an Italian military unit.{{sfn|Frasca|2001|p=49}}{{sfn|Canella|2009|p=130}} The first official Italian flag was created for the [[Cispadane Republic]] (1796–1797) in [[Reggio Emilia]] on 7 January 1797 based on a proposal by government deputy Giuseppe Compagnoni.{{sfn|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}{{sfn|La Repubblica|2013}}

The formation of the Cisalpine Republic was decreed by Napoleon on 29 June 1797, and consisted of most of the Cispadane Republic and [[Transpadane Republic]] (1796–1797), which included between them Milan, [[Mantua]], the portion of [[Parma]] north of the [[Po (river)|Po river]], [[Bolognese Republic|Bologna]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Romagna]], and later the [[Venetian Republic]].{{sfn|Partington|1836|p=548}} Its flag was proclaimed to be the tricolore, representing the "red and white of Bologna and the green of liberty".{{sfn|Waley|Hearder|1963|p=118}}

[[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]], a political movement founded in 1831 by [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] calling for a national revolution to unify all [[Italian language|Italian-speaking]] provinces, used a "theatrical" [[uniform]] based on the national colours.{{sfn|Collier|2003|p=25|ps= The national colours of Italy were worn in combination with a green blouse being complemented with a red belt and white trousers.}} These colours had been in use in the Cispadane Republic, Transpadane Republic, Cisalpine Republic, [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]] (1802–1805), and the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] (1805–1814), precursors to the modern state. During the formation of the Roman Empire of 1814, the foundational constitutional basis specified that the three national colours would be preserved.{{sfn|Dippel|2009|p=25|ps= I tre colori nazionali sono conservati.}}&lt;!--

Need refs for this:
The colours chosen for the Italian flag and the national colours of Italy were derived from the [[flag of Milan]], a red cross on a white field, and the colour of the Milanese civic guard uniform, which were green.
--&gt;

==Politics==
The colours have been used for political purposes.

During his visit to London on 11 April 1864, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] was greeted by a throng of people at the train station, many of whom carried Italian flags.{{sfn|Oddo|1865|p=522}} English men dressed in [[Redshirts (Italy)|red shirts]] commonly worn by Garibaldi's followers during his [[Mille expedition]] to [[southern Italy]], and women dressed in the national colours of Italy.{{sfn|Oddo|1865|p=522}} Italian flags could be seen throughout the city.{{sfn|Oddo|1865|p=522}} In 1848, Garibaldi's legion dressed in red shirts with green and white [[Facing colour|facing]].{{sfn|Young|Stevens|1864|p=64}}

In 1868, two years after the Austrians departed [[Venice]] following the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], the remains of statesman [[Daniele Manin]] were brought to his native city and honoured with a public funeral.{{sfn|Cook Thomas and son|1874|p=29}} He had been acclaimed president of the Venetian [[Republic of San Marco]] by residents of Venice after a revolt in 1848.{{sfn|Cunsolo: Venice and the Revolution of 1848–49}}{{sfn|Cunsolo: Daniele Manin (1804–1857)}} The [[gondola]] carrying his [[coffin]] was decorated with bow "surmounted by the [[lion of Saint Mark]], resplendent with gold", bore "the Venetian standard veiled with black [[crape]]", and had "two silver colossal statues waving the national colours of Italy".{{sfn|Cook Thomas and son|1874|p=29–30}} The statues represented the unification of Italy and Venice.{{sfn|Cook Thomas and son|1874|p=30}} The funeral procession was described as "magnificent".{{sfn|Cook Thomas and son|1874|p=30}} His remains are interred at the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], the first person buried there in over 300 years.{{sfn|Cook Thomas and son|1874|p=29}}

An apocryphal story about the [[history of pizza]] holds that on 11 June 1889, [[Naples|Neapolitan]] pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created a pizza to honour [[Margherita of Savoy]], who was visiting the city. It was garnished with tomatoes, [[mozzarella]], and [[basil]] to represent the national colours of Italy, and was named "Pizza Margherita".{{sfn|Danford|p=38}}{{sfn|''The Philadelphia Inquirer''|1989|p=E08}}{{sfn|Lakeland Ledger|1989|p=12A}}&lt;!-- NOTE: American Heritage article by Hanna Miller is not a reliable citation for this claim --&gt;

==Definition==
In 2003, the [[government of Italy]] specified the colours using [[Pantone]]. The new specification was demonstrated on sample flags displayed at [[Palazzo Montecitorio]]; they had a darker [[tint]] than the traditional colours, described as having a deeper green, a red with "ruby hues", and ivory or cream instead of white.{{sfn|BBC: Italian opposition in flap over flag}}{{sfn|Corriere della Sera|2003}} [[Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio]], president of the [[Federation of the Greens]] and a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], stated that [[Silvio Berlusconi]] had achieved a "chromatic coup d'état".{{sfn|BBC: Italian opposition in flap over flag}} Government officials stated that the sample flags did not conform to the "specified chromatic specification".{{sfn|Corriere della Sera|2003|ps= La presidenza del Consiglio – si legge nella nota – ha verificato che le nuove bandiere tricolori esposte a Montecitorio non corrispondono ai valori cromatici indicati nella propria circolare...}} The values were revised after discussion, and in 2006 were decreed by law in Article 31 of ''Disposizioni generali in materia di cerimoniale e di precedenza tra le cariche pubbliche'' ("General provisions relating to ceremonial materials and precedence for public office", published 28 July 2006 in [[Gazzetta Ufficiale]]) for polyester fabric [[Bunting (textile)|bunting]] to use the following Pantone Textile Colour System values:{{sfn|Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana|2006}}{{sfn|Prefettura di Pisa|p=2}}

[[File:Italy cockade.svg|thumb|right|The national [[cockade]] of Italy.]]
The national colours are specified in the [[Constitution of Italy]] to be used on the [[Flag of Italy]], a vertical [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour flag]] of green, white, and red.{{sfn|La Costituzione}}{{sfn|Constitution of the Italian Republic}} It is also used on the [[cockade]], another of the [[national symbols of Italy]]. Its use of the national colours was the antecedent for its use in the flag.{{sfn|Biblioteca dell'Accademia virgiliana|p=4|ps=...o Bandiera Cispadana di tre colori, verde, bianco e rosso, e che questi tre colori si usino anche nella coccarda cispadana la quale debba portarsi da tutti}}{{sfn|Protonotari|1897|p=239-267 and 676–710}}{{sfn|Murati|1892|p=12–13}}

The [[Flag of Italy#Presidential standard|Presidential Standard of Italy]] is the flag used by the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]], the nation's [[head of state]]. It is based on the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with the [[Emblem of Italy|coat of arms of Italy]] in gold.{{sfn||Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana|2000}}

On 31 December 1996, legislation was passed (''legge no. 671'') instituting 7 January as national [[flag day]], known as ''[[Festa del Tricolore]]'', and was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana three days later.{{sfn|Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana|1997}} Its purpose was to celebrate the bicentennial of the establishment of the Italian flag on 7 January 1797.{{sfn|La Repubblica|2013}} The most important of these celebrations is that at the [[Sala del Tricolore (Reggio Emilia)|Sala del Tricolore]] ("Room of the tricolour") in the commune palace of [[Reggio Emilia]], and a solemn changing of the guard at the [[Quirinal Palace]] in Rome, followed by a parade of the [[Corazzieri]] and a brass band fanfare by the [[Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment]].{{sfn|La Repubblica|2013}}

[[File:Scudetto.svg|thumb|right|The ''scudetto'' is worn on jerseys by the team that wins the [[Serie A]] championships]]

In [[Football in Italy|football]], the winners of [[Serie A]] are the [[List of Italian football champions|Italian football champions]], which entitles the winning team to adorn the jersey of each of its players with the ''scudetto'', an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] ([[heater shield]]) of the Italian flag, the subsequent season.{{sfn|Lega Nazionale Professionisti: Premiazione scudetto|2012}} The practice was established in 1924, after [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] had wanted to put a shield flag on the uniforms of Italian military commanders during a [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly match]].{{sfn|Lega Nazionale Professionisti: Premiazione scudetto|2012}} The league operators state that it is "representative of national unity at the level of football".{{sfn|Lega Nazionale Professionisti: Premiazione scudetto|2012|ps=...uno scudetto con i colori della bandiera italiana, rappresentativo dell'unità nazionale a livello calcistico}} The winner of the [[Coppa Italia]] is entitled to adorn its team jersey with a tricolour cockade for the subsequent season.{{sfn|Lega Nazionale Professionisti:Regolamento|2012|loc=section 12.1 Società vincitrice|p=247/700 and Articolo 1}}&lt;!-- the attachment shows the adornment (the cockade) --&gt;

After having played its first two international matches in white in 1910, the [[Italy national football team|men's football team]] announced its new uniform on 31 December 1910, an [[Azure (color)|azure]] shirt with an escutcheon of the Italian colours, and white shorts.{{sfn|Chiesa|2012|loc=[http://www.magliarossonera.it/img_cronistoriadelfootball/gs/3gs.pdf chapter 1910–1912, Azzurri come il cielo]|p=44|ps=Siamo informati che la squadra nazionale avra finalmente una sua propria divisa: una maglia di colore bleu marinaro, con sul petto uno scudo racchiudente i colori italiani}} Widespread opinion was that the blue colour had been chosen as an homage to the [[House of Savoy]] that had previously ruled parts of [[northern Italy]] until the [[Italian unification|nation's unification]].{{sfn|Chiesa|2012|loc=[http://www.magliarossonera.it/img_cronistoriadelfootball/gs/3gs.pdf chapter 1910–1912, Azzurri come il cielo]|p=44}} The uniform was first worn on 6 January 1911 in a match against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in [[Milan]].{{sfn|Chiesa|2012|loc=[http://www.magliarossonera.it/img_cronistoriadelfootball/gs/3gs.pdf chapter 1910–1912, Azzurri come il cielo]|p=44}}

In sport, many men's national teams are known as the ''azzurri'' and women's teams as the ''azzurre'' (meaning "azure"). These include the [[Italy national basketball team|men's basketball]],{{sfn|Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro: Gli azzurri}} [[Italy national football team|men's football]], [[Italy men's national ice hockey team|men's ice hockey]], [[Italy national rugby league team|men's rugby league]], [[Italy national rugby union team|men's rugby union]], and [[Italy men's national volleyball team|men's volleyball]]{{sfn|Federazione Italiana Pallavolo: Azzurri}} teams, and the [[Italy women's national basketball team|women's basketball]],{{sfn|Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro: Le Azzurre}} [[Italy women's national football team|women's football]], [[Italy women's national ice hockey team|women's ice hockey]], and [[Italy women's national volleyball team|women's volleyball]]{{sfn|Federazione Italiana Pallavolo: Azzurre}} teams.

The [[List of international auto racing colors|national auto racing colour]] of Italy is [[rosso corsa]] ("racing red").{{sfn|Bristow|2013|p=7}}

==Other==
[[File:Frecce Tricolori RIAT 2011.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Frecce Tricolori'' with green, white, and red smoke trails]]

The [[Frecce Tricolori]], the [[aerobatics]] demonstration team of the Italian [[Aeronautica Militare]] based at [[Rivolto Air Force Base]], are so named for the green, white, and red smoke trails emitted during performances, representing the national colours.{{sfn|Haberman|1989}}{{sfn|Wings|p=6|ps=the Italians call themselves Frecce Tricolori (and emphasize the title by emitting red, white, and green smoke)}}

The name of  ''Italia Peak'', a [[Summit|peak]] in the [[Elk Mountains (Colorado)|Elk Mountains]] of [[Colorado]] in the [[United States]], is derived from the display on one of its faces, when seen at a distance, of "brilliant red, white and green colors, the national colors of Italy".{{sfn|Ayer|1880|p=211}}{{sfn|Diller|1902|p=145}}{{sfn|Dana|Silliman|1874|p=400}}

'''''Resident Evil: Revelations'''''{{efn|known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Biohazard Revelations''|バイオハザード リベレーションズ|Baiohazādo Riberēshonzu|lead=yes}}}} is a [[survival horror]] [[video game]] developed by [[Capcom]] and originally released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] handheld game console in 2012. Set between the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' titles ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'', the game follows [[counter-terrorism]] agents [[Jill Valentine]] and [[Chris Redfield]] as they try to stop a [[Bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] organization from infecting the Earth's oceans with a [[virus]]. The game features a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode where the player must complete a series of episodes that involve solving [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]] and defeating enemies, and a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode where players may fight their way through altered single-player scenarios.

''Revelations'' emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. It was designed to bring back the content and horror of the series' roots, while at the same time trying to modernize the gameplay. ''Revelations'' was also the first game to support the Nintendo 3DS [[Circle Pad Pro]] outside Japan. The game was a moderate commercial success and received generally positive reviews from video game publications. Several critics praised its graphics, sound effects, and horror setting, but some criticized its inconsistent gameplay between scenarios.

A [[High-definition video|high definition]] (HD) version was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii U]], and [[Xbox 360]] in 2013, and for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2017. This version does not support the [[Autostereoscopy|3D capabilities]] of the Nintendo 3DS but features upgraded graphics and other minor changes. Across all platforms, the HD version sold more than two million copies worldwide but received less critical praise than the Nintendo 3DS version. A sequel, ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]'', was released in 2015.

==Gameplay==

''Resident Evil: Revelations'' is a [[survival horror]] game where the player controls the on-screen character from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person]] perspective to interact with the environment and enemies. In the game's [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign, the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide walkthrough"/&gt; Most of the scenarios involve the player controlling [[Jill Valentine]] aboard a ghost ship in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], but some require the player to play as other characters in different settings.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide walkthrough"/&gt; To finish a scenario and proceed to the next one, the player must complete certain objectives such as solving [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]], defeating a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game, among others.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide walkthrough"/&gt;

As a survival horror game, ''Revelations'' emphasizes survival, evasion, and exploration over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide walkthrough"/&gt; Up to three firearms can be carried at one time, in addition to [[Hand grenade|grenades]] and the standard [[combat knife]]. Firearms range from [[handgun]]s to [[shotgun]]s, [[submachine gun]]s and [[rifle]]s.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide basics"/&gt; When aiming a firearm to shoot enemies, the gameplay switches into either a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] or an [[Over the shoulder shot|over-the-shoulder]] perspective.&lt;ref name="GI review"/&gt; As Valentine, the player can upgrade firearms by finding special items throughout the game.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide basics"/&gt; The player may also perform melee attacks when an enemy has been stunned after being shot at the right time. Ammunition and health suppliers are dispersed among the game to help players increase their resources.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide basics"/&gt; A device called Genesis can be used to scan and find items hidden throughout the game's environments.&lt;ref name="GI review"/&gt; An [[automap]] feature is available to help players navigate the game.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide basics"/&gt;

In addition to the single-player campaign, ''Revelations'' offers a more action-oriented mode, called Raid Mode, where one or two players may fight their way through a selection of altered scenarios from the single-player campaign.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide raid mode"/&gt; These usually feature enemies of varying power for the player to defeat. Once a scenario has been completed, the player is rewarded with experience and battle points that can be exchanged for various weapons and items at a store. Gaining experience and acquiring new equipment allow players to progress to higher and more challenging scenarios.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide raid mode"/&gt; As the player progresses throughout the game, the player may also unlock numerous characters for use in both the single-player campaign and Raid Mode, with each character having a different set of abilities and melee attack.&lt;ref name="Official Bradygames Guide characters"/&gt; The game supports a [[StreetPass]] functionality that allows different players to exchange items for use in the game.&lt;ref name="EuroG StreetPass"/&gt;

==Plot==
''Revelations'' is set between ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'', shortly after the establishment of the [[counter-terrorism]] group Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; One year prior to the game's events, the Federal Bioterrorism Commission (FBC) sent agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat to keep the city of Terragrigia under control after the [[Bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] organization Il Veltro launched an attack using genetically modified living creatures in opposition to Terragrigia's solar energy development. In the present, BSAA head Clive R. O'Brian sends out BSAA agents Jill Valentine and Parker to search for BSAA agents [[Chris Redfield]] and Jessica at their last known location, the cruise ship ''Queen Zenobia'' in the Mediterranean Sea. They have reportedly gone missing during their mission to investigate Veltro's possible reappearance.

Aboard the ship, Jill and Parker enter a room where they believe Chris is being held, realizing too late that it was a trap set by a Veltro operative. Meanwhile, Chris and Jessica find a base of operations for Veltro; the Valkoinen Mökki airstrip in the mountains. Being informed by O'Brian that Jill and Parker are missing in the Mediterranean, they are redeployed to investigate their whereabouts. O'Brian also sends BSAA agents Quint Cetcham and Keith Lumley to Valkoinen Mökki to gather information. Awakening in separate locked rooms, Jill and Parker manage to regroup and witness a video transmission of a Veltro member threatening to infect one-fifth of the Earth's oceans with the T-Abyss, which was created in retaliation to the FBC for their involvement in the destruction of Veltro's forces on Terragrigia. Jill and Parker reach the ship's antenna to request evacuation but learn that FBC director Morgan Lansdale activated a satellite attack on the ''Queen Zenobia'', which floods the ship with water.

Chris and Jessica arrive at the ''Queen Zenobia'' and eventually meet with Jill and Parker. The team is confronted by the Veltro operative, but Jessica shoots him before he reveals details of a larger conspiracy. Parker unmasks him to discover that he was his FBC partner Raymond Vester. He seemingly dies after whispering something to him. Afterward, Chris and Jill make their way to the ship's laboratory to stop the virus from contaminating the sea, while Parker and Jessica search for a way to stop the ship from sinking. As told by Vester, Parker turns his gun on Jessica, suspecting her of being an FBC mole. Jessica wounds Parker and initiates a self-destruct sequence before escaping. Vester reveals himself to be alive and working with O'Brian. Having found the laboratory, Chris and Jill are confronted by Lansdale via a video uplink, revealing that he worked with Veltro in the Terragrigia panic in an effort to increase the FBC's funding and international influence. The pair neutralizes the virus and proceeds to an extraction point.

O'Brian informs Chris and Jill that he had orchestrated the events in an effort to gather evidence of Lansdale's involvement in Terragrigia. He also informs them of the results from Keith and Quint's data analysis: the existence of a sister ship below the ruins of Terragrigia, which was destroyed by Lansdale to eliminate incriminating evidence of his involvement. However, Lansdale then proceeds to arrest O'Brian, cutting off communications. In the sister ship, Jill and Chris search for Veltro leader Jack Norman, knowing that he holds evidence against Lansdale. However, he has gone delusional and survived a year by injecting himself with T-Abyss. After a long battle, Chris and Jill defeat him and broadcast the video, exposing Lansdale. As a result, O'Brian is released and the FBC is dissolved. In the end, it is revealed that Parker was ultimately saved by Vester. In a [[post-credits scene]], Vester approaches Jessica at a cafe and gives her a sample of the T-Abyss. She asks him why he saved Parker, with him replying that he "had his reasons".

==Development==
[[File:Resident Evil Revelations Art.png|250px|thumb|A cruise ship was chosen as the main setting of the game due to its claustrophobic corridors and isolation in the middle of the ocean. This [[concept art]] depicts the protagonist navigating the ship's corridors.]]

''Revelations'' was developed by [[Capcom]] and directed by Koshi Nakanishi, who previously worked as a game designer for ''Resident Evil 5''.&lt;ref name="Metacritic Nakanishi"/&gt; The game was developed simultaneously with ''[[Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D]]'' and the people who worked on the game were not involved with the development of ''[[Resident Evil 6]]''.&lt;ref name="EGM GDC 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XA interview"/&gt; The development team chose to develop the game for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] because they felt that its [[Autostereoscopy|3D capabilities]] could produce a "tense, scary experience with a realistic atmosphere that could make players feel like there could be something lurking around every corner."&lt;ref name="The making of RER 1"/&gt; The developers decided to give the game an episodic structure with short and varied chapters to make it suitable for playing on a [[Handheld game console|portable game console]].&lt;ref name="The making of RER 2"/&gt; The Raid mode was designed so that players could "bring the game to their friend's house and enjoy it with friends face to face, as they talk."&lt;ref name="Metro interview"/&gt;

The developer's main goal was to bring back the content and horror of the series' roots, while at the same time trying to modernize the gameplay.&lt;ref name="XA interview"/&gt; A cruise ship was chosen as the main setting of the game because it could provide claustrophobic corridors and make the player helpless in the middle of the ocean.&lt;ref name="The making of RER 1"/&gt; The ship's main hall was inspired by the [[Palais Garnier]] opera house in Paris.&lt;ref name="OCW Main Hall"/&gt; To increase the horror aspect of the game, enemies were designed to moan and emit terrifying sounds even before being spotted by the player. Nakanishi remarked that this mechanic allows players to determine which enemies are coming for them from their sound alone.&lt;ref name="The making of RER 2"/&gt; Although [[zombie]]s are the main enemies in the first ''Resident Evil'' games, the team opted to create "water-logged" creatures with deformed structures for ''Revelations'' to widen the variety of enemies of the franchise.&lt;ref name="OCW Ooze"/&gt;

''Revelations'' uses a [[porting|ported]] and downsized version of the internally developed [[MT Framework]] graphics [[Game engine|engine]], which was originally designed for [[High-definition video|high definition]] (HD) games such as ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' and ''[[Lost Planet 2]]''.&lt;ref name="The making of RER 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joystiq MT Framework"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGM GDC 2012"/&gt; Capcom's previous experience with ''The Mercenaries 3D'' helped the development team improve the technical and graphical aspects of the game to a greater extent.&lt;ref name="EGM GDC 2012"/&gt; According to Nakanishi, "It was thanks to the tremendous efforts of our technical team that we were able to get console-quality graphics from portable hardware."&lt;ref name="The making of RER 1"/&gt; Some techniques were used to reduce performance costs; for example, the Genesis scanner reduces the on-screen display complexity, while some creatures were designed to have simplistic skeletal physics and no HD textures.&lt;ref name="The making of RER 2"/&gt; A pair of [[glasses]] for Jill was originally suggested as the Genesis scanner.&lt;ref name="OCW Scanner"/&gt;

Unlike in previous ''[[Resident Evil]]'' titles, the developers designed ''Revelations'' so that the player could move and shoot at the same time.&lt;ref name="Metro interview"/&gt; Producer Masachika Kawata explained that the reason why the mechanic was not adopted earlier was that it would make the game too fast for a survival horror game. Nevertheless, the developers balanced the gameplay of the game by slowing down the speed of the player movement and by making enemies move in a complex and spooky manner, "as if they're trying to avoid your attack."&lt;ref name="Metro interview"/&gt; The developers decided to support the [[Circle Pad Pro]] accessory as soon as it was conceived because improving the game controls was a major priority.&lt;ref name="Metro interview"/&gt;

In December 2010, it was reported that only 20% of the game was complete.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar horror roots"/&gt; Numerous features were not included in the final product due to time and budget constraints.&lt;ref name="The making of RER 2"/&gt; The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eighth episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it.&lt;ref name="The making of RER 2"/&gt; Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.&lt;ref name="The making of RER 2"/&gt;

==Marketing and release==
''Revelations'' was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010]] trade show in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="IGN E3 2010"/&gt; A playable [[Game demo|demo]] referred to as a "pilot version" by Capcom was released with ''Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="IGN Demo 2011"/&gt; Another playable demo of the game was made available for download from the [[Nintendo eShop]] service in January 2012 in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="IGN Demo 2012"/&gt; [[IGN]] editors nominated the game for Best 3DS Game at their Best of [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011|E3 2011]] Awards and later listed it as one of the 30 most anticipated games of 2012.&lt;ref name="IGN Best E3 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Most Anticipated"/&gt; Prior to its release, Capcom sent North American copies of ''Revelations'' to reviewers with the game's title, as printed on the cover's spine, misspelled as "Revelaitons". To make up for the error, Capcom offered to replace the cover with a corrected version to users in North America.&lt;ref name="IGN spelling"/&gt;

''Revelations'' was released on January 26, 2012, in Japan, January 27, 2012, in Europe, and February 7, 2012, in North America.&lt;ref name="IGN Game details"/&gt; It was the first game to support the Circle Pad Pro outside Japan.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra bundle"/&gt; A bundle containing the accessory and the game was exclusively released in Europe.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra bundle"/&gt; According to [[Media Create]], the game sold 296,040 copies in Japan in 2012.&lt;ref name="Siliconera Japan sales"/&gt; In the United States, the game was among the 25 best-selling video games of February 2012 and sold 122,000 units in March 2012.&lt;ref name="Joystiq US sales"/&gt; Although sales of ''Revelations'' were considered successful for a Nintendo 3DS game, Capcom wanted it to sell "a little more" given the game's large development costs.&lt;ref name="EuroG 3DS market"/&gt;

''Revelations'' received generally positive reviews from video game critics.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; Jane Douglas of [[GameSpot]] felt that the game is "a thoroughly successful crossbreeding of old-school chills and new-school action", highlighting its brooding atmosphere and slow-paced combat.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Josh Laddin of [[Game Revolution]] went so far as to say that the game is sometimes even superior to the old-school ''Resident Evil'' games.&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt; Writing for IGN, Richard George described ''Revelations'' as "a great handheld game, one that not only pushes the boundaries and standards of the Nintendo 3DS but one that recaptures a long-forgotten spirit of a classic franchise."&lt;ref name="IGN review 2"/&gt; However, he also criticized the scenarios not involving the cruise ship setting and remarked that the constant alterations of characters and gameplay between scenarios hold the game "back from true greatness", stating that the game "doesn't understand its strengths".&lt;ref name="IGN review 2"/&gt;

Several critics declared the game's graphics to be some of the best on the Nintendo 3DS.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review 1"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] reviewer Rich Stanton praised the environments for their lighting and particle effects, while GameSpot credited the highly detailed character models, especially those of Jill and some enemies.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; IGN also highlighted the sound design, saying that "Capcom has mastered the ability to play up a soundtrack when appropriate, sometimes completely cutting to isolated noises in order to focus a player on something truly haunting."&lt;ref name="IGN review 1"/&gt; Game Revolution stated similar pros, noting that the game is best experienced when played in the dark with headphones on.&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt; Tim Turi of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the story for its episodic structure and pacing, but also admitted that BSAA agents Quint and Keith are the worst characters in the series' history.&lt;ref name="GI review"/&gt; The fact that the game supports the Circle Pad Pro was seen as a valuable feature, as it gives players the ability to move, shoot and control the camera at the same time.&lt;ref name="GI Circle Pad Pro"/&gt;

In a mixed review, ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' felt that the gameplay "takes the best and worst of ''Resident Evil''{{'}}s past and present, and spot welds them together unevenly. If the designers had committed wholeheartedly to either polarity of action or horror, ''Revelations'' may have been a headshot, but what we're left with is more like a glancing blow."&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; GameSpot praised the gameplay for its stop-and-shoot action and use of the Genesis scanner, saying that it "nicely complements the resource scavenging that underpins your survival."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; ''Game Informer'' felt that the weapon customization allows for different playstyles, but also criticized the game's lack of enemy variety in comparison to other games in the series.&lt;ref name="GI review"/&gt; Jonathan Deesing of [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] praised the exploration of the cruise ship setting, comparing it favorably to ''[[Super Metroid]]''.&lt;ref name="G4 review"/&gt; However, he criticized the controls for being frustrating and the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI-controlled]] companions for being useless.&lt;ref name="G4 review"/&gt; Similarly, IGN remarked that the fact that the player is accompanied by a partner makes the game less scary.&lt;ref name="IGN review 2"/&gt; The Raid Mode was seen as a valuable addition to the game.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G4 review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; Eurogamer stated that the mode "is a great concept for 3DS" and the game "executes it with conviction" due to its unlockable features, challenge, and replayability.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;

A '''sediment control''' is a practice or device designed to keep [[erosion|eroded]] [[soil]] on a [[construction]] site, so that it does not wash off and cause [[water pollution]] to a nearby stream, river, lake, or sea. Sediment controls are usually employed together with [[erosion control]]s, which are designed to prevent or minimize erosion and thus reduce the need for sediment controls.  Sediment controls are generally designed to be temporary measures, however, some can be used for storm water management purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Erosions and Sediment Control|year=2010|publisher=Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active treatment systems==
Chemical treatment of sediment, commonly called an '''active treatment system,''' is a relatively new form of sediment control for the construction industry.  It is designed to reduce [[turbidity]] in nearby water bodies and involves collection of sediment-laden stormwater in a basin or tank, and adding a chemical [[Flocculation#Flocculants|flocculant]]. An example video of chemical dosing on slow settling solids is on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oya6cQsUzqY Example video of chemical dosing on slow settling solids]&lt;/ref&gt;  This causes the sediment to settle so it can be more easily removed from the water.  Some of the flocculent chemicals used for sediment treatment are [[chitosan]] and  [[polymer]]s such as [[polyacrylamide]]. The water is then pumped through a removal system, such as a [[Siltbuster]], [[sand filter|sand]] or cartridge filter, prior to discharge. Chemical sediment control is currently used on some construction sites around the [[United States]] and Europe, typically larger sites where there is a high potential for damage to nearby streams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.
[http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-11.pdf “California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Chemical Treatment.”] Fact Sheet No. SE-11. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another active treatment system design uses [[electrocoagulation#Electrocoagulation in water treatment|electrocoagulation]] to flocculate suspended particles in the stormwater, followed by a filtration stage.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Arthur H., et al. 2004. [http://www.stormh2o.com/may-june-2004/construction-stormwater-treatment.aspx "Raising the Bar on Construction Stormwater Treatment."]  [http://www.stormh2o.com ''Stormwater:''] May–June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory requirements==
All [[U.S. state|states]] in the U.S. have laws requiring installation of erosion and sediment controls (ESCs) on construction sites of a specified size.  Federal regulations require ESCs on sites {{convert|1|acre|ha|abbr=on}} and larger.  Smaller sites which are part of a common plan of development (e.g. a residential [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]) are also required to have ESCs.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/regulations/sw2-part1.pdf “Regulations for Revision of the Water Pollution Control Program Addressing Storm Water Discharges; Final Rule”]  (Commonly called the “Phase II Stormwater Rule.”) ''Federal Register,'' 64 FR 68721, December 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, non-contiguous sites under {{convert|1|acre|m2|sing=on}} are also required to have ESCs. For example, the State of [[Maryland]] requires ESCs on sites of {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;State of Maryland. ''Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR).'' [http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/26/26.17.01.05.htm ''Activities for Which Approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plans are Required.''] Sec. 26.17.01.05.&lt;/ref&gt; The sediment controls must be installed before the beginning of land disturbance (i.e. land clearing, grubbing and [[land grading|grading]]) and must be maintained during the entire disturbance phase of construction.

In [[mathematics]], a '''series''' is, roughly speaking, a description of the operation of adding infinitely many quantities, one after the other, to a given starting quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calculus Made Easy|last1=Thompson |first1=Silvanus |authorlink1=Silvanus P. Thompson|last2=Gardner |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Gardner |date=1998 |isbn=978-0312185480}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of series is a major part of [[calculus]] and its generalization, [[mathematical analysis]]. Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].

For a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical by mathematicians and [[philosopher]]s. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch the tortoise. 

In modern terminology, any (ordered) [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; of [[term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is [[number]]s, [[function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like 
: &lt;math&gt;a_1+a_2+a_3+\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
or, using the [[summation sign]],
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the set to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the ''sum'' of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the ''{{math|''n''}}th partial sums'' of the series. That is, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i  = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i.&lt;/math&gt;
When this limit exists, one says that the series is ''convergent'' or ''summable'', or that the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the ''sum of the series''. Otherwise, the series is said to be ''divergent''.

Generally, the terms of a series come from a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;\Bbb R&lt;/math&gt; of the [[real number]]s or the field &lt;math&gt;\Bbb C&lt;/math&gt; of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].

==Basic properties==

An infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form&lt;ref name="SW501"&gt;{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol "+".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n &lt;/math&gt; .

If an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series &lt;math&gt;s=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n,&lt;/math&gt; its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is
:&lt;math&gt;s_k = \sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_k.&lt;/math&gt;
By definition, the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.&lt;ref name="SW501" /&gt; In this case, one usually writes 
:&lt;math&gt;L = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n.&lt;/math&gt;
A series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.

===Convergent series===
[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]
A series {{math|∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = \lim_{k\to\infty} s_k = \lim_{k\to\infty} \sum_{n=0}^k a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

An easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.

Working out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + \frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{8}+\cdots+ \frac{1}{2^n}+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to "visualize" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, ½, ¼, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off ½, we still have a piece of length ½ unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&amp;nbsp;¼.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&amp;nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that

:&lt;math&gt;S/2 = \frac{1+ \frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{8}+\cdots}{2} = \frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{8}+ \frac{1}{16} +\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;S-S/2 = 1 \Rightarrow S = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematicians extend the idiom discussed earlier to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, when we talk about a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in

:&lt;math&gt;x = 0.111\dots &lt;/math&gt;

we are talking, in fact, just about the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{10^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

But since these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111… can be identified with &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 &amp;times; 0.111&amp;hellip; = 0.999&amp;hellip; = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].

{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}

* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).  Example:
::&lt;math&gt;1 + {1 \over 2} + {1 \over 4} + {1 \over 8} + {1 \over 16} + \cdots=\sum_{n=0}^\infty{1 \over 2^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
:In general, the geometric series
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n&lt;/math&gt;
:converges [[if and only if]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|z| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

* An ''[[arithmetico-geometric series]]'' is a generalization of the geometric series, which has coefficients of the common ratio equal to the terms in an [[arithmetic sequence]].  Example:
::&lt;math&gt;3 + {5 \over 2} + {7 \over 4} + {9 \over 8} + {11 \over 16} + \cdots=\sum_{n=0}^\infty{(3+2n) \over 2^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

* The ''[[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]'' is the series
::&lt;math&gt;1 + {1 \over 2} + {1 \over 3} + {1 \over 4} + {1 \over 5} + \cdots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {1 \over n}.&lt;/math&gt;
:The harmonic series is [[harmonic series (mathematics)#Divergence|divergent]].

* An ''[[alternating series]]'' is a series where terms alternate signs.  Examples:
::&lt;math&gt;1 - {1 \over 2} + {1 \over 3} - {1 \over 4} + {1 \over 5} - \cdots =\sum_{n=1}^\infty {\left(-1\right)^{n-1} \over n}=\ln(2) \quad &lt;/math&gt; ([[alternating harmonic series]])

and

::&lt;math&gt;-1+\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} - \frac{1}{9} + \cdots =\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\left(-1\right)^n}{2n-1} = -\frac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

*The [[harmonic series (mathematics)#P-series|''p''-series]]
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^r}&lt;/math&gt;
:converges if ''r'' &gt; 1 and diverges for ''r'' ≤ 1, which can be shown with the integral criterion described below in [[Series (mathematics)#Convergence tests|convergence tests]]. As a function of ''r'', the sum of this series is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].

*A [[telescoping series]]
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty (b_n-b_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;
:converges if the [[sequence]] ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to a limit ''L'' as ''n'' goes to infinity. The value of the series is then ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''L''.

*There are some elementary series whose convergence is not yet known/proven. For example, it is unknown whether the Flint Hills series {{anchor|Flint Hills series|Flint Hills Series}}
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\csc^{2} n}{n^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;
:converges or not. The convergence depends on how well &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated with rational numbers (which is unknown as of yet). More specifically, the values of ''n'' with large numerical contributions to the sum are the numerators of the continued fraction convergents of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, a sequence beginning with 1, 3, 22, 333, 355, 103993, ... {{OEIS|A046947}}. These are integers that are close to &lt;math&gt;n\pi&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''n'', so that &lt;math&gt;\sin n\pi&lt;/math&gt; is close to 0 and its reciprocal is large. Alekseyev (2011) proved that if the series converges, then the [[irrationality measure]] of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than 2.5, which is much smaller than the current known bound of 7.6063....&lt;ref&gt;Max A. Alekseyev, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5100 On convergence of the Flint Hills series],  	arXiv:1104.5100, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|FlintHillsSeries|Flint Hills Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculus and partial summation as an operation on sequences==
Partial summation takes as input a sequence, {&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, and gives as output another sequence, {&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}. It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[linear function|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the vector space of sequences, denoted Σ. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, Δ. These behave as discrete analogs of [[integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence {1, 1, 1, ...} has series {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that &lt;math&gt;\int_0^x 1\,dt = x.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].

==Properties of series==
Series are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.

===Non-negative terms===
When ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series ∑''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' of partial sums is bounded.

For example, the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is convergent, because the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\frac1 {n^2} \le \frac{1}{n-1} - \frac{1}{n}, \quad n \ge 2,&lt;/math&gt;

and a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].

===Absolute convergence===
{{Main article|Absolute convergence}}
A series
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;
is said to '''converge absolutely''' if the series of [[absolute value]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left|a_n\right|&lt;/math&gt;
converges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.

===Conditional convergence===
{{Main article|Conditional convergence}}
A series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \over n} = 1 - {1 \over 2} + {1 \over 3} - {1 \over 4} + {1 \over 5} - \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

which is convergent (and its sum is equal to&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&amp;nbsp;''S''.

[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\sum a_n = \sum \lambda_n b_n&lt;/math&gt;

where the partial sums ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot; + ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are bounded, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} exists:

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_N \Bigl| \sum_{n=0}^N b_n \Bigr| &lt; \infty, \ \ \sum |\lambda_{n+1} - \lambda_n| &lt; \infty\ \text{and} \ \lambda_n B_n \ \text{converges,}&lt;/math&gt;

then the series {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is convergent.  This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\sin(n x)}{\ln n}&lt;/math&gt;

with 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 2π.  Abel's method consists in writing ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to the absolutely convergent series

:&lt;math&gt; \sum (\lambda_n - \lambda_{n+1}) \, B_n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Convergence tests==
{{Main article|Convergence tests}}
* ''[[n-th term test]]'': If lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''→∞&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 then the series diverges.
*Comparison test 1 (see [[Direct comparison test]]): If ∑''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp; is an [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]] series such that |''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;≤ ''C''&amp;nbsp;|''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;| for some number ''C''&amp;thinsp; and for sufficiently large ''n''&amp;nbsp;, then ∑''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp; converges absolutely as well. If ∑|''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;| diverges, and |''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;≥ |''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;| for all sufficiently large ''n''&amp;nbsp;, then ∑''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp; also fails to converge absolutely (though it could still be conditionally convergent, e.g. if the ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp; alternate in sign).
*Comparison test 2 (see [[Limit comparison test]]): If ∑''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp; is an absolutely convergent series such that |''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;/''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;≤ |''b&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;/''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;| for sufficiently large ''n''&amp;nbsp;, then ∑''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp; converges absolutely as well. If ∑|''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;| diverges, and |''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;/''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;≥ |''b&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;/''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;| for all sufficiently large ''n''&amp;nbsp;, then ∑''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp; also fails to converge absolutely (though it could still be conditionally convergent, e.g. if the ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp; alternate in sign).
*[[Ratio test]]: If there exists a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 1 such that |''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;/''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;''C'' for all sufficiently large&amp;nbsp;''n'', then ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges absolutely. When the ratio is less than 1, but not less than a constant less than 1, convergence is possible but this test does not establish it.
*[[Root test]]: If there exists a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 1 such that |''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤ ''C'' for all sufficiently large&amp;nbsp;''n'', then ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges absolutely.
*[[Integral test for convergence|Integral test]]: if ''ƒ''(''x'') is a positive [[monotone decreasing]] function defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1, ∞&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;!--DO NOT "FIX" THE "TYPO" IN THE FOREGOING.  IT IS INTENDED TO SAY [...)

*[[Cauchy's condensation test]]: If ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is non-negative and non-increasing, then the two series&amp;thinsp; ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp; and&amp;thinsp; ∑2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; are of the same nature: both convergent, or both divergent.
*[[Alternating series test]]: A series of the form ∑(&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0) is called ''alternating''. Such a series converges if the [[sequence]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[monotone decreasing]] and converges to&amp;nbsp;0. The converse is in general not true.
*For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].

==Series of functions==
{{Main article|Function series}}
A series of real- or complex-valued functions

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]]''' on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums
:&lt;math&gt;s_N(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;
converge to ''ƒ''(''x'') as ''N''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ for each ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E''.

A stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called '''[[uniform convergence]]'''.  The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''ƒ''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,
:&lt;math&gt;|s_N(x) - f(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
can be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.

Uniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].

More sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''ƒ'' provided
:&lt;math&gt;\int_E \left|s_N(x)-f(x)\right|^2\,dx \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
as ''N''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞.

===Power series===
:{{Main article|Power series}}

A '''power series''' is a series of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-c)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
is the Taylor series of &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.

Unless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].

Historically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.

=== Formal power series ===
{{main|Formal power series}}

While many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol "+" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert–Poincaré series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.

Even if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series "formally", treating the symbol "+" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: §III.2.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.

===Laurent series===
{{Main article|Laurent series}}
Laurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n x^n.&lt;/math&gt;
If such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.

===Dirichlet series===
:{{Main article|Dirichlet series}}

A [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty {a_n \over n^s},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is a [[complex number]].  For example, if all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the [[Riemann zeta function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}.&lt;/math&gt;

Like the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in [[analytic number theory]].  Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}\setminus\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&amp;nbsp;1.

This series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].

===Trigonometric series===
{{Main article|Trigonometric series}}
A series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac12 A_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(A_n\cos nx + B_n \sin nx\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.

==History of the theory of infinite series==

===Development of infinite series===
[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a
method that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|&amp;pi;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].

===Convergence criteria===
The investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series

:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{\alpha\beta}{1\cdot\gamma}x + \frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)\beta(\beta+1)}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot \gamma(\gamma+1)}x^2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
on which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.

[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.

[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]
:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{m}{1!}x + \frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

corrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely
scientific summation of the series for complex values of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.

Cauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and
the same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate
investigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose
logarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have
shown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]
(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);
[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]
(1853).

General criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been
studied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various
contributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),
DuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.

===Uniform convergence===
The theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his
limitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it
successfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847–48). Cauchy took up the
problem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching
the same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the
doctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the
importance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform
convergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.

===Semi-convergence===
A series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].

Semi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),
who attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schlömilch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&amp;nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \cdots + (x - 1)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.

Among the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose "loi suprême" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into
prominence.

===Fourier series===
[[Fourier series]] were being investigated
as the result of physical considerations at the same time that
Gauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite
series. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple
arcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by
[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still
earlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,
as did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schröter|Schröter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].

Fourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to
expand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of
multiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Théorie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the
formulas for determining the coefficients in the series;
Fourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general
theorem. [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820–23) also attacked the problem from a
different standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question
of convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to
attempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly
scientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by
Riemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schläfli|Schläfli]], and
[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of
trigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],
Krause, Byerly and [[Paul Émile Appell|Appell]].

==Generalizations==

===Asymptotic series===
[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge. But they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.

===Divergent series===
{{Main article|Divergent series}}
Under many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Cesàro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).

A variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman–Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.

===Series in Banach spaces===
The notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series Σ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,
:&lt;math&gt;\biggl\|x - \sum_{n=0}^N x_n\biggr\|\to 0&lt;/math&gt;
as ''N''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞.

More generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, Σ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.

===Summations over arbitrary index sets===
Definitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonné|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.

If &lt;math&gt;a:I \mapsto G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the "series" associated to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[formal sum]] of the elements &lt;math&gt;a(x) \in G &lt;/math&gt; over the index elements &lt;math&gt;x \in I&lt;/math&gt; denoted by the
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in I} a(x).&lt;/math&gt;

When the index set is the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;I=\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;a:\mathbb{N} \mapsto G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[sequence]] denoted by &lt;math&gt;a(n)=a_n&lt;/math&gt;. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

====Families of non-negative numbers====
When summing a family {''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}, ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}a_i = \sup \Bigl\{ \sum_{i\in A}a_i\,\big| A \text{ finite, } A \subset I\Bigr\} \in [0, +\infty].&lt;/math&gt;

When the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''I'' such that ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 is countable.  Indeed, for every ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥ 1, the set &lt;math&gt; A_n = \{ i \in I \,:\, a_i &gt; 1/n \}&lt;/math&gt; is finite, because

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 n \, \textrm{card}(A_n) \le \sum_{i\in A_n} a_i  \le \sum_{i\in I}a_i &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''I''&amp;thinsp; is countably infinite and enumerated as ''I''&amp;nbsp;= {''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...} then the above defined sum satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in I} a_i = \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} a_{i_k},&lt;/math&gt;

provided the value ∞ is allowed for the sum of the series.

Any sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the [[counting measure]], which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.

====Abelian topological groups====
Let ''a''&amp;nbsp;: ''I'' → ''X'', where ''I''&amp;thinsp; is any set and ''X''&amp;thinsp; is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Let ''F''&amp;thinsp; be the collection of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]s of ''I''.  Note that ''F''&amp;thinsp; is a [[directed set]] [[Partially ordered set|ordered]] under [[inclusion (mathematics)|inclusion]] with [[union (set theory)|union]] as [[join (mathematics)|join]].  Define the sum ''S''&amp;thinsp; of the family ''a'' as the limit

:&lt;math&gt; S = \sum_{i\in I}a_i = \lim \Bigl\{\sum_{i\in A}a_i\,\big| A\in F\Bigr\}&lt;/math&gt;

if it exists and say that the family ''a'' is unconditionally summable.  Saying that the sum ''S''&amp;thinsp; is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood ''V''&amp;thinsp; of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''I''&amp;thinsp; such that

:&lt;math&gt;S - \sum_{i \in A} a_i \in V, \quad A \supset A_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Because ''F''&amp;thinsp; is not [[total order|totally ordered]], this is not a [[limit of a sequence]] of partial sums, but rather of a [[net (mathematics)|net]].&lt;ref name="Bourbaki"&gt;{{cite book|title=General Topology: Chapters 1–4 |first=Nicolas |last=Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783540642411 |pages=261–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Choquet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Topology |first=Gustave |last=Choquet |authorlink=Gustave Choquet |year=1966 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780121734503 |pages=216–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a smaller neighborhood ''V''&amp;thinsp; such that ''V''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; ''V''&amp;nbsp;⊂ ''W''. It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is: for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''I''&amp;thinsp; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in A_1} a_i - \sum_{i \in A_2} a_i \in W, \quad A_1, A_2 \supset A_0.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''X''&amp;thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&amp;thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&amp;thinsp; is complete and ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&amp;nbsp;⊂ ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''j''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.

When the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.

If a family ''a'' in ''X''&amp;thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''I''&amp;thinsp; such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈ ''W''&amp;thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  If ''X''&amp;thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''I''&amp;thinsp; such that ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).

====Unconditionally convergent series====
Suppose that ''I''&amp;nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈ '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = \sum_{n \in \mathbf{N}} a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

By nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''σ'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{\sigma(n)} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, if every permutation of a series ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&amp;thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&amp;thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ±1&lt;!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. --&gt;, the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \varepsilon_n a_n&lt;/math&gt;

converges in ''X''.  If ''X''&amp;thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series ∑''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of vectors in ''X''&amp;thinsp; converges absolutely if

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n \in \mathbf{N}} \|a_n\| &lt; +\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).

====Well-ordered sums====
Conditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example an [[ordinal number]] ''α''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\beta &lt; \alpha + 1} a_\beta = a_{\alpha} + \sum_{\beta &lt; \alpha} a_\beta&lt;/math&gt;

and for a limit ordinal ''α'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\beta &lt; \alpha} a_\beta = \lim_{\gamma\to\alpha} \sum_{\beta &lt; \gamma} a_\beta&lt;/math&gt;

if this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''α''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then the series converges.

====Examples====

{{ordered list
|1= Given a function ''f''&amp;nbsp;: ''X''→''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''

:&lt;math&gt;f_a(x)=
\begin{cases}
0 &amp; x\neq a, \\
f(a) &amp; x=a, \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

a function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;f=\sum_{a \in X}f_a&lt;/math&gt;

in the [[topology of pointwise convergence]] (that is, the sum is taken in the infinite product group ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;).

|2= In the definition of [[partitions of unity]], one constructs sums of functions over arbitrary index set ''I'',

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i \in I} \varphi_i(x) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

While, formally, this requires a notion of sums of uncountable series, by construction there are, for every given ''x'', only finitely many nonzero terms in the sum, so issues regarding convergence of such sums do not arise.  Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is ''locally finite'', ''i.e.'', for every ''x'' there is a neighborhood of ''x'' in which all but a finite number of functions vanish.  Any regularity property of the ''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',&amp;thinsp; such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.

|3= On the [[first uncountable ordinal]] ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; viewed as a topological space in the [[order topology]], the constant function ''f'': [0,ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) → [0,ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;] given by ''f''(α) = 1 satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\alpha\in[0,\omega_1)}f(\alpha) = \omega_1&lt;/math&gt;

(in other words, ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; copies of 1 is ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) only if one takes a limit over all ''countable'' partial sums, rather than finite partial sums.  This space is not separable.

They want to be accepted to the Star Frame Class, which is directly taught by the members of the Kao Council, the most talented students from the Musical Department who stand at the top within the academy. Luckily, they are spotted by Itsuki Otori, one of Kao Council members who puts them on his Star Team.

==Characters==

===Team Otori===
;{{nihongo|Yuta Hoshitani|星谷 悠太|Hoshitani Yūta}}
:{{voiced by|[[Natsuki Hanae]]}}
:Hoshitani is the bright and cheerful member of Team Otori. In the fall of his 2nd year in middle school, he was deeply touched by a certain high schooler's performance. Following that student who was wearing an Ayanagi Academy musical department uniform, he enters Ayanagi. In middle school he was in the ordinary department, and is basically an amateur concerning musicals and theater. However, his motivation and absorption of skills is top notch, and is a mood-maker who can be bright and optimistic no matter how hard the obstacle is. His roommate is Toru Nayuki.

;{{nihongo|Toru Nayuki|那雪 透|Nayuki Tōru}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kensho Ono]]}}
:Nayuki is the kind and gentle member of Team Otori that Hoshitani met during the entrance ceremony, and later on they find out that they are roommates. He initially had no intention of applying for the music department, only auditioning because of Hoshitani, but he came to love performing and becomes one of Hoshitani's closest friends. He has stage fright, which can be repelled by letting him drink a special tea which is a specialty of the Nayuki family.

;{{nihongo|Kaito Tsukigami|月皇 海斗|Tsukigami Kaito}}
:{{voiced by|[[Arthur Lounsbery]]}}
:With his father as a famous director, his mother as one of the most prolific theatrical actresses in Japan, and his older brother a musical genius, it was only natural for Tsukigami to enter Ayanagi. However, he greatly dislikes being compared to his family, especially his older brother who is an alumnus of Ayanagi. Though coming off as stiff and somewhat strict, Tsukigami gradually comes to care greatly for his companions especially after Hoshitani stands up for him, followed by his fellow teammates. He aims to become an actor. His roommate is Shu Kuga.

;{{nihongo|Kakeru Tengenji|天花寺 翔|Tengenji Kakeru}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]}}
:As a famous Kabuki actor from a well-known family, Tengenji has pride issues, looking down upon those who are not in the same class as him. Because he's lived in a world full of adults from a very young age, he is bad at communicating with peers, and does not fully understand the concept of friends, but because of the kindness and that Hoshitani showed him, he learns how to appreciate others. Due to being popular, he has gained a lot of female fans, and there have been rumors that the noise from his dorm room came from bringing women in. These rumors are proven false upon the introduction of Tavian, Tengenji's pet cat that he loves dearly.

;{{nihongo|Shu Kuga|空閑 愁|Kuga Shū}}
:{{voiced by|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]}}
:Kuga is the quiet and aloof member of Team Otori. After the death of his father, Kuga wanted to make his mother happy by imitating the musicals he saw on television, which led to him pursuing the musical world. According to Toraishi, being late for the musical department auditions has caused Kuga to be a member of Team Otori even though he had the skills to become a member of Team Hiragi. He gets along fairly well with his fellow members although maintains his silent demeanor. He works part-time at a bar with a piano, because he wanted to work in a place with something musical-related. His piano skills are self-taught, while his drawing skills are poor.

'''Strangling''' is compression of the neck that may lead to [[unconsciousness]] or [[death]] by causing an increasingly [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] state in the brain.&lt;ref name=ernoehazy&gt;Ernoehazy, William; Ernoehazy, WS. [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic227.htm Hanging Injuries and Strangulation]. ''www.emedicine.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fatal strangling typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and is one of two main ways that [[hanging]] causes death (alongside breaking the victim's neck).

Strangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practised in [[erotic asphyxia]], in the [[choking game]], and is an important technique in many [[combat sport]]s and [[self-defence]] systems. 
Strangling can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used:&lt;ref name=strack&gt;Strack, Gael; McClane, George.

* '''[[Hanging]]'''—Suspension from a cord wound around the neck
* '''Ligature strangulation'''—Strangulation without suspension using some form of cord-like object called a [[garrote]]
* '''Manual strangulation'''—Strangulation using the fingers or other extremity

==General==
[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|left|200 px|The neck contains several vulnerable targets for compression including the [[carotid arteries]].]]
Strangling involves one or several mechanisms that interfere with the normal flow of [[oxygen]] into the brain:&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, Richard. [http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/asphyxia.htm Asphyxia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226102952/http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/asphyxia.htm |date=2006-02-26 }}, [http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm Strangulation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430224427/http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm |date=2006-04-30 }}.

*Compression of the [[carotid arteries]] or [[jugular veins]]—causing [[cerebral ischemia]].
*Compression of the [[laryngopharynx]], [[larynx]], or [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]—causing [[asphyxia]].
*Stimulation of the [[carotid sinus reflex]]—causing [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], or both.
Depending on the particular method of strangulation, one or several of these typically occur in combination; [[cerebral ischemia|vascular obstruction]] is usually the main mechanism.&lt;ref name=ferris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathology.ubc.ca/path425/Others/MedicolegalInvestigationOfDeathAndForensic/AsphixiaDrJAJFerris.doc |title=Asphyxia |website=pathology.ubc.ca |author=J.

''www.aikiweb.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in all cases of strangulation, the rapidity of death can be affected by the susceptibility to [[carotid sinus stimulation]].&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt;  [[carotid sinus#Carotid sinus reflex death|Carotid sinus reflex death]] is sometimes considered a mechanism of death in cases of strangulation, but it remains highly disputed.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Passig, K.

URL last accessed February 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The reported time from application to [[unconsciousness]] varies from 7–14 seconds if effectively applied &lt;ref name=koiwai&gt;Koiwai, Karl. [http://judoinfo.com/chokes6.htm Deaths Allegedly Caused by the Use of "Choke Holds" (Shime-Waza)]. ''judoinfo.com'' URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; to one minute in other cases, with death occurring minutes after unconsciousness.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

==Manual strangulation==
'''Manual strangulation''' (also known as "throttling") is strangling with the hands, fingers, or other extremities and sometimes also with blunt objects, such as [[Club (weapon)|batons]]. Depending on how the strangling is performed, it may compress the [[airway]], interfere with the flow of blood in the neck, or work as a combination of the two. Consequently, manual strangulation may damage the [[larynx]],&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; and fracture the [[hyoid]] or other bones in the neck.&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; In cases of airway compression, manual strangling leads to the frightening sensation of [[air hunger]] and may induce violent struggling.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

More technical variants of manual strangulation are referred to as [[chokehold]]s, and are extensively practised and used in various [[martial arts]], [[combat sport]]s, [[self-defense]] systems, and in military [[hand-to-hand combat]] application. In some martial arts like [[judo]] and [[jujutsu]], strangles or chokes that constrict blood flow are regarded as a safe{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} way to render the opponent unconscious as opposed to other attacks, e.g., strikes to the head.
During the 18th century, a sentence of "Death by Throttling" would be passed upon the verdict of a [[Court Martial]] for the crime of desertion from the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Culloden''. BBC Drama Documentary, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ligature strangulation==
{{Main|Garrote}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Operation: Mindcrime]] --&gt;
'''Ligature strangulation''' (also known as "garroting") is strangling with some form of cord such as rope, wire, or shoe laces, either partially or fully circumferencing the neck.&lt;ref name=turvey&gt;Turvey, Brent (1996). [http://www.corpus-delicti.com/ligature.html A guide to the physical analysis of ligature patterns in homicide investigations]. Knowledge Solutions Library, Electronic Publication. ''www.corpus-delicti.com''. URL last accessed March 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the mechanism of strangulation is similar, it is usually distinguished from [[hanging]] by the strangling force being something other than the person's own bodyweight.&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; Incomplete occlusion of the [[carotid arteries]] is expected and, in cases of [[homicide]], the victim may struggle for a period of time,&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; with unconsciousness typically occurring in 10 to 15 seconds.&lt;ref name=turvey/&gt; Cases of ligature strangulation generally involve homicides of women, children, and the elderly,&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; but accidents and suicides occur as well.&lt;ref name=dundee&gt;University of Dundee, Forensic Medicine. [http://www.dundee.ac.uk/forensicmedicine/llb/deaths.htm#Stages Asphyxial Deaths]. ''www.dundee.ac.uk''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to hanging, the ligature mark will most likely be located lower on the neck of the victim.

During the [[Spanish Inquisition]], victims who admitted their alleged sins and recanted were killed via ligature strangulation (i.e. the [[garrote]]) before their bodies were burnt during the ''[[auto-da-fé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James Jr. ''Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the Defeat of the Moors.'' Doubleday, 2005. {{ISBN|0-385-50848-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of the 20th and 21st centuries, the [[American Mafia]] used ligature strangulation as a means of murdering their victims.  Confessed American [[serial killer]] [[Altemio Sanchez]] used ligature strangulation in the rapes and/or murders of his victims, as did [[Gary Ridgway]], the Green River Killer.

{{wiktionary}}
A '''sucker punch''' ([[American English]]) (also known as a '''coward punch''', '''king hit''' or '''one-punch attack''' ([[Australian English]]);  or '''cold-cock''' ([[American English]])) is a [[punch (combat)|punch]] made without warning or while the recipient is distracted, allowing no time for preparation or defense on the part of the recipient. It is often thrown from behind—such as in the '[[knockout game]]'—although striking from behind is not a prerequisite for a sucker punch. The term is generally used in situations where the way in which the punch has been delivered is considered unfair or unethical, and is done using deception or distraction, hence the term 'sucker' used to refer to the victim. 

In [[boxing]], a sucker punch—as is done when 'hitting on the break', for example—is illegal. For example, when [[James Butler (boxer)|James Butler]] knocked [[Richard Grant (boxer)|Richard Grant]] unconscious after losing a fight to him on points, his license was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-12-04/news/anatomy-of-a-sucker-punch|title=The Anatomy of a Sucker Punch|publisher=Village Voice|author=Mitch Abramson|date=4 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2013 and 2014, significant media attention was paid to two violent killings involving one-hit punches in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/police-charge-builder-who-allegedly-cowardpunched-daniel-christie-with-murder/story-fni0cx4q-1226800203227|title=Police charge builder who allegedly coward-punched Daniel Christie with murder|first=Amy|last=Dale|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=12 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/thomas-kelly-murder-case-timeline/story-fni0cx12-1226761707462|title=Thomas Kelly murder case: timeline|first=Brenden|last=Hills|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 November 2013|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that 91 people had died in Australia in the previous four years from brain trauma as a result of being king hit, a media campaign was launched to refer to them as coward punches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/kellys-call-for-tougher-sentencing-laws/story-fnihsfrf-1226794126356?from=public_rss|title=NSW cops, pollies, docs call out 'cowards'|first=Sophie|last=Tarr|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=3 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-03/push-to-refer-to-king-hit-attacks-as-coward-punches/5183260|title=Push to refer to king hit attacks as 'coward punches' after teen left in coma|newspaper=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC online]]|date=3 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was supported by the [[New South Wales]] [[Government of New South Wales|Government]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Needham|first=Kirsty|title=Sydney teen dies following king-hit punch|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2017351/sydney-teen-dies-following-king-hit-punch/|accessdate=16 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the "one hit punch" and "king hit" is still a controversial subject among various minorities{{weasel-inline|date=May 2018}} within Australia.{{dubious|date=May 2018}} Each share different views on the actual punch, the circumstances around it or  what led to it, the people involved and the outcome of it. Australia has been a leader in criminalizing this kind of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearlman|first1=Jonathan|title=Australia leading the way in crackdown on one-punch killers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/10670485/Australia-leading-the-way-in-crackdown-on-one-punch-killers.html|accessdate=1 March 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|ref=http://www.thetelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "sucker punch" was widely discussed after the [[New York Jets]]' starting quarterback, [[Geno Smith]], was "sucker punched" by a fellow player, [[IK Enemkpali]], on August 11, 2015. The altercation was in the locker room about compensation regarding a $600 airplane ticket.

==Culture and media==
The sucker punch has been adapted into many films, video games and other forms of media. It can be used to show the antagonist's vileness, the low morals of an [[anti-hero]], betrayal of someone close to the protagonist, etc. However, it also can be used as a weapon of the protagonist to deal with an unfair situation.&lt;ref&gt;In the Lucas Arts 1992 game'' [[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'', page 7 of the [http://store.steampowered.com/manual/6010 game manual] states, "In most cases, you can 'sucker punch' your opponent and win the fight. Keep in mind that you don't get IQ points for using this option."&lt;/ref&gt; A sucker punch is a major dramatic element in the 2004 film ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]''. 

There are also several videos depicting sucker punches on video-sharing websites such as YouTube, however YouTube forbids such content as a violation of its [[YouTube community guidelines|Community Guidelines]] and are thus not supposed to be on there.

Australian soap operas ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''[[Home and Away]]'' have covered the topic in storylines broadcast in September 2014 and October 2015 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a599252/neighbours-james-mason-on-chriss-future-challenging-stories-ahead/|title=Neighbours' James Mason on Chris's future: 'Challenging stories ahead'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=26 September 2014|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a673216/home-and-away-spoilers-josh-barrett-left-fighting-for-his-life-after-coward-punch/|title=Home and Away spoilers: Josh Barrett left fighting for his life after coward punch|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=12 October 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Pokémon]] game series, a move has the English name of [[bulba:Sucker Punch (move)|Sucker Punch]]. It is a Dark-type move that allows the user to attack before the other Pokémon has a chance to, provided that the targeted Pokémon is going to attack in that same turn.

[[P. J. O'Rourke]] has referred to a combination of [[grain alcohol]] and [[Gatorade]] as "sucker punch."

==Prevention techniques==

Sucker punches tend to be done after employing distraction tactics such as pretending to notice something to trick the victim into looking also, having an accomplice to distract the victim, looking away to get the victim's guard down, or pretending to walk away only to turn around and deliver the strike. As sucker punches rely on deception they can often be anticipated using methods such as: 
* holding out the arms in a non-threatening manner, colloquially referred to as 'the fence' in many self-defense circles and communities. Many security personnel—such as those who work as doormen or '[[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]]'—are trained to do this.
* scanning the hands of the potential aggressor for signs of impending violence - such as clenching of the fists or the holding of a weapon, such as a knife
* watching the aggressor for sudden movements, or an abrupt deescalation of conflict, which is often used as a distraction technique.
Sucker punches are commonly performed using either a [[Hook (boxing)|hook]]-type punch, or a [[Haymaker (punch)|haymaker]]-type punch, as these are more damaging than straight shots due to the increased distance traveled thus enabling more time for acceleration.

Because sucker punches come unexpectedly, people at risk of such blows must be alert to the proximity of potential opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC|page=165|title=The Way of Kata|author=Lawrence A.

The concept of the '''Three Kingdoms of Korea''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=삼국시대}}) refers to the three kingdoms of [[Baekje]] (백제), [[Silla]] (신라) and [[Goguryeo]] (고구려). [[Goguryeo]] was later known as Goryeo (고려), from which the modern name ''[[Korea]]'' is derived. The Three Kingdoms period was defined as being from 57 BC to 668 AD (but there existed about 78 tribal states in the southern region of Korean peninsula and relatively big states like [[Okjeo]], [[Buyeo]], and [[Dongye]] in its northern part and Manchuria).

The three kingdoms occupied the entire [[Korean Peninsula]] and most of [[Manchuria]], located in present-day [[China]] and [[Russia]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The kingdoms of Baekje and Silla dominated the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and [[Tamna]], whereas Goguryeo controlled the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Manchuria]] and the northern half of the Korean Peninsula. Baekje and Goguryeo shared founding myths and originated from [[Buyeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=The National Folk Museum of Korea (South Korea)|title=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature: Encyclopedia of Korean Folklore and Traditional Culture Vol. III|date=2014|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788928900848|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DsR3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th century, allied with [[China]] under the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Silla]] unified the Korean Peninsula for the first time in Korean history, forming a united Korean national identity for the first time. After the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo, the [[Tang dynasty]] established a short-lived [[Protectorate General to Pacify the East|military government]] to administer parts of the Korean peninsula. However, as a result of the [[Silla–Tang Wars]] (≈670–676), Silla forces expelled the Protectorate armies from the peninsula in 676. The following period is known as the Unified Silla or Later Silla (668–935).

Subsequently, [[Dae Joyeong]], a former Goguryeo general, founded [[Balhae]] in the former territory of Goguryeo after defeating the [[Tang dynasty]] at the [[Battle of Tianmenling]].

The predecessor period, before the development of the full-fledged kingdoms, is sometimes called [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea|Proto–Three Kingdoms period]].

Main primary sources for this period include ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' and ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' in Korea, and the "Eastern Barbarians" section (東夷傳) from the ''Book of Wei'' (魏書) of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in China.

==Names==
Beginning in the 7th century, the name "[[Samhan]]" became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The "Han" in the names of the [[Korean Empire]], ''Daehan Jeguk'', and the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea), ''Daehan Minguk'' or ''Hanguk'', are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang"&gt;{{cite web |last1=이기환 |title=[이기환의 흔적의 역사]국호논쟁의 전말…대한민국이냐 고려공화국이냐 |url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201708300913001&amp;code=960100&amp;www |website=경향신문 |publisher=The Kyunghyang Shinmun |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chosun"&gt;{{cite web |last1=이덕일 |title=[이덕일 사랑] 대~한민국 |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/08/14/2008081401512.html |website=조선닷컴 |publisher=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Samguk Sagi]] and [[Samguk Yusa]], [[Silla]] implemented a national policy, "Samhan Unification" ({{hangul|삼한일통}}), to integrate refugees and migrants from [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]]. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in [[Cheongju]] with an inscription: "The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded."&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; During the [[Later Silla]] period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, [[Choe Chiwon]] equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt; By the [[Goryeo]] period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, [[Wang Geon]] declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt; Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the [[Joseon]] period and was widely referenced in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;

In China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web |title=고현묘지명(高玄墓誌銘) |url=http://gsm.nricp.go.kr/_third/user/frame.jsp?View=search&amp;No=4&amp;ksmno=7190 |website=한국금석문 종합영상정보시스템 |publisher=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name="kwon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deok-young |first1=Kwon |title=An inquiry into the name of Three Kingdom(三國) inscribed on the epitaph of T’ang(唐) period |journal=The Journal of Korean Ancient History |date=2014 |volume=75 |pages=105–137 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE02486618 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |issn=1226-6213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goguryeo was alternately called [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals "Mahan leaders" ({{Korean|마한추장|馬韓酋長|labels=no}}) in 645.&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; In 651, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea "Samhan", especially Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="kwon" /&gt; For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon ({{Korean|고현|高玄|labels=no}}), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a "Liaodong Samhan man" ({{Korean|요동 삼한인|遼東 三韓人|labels=no}}).&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; The [[History of Liao]] equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt;

The name "Three Kingdoms" was used in the titles of the Korean histories ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' (12th&amp;nbsp;century) and ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' (13th&amp;nbsp;century), and should not be confused with the Chinese [[Three Kingdoms]].

==Background==
[[File:7th century painting of Koreans.png|thumb|left|7th century Tang dynasty painting of envoys from the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla]]
The Three Kingdoms was founded after the fall of [[Wiman Joseon]], and gradually conquered and absorbed various other small states and confederacies. After the fall of Gojoseon, the [[Han dynasty]] established four [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] in present
[[Liaoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/5880-2-5623.pdf |title=The Puyeo-Koguryeo Ye-maek the Sushen-Yilou Tungus, and the Xianbei Yan |author=Hong, Wontack |pages=1–7 |journal=East Asian History: A Korean Perspective |volume=1 |issue=12 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three fell quickly to the [[Samhan]], and the last was destroyed by Goguryeo in 313.

The nascent precursors of [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]] expanded within the web of statelets during the [[Proto Three Kingdoms]] Period, and [[Goguryeo]] conquered neighboring state like [[Buyeo (state)|Buyeo]] in [[Manchuria]] and chiefdoms in [[Okjeo]], [[Dongye]] which occupied the northeastern Korean peninsula. The three polities made the transition from walled-town state to full-fledged state-level societies between 1st – 3rd century AD.

All three kingdoms shared a similar culture and language. Their original religions appear to have been [[shamanism|shamanistic]], but they were increasingly influenced by Chinese culture, particularly [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]. In the 4th century, [[Buddhism]] was introduced to the peninsula and spread rapidly, briefly becoming the official religion of all three kingdoms.

==Goguryeo==

[[Goguryeo]] emerged on the north and south banks of the [[Yalu River|Yalu (Amrok)]] River, in the wake of [[Gojoseon]]'s fall. The first mention of Goguryeo in Chinese records dates from 75 BC in reference to a commandery established by the Chinese [[Han dynasty]], although even earlier mentions of "Guri" (구리) may be of the same state. Evidence indicates Goguryeo was the most advanced, and likely the first established, of the three kingdoms.

Goguryeo, eventually the largest of the three kingdoms, had several capitals in alternation: two capitals in the upper Yalu area, and later Nangrang (''[[Lelang]]'' in Chinese) which is now part of [[Pyongyang]]. At the beginning, the state was located on the border with [[China]]; it gradually expanded into Manchuria and destroyed the Chinese [[Lelang commandery]] in 313. The cultural influence of the Chinese continued as Buddhism was adopted as the official religion in 372.

Goguryeo controlled not only Koreans but also Chinese and Tungusic tribes in Manchuria and [[North Korea]]. After the establishment of the [[Sui Dynasty]] and later the [[Tang Dynasty]] in China, the estate continued to aggress China and Korean Silla and Baekje until conquered by allied Silla–Tang forces in 668. Most of its territory was absorbed by Tang Dynasty China and the territory of former Baekje was absorbed by Korean Silla.

==Baekje==

Baekje absorbed or conquered other Mahan chiefdoms and, at its peak in the 4th century, controlled most of the western Korean peninsula. Buddhism was introduced to Baekje in 384 from Goguryeo, which Baekje welcomed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Baekje exerted its political influence on [[Tamna]], a kingdom that ruled [[Jejudo]]. Baekje maintained a close relationship with and extracted tribute from Tamna. Baekje's religious and artistic culture influenced [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]].

Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|Geunchogo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Korea|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006199|pages=29–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto and declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Chai-Shin|title=The New History of Korean Civilization|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781462055593|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYKNdiDCGLAC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 5th century, under attack from Goguryeo, the capital of Baekje was moved south to Ungjin (present-day [[Gongju]]) and later further south to [[Sabi (Korea)|Sabi]] (present-day [[Buyeo County|Buyeo]]).

==Silla==
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], 7th century]]
{{main|Silla}}
According to Korean records, in 57 BC, Seorabeol (or Saro, later [[Silla]]) in the southeast of the peninsula unified and expanded the confederation of city-states known as [[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]]. Although ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' records that Silla was the earliest-founded of the three kingdoms, other written and archaeological records indicate that Silla was likely the last of the three to establish a centralized government.

Silla was the smallest and weakest of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Jinwung|title=A History of Korea: From "Land of the Morning Calm" to States in Conflict|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253000248|pages=44–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2EVi-MpnUsC&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Korea: Outline of a Civilisation|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004300057|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renamed from Saro to Silla in 503, the kingdom annexed the [[Gaya confederacy]] (which in turn had absorbed [[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] earlier) in the first half of the 6th century. Goguryeo and Baekje responded by forming an alliance. To cope with invasions from Goguryeo and Baekje, Silla deepened its relations with the Tang Dynasty, with her newly gained access to the Yellow Sea making direct contact with the Tang possible. After the conquest of Goguryeo and Baekje with her Tang allies, the Silla kingdom drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula and occupied the lands south of Pyongyang.

The capital of Silla was Seorabeol (now [[Gyeongju]]; "Seorabeol", "서라벌", is hypothesized to have been the ancient Korean term for "capital"). [[Buddhism]] became the official religion in 528. The remaining material culture from the kingdom of Silla including unique gold metalwork shows influence from the northern nomadic steppes, differentiating it from the culture of Goguryeo and Baekje where Chinese influence was more pronounced.

==Other states==
Other smaller states or regions existed in Korea before and during this period:
*[[Gaya confederacy]], until annexed by Silla
*[[Dongye]], [[Okjeo]], and [[Buyeo (state)|Buyeo]], all three conquered by Goguryeo
*[[Usan-guk|Usan]] ([[Ulleung-do]]) tributary of Silla
*[[Tamna]] ([[Jeju-do]]) tributary of Baekje
[[File:Korea-Gaya Warrior.jpg|thumb|right|A Gaya soldier.]]

==Fate==
Allied with [[China]] under the [[Tang dynasty]], Silla conquered Goguryeo in 668, after having already conquered Gaya in 562 and Baekje in 660, thus ushering in the North-South states period with [[Unified Silla|Later Silla]] to the south and [[Balhae]] to the north, when [[Dae Jo-young]], a former Goguryeo military officer, revolted against Tang Chinese rule and began reconquering former Goguryeo territories.

==Archaeological perspectives==
[[File:Pressapochista15.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An unusual drinking vessel excavated from a Gaya mounded burial.]] 
Archaeologists use [[Archaeological theory|theoretical]] guidelines derived from [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], analogy, and [[ethnohistory]] to the concept of what defines a [[Sociocultural evolution|state-level society]]. This is different from the concept of state (''guk'' or [[Chinese language|Sino]] ko: 國, walled-town state, etc.) in the discipline of Korean History. In anthropological [[archaeology]] the presence of urban centres (especially capitals), monumental architecture, craft specialization and standardization of production, ostentatious burials, [[Writing system|writing or recording systems]], [[bureaucracy]], demonstrated political control of geographical areas that are usually larger in area than a single river valley, etc. make up some of these correlates that define states.&lt;ref name=Rhee&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rhee, S.N.  |author2=Choi, M.L. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Emergence of complex society in Korea|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=6|pages=51–95|doi=10.1007/BF00997585|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the archaeology sites dating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, hundreds of cemeteries with thousands of [[burial]]s have been excavated. The vast majority of archaeological evidence of the Three Kingdoms Period of Korea consists of burials, but since the 1990s there has been a great increase in the archaeological excavations of ancient industrial production sites, roads, palace grounds and [[elite]] precincts, ceremonial sites, commoner households, and fortresses due to the boom in [[salvage archaeology]] in South Korea.

The correlates of state-level societies did not develop as a package, but rather in spurts and starts and at various points in time. It was some time between 100–400 AD that individual correlates of state societies had developed to a sufficient number and scale that state-level societies can be confidently identified using archaeological data.

===Burials===

Lee Sung-joo analyzed variability in many of the [[elite]] cemeteries of the territories of Silla and Gaya polities and found that as late as the 2nd century there was intra-cemetery variation in the distribution of prestige [[grave goods]], but there was an absence of hierarchical differences on a regional scale between cemeteries. Near the end of the 2nd century AD, interior space in elite burials increased in size, and wooden chamber burial construction techniques were increasingly used by elites. In the 3rd century, a pattern developed in which single elite cemeteries that were the highest in status compared to all the other cemeteries were built. Such cemeteries were established at high elevations along ridgelines and on hilltops. Furthermore, the uppermost elite were buried in large-scale tombs established at the highest point of a given cemetery.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Cemeteries with 'uppermost elite' mounded burials such as Okseong-ri, Yangdong-ri, Daeseong-dong, and Bokcheon-dong display this pattern.
[[File:Korea-Goguryeo-Roof.tiles-01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Roof tiles excavated from Goguryeo archaeological sites in the Han River valley, from [[National Museum of Korea]].]]

===Factory-scale production of pottery and roof-tiles===

Lee Sung-joo proposed that, in addition to the development of regional political hierarchies as seen through analysis of burials, variation in types of pottery production gradually disappeared and full-time specialization was the only recognizable kind of pottery production from the end of the 4th century A.D. At the same time the production centers for pottery became highly centralized and vessels became [[standardized]].&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

[[Centralisation]] and elite control of production is demonstrated by the results of the archaeological excavations at Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ni in [[Gyeongju]]. These sites are part of what was an interconnected and sprawling ancient industrial complex on the northeast outskirts of the Silla capital. Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ri are an example of the large-scale of specialized [[factory]]-style production in the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla Periods. The site was excavated in the late 1990s, and archaeologists found the remains of many production features such as [[pottery]] [[kiln]]s, roof-tile kilns, [[charcoal]] kilns, as well as the remains of buildings and [[workshop]]s associated with production.

===Capital cities, elite precincts, and monumental architecture===

Since the establishment of Goguryeo, its early history is well attested archaeologically: The first and second [[Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom|capital cities]], [[Wunü Mountain|Jolbon]] and [[Gungnae Fortress|Gungnae]] city, located in and around today's [[Ji'an, Jilin]]. In 2004, the site was designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. Since 1976, continuing archaeological excavations concentrated in the southeastern part of modern [[Gyeongju]] have revealed parts of the so-called ''Silla Wanggyeong'' (Silla royal capital). A number of excavations over the years have revealed [[Buddhist temple|temples]] such as [[Hwangnyongsa]], Bunhwangsa, Heungryunsa, and 30 other sites. Signs of Baekje's capitals have also been excavated at the Mongchon Fortress and the [[Pungnap Toseong|Pungnap Fortress]] in [[Seoul]].

'''Tivaevae''' or '''tivaivai''' ({{lang-rar|tīvaevae}}) in the [[Cook Islands]], '''tifaifai''' in [[French Polynesia]], is a form of artistic [[quilting]] traditionally done by [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] women. The word literally means "patches",&lt;ref name="Giuffre2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Anne Giuffre|title=Collective Creativity: Art and Society in the South Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zObDf1mQj20C&amp;pg=PA30|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-9168-2|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the pieces of material sewn together. The tivaevae are either made by one woman or can be created in groups of women called ''vainetini''. The ''vainetini'' use this time together to bond, sing and catch up on village news.&lt;ref name="Giuffre2009" /&gt;

==Traditional uses==
Tivaevae are often given on very special occasions either to important visitors, as birthday and wedding gifts or used to cover the body of a loved one who has died. They are often displayed during important events like the traditional boys' [[First haircut#Polynesian boys|hair-cutting ceremonies]], birthdays and weddings.&lt;ref name="Herle2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita Herle|title=Pacific Art: Persistence, Change, and Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgXLIe1lojkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA142|date=January 2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2556-0|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By custom, a tivaevae is not measured by monetary value nor production cost. Its value is said to be reflected by the love and patience that the creator(s) have put into making a stunning work of art. Cook Islands women often described their tivaevae as being "something from the heart".&lt;ref name="Boundless2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Boundless|title=Art History, Volume II: 1400-present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra7pAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418|date=23 August 2013|publisher=Boundless|isbn=978-1-940464-26-8|pages=418–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tivaevae are rarely seen for sale on the islands. The Atiu Fibre Arts Studio on [[Atiu]] is the only place in the Cook Islands where they are commercially produced and available for purchase.&lt;ref name="Hunt2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Errol Hunt|title=Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5akbBi6sso8C&amp;pg=PA49|year=2003|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-083-9|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The tivaevae's origins are uncertain. Rongokea (1992) believes it to be an imported art form, and cites two sets of Christian missionaries in the 19th century as possible origins. While it is known that these female missionaries taught the indigenous women how to sew, it is not certain that they taught them the craft of quilting or making bed coverlets. The [[appliqué]] style of tivaevae quilting appears to have been influence by Pennsylvanian German [[scherenschnitte]] or Victorian folded paper-cutting traditions.&lt;ref name="LalFortune2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brij V. Lal|author2=Kate Fortune|title=The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pPpJl8E5wC&amp;pg=PA551|date=January 2000|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2265-1|pages=551–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple origins and influences thus seem likely.

As an art form, tivaevae replaced [[barkcloth]] production in [[Tahiti]] and the Cook Islands by the late 19th century: the function and nature of barkcloth production was transferred to tivaevae.&lt;ref name="Stevenson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Stevenson|title=The Frangipani is Dead: Contemporary Pacific Art in New Zealand, 1985-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUGQiQekULcC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2008|publisher=Huia Publishers|isbn=978-1-86969-325-1|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4704">'''Transatlanticism''' is an aspect of the relationship of British and American culture explored by some writers in [[American literature]] and [[British literature]]. Although the academic discipline of [[transatlantic studies]] is a critical framework originating the 2000s, it has been argued that transatlanticism itself is in itself a very old phenomenon, and that transatlanticism shows the tension in nineteenth-century America between emphasizing the British dimensions of American culture and asserting the independence of American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Straub ''Handbook of Transatlantic North American Studies''  2016  3110376733 p59 "Yet Paul Giles contends, “Transatlanticism [...] is in itself a very old phenomenon,” highlighting the tension in nineteenth-century America between “emphasiz[ing] British dimensions of American culture” and asserting an independent American one (2013, 15). This “old phenomenon” has also seeped into the modern consciousness: American indie band Death Cab for Cutie's 2003 album Transatlanticism and song by the same name about the difficulties of long-distance love function ...&lt;/ref&gt; Within this area of literary studies is depiction of "white America's status as both colonial subject and colonial power".&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Camden ''Secondary Heroines in Nineteenth-Century British and American Novels'' 1409475743  2013 "Alternatively, transatlanticism is comparative and reflective, according to Paul Giles and Susan Manning; or a one-way transmission of cultural imperialism, as we see in Robert Weisbuch. Central to these understandings of "the transatlantic" is white America's status as both colonial subject and colonial power. "&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of translatlanticism among authors include 19th Century American writers such as [[Hannah Crafts]] who treats both American and British variants of the injustice of slavery in ''[[The Bondwoman's Narrative]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget M. Marshall  ''The Transatlantic Gothic Novel and the Law, 1790–1860 '' 1409476324  - 2013 p.151  "... "is not confined to any one place, or country, or condition" (200). While Crafts's novel clearly indicts American slavery, it is also a more general condemnation of systems that the Gothic - in both its American and British versions - has repeatedly critiqued. Crafts's novel, like the Gothic, engages in a transatlantic discourse that absorbs readers in complicated questions about the foundations of human justice. The importance of transatlanticism is nowhere more apparent than in the study of the slave trade and the legal..."&lt;/ref&gt; As well as 20th Century authors such as [[Sylvia Plath]] for whom it has been seen as the "negotiation of American and European identities in conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Jo Gill ''The Cambridge Introduction to Sylvia Plath'' 1139474138 - 2008 p.127 "Like Nelson and Curry, Brain offers a reading of 'Cut' which attends to its historical and ideological significations, specifically as they expose Plath's negotiation of American and European identities in conflict.54 For Giles, Plath's transatlanticism is best read within the specific context of the 1950s. In these terms, transatlantic exile is an existential and an aesthetic strategy. Giles traces the ways in which national identities are mutually constitutive and mutually sustaining and, in Plath's ...&lt;/ref&gt; as well as cross-national poets such as [[T.S. Eliot]]&lt;ref&gt;Jahan Ramazani ''A Transnational Poetics''- p. ix 0226703371  2015  But Eliot, whose transatlanticism is hardly a surprise, and a variety of other poets, whose cross-nationality is less frequently considered, brought this sensible institutional practice into collision with the transnationalism of modern and contemporary poetry in English. Should Eliot and his writing be tagged “American” since he grew up in the United States and wrote “Prufrock” and “Preludes” there? Or “Brit. (Am.-born) poet and critic,” as Webster's puts it, s...\3&lt;/ref&gt;

Transatlanticism in literature and culture should be distinguished from transatlanticism in international relations and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Buonanno, Natalia Cuglesan, Keith Henderson ''The New and Changing Transatlanticism: Politics and Policy Perspectives'' 113626647X 2015 "Fora and Agreements - What is sometimes referred to as “The New Transatlanticism” is legally based on post-Cold War agreements, in particular the TAD (1990), the NTA (1994), and subsequent overarching agreements focusing on the economic partnership, particularly the now defunct [[Transatlantic Economic Partnership]] (TEP; 1998), and the [[Transatlantic Economic Council|TEC]] (2007)."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newsletter published on July 25, 2015, creator Christy Hui announced that ''Chronicles'' will not continue with a second season and will be a standalone series. However, she stated that there will be a new ''Xiaolin'' project that will continue in a format to that of ''Showdown''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=72e5e554031c8b4144d6b495d&amp;id=7e7ae4a762 |title=Xiaolin Newsflash |quote=XC will be a standalone 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Produced in France and the United States with [[Christy Hui]] returning as executive producer, the show is animated in 2D animation while CGI was used for all of the Xiaolin Showdown scenes. The show features new character designs and a slightly altered logo for the show. With the exception of [[Tara Strong]] (Omi, Ping Pong) and [[Jennifer Hale]] (Kimiko in ''Chronicles'' only, Katnappe, Willow), all of the original English voice cast was replaced due to the show moving to Canadian actors. All Shen Gong Wu from the original series had to be renamed because [[Warner Bros.]] still owns the titles and rights to the names.

==Plot==
Omi, Kimiko, and Clay have recently risen to the rank of Shoku Warrior except for Raimundo (who attained the rank previously), where they must continue to uphold their duty of finding and collecting all of the mystical Shen Gong Wu artifacts before the evil Heylin forces do. They are joined by a recruit from Europe named Ping Pong, who competes with a mysterious girl named Willow for the position of Xiaolin Apprentice. Through the events of the show's pilot, the monks learn that Willow is evil, and is the apprentice to the formidable Heylin warrior Chase Young. She and Chase destroy the temple and take all the Shen Gong Wu. With their temple destroyed, the monks must search for a new temple, while still trying to collect all the Shen Gong Wu and protecting the world from the likes of Chase Young and the villainous Jack Spicer.

==Characters==
{{main article|List of Xiaolin Showdown characters}}
* '''Omi''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) - The Xiaolin Dragon of Water, his elemental Shen Gong Wu is the Orb of Torpedo. His main attack, "Shoku Neptune Water", allows him to control and manipulate water. He is the most skilled of the Xiaolin monks. He has a very big ego and tends to think himself better than everyone else. This sometimes makes him brag and put others down, and when someone does something better than him, he usually becomes jealous and tries to outdo that person. Due to his sheltered upbringing, he is somewhat sexist, and he has a penchant for misinterpreting modern slang and idioms.
* '''Raimundo Pedrosa''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) - The Xiaolin Dragon of Wind hailing from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, his elemental Shen Gong Wu is the Sword Of Lucida. His main attack, "Shoku Astro Wind", allows him to fly and to literally blow his enemies away. Raimundo is lazy, impulsive, and prone to making rash decisions; however, he is an excellent strategist and cares deeply for those he considers friends.
* '''Kimiko Tohomiko''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) - The Xiaolin Dragon of Fire from Tokyo, Japan, her elemental Shen Gong Wu is the Kanabi Star. Her main attack, "Shoku Mars Fire", allows her to conjure up great blazing fireballs. Known to be short-tempered &amp; stubborn, Kimiko hates being made to feel incompetent or insignificant. Despite this, she is quite compassionate and affectionate toward her friends. Kimiko's interests include technology and fashion.
* '''Clay Bailey''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) - The Xiaolin Dragon of Earth from Texas in the United States, his elemental Shen Gong Wu is the Fist of the Iron Bear. His main attack, "Shoku Jupiter Earth", allows him to create fissures or shatter boulders. He is shown to be gentle despite his big size and can often come up with simple solutions to complicated problems.
* '''Ping Pong''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) - The 5th monk chosen at the Xiaolin Temple as Xiaolin Dragon of the Wood, Ping Pong is the first new character introduced in this series. Ping Pong resembles Omi, but younger &amp; wearing big green glasses. His birth name is "Boris Antonio Rolf Jean-Pierre Gaulle LeGrand IV". Due to his long name, Omi decides to call him "Ping Pong". As his protégé, Omi refers to Ping Pong as his "little gecko". In his backstory, Ping Pong grew up in Europe as a speedy errand boy delivering messages to monasteries throughout Europe. He was soon inspired by hearing legends of the Xiaolin monks and decides to join them on their adventures. His main abilities are his running speed and fast moves.
* '''Dojo Kanojo Cho''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]) - A size-shifting [[Chinese dragon]], Dojo serves as the Xiaolin Warriors' main mode of transportation and wisecracking advisor. He often shows affection for Master Fung.
* '''Master Fung''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]) - A wise old master, trainer, and guide to the Xiaolin Warriors, he provides the Xiaolin Warriors advice that can help them solve their problems.
* '''Chase Young''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) - The main antagonist, Chase is an immortal evil warrior who renews his desire to destroy the Xiaolin Monks and plots to create a Heylin Empire. He created Shadow and shares a connection with her.
* '''Shadow''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) - Shadow, the second new character introduced in XC, is a dark spy who works for Chase Young and often thinks Jack and Chase are too incompetent to be evil. She can hide in the shadows and communicate telepathically with Chase Young. When the Xiaolin monks first met her, she was revealed as a normal girl named Willow. She and Ping Pong competed for the Xiaolin Apprentice top spot, as well as for Omi's attention. Kimiko began to grow more suspicious of her and eventually discovered her secret identity as Shadow.
* '''Wuya''' (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]) - The once most powerful and evil Heylin Witch, she was defeated by Grand Master Dashi in the first Xiaolin Showdown and imprisoned in a spring contained within a puzzle box. Released 1,500&amp;nbsp;years later by Jack Spicer, Wuya needs him to collect Dashi's Shen Gong Wu to rule the world once again and plunge the world into 10,000&amp;nbsp;years of darkness. She frequently berates and mocks Jack. She returns to her human self thanks to Shadow.
* '''Jack Spicer''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) - Self-proclaiming as an "Evil Boy Genius" and aspiring to rule the world, Jack is largely incompetent and a bit of a bumbler, though he is persistent and never loses sight of his goals. He often refers to himself as an "evil entrepreneur." Sometimes allies himself with the Xiaolin Monks, but tries hard to impress Chase Young.
* '''Katnappe''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) - A cat-themed criminal and one of Jack Spicer's allies.
* '''Tubbimura''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) - An overweight but agile ninja and one of Jack Spicer's allies.
* '''Cyclops''' - A one-eyed giant and one of Jack Spicer's allies.
* '''Tiny Sim/Weaselnator''' (voice by [[Tara Strong]]) - A young aspiring villain who idolized Jack, seeking to apprentice under the evil genius. However, once he acquired the Rooster Booster Shen Gong Wu, he betrayed Jack and dissolved their partnership. Before meeting Jack, Tiny Sim was the president and webmaster for the Online Jack Fanclub.
* '''Pandabubba''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) - A panda-themed crime lord.
* '''Salvador Cumo''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) - A charming but conniving criminal that can transform into a [[Komodo dragon]] and regenerate lost limbs. He was once allies with Wuya and seems to have some sort of mysterious connection to Chase Young.
* '''Warden''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) - A demented Game Show Host summoned by Chase Young to keep the Xiaolin Monks from obtaining The Mask of The Green Monkey.

The '''Yipao''' or [[Jeep]] [[parade]] is [[folkloric]] celebration in the [[Colombia]]n department of [[Quindío Department|Quindío]], specially during the anniversary parties of the departmental capital [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]].

==Jeep-Willys history in Colombia==
The first Jeeps (M38 or CJ-2A models) arrived to [[Colombia]] in 1946 for military purposes. They were imported by the [[Ministry of National Defense (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Defense]] and soon became very popular among [[Colombian coffee]] farmers who saw in this vehicle the needed qualities for the difficult roads in the mountainous region of the country. Besides the transportation of coffee, Jeeps are used to transport many other agricultural products, as well as country workers to places previously accessible only to [[pack animal]]s. Due to this quality, the Jeeps are also known locally in {{lang-es|"mulitas mecánicas" }}(or mechanical [[mule]]s).

==Jeeps and culture==
Many families in the [[Paisa region]] and [[Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis]] own Jeep vehicles, which have become a beloved symbol of the [[coffee culture]]. Often the Jeeps have many ornaments, [[icon]]s, and flashy accessories, in a [[kitsch]] style.

==The parade==
[[Image:Jipao agricola by Natalia Rivera.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep loaded with plantains]]
The Yipao parade is celebrated during anniversary parties both in [[Armenia, Quindío]] and [[Calarcá, Quindío]]. The first edition of the parade was organized by Mrs Joan Jaramillo, headmistress of protocol of the Quindio Governor's office in 1988.  The event has several categories separated according to the products carried in the vehicles:
* Agricultural products
* Coffee
* Furniture
* People
* Institutional advertisement
The vehicles are driven by the main streets of the city and the Jeeps with the largest amount of objects carried and the most harmonious arrangements earn prizes.

In February 2006, a [[Guinness World Records]] was established for the "Longest Jeep Parade" in Calarca, with a caravan of over 370 Jeep Willys vehicles.

The '''Äynu''' (also '''Ainu''', '''Abdal''', and '''Aini''') are an ethnic group native to the [[Xinjiang]] region of western [[China]]. There are estimated to be around 30,000 Äynu people, mostly located on the fringe of the [[Taklamakan Desert]].&lt;ref name="Johanson"&gt;{{cite paper

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The origins of the Äynu people are disputed. Some historians theorize that the ancestors of the Äynu were an Iranian-related nomadic people who came from [[Iran|Persia]] several hundred years ago or more,&lt;ref name="Safran"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others conclude that the [[Persian language|Persian]] vocabulary of the [[Äynu language]] is a result of Iranian languages being once the major trade languages of the region, or Persian traders intermarrying with local women.&lt;ref name="MixedLanguage"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
{{main|Äynu language}}
The Äynu people's native language is [[Äynu language|Äynu]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] with a strong influence from [[Iranian languages|Persian]].&lt;ref name="Johanson" /&gt; [[Äynu language|Äynu]] is usually only spoken at home, while [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] is spoken in public, by Äynu men and women alike.

== Culture ==
The Äynu people engage mostly in agriculture, although in the past some were peddlers, circumcisers, or beggars.&lt;ref name="Johanson" /&gt;

There is a tradition of discrimination against the Äynu by their neighbors, who identify the Äynu as ''Abdal'', a name which carries a derogatory meaning.&lt;ref name="Johanson" /&gt; Intermarriage with their neighbors the [[Uyghur people]] is uncommon.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Chinese government counts the Äynu people as Uyghur.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

The predominant religion of Äynu people is [[Sunni Islam]]. Äynu people experience discrimination by their Uyghur neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/10522/CH|title=Ainu in China|website=[[Joshua Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
