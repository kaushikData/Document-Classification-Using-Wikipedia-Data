{{Politics of Niger}}
The '''2009–2010 Nigerien constitutional crisis''' occurred in [[Niger]] due to a political conflict between [[President of Niger|President]] [[Mamadou Tandja]] and judicial and legislative bodies regarding the [[Nigerien constitutional referendum, 2009|Constitutional referendum]] that opponents claimed was an attempt to extend his mandate beyond the constitutional maximum. It was held on 4 August 2009 before a [[Nigerien parliamentary election, 2009|parliamentary election]] which was mandated to take place by 26 August 2009. The crisis eventually led to a [[2010 Nigerien coup d'état|coup d'état]] by [[Niger Armed Forces|military]] leaders who overthrew President Tandja and formed a [[Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy|ruling junta]].&lt;ref name="BBC-100218"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8522227.stm|title=Niger leader Mamadou Tandja 'held by soldiers'|date=18 February 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Tandja dissolved the [[National Assembly of Niger]] on 26 May 2009 due to strong opposition from the National Assembly, civil society groups, and the courts regarding his referendum proposal. The Constitutional Court of Niger ruled on 12 June 2009 on a case brought by opposition deputies from the National Assembly that the proposed referendum was unconstitutional, and on 21 June 2009 the President announced he would not seek the 20 August vote.  He left open the possibility he would propose future constitutional changes before the end of his mandate.&lt;ref name=afp12june&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrZHo87RYAGEnjHhUE-atnM4jZDQ "Niger's top court rejects referendum on new constitution"], AFP, 12 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rfi21june&gt;[http://www.tamtaminfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1625:le-president-tandja-renonce-a-son-projet-de-referendum&amp;catid=44:politique&amp;Itemid=61 Le président Tandja renonce à son projet de référendum]. Radio France International. 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 2009 the President then dissolved the courts and announced he was assuming emergency powers.

His ministers then announced the 4 August referendum would go forward, despite previous refusals of courts, political parties, and the independent electoral commission to carry out the election.&lt;ref name="uk.reuters.com"&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLS45794220090628?sp=true Niger to hold referendum despite court ruling].  Reuters. 28 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for presidential term extension==
The proposal for a referendum was first floated in May 2009.  Beginning in late 2008, several supporters of President Tandja began a campaign to extend his term of office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/DEPAPA83412/-gouvernance-Le-President-Tandja-reste-muet-sur-les-appels-en-faveur-d?une-prolongation-de-son-mandat.html Le Président Tandja reste muet sur les appels en faveur d’une prolongation de son mandat].  APA 19 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposition from political opponents was swift, with dueling marches in Niamey in December 2008.  Supporters of Tandja to the slogan of his 2004 re-election campaign, "''Tazarché''", which means "Continuation" or "Continuity" in [[Hausa language|Hausa]]: supporters were quickly dubbed "''Tazarchistes''" and opponents "''Anti-Tazarchistes''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/DEPAPA83566/edition_digitale.php Des Nigériens manifestent pour la mise en place d’une transition politique de trois ans dans leur pays].

AFP 21 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations were held throughout Niger, while political committees were created, headed by supporters of Tandja outside government.  The Tazarche committee was headed by Niamey politicians [[Boubacar Mazou]] and [[Anassara Dogari]],&lt;ref name="republicain-niger.com"&gt;[http://www.republicain-niger.com/index.asp?affiche=News_Display.asp&amp;articleid=5404 ANNONCE DU RÉFÉRENDUM Le planning du Tazartché] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715174815/http://www.republicain-niger.com/index.asp?affiche=News_Display.asp&amp;articleid=5404 |date=15 July 2011 }}.

Mayaki Soumaila Seydou, [[Le Sahel]]. 11 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In January the Prime Minister asserted that all elections would go on as scheduled, including the Presidential election, which by law must take place before 22 December 2009, the five-year anniversary of Tandja's second five-year election as President. The 1999 constitution made the serving of more than two terms impossible (article 36), and the revision of that article illegal by any means (article 136). [[Prime Minister of Niger|Prime Minister]] [[Seyni Oumarou]] reiterated on 22 January that all scheduled elections would go ahead before the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&amp;sid=aOI6DPL_PJZc&amp;refer=africa Niger Plans Election by December, Prime Minister Says]. Abdoulaye Ibbo Daddy, [[Bloomberg news]].  22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, during his meetings with [[Nicolas Sarkozy|French President Sarkozy]], Tandja explicitly stated that he would not seek a third term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congoplus.info/fr/international/afrique-de-louest/628-niger--l-je-suis-pret-a-partir-a-la-fin-de-mon-mandat-r-affirme-le-president-nigerien  Niger : « Je suis prêt à partir à la fin de mon mandat », affirme le Président nigérien]. APA 28 Mars 2009 11:34
&lt;br /&gt;
« je ne cherche pas un autre mandat. Donc je suis très clair là-dessus, je n’ai demandé à aucun nigérien si on peut faire ceci ou cela. Jamais, et je n’ai jamais demandé quoi que ce soit pour changer la constitution nigérienne ou à y chercher des modifications »&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in early May 2009, when questioned by the press on his visit to [[Agadez]] to begin peace talks with Tuareg rebels, Tandja announced that "the people have demanded I remain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamtaminfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1319:le-president-de-la-republique-mamadou-tandja-lle-peuple-demande-que-je-reste-je-ne-peux-pas-rester-insensible-a-son-appelr-&amp;catid=44:politique&amp;Itemid=61 Le président de la République Mamadou Tandja: «Le peuple demande que je reste, je ne peux pas rester insensible à son appel.»]. LE TEMOIN 04 - 8 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter it was announced he would seek a referendum to scrap the current constitution and create the Sixth Republic of Niger.

A series of protests followed, led by opposition party [[PNDS-Tarayya]], but crucially containing a number of parties which had previously supported the government.  These included the CDS, a party which enabled the ruling MNDS to form a majority in the National Assembly. The CDS announcement of opposition—-the last of the major parties to weigh in on the plan—on also left the President open to National Assembly votes to sanction him, or bring down the current government.&lt;ref name="nigerdiaspora.info"&gt;[http://nigerdiaspora.info/index.php/politique/politique/le-principal-parti-alli%C3%A9-de-tandja-contre-son-projet-de-r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rendum/ Le principal parti allié de Tandja contre son projet de référendum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519131030/http://nigerdiaspora.info/index.php/politique/politique/le-principal-parti-alli%C3%A9-de-tandja-contre-son-projet-de-r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rendum/ |date=19 May 2009 }}.

The CDS continued to support the government while opposing the referendum plan&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120917190029/http://www.tv5.org/TV5Site/info/afp_article.php?idrub=6&amp;xml=newsmlmmd.2227c5aa1b620aa0aa0fbb325e51f139.ab1.xml Remaniement gouvernemental au Niger, nouveau ministre de la Justice]. AFP  15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1999 [[Constitution of Niger]], the President may call a [[referendum]] on any matter (except for a revision of those elements of the Constitution outlined in Article 136—including the presidential term limits).  The [[Constitutional Court of Niger]] and the [[National Assembly of Niger]] must advise the president, but there is no provision that the president must heed their advice.  On 25 May 2009, the Constitutional Court, made up of appointed judges, released a ruling that any referendum to create a new constitution would be [[unconstitutional]], and further would be a violation of the oath the president had taken on the [[Koran]] (a serious matter in Niger, which is overwhelmingly Muslim).&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/nigerNews/idAFLQ4311320090526?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=nigerNews Niger court says third-term referendum unlawful].

On 13 May, the ANDP-Zaman Lahiya, led by [[Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye]], declared its opposition to any change in the constitution.  On 15 May the [[CDS-Rahama]], the party without which the MNSD could not have formed governments in 1999, 2004, and 2007, came out opposing the referendum, and calling the constitution unalterable.&lt;ref name="nigerdiaspora.info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tamtaminfo.com"/&gt;  Neither party moved into the opposition, and both Ousmane and Djermokoye said they were willing to negotiate with the president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamtaminfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1365:-ousmane-et-djermokoye-esperent-toujours-louverture-des-negociations-avec-tandja&amp;catid=44:politique&amp;Itemid=61 Ousmane et Djermokoye espèrent toujours l’ouverture des négociations avec Tandja ]. LE TEMOIN du 11 au 15 mai 200&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May, within hours of the Constitutional Court's statement, official media read out a statement that President Tandja had dissolved the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE54P0EL20090526?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews Niger's Tandja dissolves parliament].

==Referendum plan==
{{Main|Nigerien constitutional referendum, 2009}}
The full details of the referendum proposal were not finalized, but elements of the proposed constitution were outlined by government spokesmen and by a commission set up by the president to draft a proposed document. Tandja would extend his term for a transitional mandate of three years, during which a new constitution would be written and approved.  The system of government would be changed from a [[semi-presidential system]] to a full [[presidential system]], which Tandja claims is more stable.  There would be no limit to presidential terms, and a bi-cameral legislature would be created with an upper house, the Senate.&lt;ref name="republicain-niger.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="News_Display 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idINLV16692820090601?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 | work=Reuters | title=SCENARIOS-Niger's president seeks to change constitution | date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hO_HhpJDK6w73SExPHul518BLFAA AFP: Niger to vote August 4 on extension of presidential mandate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June, the President and the [[Council of Ministers of Niger]] approved plans for the referendum, titled ''Referendum on the Project of the VIth Republic''.  Campaigning would take place from 13 July 2009 to 2 August 2009.  The President established a commission to create a draft constitutional law upon which the population would vote.

==Protests==
Large opposition rallies were held in May and June, attended by a broad coalition of political parties, civil society groups and trades unions. These included Former Prime Ministers [[Hama Amadou]] and [[Mahamadou Issoufou]], former President and current President of the Assembly [[Mahamane Ousmane]], and former President of the Assembly and party leader, [[Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamtaminfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1337:premiere-journee-anti-tazartche-jatniamey-le-09-mai-2009&amp;catid=44:politique&amp;Itemid=61 PREMIERE JOURNEE ANTI- TAZARTCHE (JAT)...NIAMEY LE 09 MAI 2009.] CEN-PNDS.TARAYYA. 10 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://issikta.blogspot.com/2009/05/niger-grande-manifestation-niamey.html Niger: grande manifestation à Niamey contre une nouvelle constitution].

==Legal block==
On 12 June 2009, the Constitutional Court ruled against Tandja's referendum proposal, following a non-binding advisement to the President the month before.  This time the ruling was in response to a case brought by a coalition of opposition groups, which included the CDS, a governing partner in the previous government, without which the MNSD could not gain a majority in the Assembly.  In such cases, the Constitution specifies that rulings of the Constitutional Court are binding and may not be appealed.&lt;ref name=afp12june /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8101732.stm BBC]. 12 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, the [[Independent National Electoral Commission (Niger)|Independent National Electoral Commission]] announced that National Assembly elections would take place on 20 August, and no referendum would be voted upon.

On 19 June President Tandja called [[Council of the Republic (Niger)|Council of the Republic]], a consultative body of all major government leaders.  This was the first time this body was called.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5igi6odh_A7miho7IecShawl8DWtg "Niger elections set for Aug 20: poll commission"], AFP, 19 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June President Tandja released a statement saying he would honor the Court and Electoral Commission rulings, and would suspend any effort to change the constitution until after the National Assembly elections on 20 August.&lt;ref name=rfi21june /&gt;

Despite the 21 June statement by the President, on the evening of 24 June, Minister of Communications Ben Omar released a statement by the President, demanding the Constitutional Court to rescind its decision, citing a 2002 statement by the same body that the President was able to call referenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/nigerNews/idAFLP72856120090625?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=nigerNews Le président du Niger maintient son projet de référendum].

This group appears in direct competition with the larger opposition front, the FDD (''Front de défense de la démocratie''), which is led by the PNDS and staged the two recent anti-referendum marches in Niamey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/114/article_82159.asp L'opposition à Tandja se renforce].

On the same day, the [[Democratic Confederation of Workers of Niger]] (CDTN) trade union confederation led a 24-hour general strike across the nation to protest the President's referendum plans, after a previous strike had been indefinitely postponed on 18 June. All seven trade union confederations took part, in the first general strike since the creation of the Fifth Republic in 1999. The organizers provided skeleton staffs of union workers for hospitals, water and electric utilities, and airports.

==Presidential emergency powers==
In a televised and radio speech to the nation on the following evening (26 June, after [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]]), President Tandja announced he was dissolving the government and would rule by decree.&lt;ref name=Reutersjune26&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSLQ2439220090626  Niger president rules by decree after court snub].

On 29 June, Tandja again appeared on state media defending the state of emergency.

[[File:Sanford Health ambush marketing at Target Field.jpg|thumb|right|A billboard [[#Minneapolis sports venues|placed on]] the exterior of a [[Target Center|venue]] adjacent to [[Target Field]], so that it is visible from within to compete with a sponsorship held by a competitor.]]

'''Ambush marketing''' or '''ambush advertising''' is a [[marketing]] strategy in which an advertiser "[[wikt:ambush|ambushes]]" an event to compete for exposure against other advertisers.

The term "ambush marketing" was coined by marketing strategist Jerry Welsh, while he was working as the manager of global marketing efforts for [[American Express]] in the 1980s. Most ambush marketing campaigns capitalize on the prominence of a major event, and aim to create an "association" with the event without being an "official" partner or sponsor of the event. An advertiser may indirectly ambush an event by alluding to its imagery and [[Theme (narrative)|themes]] without referencing any specific [[trademark]]s associated with it, or in "direct" and "predatory" means—where an advertiser engages in conduct (including the fraudulent use of official names and trademarks) that mislead consumers into believing they are officially associated with the event.

Actions against ambush advertising are most common in [[sport]] (where major events such as the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Olympic Games]], and the [[Super Bowl]] are prominent targets), as the practice can devalue and dilute exclusive sponsorship rights, and in some cases, infringe upon the organizers' [[intellectual property]] rights. Such actions may include restricting advertising in "clean zones" around an event site, removing or obscuring references to non-sponsors at venues, and requiring host countries to pass laws to grant the organizer legal rights to enforce clean zones, and to restrict the use of specific words and concepts to create unofficial associations with the event. 

Anti-ambush marketing regulations have attracted controversy for limiting [[freedom of speech]], and for preventing companies from factually promoting themselves in the context of an event.

==Intent and techniques==
Typically, ambush marketing is used to "[[Free rider problem|ride off]]" the prominence and draw of a major event, aligning promotional activities and publicity around it, without having to pay fees to the event's organizer to be designated as an "official" sponsor in a certain product category. Ambush marketing techniques can be classified into two categories: "direct" forms of ambush marketing involve advertisers promoting themselves as being a part of or associated with an event, diluting the exposure of official sponsors and their respective campaigns—especially if they are the product of the non-sponsor's competitors, while indirect forms of ambush marketing use imagery relating to an event in advertising to evoke a mental connection with it, without specifically mentioning it.&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-lining/&gt;

"Predatory" forms of direct ambush marketing involve fraudulent claims by a non-sponsor that [[passing off|pass themselves off]] as being an "official" sponsor, usually by making direct references to [[trademark]]s relating to an event, but without having any official authorization from the event's organizers to identify itself as an official sponsor or use its trademarks.&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambushed!|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204731804574391102699362862?mod=_newsreel_1|accessdate=7 October 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advertiser may attempt to perform a [[publicity stunt]] inside the venue itself to attract attention to their brand, such as having attendees wear attire that is associated with the company.&lt;ref name="guardian-2010skirt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-shorts"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed /&gt; An official sponsor can also be involved in direct ambush marketing if they perform more extensive promotional activities at an event than they were originally authorized, such as distributing branded merchandise when they were only granted advertising on signage—especially if these activities compete with those of another sponsor authorized to do so.&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed /&gt;

A company may also perform direct ambush marketing by [[Wikt:ride the coattails|riding coattails]]—factually marketing their role in connection to an event or its participants. For example, a company which produces sporting equipment may advertise that they are the official supplier for a specific athlete or team.&lt;ref name=wsj-lining/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed/&gt; Similarly, a non-sponsor may choose to solely sponsor the event's telecast by a broadcaster, but not the event itself.&lt;ref name=bbc-ambushed /&gt; The factual acknowledgment of a non-sponsor's involvement with the participants in an event by, for example, a television host or commentator, can also be considered an incidental form of coattail marketing, as it provides additional unpaid publicity to the brand.&lt;ref name=wsj-lining/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed/&gt;

Most forms of indirect ambush marketing involve a non-sponsor making use of imagery, [[Theme (narrative)|themes]], and [[values]] similar to what the event and campaigns from official sponsors express, either positively or negatively, and without making specific references to the event itself or its trademarks. In essence, the advertiser markets itself using content that evokes a mental association with the event, and as a result, appeals to those who are aware of the event.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise of the pseudo-sponsors: A history of ambush marketing|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/rise_of_the_pseudo-sponsors_a_history_of_ambush_marketing|website=SportPro|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed/&gt; Advertisers may use a well-known nickname for the event that is not a trademark, such as "the big game".&lt;ref name=thr-supertrademarks&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl, Super Trademarks: Protecting the NFL's IP|url=http://www.hollywoodreporteresq.com/thresq/ip/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003538980|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=30 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526064231/http://www.hollywoodreporteresq.com/thresq/ip/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003538980|archivedate=26 May 2007|date=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a non-sponsor may use "distractive" techniques to divert consumers' attention away from the actual event and its official sponsors using similarly indirect means; for example, a non-sponsor may saturate the area at or around its venue (including [[street vendor]]s, billboards, and [[public transport]]) with a competing marketing presence. Such "saturation marketing" may either be indirectly related to the event, or be incidental and make no references at all. In some cases, a company may sponsor or create a similar "parallel property," designed to compete directly with a major property by evoking similar thematics.&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed/&gt;

== Regulation ==
In response to the threats of ambush marketing and other forms of [[trademark infringement]], organizers of major sporting events have sometimes required host countries or cities to implement special laws that, going beyond standard [[trademark law]], provide regulations and penalties for advertisers who disseminate marketing materials that create unauthorized associations with an event by making references to specific words, concepts, and symbols.&lt;ref name=guardian-olympicbill/&gt;&lt;ref name=startrib-aclu/&gt;  Organizers may also require a city to set up "clean zones" in and around venues, in which advertising and commerce is restricted to those that are authorized by the event's organizer—specifically, the event's official sponsors.&lt;ref name=aclu-nosuperbowl&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU Sues City of New Orleans Over Super Bowl "Clean Zone" Ordinance|url=https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-sues-city-new-orleans-over-super-bowl-clean-zone-ordinance|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vice-nosuperbowl&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Zones and Cabbies: How the Super Bowl Screws New Orleans Part 2|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/clean-zones-and-cabbies-how-the-super-bowl-screws-new-orleans-part-2|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dmn-lawsuit&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl host committee settles 'ambush marketing' lawsuit|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20120906-super-bowl-host-committee-settles-ambush-marketing-lawsuit.ece|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=Dallas Morning News|date=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a venue may be required to suspend its [[naming rights]] for the duration of the event if the venue is named for a concern that is not an official sponsor, during which it is referred to under a generic name by all event-related materials and telecasts, and all signage referring to the sponsored name may be obscured or removed.&lt;ref name=louw-ambush&gt;{{cite book|last1=Louw|first1=Andre M.|title=Ambush marketing and the mega-event monopoly how laws are abused to protect commercial rights to major sporting events|date=2012|publisher=T. M. C. Asser Press|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-6704-864-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[2010 Winter Olympics]] hockey venue General Motors Place (since renamed to [[Rogers Arena]]) was renamed "Canada Hockey Place" for the duration of the Games.&lt;ref name=cbc-rogersarena&gt;{{cite web|title=GM Place renamed Rogers Arena|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gm-place-renamed-rogers-arena-1.923708|website=CBC News|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Broadcasters of events may be contractually required to give the official sponsors [[right of first refusal]] to purchase advertising time during their telecasts.&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed /&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-logotape&gt;{{cite web|title=Ignore That Logo Under the Tape!|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121885240984946511|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some events may require all advertising time to be controlled and allocated by the organizer itself, such as the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt;

=== Examples ===
The earliest example of general anti-ambush advertising legislation were passed in [[South Africa]] in 2001 in preparation for the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. The law gave the Minister of Trade and Industry the ability to designate specific events as "protected," making it illegal to use the event's trademarks visually, audibly, and "in promotional activities, which in any way, directly or indirectly, is intended to be brought into association with or to allude to an event," to "derive special promotional benefit from the event," without the consent of the organizer.&lt;ref name="louw 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Louw|first1=Andre M.|title=Ambush marketing and the mega-event monopoly how laws are abused to protect commercial rights to major sporting events|date=2012|publisher=T. M. C. Asser Press|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|isbn=906704864X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], [[New Zealand]] passed the similar "Major Events Management Act," which prohibits any promotional use of words, emblems, and concepts implying association with events specifically designated as "major" by the national government, without permission from the event's organizers. The law also provides the ability for clean zones to be established around event sites for the purposes of enforcing advertising rules and providing [[crowd control]].&lt;ref name=tvnz-threelittlewords&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning over three little words|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/warning-over-three-little-words-3694792|website=One News|publisher=TVNZ|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nzl-mema&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Events Management Act 2007|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0035/latest/DLM411987.html|website=Leglislation.govt.nz|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aucklandnow-rwcact&gt;{{cite web|title=Rugby World Cup advertising ambush expected|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/5297879/Rugby-World-Cup-advertising-ambush-expected|accessdate=30 September 2014|work=Auckland Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rule 40]] of the [[Olympic Charter]] forbids all Olympic athletes from participating in marketing activities for companies that are not official sponsors of the Olympics, even if they have official relationships with the advertiser, during a timeframe that begins 9 days before the opening ceremony, and ends 3 days after the Games' conclusion. This includes advertising material containing "Olympic-related terms," including the current year, the host city's name, "Games," "Olympians," "Sponsors," "Medal," "Gold," "Silver," "Bronze," "Challenge," "Effort," "Performance," and "Victory".&lt;ref name="bbcsport-rule40"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio Olympics 2016: Athletes could face sanctions over controversial rule 40|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36909409|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006]] prior to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]: on top of existing laws providing special protection for [[Olympic symbols]], the act banned the use of the words "2012" and "Games" by non-sponsors, either together, or with words or concepts relating to the event, such as "Gold," "Silver," "Bronze," "Medals," "Summer," "Sponsors," or "London," to imply an association with the Games. LOCOG also announced plans to enforce these rules in the internet [[keyword advertising]] market.&lt;ref name=mondaq-keyword&gt;{{cite web|title=UK: LOCOG To Police Keyword Bidding In Run Up To London 2012|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/141722/Advertising+Marketing/LOCOG+To+Police+Keyword+Bidding+In+Run+Up+To+London+2012|website=Mondaq|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-brandingpolice /&gt;

==Examples==
=== The "credit card wars" ===
The first notable instances of ambush marketing occurred between the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, and the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in Seoul.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt; Earlier Games allowed any number of companies to be official sponsors, and there were a record 628 sponsors for the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal. Despite the revenue it provided for the Games, the ability for sponsors to promote awareness of themselves within the context of the Games were diluted by the sheer number.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/marketing-the-olympics-1.2801785|title=Marketing The Olympics|work=CBC Radio|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to improve the value of these sponsorships, the [[International Olympic Committee]] implemented a system of exclusive sponsorship rights within specific market categories for the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt;

In 1986, [[credit card]] company [[American Express]]—rival to official sponsor [[Visa Inc.]], began a marketing campaign in Asia promoting merchandise from a fictitious "Olympic Heritage Committee," supposedly based in Switzerland. American Express halted the campaign following complaints by the IOC, who threatened to denounce the company's actions with ads and media events in which [[sports minister]]s and Olympic athletes from the countries involved in the campaign would cut American Express [[credit card]]s into pieces, if they did not withdraw the ads.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt; In a follow-up, American Express released ads featuring a photo from the opening ceremony of the [[1986 Asian Games]] held in the same city, captioned "Amex welcomes you to Seoul," which implied that it was a photo of the Olympics' opening ceremony.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters-creditcardwar/&gt; These campaigns resulted in retaliatory advertising from Visa.; in a continuation of an ongoing campaign promoting its exclusivity at certain venues and events, Visa ran advertising promoting that it was the only credit card accepted at Olympic venues and for purchasing tickets.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-ambushes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-28/business/fi-4230_1_american-express|title=Credit Companies Trade Charges: Visa and American Express clash over using the Olympics in their promotions.|last=Gellene|first=Denise|date=1992-03-28|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune-dontneedavisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters-creditcardwar&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Card War Erupts at Olympics: Advertising: IOC accuses American Express Co. of 'ambush marketing' in campaign aimed at rival Visa.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-19/business/fi-24757_1_american-express|accessdate=6 January 2015|agency=Reuters|date=19 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

American Express felt that Visa's advertisements were misleading, citing viewers who interpreted the ads as to believe that no other credit cards were accepted anywhere in the host city during the Olympics (such as at shops and restaurants), rather than applying only for Olympic ticket sales and at venues.&lt;ref name="lat-ambushes"/&gt; Prior to the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] and [[1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]], American Express aired advertisements acknowledging these facts, explained with the tagline "You'll need a [[passport]], but you don't need a Visa."&lt;ref name=reuters-creditcardwar/&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune-dontneedavisa&gt;{{cite web|title=Visa, American Express Play Negative-ad Card|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-30/business/9410300124_1_visa-usa-american-express-cardholders/2|accessdate=6 January 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|date=30 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1992 Summer Olympics, the company also promoted a partnership with [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] and Turespana that made American Express "the official credit card of tourism in Spain"—a campaign which factored the Olympics, as well as [[Seville Expo '92]].&lt;ref name="lat-ambushes"/&gt; The IOC negotiated a truce between Amex and Visa to tone down their advertisements, but encouraged Visa once Amex returned to its ambush marketing in 1994, and Amex finally conceded defeat by 1996.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush/&gt; Jerry Welsh, who was the manager of global marketing efforts for American Express in the 1980s, would coin the term "ambush marketing" to refer to these activities. Welsh defended Amex's practices as a corporation's duty to its shareholders after they lost out on the official Olympic sponsorship rights to Visa.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush/&gt;

=== Nike ===
In the mid 1990s, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became known for several major ambush marketing schemes at the Olympics and association football tournaments.

At the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], Nike (whose presence competed with official sponsor [[Reebok]]) set up a prominent [[pop-up store]] near the athletes' village. Consistent with its aggressively-toned marketing of the time, its campaign featured slogans parodying those of the Olympics and attacking its values, including "Faster, Higher, Stronger, Badder", and "If you're not here to win, you're a tourist". Nike was also attempting to have fans to display signs with its slogans inside venues. IOC marketing director [[Michael Payne (executive)|Michael Pane]] noted that the campaign was being widely criticized, as athletes were "likely to be uncomfortable when their shoe sponsor says they have failed unless they win a gold medal", and that Nike was "crossing the very fine line between having an impact and biting the hand that creates tomorrow's heroes."&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt; 

Payne and the [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s marketing director John Krimsky held a meeting over the campaign with Howard Slusher, a subordinate of Nike co-founder [[Phil Knight]]. The meeting quickly turned aggressive; Payne threatened IOC counter-measures, including pulling accreditation for Nike employees, banning the display of its logos on equipment, and organizing a press conference where silver medallists from the Games, as well as prominent Nike-sponsored athlete [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]], would denounce the company. Faced with these threats, Nike agreed to retract most of its negative advertising and PR stunts.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt;  Nike eventually served as the official sportswear supplier of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] on short notice after Reebok unexpectedly pulled out, and used the Games to launch its first-ever global marketing campaign.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt; 

Nike also performed saturation ambushes at [[UEFA Euro 1996]] and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], by buying advertising space in the vicinity of the host venues in order to prevent the official sponsors ([[Umbro]] and [[Adidas]] respectively) from being able to promote themselves. Nike's actions influenced the eventual adoption of "safe zone" rules, requiring official sponsors to have exclusive use of all advertising locations within a certain radius of an event's venue.&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt;

=== FIFA World Cup ===
During a game at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], fans were asked to remove "[[Leeuwenhosen]]"—pants with [[lion]] tails colored in the orange of the [[Netherlands national football team]], distributed and branded by [[Bavaria Brewery (Netherlands)|Bavaria Brewery]]—because they infringed on the exclusive beer sponsorship rights owned by [[Anheuser-Busch]]. Officials distributed orange-colored shorts to fans affected by the requirement.&lt;ref name="bbc-shorts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5104252.stm|title=Dutch fans given shorts for match|publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=21 June 2006 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bavaria Brewery was again accused of ambush marketing at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], when 36 female fans were ejected from a game (along with the arrest of two, later released, accused of violating the Contravention of Merchandise Marks Act) for wearing unbranded orange [[miniskirts]] that were provided by Bavaria; [[Sylvie van der Vaart]], wife of Dutch player [[Rafael van der Vaart]], had modeled one of the miniskirts in an advertising campaign for the brewery.&lt;ref name="guardian-2010skirt"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/16/fifa-world-cup-ambush-marketing | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=World Cup 2010: Women arrested over 'ambush marketing' freed on bail | first=Owen | last=Gibson | date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-ambushed"&gt;{{cite web | last =Kelly | first =Jon | title =How ambush marketing ambushed sport | work =BBC News Magazine | publisher =BBC | date =17 June 2010 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8743881.stm | accessdate =2010-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robbie Earle]] was also fired from his roles as [[ITV Sport]] pundit and ambassador for [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England's bid for the 2018 World Cup]], when it was claimed by FIFA that he had sold tickets meant for family and friends on to Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10322048.stm |title=Robbie Earle sacked over World Cup tickets |date=16 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, South African budget airline [[Kulula]] ran an advertisement that played upon the fact that they were not an official sponsor of the tournament: it described themselves as "Unofficial National Carrier of the You-Know-What," and contained images of stadiums, [[Ball (association football)|balls]], [[vuvuzela]]s and national flags. The ad was pulled following a complaint by FIFA, who claimed that the ads contained symbols that constituted an unauthorized association with the event when used together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8576220.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fifa orders SA airline to pull ad | date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kulula mocked FIFA's objections in subsequent advertising: a follow-up ad deliberately replaced the items from the first ad with similarly-shaped items (such as [[disco ball]]s and [[golf tee]]s), and explained that there were other reasons to travel South Africa "than just for that thing we wouldn't dare mention."&lt;ref name="time-wouldntdaremention"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stopping Ambush Marketers During the World Cup|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1978129,00.html|website=Time|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline also announced that it would give away free flights to anyone named "[[Sepp Blatter]]"; the offer was redeemed for a dog named after the then-[[FIFA president]].&lt;ref name=best-ambush&gt;{{cite web|title=Ingenious Ambush Campaigns From Nike, Samsung and BMW Make Official Sponsorships Look Like A Waste|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/best-ambush-marketing-campaigns-2012-6?op=1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Olympic Committee]] has required host cities to enact measures to restrict commerce around venues, ensure official sponsors have access to public advertising space, "reduce and sanction" ambush marketing, and keep venues "clean" of any references to non-sponsors.&lt;ref name=louw-ambush/&gt;

At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, the IOC worked with the local organizing committee to develop a "robust brand-protection program"; logos of non-sponsors were covered with [[Adhesive tape|tape]] on equipment at Games facilities—a restriction that applied even to appliances, bathroom fixtures, elevators, and fire extinguishers.&lt;ref name=wsj-logotape/&gt; However, there was a high-profile ambush during the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]; former Olympic gymnast [[Li Ning]], who founded [[Li-Ning|an eponymous Chinese shoe company]], lit the Olympic cauldron.

Prior to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, England, [[bookmaker]] [[Paddy Power]] organized an [[egg-and-spoon race]] in the French village of [[London, Burgundy]] with a €100 credit as a prize, allowing the company to jokingly market itself as being the official sponsor of "the largest athletics event in London this year".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bettingpro.com/category/industry-news/paddy-power-sponsors-egg-spoon-race-201207240050/|title=Paddy Power sponsor 2012 Olympics Egg &amp; Spoon Race|website=Bettingpro.com|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pp-ad/&gt; LOCOG threatened Paddy Power over ads for the event, but backtracked after Paddy Power threatened to take the organizing committee to court.&lt;ref name=pp-ad&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012 Olympics: Paddy Power seek a court order after Locog demand advertising posters be taken down|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9425878/London-2012-Olympics-Paddy-Power-seek-a-court-order-after-Locog-demand-advertising-posters-be-taken-down.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LOCOG U-turns over Paddy Power 'London' ads|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/News/MostRead/1142903/LOCOG-U-turns-Paddy-Power-London-ads/|publisher=Marketing Magazine|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When announcing the planned lawsuit, a Paddy Power spokesmen quipped that "It's a pity they didn't put the same energy in to the ticketing and [[Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics|security arrangements]] for the Games that they put into protecting their sponsorship revenue streams."&lt;ref name=pp-ad/&gt; Nike released a television advert tying into the Games with a similar concept, featuring footage of athletes training in [[London (disambiguation)|other places named "London"]], and the tagline "Greatness doesn't only exist in [[SW19]]".&lt;ref name=guardian-nikelondon&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012 Olympics will not take legal action over Nike ad campaign|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/27/london-olympics-legal-action-nike|accessdate=4 January 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Games, a study by the [[Global Language Monitor]] found that several non-sponsors, including [[Centrica]], [[Ericsson]], [[Philips]], and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], were among the brands with the highest perceived relationship between themselves and the Games.&lt;ref name=glm-bai2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Ambush Marketers Continue to Dominate London 2012|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/olympics/olympic-ambush-marketers-continue-to-dominate-london-2012/|website=Global Language Monitor|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, prior to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], clothing company [[The North Face]] was sued by the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] (COC) for marketing a line of "villagewear" apparel that it felt implied an unauthorized association with the Games. The apparel had designs featuring the colors and symbols of countries (such as red and white with a [[maple leaf]] for Canada) and patches reading "[[Russia|RU]] 14," were described in a catalog as "[capturing] the international spirit of the Olympic Games," and several items in the catalog contained references to [[Sochi]] in their names. The COC also felt that the name "villagewear" implied a reference to [[Olympic Village]]s, accused the company of using the [[Olympic rings]] in a store sign advertising the line, and purporting to give away tickets to the Games as part of a contest—in violation of terms and conditions restricting redistribution of tickets without permission.&lt;ref name=gandm-villagewear/&gt;&lt;ref name=tsn-northface/&gt; The North Face disputed the COC's claims, arguing that it did not imply it was an official supporter of the COC, did not use any of the official branding elements of the Games, that the COC had no right to restrict usage of national symbols that are in the [[public domain]], and that the COC did not hold rights to the "alleged Olympic trademarks" at all since they were owned by the IOC.

Prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], Rule 40 was loosened by the IOC to allow some campaigns by non-sponsors involving athletes to occur during the Games, as long as the campaign had begun within a certain timeframe prior to the Games, and do not imply an association with the Olympics. It also requires the submission of waivers to the IOC and the country's [[National Olympic Committee]] that describe the extent of the marketing involving athletes.&lt;ref name="nyt-evade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adweek-2016"/&gt; Prior to these Games, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) also issued a warning asserting that non-sponsors could not create or disseminate any content related to the Olympics on social media, including posts referencing the Games or its results, posts sourced from official accounts, or posts using official [[hashtag]]s (which the USOC has claimed as trademarks).&lt;ref name="techdirt-dearusoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear US Olympic Committee: Tweeting About The Olympics Is Never Trademark Infringement|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160722/07140335039/dear-us-olympic-committee-tweeting-about-olympics-is-never-trademark-infringement.shtml|website=Techdirt|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-usochashtags"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Olympic committee bullying unofficial sponsors who use hashtags|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/22/us-olympic-committee-bullying-unofficial-sponsors-hashtags|website=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espn-usocambush"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Olympic Committee in battle with athletes and the companies that sponsor them but not Olympics|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/17120510/united-states-olympic-committee-battle-athletes-companies-sponsor-not-olympics|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2016, the [[Australian Olympic Committee]] sued mobile provider [[Telstra]] over adverts promoting its partnership with the [[Seven Network]] to offer subscribers free premium access to its digital [[Olympics on Seven|coverage]] of the 2016 Summer Olympics, as the broadcaster's "official technology partner". The ad was set to a version of [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]]'s song "[[I Go to Rio]]"—a phrase which was also used as the tagline of the campaign. The AOC argued that the promotion was deceiving and could imply that Telstra was an official sponsor of the Australian Olympic team (Telstra was previously an official sponsor, but ended its relationship in 2015). Telstra defended the ads, stating that they were intended to promote its relationship with the official broadcaster, and that it would amend the ads to disclaim that the company is not an official sponsor of the AOC or any related entities.&lt;ref name="smh-telstradeceive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Olympic Committee sues Telstra over 'I go to Rio' ads|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/australian-olympic-committee-sues-telstra-over-i-go-to-rio-ads-20160715-gq6y8m.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=22 August 2016|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newscomau-telstrawins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Telstra wins case against the Australian Olympic Committee on its ‘I go to Rio’ campaign|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/olympics/telstra-wins-case-against-the-australian-olympic-committee-on-its-i-go-to-rio-campaign/news-story/99c8975f78cf202398229bc5d46b7ab6|website=News.com.au|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 2016, a federal court ruled in favor of Telstra, stating that there was "no doubt" the campaign was relating to the Games without using its trademarks, but that it was "not enough for the AOC to prove that the advertisements were Olympic-themed."&lt;ref name="smh-telstrawins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Telstra 'Go to Rio' campaign cleared by Federal Court, AOC case dismissed|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/telstra-go-to-rio-campaign-cleared-by-federal-court-20160729-gqgojk.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC's restrictive ambush marketing rules were one factor in the [[National Hockey League]]'s decision to ban its players from the [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympics]]; for the previous five Olympics, the NHL scheduled an extended break in the regular season to allow players to participate, and placed its [[NHL All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] on hiatus.

=== NFL ===
The [[National Football League]] has historically been protective over unauthorized uses of its intellectual property, such as the game telecasts themselves, and most notably, its trademark for the [[Super Bowl]]—the league's championship game. To protect these properties and its official sponsors, the league has historically sent reminders and [[cease and desist]] notices to advertisers and businesses—including establishments that may be showing the game—that use references to "Super Bowl," "Super Sunday," or team names in promotional activities related to the Super Bowl. Although using part of a trademark for descriptive purposes, without implying official association, can be considered a [[nominative use]] under [[United States trademark law]], non-sponsors typically use euphemisms such as "the Big Game" to refer to the Super Bowl in advertising to protect themselves from liability.&lt;ref name=thr-supertrademarks/&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-nfloveraggressive /&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-godvsgridiron&gt;{{cite web|title=God vs. Gridiron|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120190701069036633?mod=home_we_banner_left|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the NFL submitted an application to register "The Big Game" as a trademark as well, but withdrew following opposition by students of [[Stanford University]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], who play in a long-running [[college football]] [[rivalry game]] also known as "[[Big Game (American football)|the Big Game]]"—an event which pre-dates the Super Bowl by several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=FitzGerald |first=Tom |title=NFL sidelines its pursuit of Big Game trademark |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/23/SPGUAQ07LN6.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL has also partaken in clean zone policies around Super Bowl sites to protect against saturation ambush marketing.&lt;ref name=vice-nosuperbowl /&gt;

The league intended to do so again on January 14 for the AFC championship game, but on the 9th, the blimp was let loose unmanned after a failed attempt to land it at [[Oakland International Airport]], and it crashed over a waterfront restaurant on the [[Oakland Estuary]] after getting caught on a sailboat mast.

In 2009 and 2010, [[Avid Life Media]] produced advertisements for its [[extramarital]] and [[homosexual]] [[online dating service]]s [[Ashley Madison]] and [[ManCrunch]], that it aimed to have [[Super Bowl advertising|aired during]] the Super Bowl. The Ashley Madison ad featured the tagline "Who Are You Doing After the Game?," while the ManCrunch ad culminated with two male football fans kissing and [[dry humping]] each other. Both ads were rejected by the game's respective broadcasters; the Ashley Madison ad for objectionable content, and the ManCrunch ad for its unauthorized use of NFL trademarks. An Avid Life Media spokesperson, as well as the media, initially reported that the ManCrunch ad had actually been rejected because of its homosexual themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bartlett|first1=Kristen|title=How Ashley Madison ruined my reputation (on purpose) long before the hack.|url=http://happyplace.someecards.com/workplace/ashley-madison-avid-life-media-super-bowl-homophobic-ad/|accessdate=22 July 2015|publisher=[[Someecards]]|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics felt that the company was engaging in ambush marketing by intentionally submitting ads that would be rejected by broadcasters, and thus earn free publicity from the resulting "controversy" without having to pay for the ad time itself.

Prior to [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in Glendale, Arizona, the NFL filed an opposition to a trademark application for "Superb Owl", filed by the organizers of a local running event known as The Night Run. They had planned to hold a "Superb Owl Shuffle 5K" event on the morning of the game, in reference to the "Superb Owl" awards given out during The Night Run. The NFL felt that the trademark was likely to cause confusion with its Super Bowl trademarks, also noting that the event's website, superbowlshuffle.org, was confusingly similar to "[[The Super Bowl Shuffle|Super Bowl Shuffle]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale/2015/08/10/scottsdale-super-owl-race-nfl-trademark-objection/31421093/|title=Race organizers' trademark try of 'Superb Owl' runs afoul of NFL|last=|first=|date=|work=AZcentral|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The euphemism "Superb Owl" had also appeared as the result of user typos on search queries for the game, on the television series ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' as a satire of the NFL's trademark rules, and during the vandalism of commemorative statues that were put up in [[San Francisco]] during the lead-up to [[Super Bowl 50]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/02/03/superb-owl-searches-soar-big-game-approaches/jOTRY9sDC8BwfhBNT96MIK/story.html|title=‘Superb Owl’ searches soar as big game approaches - The Boston Globe|last=|first=|date=|work=Boston Globe|access-date=2017-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203171750/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/02/03/superb-owl-searches-soar-big-game-approaches/jOTRY9sDC8BwfhBNT96MIK/story.html|archive-date=2017-02-03|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minneapolis sports venues ===
In September 2010, the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] basketball team announced that they would install a large billboard sign for [[Sanford Health]] on the exterior of [[Target Center]]. The sign was placed so that it would be visible from within [[Target Field]], home stadium of the [[Minnesota Twins]] baseball team. The Twins have a competing healthcare sponsorship with the [[Mayo Clinic]]. Although it is a city-owned venue, the Timberwolves had the right to sell advertising on the exterior of the arena. Twins president [[Dave St. Peter]] stated that the size of the sign was "shocking", while the timing of the change was criticized for occurring right before the start of the [[2010 Major League Baseball season#Postseason|2010 Major League Baseball postseason]], which would bring national exposure to the venue and the sign.&lt;ref name=minnpost-timbersign&gt;{{cite web|title=Tempest brewing over huge advertising sign being erected on Target Center -- facing Target Field|url=http://www.minnpost.com/cityscape/2010/09/tempest-brewing-over-huge-advertising-sign-being-erected-target-center-facing-targ|website=[[MinnPost]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, per an extension of [[Target Corporation]]'s naming rights for the arena, the company was given control over its exterior.

The [[Minnesota Vikings]]' [[U.S. Bank Stadium]] faced a similar controversy; because the Minneapolis offices of [[Wells Fargo]], a rival to the new stadium's naming rights sponsor [[U.S. Bank]], are located within the vicinity of the stadium, Wells Fargo agreed to only install "non-mounted," non-illuminated signage on its building, such as letters painted directly onto the roof. After the original agreement was reached, Wells Fargo had asked the team to allow the installation of "raised, illuminated lettering. mounted on beams more than a foot above the roof rather than painted on the roof as agreed upon". Such signage would be visible in overhead views of U.S. Bank Stadium (such as camera shots during event telecasts), Wells Fargo threatened to light the entire rooftops of its offices if the Vikings chose to deny the requested change. In December 2015, the Vikings sued Wells Fargo for violating the agreement, after they began to construct an illuminated sign on their rooftop.&lt;ref name="startrib-wellsfargo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vikings say Wells Fargo's new rooftop signs near U.S. Bank Stadium are too big and bright|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-vikings-say-wells-fargo-s-new-signs-near-u-s-bank-stadium-are-too-big-and-bright/363378351/|website=Star-Tribune|location=Minneapolis|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mbj-photobomb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vikings sue Wells Fargo over 'photo bomb' rooftop signs near U.S. Bank Stadium|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2015/12/23/vikings-sue-wells-fargo-over-photo-bomb-rooftop.html|website=Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 2016, Judge [[Donovan W.

=== Ambushes of Apple ===
In October 2011, [[Samsung]] ambushed the Australian launch of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone 4S]] [[smartphone]] by setting up a [[Pop-up retail|pop-up store]] near Sydney's [[Apple Store]]. At the store, the company sold its competing [[Samsung Galaxy S II|Galaxy S II]] to the first 10 people in line daily at a discount price of $2 [[Australian dollar|AUD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung plays dirty, ambushes Apple's iPhone 4S launch in Sydney|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/12/samsung-plays-dirty-ambushes-apples-iphone-4s-launch-in-sydney/|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung similarly piggybacked the launch of its successor, the [[iPhone 5]], to promote the [[Galaxy S III]] and [[Galaxy Note II]]; the company purchased keyword advertisements for the devices on major search engines, as well as [[Twitter]] and [[YouTube]], thus causing ads for them to appear on searches relating to iPhone 5.&lt;ref name="tnw-iphone5ambush"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsung’s weapons in battle against Apple’s iPhone 5: Google, Twitter and Bing|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/09/13/samsung-lays-serious-marketing-dollars-ambush-iphone-5-launch/|website=The Next Web|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessinsider-killingiphone5"&gt;{{cite news|title=Samsung Is Killing The iPhone 5 In Web Video Ads Right Now|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-is-killing-iphone-5-in-web-video-2012-9|accessdate=27 January 2017|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
[[File:Olympic Stadium (London) illuminated, 3 August 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The organizers of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] ''([[Olympic Stadium (London)|stadium]] pictured)'' received criticism for their "draconian" anti-ambush marketing rules.&lt;ref name=guardian-olympicbill/&gt;&lt;ref name=outlaw-2012/&gt;]]

Moves to control ambush marketing at events have been met with mixed reception: ambush marketing regulations enable the event organizer to prevent competitors from impeding on a company's exclusive rights to serve as an event's sponsor, thus making their sponsorship rights more lucrative.&lt;ref name=wsj-ambushed /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-brandingpolice /&gt;&lt;ref name=sportpro-ambush /&gt; Laws enacted to control ambush advertising practices have proven to be controversial: critics have argued that ambush advertising regulations can inhibit [[Freedom of speech|free expression]] and prevent businesses (such as restaurants, [[sports bar]]s, and [[pub]]s) from even mentioning an event, and that a country's existing [[trademark law]]s can be sufficient to protect organizers' intellectual property without granting them special powers.&lt;ref name=guardian-olympicbill/&gt;&lt;ref name=startrib-aclu/&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has opposed "clean zone" policies on several occasions; prior to both [[Super Bowl XLVII]] and the [[2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], the organization respectively sued both the cities of [[New Orleans]] and [[Minneapolis]] for enforcing clean zone laws, arguing that they were [[unconstitutional]] for banning [[protected speech]]. In response to the lawsuit, New Orleans did amend its clean zone ordinance to allow non-commercial protected speech within the clean zones.&lt;ref name=startrib-aclu&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU sues Minneapolis over All-Star Game "clean zone"|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/blogs/258505291.html|website=Star-Tribune|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vice-nosuperbowl/&gt; The NFL has also received criticism for exaggerating the extent of its intellectual property rights under the laws of the United States, aggressively enforcing its trademarks, and failing to take the doctrine of [[fair use]] into account.&lt;ref name=ars-nfloveraggressive&gt;{{cite web|title=The NFL wants you to think these things are illegal|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/the-nfl-wants-you-to-think-these-things-are-illegal/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thr-supertrademarks/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-godvsgridiron/&gt;

During the lead-up to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games]] (LOCOG) showed an infamously aggressive stance towards enforcing anti-ambush advertising regulations. The organizing committee's policies and the [[London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006]] were criticized by local politicians, along with the [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]], for being overly broad, "draconian," and unnecessary to enforce its exclusive trademark and sponsorship rights.&lt;ref name=guardian-olympicbill&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic bill under fire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/16/advertising.marketingandpr|accessdate=3 October 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=outlaw-2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic law 'draconian', says marketing body|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-9441|website=Out-Law|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press described LOCOG as being a "branding police" due to these enforcement measures; [[EasyJet]] was told by a LOCOG representative that having [[Sally Gunnell]] reprise her pose with the [[Union Jack]] from the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Games]] for an advertisement would constitute an unauthorized association, an art event known as ''The Great Exhibition 2012'' received threats from LOCOG for merely containing "2012" in its name, and athletes were asked to report ambush advertising activities on a special website.&lt;ref name=marketing-brandpolice/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-brandingpolice/&gt;  In contrast, LOCOG allowed the restaurant chain [[Little Chef]] to continue selling its popular "Olympic Breakfast," owing to its long-standing use of the brand since 1994.&lt;ref name=littlechef&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Chef allowed to keep Olympic Breakfast, LOCOG rules|url=http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2012/07/23/little-chef-allowed-keep-olympic-breakfast-locog-rules|accessdate=26 July 2012|website=The Drum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also argued by critics that LOCOG's policies made it unviable for smaller businesses to promote themselves using the Games, even in support of athletes, as they would need to evaluate whether their marketing materials violate the restrictions on unauthorized associations.&lt;ref name=marketing-brandpolice&gt;{{cite web|title=Branding 'police' mask non-sponsor logos at Olympic venues|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1115729/branding-police-mask-non-sponsor-logos-olympic-venues|website=Marketing Magazine (UK)|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-brandingpolice&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics 2012: branding 'police' to protect sponsors' exclusive rights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/13/olympics-2012-branding-police-sponsors|accessdate=3 January 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the architecture community strongly criticised the marketing restrictions, citing LOCOG's refusal to allow architectural firms to publicise their work on Olympic venues, including preventing the firms from entering national and international award competitions. LOCOG retained rights to all Olympic marks even after the end of the games until they were transferred to the [[British Olympic Association]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/11/olympics-marketing-rules-architecture-tessa-jowell?newsfeed=true |title=Olympics marketing rules are damaging British business, says Tessa Jowell |first=Owen |last=Gibson |website=The Guardian |date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|2016 U.S. Olympic track and field trials]], the apparel company Oiselle received demands by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) to remove social media posts congratulating its sponsored athlete [[Kate Grace]] on qualifying for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. The USOC considered them to be unauthorized "Olympic-related advertising" because the photos attached to the posts depicted USOC trademarks, including the Olympic rings and the phrase "Road to Rio". Company CEO Sally Bergesen stated that future posts would remove or obscure references to these trademarks, but argued that their depiction were [[De minimis|incidental]] because the offending material appeared in the venue and on the bibs worn by all athletes at the event, making it intractable to avoid depicting them in photos taken there. She also defended the postings as being news reporting on the achievements of its sponsored athletes, and not necessarily promotion for the brand itself.&lt;ref name="fittish-usoctm"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Olympic Committee Tells Oiselle To Delete Social Media Posts, Ignores Others|url=http://fittish.deadspin.com/u-s-olympic-committee-tells-oiselle-to-delete-social-m-1783304825|website=Fittish (Deadspin)|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adweek-2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Olympics' New Advertising Rules Will Impact Athletes and Brands in Rio|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/how-olympics-new-advertising-rules-will-impact-athletes-and-brands-rio-172372|website=Adweek|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-evade"&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics Ease an Ad Blackout, and Brands Flood the Field|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/business/media/olympics-ease-an-ad-blackout-and-brands-flood-the-field.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onerous restrictions on the promotion of Olympic athletes were one of the factors behind the [[National Hockey League]]'s decision to prohibit its players from participating in the [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics|men's ice hockey tournaments]] at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes20160520"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/sports/hockey/olympics-and-nhl-face-off-over-who-pays-to-insure-players.html?_r=0 | title=Olympics and N.H.L.

Comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] satirized the USOC policies during a sketch on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]'' aired on the eve of the 2016 opening ceremony, wherein he presented an image of five [[CBS]] logos arranged and coloured like the [[Olympic rings]], and promoted the programme's new "sponsor", Musa Tea (a beverage "brewed from the freshest mint in Morocco's [[Jebel Musa (Morocco)|Musa mountains]]"), which is promoted using the [[hashtag]] "#teamusa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/stephen-colbert-rio-olympics-hashtags-donald-trump-video-1201797104/|title=Stephen Colbert Thumbs Nose At Rio Olympics Organizers|last=Moraes|first=Lisa de|date=2016-08-02|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert also satirized the NFL's "Super Bowl" trademarks in 2014 on his previous series, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', where he referred to the game as the "Superb Owl", and remarked that "we all know that the winner of the Big Game [[I'm going to Disney World!|goes to]] [[Walt Disney World|Animated Mouse Theme Park]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/stephen-colbert-finds-loophole-nfl-trademark-get-ready-colbert-report-superb-owl-xlviii-video/|title=Stephen Colbert Finds NFL Trademark Loophole: Prepare for 'Colbert Report' 'Superb Owl XLVIII' (Video)|date=2014-01-28|work=TheWrap|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beard token.jpg|thumb|right|A Russian beard token from 1705, carried to indicate that the owner had paid the beard tax imposed by Peter the Great]]
A '''beard tax''' is one of several taxes introduced throughout history on men who wear [[beard]]s.

== England ==
In 1535, King [[Henry VIII of England]], who wore a beard himself, introduced a tax on beards. The tax was a graduated tax, varying with the wearer's social position. His daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England]], reintroduced the beard tax, taxing every beard of more than two weeks' growth, although it was poorly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrews |first1=William G. |url=http://www.loyalbooks.com/download/text/At-the-Sign-of-the-Barbers-Pole-by-Andrews.txt |format=TXT |title=At the Sign of the Barber's Pole: Studies in Hirsute History |location=Cottingham, Yorkshire, England |publisher=J.R. Tutin |year=1904 |isbn=978-1590210819 |accessdate=2016-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary documentation of the Tudor beard tax, however, is lacking, and [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] has no record of such a tax having been instituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dhhliteraryagency.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/moustaches-whiskers-beards-lucinda-hawksley/ |title=DHH Author Blog: Moustaches, Whiskers &amp; Beards – Lucinda Hawksley |last=Hawksley |first=Lucinda |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2016-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boub v. Township of Wayne''' is a ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme court]] made in 1998, where it was held that municipalities are not liable for the damage cyclists suffer on the poorly maintained roads. The cyclists were ruled "permitted, but not intended, users of the roads" in the state of Illinois. Under the state law, municipalities have a duty to maintain local roads in a safe condition. However they are liable for damages only if the use of a road was both permitted and intended. The justices were sharply divided on the issue—four of them voted for the decision and three against. The dissenters called the decision "absurd and dangerous".&lt;ref name=Boub&gt;{{cite web|title=Boub v. Township of Wayne, 183 Ill. 2d 520, 702 N.E.2d 535 (1998) |url=http://www.state.il.us/court/opinions/supremecourt/1998/October/Opinions/HTML/84246.htm |date=October 22, 1998 |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |publisher=Illinois Courts website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605052609/http://www.state.il.us/court/opinions/supremecourt/1998/October/Opinions/HTML/84246.htm |archivedate=June 5, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case originated from an incident on September 8, 1992 in which the cyclist Jon Boub was riding over a bridge in [[Wayne, Illinois|Township of Wayne]]. The bridge was being renovated at the time, and the asphalt had been partially removed from the road bed, revealing gaps between the wooden planks. When the front wheel of the Boub's bike "became stuck between two of the planks", he was thrown off the bike, hit the steel railing of the bridge, and received severe injuries. Boub sued the Township of Wayne on September 23, 1993 claiming negligence on the part of the municipality. The lawsuit was dismissed by the lower courts and subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois.&lt;ref name=Boub/&gt;

==Effect==
The decision created a disincentive for Illinois municipalities to declare roads safe for cyclists. Over a seven-year period, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] tried several times to change the law, without success.&lt;ref name=Boub2&gt;{{cite web|publisher=League of Illinois Bicylists|title=Addressing Illinois’ On-Road Bikeway Disincentive|url=http://www.bikelib.org/on-road-bikeway-disincentive/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130910201605/http://www.bikelib.org/on-road-bikeway-disincentive/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Camp David Accords''' were signed by [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Menachem Begin]] on 17 September 1978, following twelve days of secret negotiations at [[Camp David]].&lt;ref name="TEXTOFACCORDS"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Camp%20David%20Accords Camp David Accords&amp;nbsp;– Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903011255/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Camp%20David%20Accords |date=3 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two framework agreements were signed at the [[White House]], and were witnessed by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]. The second of these frameworks (''A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel'') led directly to the 1979 [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]. Due to the agreement, Sadat and Begin received the shared 1978 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The first framework (''A Framework for Peace in the Middle East''), which dealt with the [[Palestinian territories]], was written without participation of the Palestinians and was condemned by the United Nations.

Carter's and Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]]'s exploratory meetings gave a basic plan for reinvigorating the peace process based on a Geneva Peace Conference and had presented three main objectives for Arab–Israeli peace: Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist in peace, Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories gained in the [[Six-Day War]] through negotiating efforts with neighboring Arab nations to ensure that Israel's security would not be threatened and securing an undivided Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1482.html|title=Camp David Accords: Jimmy Carter Reflects 25 Years Later|website=www.cartercenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camp David Accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by Egypt, Israel, and the United States that began after Jimmy Carter became President.&lt;ref name="Stein, Kenneth 1989, pp. 229-228"&gt;Stein, Kenneth. ''Heroic Diplomacy: Sadat, Kissinger, Carter, Begin, and the Quest for Arab–Israeli Peace''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, pp. 228–229&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts initially focused on a comprehensive resolution of disputes between Israel and the Arab countries, gradually evolving into a search for a bilateral agreement between Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;"Stein, Kenneth 2000, pp. 229–228"&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon assuming office on January 20, 1977, President Carter moved to rejuvenate the [[Middle East]] peace process that had stalled throughout the 1976 presidential [[Political campaign|campaign]] in the [[United States]]. Following the advice of a [[Brookings Institution]] report, Carter opted to replace the incremental, bilateral peace talks which had characterized [[Henry Kissinger]]'s [[shuttle diplomacy]] following the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] with a comprehensive, multilateral approach. The Yom Kippur War further complicated efforts to achieve the objectives written in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]].

Israel's Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and his successor, [[Menachem Begin]], were both skeptical of an international conference.&lt;ref name="Stein, Kenneth 1989, pp. 229-228" /&gt; While Begin, who took office in May 1977, officially favored the reconvening of the conference, perhaps even more vocally than Rabin, and even accepted the Palestinian presence, in actuality the Israelis and the Egyptians were secretly formulating a framework for bilateral talks. Even earlier, Begin had not been opposed to returning the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], but a major future obstacle was his firm refusal to consider relinquishing control over the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lenczowski]], ''American Presidents and the Middle East'', Duke University Press, 1990 p.164. {{ISBN|0-8223-0972-6}}. From [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], ''Power and Principle: Memoirs of the National Security Advisor 1977–1981'', (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1983), p.88.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Carter] outlined to Begin his program, which consisted of five points: (1) achieve a comprehensive peace affecting all of Israel's neighbors: (2) peace to be based on UN Resolution 242: (3) peace would involve open borders and free trade; (4) peace would call for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories to secure borders; (5) a Palestinian entity (but not an independent nation) should be created.  Begin responded that he could accept all of these points except the Palestinian entity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participating parties===
[[File:Six Day War Territories.svg|thumb|upright|right|Territory held by Israel: {{legend|#ffffd0|before the [[Six-Day War]]}} {{legend|#f7d3aa|after the war}}]]
Carter visited the heads of state on whom he would have to rely to make any peace agreement feasible. By the end of his first year in office, he had already met with [[Anwar El Sadat]] of [[Egypt]], [[King Hussein]] of [[Jordan]], [[Hafez al-Assad]] of [[Syria]], and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] of [[Israel]]. Despite the fact that he supported Sadat's peace initiative, King Hussein refused to take part in the peace talks; Begin offered Jordan little to gain and Hussein also feared he would isolate Jordan from the Arab world and provoke Syria and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] if he engaged in the peace talks as well.&lt;ref name=olp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/jordan/19.htm|title=Jordan - The Camp David Accords|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hafez al-Assad, who had no particular interest in negotiating peace with Israel,&lt;ref name=ldmm&gt;The Middle East: ten years after Camp David, William B. Quandt, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; also refused to come to the United States and only agreed to meet with Carter in Geneva.

===Begin Initiative===
The key to an arrangement between Begin and Sadat took place on Sunday, 6 August 1978, as a result of a telephone call made that morning to the Israeli Prime Minister's office by a United States citizen who had an "idea for peace." The Prime Minister had not yet arrived at his office and the caller spoke to Mr. Yechiel Kadishai, a Begin staff head. Kadishai said that "no one was speaking with anyone and we expect a war in October." He also told the caller that if any high level talks were to occur the caller could be assured that they would be using his approach. Begin arrived, was informed of the plan, and contacted Sadat who agreed to the plan on that day. On the next day, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance traveled to the Middle East to obtain firsthand confirmation of the agreement between Israel and Egypt. The following day, Tuesday, 8 August, the Camp David meeting was scheduled to take place in exactly 4 weeks time; on 5 September 1978. The plan was that Israel agreed on 6 August to return the land to Egypt. Sadat’s then waning popularity would be greatly enhanced as a result of such an achievement. Israel's security was insured by the specific activities to take place during the "transition period." Those activities also were included in the "idea for peace" communicated to Begin's office on 6 August.

===Sadat Initiative===
[[File:Camp David, Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat, 1978.jpg|fight|thumb|250px|[[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] at [[Camp David]], 1978]]
President [[Anwar El Sadat]] came to feel that the Geneva track peace process was more show than substance, and was not progressing, partly due to disagreements with his Arab (mainly [[Syria]], [[Libya]], and [[Iraq]]) and his communist allies. He also lacked confidence in the Western powers to pressure Israel after a meeting with the Western leaders. His frustration boiled over, and after clandestine preparatory meetings between Egyptian and Israeli officials, unknown even to the NATO countries, in November 1977, Sadat became the first Arab leader to visit Israel.

On 9 November 1977, President Sadat startled the world by announcing to parliament his intention to go to [[Jerusalem]] and speak before the [[Knesset]]. Shortly afterward, the Israeli government cordially invited him to address the Knesset in a message passed to Sadat via the US ambassador to Egypt. Ten days after his speech, Sadat arrived for the groundbreaking three-day visit, which launched the first peace process between Israel and an Arab state. As would be the case with later Israeli–Arab peace initiatives, Washington was taken by surprise; the White House and State Department were particularly concerned that Sadat was merely reaching out to reacquire Sinai as quickly as possible, putting aside the Palestinian problem. Considered as a man with strong political convictions who kept his eye on the main objective, Sadat had no ideological base, which made him politically inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sadat visit came about after he delivered a speech in Egypt stating that he would travel anywhere, "even Jerusalem," to discuss peace.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, James. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DC1E30F93AA35750C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 "Menachem Begin, Guerrilla Leader Who Became Peacemaker."] ''[[The New York Times]]''.  9 March 1992.  15 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; That speech led the Begin government to declare that, if Israel thought that Sadat would accept an invitation, Israel would invite him. In Sadat's [[Knesset]] speech he talked about his views on peace, the status of [[Israeli occupied territories|Israel's occupied territories]], and the Palestinian refugee problem. This tactic went against the intentions of both the West and the East, which were to revive the [[Geneva Conference (1973)|Geneva Conference]].

The gesture stemmed from an eagerness to enlist the help of the NATO countries in improving the ailing Egyptian economy, a belief that Egypt should begin to focus more on its own interests than on the interests of the Arab world, and a hope that an agreement with Israel would catalyze similar agreements between Israel and her other Arab neighbors and help solve the Palestinian problem. Prime Minister Begin's response to Sadat's initiative, though not what Sadat or Carter had hoped, demonstrated a willingness to engage the Egyptian leader. Like Sadat, Begin also saw many reasons why bilateral talks would be in his country's best interests. It would afford Israel the opportunity to negotiate only with Egypt instead of with a larger [[Arab]] delegation that might try to use its size to make unwelcome or unacceptable demands. Israel felt Egypt could help protect Israel from other Arabs and Eastern communists. In addition, the commencement of direct negotiations between leaders&amp;nbsp;– summit diplomacy&amp;nbsp;– would distinguish Egypt from her Arab neighbors. Carter's people apparently had no inkling of the secret talks in Morocco between Dayan and Sadat's representative, Hassan Tuhami, that paved the way for Sadat's initiative. Indeed, in a sense Egypt and Israel were ganging up to push Carter off his Geneva track. The basic message of Sadat's speech at the [[Knesset]] were the request for the implementation of [[U.N. Resolution 242|Resolutions 242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]]. Sadat's visit was the first step to negotiations such as the preliminary Cairo Conference in December 1977.

==Egyptian–Israeli talks==

[[File:Sadat and Begin and their delegations at Camp David, September 17, 1978 (10729645586).jpg|thumb|250px|A meeting at [[Camp David]] with (l-r) [[Aharon Barak]], [[Menachem Begin]], [[Anwar Sadat]], and [[Ezer Weizman]], 1978]]

A mechanism had yet to be created for Israel and Egypt to pursue the talks begun by Sadat and Begin in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Forward.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13212/|title=How Jimmy Carter Almost Derailed Peace With Egypt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian president suggested to Begin that Israel place a secret representative in the American embassy in Cairo. With American "cover," the true identity of the Israeli, who would liaise between the Egyptian and Israeli leaders, would be known only to the American ambassador in Cairo.&lt;ref name="Forward.com"/&gt;

Sadat's liaison initiative spoke volumes about his reasons for wanting to make peace with Israel. He wanted an alliance with the American superpower and he wanted to kill Carter's Geneva initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterlemons.org/previous/bl150402ed13.html|title=bitterlemons.org - The Powell mission and the US role|website=www.bitterlemons.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trip to Jerusalem signaled a major reorientation of Cairo's place in the global scheme of things, from the Soviet to the American camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://israel.foreignpolicyblogs.com/category/peace-process/page/2/ Foreignpolicyblogs.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's acceptance of the proposed liaison scheme would have signaled American backing for Sadat's unprecedented peace initiative. But Carter said no. However, Carter could not thwart the Israeli-Egyptian peace push. Within days Israeli journalists were allowed into Cairo, breaking a symbolic barrier, and from there the peace process quickly gained momentum. An Israeli-Egyptian working summit was scheduled for 25 December in Ismailiya, near the [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacenow.org/entries/archive3705|title=Americans for Peace Now: Archives|website=peacenow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanied by their capable negotiating teams and with their respective interests in mind, both leaders converged on Camp David for 13 days of tense and dramatic negotiations from 5 to 17 September 1978. By all accounts, Carter's relentless drive to achieve peace and his reluctance to allow the two men to leave without reaching an agreement are what played the decisive role in the success of the talks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Carter's advisers insisted on the establishment of an Egyptian-Israeli agreement which would lead to an eventual solution to the Palestine issue. They believed in a short, loose, and overt linkage between the two countries amplified by the establishment of a coherent basis for a settlement. However, Carter felt they were not "aiming high enough" and was interested in the establishment of a written "land for peace" agreement with Israel returning the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1482.html | title=Camp David Accords: Jimmy Carter Reflects 25 Years Later|accessdate=1 February 2015 |date= 17 September 2003 |work=[[Carter Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous times both the Egyptian and Israeli leaders wanted to scrap negotiations, only to be lured back into the process by personal appeals from Carter. Considered as an excellent mediator who arbitrated concessions with confidence, he played a tireless commitment to find formulas, definitions, and solutions to the many intricate variables, regardless of perceived or real political limitations, and was capable of soothing fears and anxieties, always with the goal of keeping the negotiations going.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} He gradually understood the importance historical events had upon determining personal ideology, but he would not allow it to constrain his political options, and he did not want them to limit the options of those with whom he was negotiating.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Begin and Sadat had such mutual antipathy toward one another that they only seldom had direct contact; thus Carter had to conduct his own microcosmic form of shuttle diplomacy by holding one-on-one meetings with either Sadat or Begin in one cabin, then returning to the cabin of the third party to relay the substance of his discussions. Begin and Sadat were "literally not on speaking terms," and "claustrophobia was setting in."

[[File:Carter, Brzezinski and Vance at Camp David, 1977.jpg|thumb|left|President Carter, National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], and Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] at Camp David]]
A particularly difficult situation arose on the tenth stalemated day of the talks. The issues of Israeli settlement withdrawal from the Sinai and the status of the West Bank created what seemed to be an impasse. In response, Carter had the choice of trying to salvage the agreement by conceding the issue of the West Bank to Begin, while advocating Sadat's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the Sinai Peninsula. Or he could have refused to continue the talks, reported the reasons for their failure, and allowed Begin to bear the brunt of the blame.

Carter chose to continue and for three more days negotiated. During this time, Carter even took the two leaders to the nearby [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in the hopes of using the [[American Civil War]] as a simile to their own struggle.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Consequently, the 13 days marking the Camp David Accords were considered a success. Partly due to Carter's determination in obtaining an Israeli-Egyptian agreement, a full two-week pledge to a singular international problem. Additionally, Carter was beneficiary to a fully pledged American foreign team. Likewise, the Israeli delegation had a stable of excellent talent in Ministers [[Moshe Dayan|Dayan]] and [[Ezer Weizman|Weizman]] and legal experts Dr. [[Meir Rosenne]] and [[Aharon Barak]]. Furthermore, the absence of the media contributed to the Accord's successes: there were no possibilities provided to either leader to reassure his political body or be driven to conclusions by members of his opposition. An eventual scrap of negotiations by either leader would have proven disastrous, resulting in taking the blame for the summit's failure as well as a disassociation from the White House. Ultimately, neither Begin nor Sadat was willing to risk those eventualities. Both of them had invested enormous amounts of political capital and time to reach an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camp David Accords comprise two separate agreements: ''"A Framework for Peace in the Middle East"'' and ''"A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel"'', the second leading towards the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] signed in March 1979. The agreements and the peace treaty were both accompanied by "side-letters" of understanding between Egypt and the U.S. and Israel and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/campdavid/letters.phtml "The Camp David Accords."] ''[[Jimmy Carter Library and Museum]]''.  21 July 2001.  28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framework for Peace in the Middle East===
The preamble of the ''"Framework for Peace in the Middle East"'' starts with the basis of a peaceful settlement of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]:

''The agreed basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Israel and its neighbors is United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, in all its parts.''&lt;ref name=Framework_PME&gt;Jimmy Carter Library, [http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/campdavid/accords.phtml ''The Framework for Peace in the Middle East''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216211951/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/campdavid/accords.phtml |date=16 December 2013 }}, 17 September 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework itself consists of 3 parts. The first part of the framework was to establish an [[wikt:autonomy|autonomous]] self-governing authority in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza strip]] and to fully implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]]. The Accords recognized the "legitimate rights of the Palestinian people", a process was to be implemented guaranteeing the full autonomy of the people within a period of five years. [[Menachem Begin|''Begin'']] insisted on the adjective "full" to confirm that it was the maximum political right attainable. This full autonomy was to be discussed with the participation of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza was agreed to occur after an election of a self-governing authority to replace Israel's military government.&lt;ref name="TEXTOFACCORDS"/&gt; The Accords did not mention the Golan Heights, Syria, or Lebanon. This was not the comprehensive peace that Kissinger, Ford, Carter, or Sadat had in mind during the previous American presidential transition.&lt;ref name="Stein, Kenneth 1999, p.254"&gt;Stein, 1999, p.254.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was less clear than the agreements concerning the Sinai, and was later interpreted differently by Israel, Egypt, and the United States. The [[positions on Jerusalem|fate of Jerusalem]] was deliberately excluded from this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, 175&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of the framework dealt with Egyptian–Israeli relations, the real content worked out in the second Egypt—Israel framework. The third part, "Associated Principles," declared principles that should apply to relations between Israel and all of its Arab neighbors.

==== Key points of the West Bank and Gaza section ====
* ''Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the representatives of the Palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects.''
* (1.) ''Egypt and Israel agree that, in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly transfer of authority, and taking into account the security concerns of all the parties, there should be transitional arrangements for the West Bank and Gaza for a period not exceeding five years. In order to provide full autonomy to the inhabitants, under these arrangements the Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants of these areas to replace the existing military government.''
* (2.) ''Egypt, Israel, and Jordan will agree on the modalities for establishing elected self-governing authority in the West Bank and Gaza. The delegations of Egypt and Jordan may include Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza or other Palestinians as mutually agreed. The parties will negotiate an agreement which will define the powers and responsibilities of the self-governing authority to be exercised in the West Bank and Gaza. A withdrawal of Israeli armed forces will take place and there will be a redeployment of the remaining Israeli forces into specified security locations. The agreement will also include arrangements for assuring internal and external security and public order. A strong local police force will be established, which may include Jordanian citizens. In addition, Israeli and Jordanian forces will participate in joint patrols and in the manning of control posts to assure the security of the borders.''
* (3.) ''When the self-governing authority (administrative council) in the West Bank and Gaza is established and inaugurated, the transitional period of five years will begin. As soon as possible, but not later than the third year after the beginning of the transitional period, negotiations will take place to determine the final status of the West Bank and Gaza and its relationship with its neighbors and to conclude a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan by the end of the transitional period. These negotiations will be conducted among Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the elected representatives of the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza. ... The negotiations shall be based on all the provisions and principles of UN Security Council Resolution 242. The negotiations will resolve, among other matters, the location of the boundaries and the nature of the security arrangements. The solution from the negotiations must also recognize the legitimate right of the Palestinian peoples and their just requirements.''

The framework merely concerned autonomy of the inhabitants of West Bank and Gaza. It neither mentions the [[status of Jerusalem]], nor the [[Palestinian Right of Return]].&lt;ref name=Framework_PME/&gt;

====UN Rejection of the Middle East Framework====
The [[UN General Assembly]] rejected the ''Framework for Peace in the Middle East'', because the agreement was concluded without participation of UN and PLO and did not comply with the Palestinian right of return, of self-determination and to national independence and sovereignty. December 1978, it declared in ''Resolution 33/28 A'', that agreements were only valid if they are within the framework of the United Nations and its Charter and its resolutions, include the Palestinian right of return and the right to national independence and sovereignty in Palestine, and concluded with the participation of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]. Also the passive attitude of the [[Security Council]] was criticised.&lt;ref&gt;UNGA, 7 December 1978, [https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/45650594884CB837852560DD0051C2AF ''Resolution 33/28 A. Question of Palestine''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111144829/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/45650594884CB837852560DD0051C2AF |date=11 January 2014 }} (doc.nr. A/RES/33/28)&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 1979, the UN condemned in ''Resolution 34/70'' all partial agreements and separate treaties that did not meet the Palestinian rights and comprehensive solutions to peace; it condemned Israel's continued occupation and demanded withdrawal from ''all'' occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;UNGA, 6 December 1979, [https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6118CF31EC9EB7FB852560DA006E47F3 ''Resolution 34/70.

A/RES/34/70)&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December, in ''Resolution 34/65 B'', she rejected more specific parts of the Camp David Accords and similar agreements, which were not in accordance with mentioned requirements. All such partial agreements and separate treaties were strongly condemned. The part of the Camp David accords regarding the Palestinian future and all similar ones were declared invalid.&lt;ref&gt;UNGA, 12 December 1979, [https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/1CFBE54A74E1AB8B852560DA006DE34D ''Resolution 34/65 B. Question of Palestine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329074242/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/1CFBE54A74E1AB8B852560DA006DE34D |date=29 March 2012 }}. [doc.nr. A/RES/34/65 (A-D)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framework Peace Treaty Egypt and Israel===
The second framework&lt;ref name=Framework_CPTEI&gt;Jimmy Carter Library, [http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/campdavid/frame.phtml ''Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216152443/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/campdavid/frame.phtml |date=16 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a basis for the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] six months later, in particular deciding the future of the [[Sinai peninsula]]. Israel agreed to withdraw its armed forces from the Sinai, evacuate its 4,500 civilian inhabitants, and restore it to Egypt in return for normal diplomatic relations with Egypt, guarantees of freedom of passage through the Suez Canal and other nearby waterways (such as the [[Straits of Tiran]]), and a restriction on the forces Egypt could place on the Sinai peninsula, especially within 20–40&amp;nbsp;km from Israel. This process would take three years to complete.  Israel also agreed to limit its forces a smaller distance (3&amp;nbsp;km) from the Egyptian border, and to guarantee free passage between Egypt and Jordan. With the withdrawal, Israel also returned Egypt's Abu-Rudeis oil fields in western Sinai, which contained long term, commercially productive wells.

The agreement also resulted in the United States committing to several billion dollars worth of annual subsidies to the governments of both Israel and Egypt, subsidies which continue to this day, and are given as a mixture of grants and aid packages committed to purchasing U.S. [[materiel]]. From 1979 (the year of the peace agreement) to 1997, Egypt received military aid of {{Nowrap|US$1.3 billion}} annually, which also helped modernize the [[Military of Egypt|Egyptian military]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm#relations "Egypt"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121065214/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm#relations |date=21 January 2011 }} ''[[U.S. Department of State]]''.  March 2008.  28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is beyond economic, humanitarian, and other aid, which has totaled more than {{Nowrap|US$25 billion}}.)  Eastern-supplied until 1979, Egypt now received American weaponry such as the [[M1A1 Abrams]] Tank, [[AH-64 Apache]] gunship and the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighter jet. In comparison, Israel has received {{Nowrap|$3 billion}} annually since 1985 in grants and military aid packages.&lt;ref&gt;Benhorin, Yitzhak. [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3362402,00.html "Israel still top recipient of US foreign aid."] ''[[Ynetnews]]''. 2 August 2007. 28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The time that has elapsed since the Camp David Accords has left no doubt as to their enormous ramifications on Middle Eastern politics.  Most notably, the perception of Egypt within the Arab world changed. With the most powerful of the Arab militaries and a history of leadership in the Arab world under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], Egypt had more leverage than any of the other Arab states to advance Arab interests. Egypt was subsequently suspended from the [[Arab League]] from 1979 until 1989.

When the Camp David accords were signed, Jordan's King Hussein saw it as a slap to the face when Sadat volunteered Jordan's participation in deciding how functional autonomy would work. More specifically, Sadat effectively said that Jordan would have a role in how the West Bank would be administered. Like the Rabat Summit Resolution, the Camp David Accords circumscribed Jordan's objective to reassert its control over the West Bank. Focusing as it did on Egypt, the Carter administration accepted Sadat's claim that he could deliver Hussein. However, with Arab world opposition building against Sadat, Jordan could not risk accepting the Accords without the support from powerful Arab neighbours, like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.&lt;ref name="Stein, Kenneth 1999, p.254"/&gt; Hussein consequently felt diplomatically snubbed. One of Carter's regrets was allowing Sadat to claim that he could speak for Hussein if Jordan refused to join the talks, but by then the damage was done to the Jordanians.&lt;ref name="Stein, Kenneth 1999, p.254"/&gt;
[[File:Carter and Sadat White House2.jpg|right|thumb|United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] greeting Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] at the [[White House]] shortly after the Camp David Accords went into effect, 8 April 1980.]]
The Camp David Accords also prompted the disintegration of a united Arab front in opposition to Israel. Egypt's realignment created a power vacuum that [[Saddam Hussein]] of [[Iraq]], at one time only a secondary power, hoped to fill. Because of the vague language concerning the implementation of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]], the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] problem became the primary issue in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] immediately following the Camp David Accords (and, arguably, until today). Many of the Arab nations blamed Egypt for not putting enough pressure on Israel to deal with the Palestinian problem in a way that would be satisfactory to them.  Syria also informed Egypt that it would not reconcile with the nation unless it abandoned the peace agreement with Israel.&lt;ref name=ldmm /&gt;

According to ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The normalization of relations [between Israel and Egypt] went into effect in January 1980. Ambassadors were exchanged in February. The boycott laws were repealed by Egypt's National Assembly the same month, and some trade began to develop, albeit less than Israel had hoped for. In March 1980 regular airline flights were inaugurated. Egypt also began supplying Israel with crude oil".&lt;ref&gt;Sela, "Arab–Israel Conflict", 100{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Kenneth Stein in ''Heroic Diplomacy: Sadat, Kissinger, Carter, Begin, and the Quest for Arab–Israeli Peace'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Accords were another interim agreement or step, but negotiations that flowed from the Accords slowed for several reasons. These included an inability to bring the Jordanians into the discussions; the controversy over settlements; the inconclusive nature of the subsequent autonomy talks; domestic opposition sustained by both Begin and Sadat and, in Sadat's case, ostracism and anger from the Arab world; the emergence of a what became a [[cold peace]] between Egypt and Israel; and changes in foreign policy priorities including discontinuity in personnel committed to sustaining the negotiating process[.]&lt;ref name="Stein, Kenneth 1999, p.254"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lastly, the biggest consequence of all may be in the psychology of the participants of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The success of Begin, Sadat, and Carter at Camp David demonstrated to other Arab states and entities that negotiations with Israel were possible—that progress results only from sustained efforts at communication and cooperation. Despite the disappointing conclusion of the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] between the PLO and Israel, and even though the 1994 [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] has not fully normalized relations with Israel, both of these significant developments had little chance of occurring without the precedent set by Camp David.

==Public support==
Although most Israelis supported the Accords, the [[Israeli settler|Israeli settler movement]] opposed them because Sadat would not agree to a treaty in which Israel had any presence in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] at all, Israel had to withdraw from the entire Sinai Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Sela, "Sinai Peninsula," 774&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli settlers tried to prevent the government from dismantling their settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, there is lasting support of the Camp David Peace Accords, which have become a national consensus, supported by 85% of Israelis according to a 2001 poll taken by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies (Israel based).&lt;ref&gt;Ronen, Joshua.  [http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/Hjerus1.html "Poll: 58% of Israelis back Oslo process."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502195917/http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/Hjerus1.html |date=2 May 2008 }} ''[[Tel Aviv University]]''.  7 June 2001.  28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a minority of Israelis believe the price Israel paid for the peace agreement was too high for its present gains, i.e. having relinquished the entire Sinai Peninsula, with its oil, tourism and land resources (Israel has no other oil wells), and the trauma of evacuating thousands of its Israeli inhabitants (many resisted, as in the settlement of [[Yamit]] and had to be forcefully evacuated, a phenomenon encountered also in the subsequent Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, known as the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

For Israel, perhaps the most evident tangible benefit of the agreement with Egypt (other than the subsequent U.S. aid, which Egypt also received) was a peaceful mutual border, enabling the [[Israel Defense Forces]] to reduce their levels of alert on Israel's southwestern frontier.

==Criticism of the Accords==
Although Egypt and Israel generally abided by the agreement since 1978, in the following years a common belief emerged in Israel that the peace with Egypt is a "cold peace". Others feel that the peace agreement was between the Israeli people and Egypt's [[charismatic authority|charismatic]] President [[Anwar El Sadat]], rather than with the [[Egyptian people]], who were not given the opportunity to accept or reject the agreement with a free vote or a representative majority.

==Assassination of Anwar Sadat==
{{main|Assassination of Anwar Sadat}}
President Sadat's signing of the Camp David Accords on 17 September 1978 and his shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli Prime Minister Begin led to his assassination on 6 October 1981 by members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] during the annual victory parade held in Cairo to celebrate Egypt's crossing of the Suez Canal. The president's personal protection was infiltrated by four members of this organization, who were hiding in a truck passing through the military parade with other military vehicles. As the truck approached the president, the leader of the belligerents — Lieutenant [[Khalid Islambouli]] — came out of the truck and threw three grenades towards the president; only one of the three exploded. The rest of the team opened fire with automatic assault rifles and struck President Sadat with 37 rounds. He was airlifted to a military hospital where, despite the efforts of 11 doctors and surgeons, he died just two hours after arriving.

In total, 11 were killed from collateral gunfire and 28 were injured. Among the killed were the Cuban ambassador, an Omani general, and a Coptic Orthodox bishop. Among the wounded were [[Vice-President of Egypt|Egyptian Vice-President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]], [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Irish Defence Minister]] [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], and four U.S. military liaison officers. One of the assassins was killed and the other three were wounded and taken into custody. The surviving assassins were tried and found guilty of assassinating the president and killing 10 others in the process; they were sentenced to capital punishment and were executed by firing squad on 15 April 1982.

The '''Commerce Act 1986''' is a statute of [[New Zealand]].  It prohibits conduct that restricts competition and purchase of shares or assets where that would lessen competition in a market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-legislation/|title=Commerce Act 1986|publisher=[[Commerce Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as generally governing markets, the Act gives the [[Commerce Commission]] particular powers in relation to services provided by electricity lines businesses, gas pipeline businesses and airports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">The '''Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism 2005''' (CECPT) is a regional [[multilateral treaty]] negotiated under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]]. It was concluded in [[Warsaw]] on 16 May 2005. Most notable amongst its provisions are the three new offences which it defines: Public Provocation to Commit a "Terrorist Offence"; Solicitation of Persons to Commit "Terrorist Offences"; and Provision of Training For "Terrorist Offences". Parties are required to establish these offences in their national legal systems. However the obligation only applies in respect of behaviour where there is an international nexus of some sort.  A "terrorist offence" is defined as any of the offences defined under the 12 existing [[international conventions on terrorism]] presently in force.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;Adrian Hunt, "The Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism" (2006) ''European Public Law'' 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__ 

==The Incitement Offence==
The most controversial part of the CECPT is its definition of Public Provocation to Commit a Terrorist Offence. Article 5 of the CECPT defines this as intentionally distributing "a message to the public, with the intent to incite the commission of a 'terrorist offence', where such conduct, whether or not directly advocating terrorist offences, causes a danger that one or more terrorist offences may be committed."

This is the first attempt in an international law context to define "incitement" to terrorism. It is controversial most notably because of the inclusion of “indirect” incitement. The limits of this concept are not defined in the CECPT. Article 12 of the CECPT requires parties to implement, and apply the offence in a way which is compatible with the Right to freedom of Expression as recognised in International  Law [See Article 10 of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], and Article 19 of the UN’s [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ]. There is some evidence that in a purported fulfilment of their obligations under the CECPT, States are going further than the CECPT and the relevant Human Rights principles would require or permit. See for example the British [[Terrorism Act 2006]], section 1.

==Signatures and ratifications==
The CECPT is open for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe, the [[European Community]], and by non-member states which have participated in its elaboration. It came into force on 1 June 2007 in Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine; as of July 2016 it has been ratified by 35 states.&lt;Ref name = ratifications&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=196&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG]&lt;/ref&gt; A further 10 states and the [[European Union]] have signed but not ratified the Convention.&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt;

'''The County Police Act 1839''' (2 &amp; 3 Vict c 93) (also known as the '''Rural Police Act''' or the '''Rural Constabularies Act''') was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was one of the [[Police Acts 1839 to 1893]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Act enabled [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]] in [[England and Wales]] to establish police forces in their counties. The Act was not compulsory, and constabularies were only established in 25 out of 55 counties{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} by 1856, when the [[County and Borough Police Act 1856]] made their provision mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Les|title=The Police Gazette  Part 1: Issues for 1866-1878, 1882-1897 and 1899-1900 from the Cambridgeshire Police Archive|url=http://www.ampltd.co.uk/digital_guides/police_gazette_part_1/Short-History-of-the-Police.aspx|accessdate=7 March 2010|publisher=Adam Matthews Publications|location=Marlborough, Wiltshire|chapter=A Short History of the Police}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal commission==
The legislation was based on the recommendations of a [[royal commission]] appointed in 1836 to "inquire into the best means of establishing an efficient constabulary force in the counties of England and Wales". The three members of the commission, or "Constabulary Commissioners" as they were informally called were Colonel [[Charles Rowan]], [[Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]], [[Edwin Chadwick]] and [[Charles Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Viscount Eversley|Charles Shaw Lefevre]]. The commission was appointed against a background of unrest and violence in some areas of the country, with protests against the [[New Poor Law]] and agitation by [[Chartism|Chartists]] for social and political reform.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=David|title=The new police in nineteenth-century England: crime, conflict, and control|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ihYNAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=county%20police%201839&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=1839&amp;f=false|year=1997|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-4729-9|pages=27–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chadwick was strongly in favour of the creation of a single centralised force, but this was opposed by not only the two other commissioners but also by the [[Home Secretary]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]. Russell wrote to the magistrates of the various counties asking them to support the resolution passed in [[Shropshire]] to establish a body of constables paid for out of the county rate and under the control of the magistrates.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt; The commission's report, issued in 1839, followed the lines favoured by Russell. It recommended that "a properly trained and equipped preventative police force" based on the pattern of the existing [[Metropolitan Police]], should be established in all counties where the magistrates were in favour. Each force should be funded mostly by local rates, with 25% of the cost met by central government. The force would be under the supervision of the county magistrates, who would have the power to employ or remove officers, subject to statutory regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ampltd.co.uk/digital_guides/police_gazette_part_1/Appendix-A.aspx|chapter=Appendix A: Notes on the First Report of the Constabulary Commissioners |last=Waters|first=Les|title=The Police Gazette  Part 1: Issues for 1866-1878, 1882-1897 and 1899-1900 from the Cambridgeshire Police Archive|accessdate=7 March 2010|publisher=Adam Matthews Publications|location=Marlborough, Wiltshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=First report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire as to the best means of establishing an efficient constabulary force in the counties of England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E1ADAAAAQAAJ|year=1839|publisher=[[HMSO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==

The Act allowed Justices of the Peace of any [[county]], in general or [[quarter sessions]], to appoint constables "for the preservation of the peace and protection of the inhabitants" where they felt the existing system of [[parish constable]]s was insufficient.

The constables were to be appointed on a ratio of not more than one officer per one thousand of population. [[Municipal borough|Borough]]s operating under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] had the power to form their own police force and were to be excluded from the jurisdiction of the county police.

In each county where the Act was adopted a [[Chief Constable]] was to be appointed. Where a county was divided into two parliamentary divisions by the [[Reform Act 1832]], a chief constable could be appointed to each division. It was also permitted for one chief constable to be appointed to two or more neighbouring counties.

For the purposes of the Act all county [[exclave]]s were to be part of the county by which they were surrounded, or with which they had the longest common boundary. All franchises or [[Liberty (division)|liberties]], other than reformed boroughs were also to come under the county police.

A "county" for the purposes of the Act was defined as being "any County, [[Riding (division)|Riding]] or Division having a separate Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace or in which separate County Rates are made". The Act was not to extend to the [[Metropolitan Police District]].

==Establishing a force==
In order to establish a force in a county, it was necessary for three or more magistrates to make requisition to the chairman of the [[quarter sessions]] to bring the matter to a vote. If the sessions chose to adopt the act they were obliged to prepare a report on the area and population of the county and the existing method of policing. The report would set out how it was proposed to apply the legislation to the county, detailing the number of constables, the divisions of the county and the salaries to be paid and making any additional rules and regulations deemed necessary. The report was then submitted for approval to the Home Secretary who could modify parts of the scheme but did not have the power to alter the number of constables or their salaries. The sessions had the power to choose a chief constable, but his appointment was also subject to the approval of the Home Secretary. In some cases magistrates chose to form a force in only part of a county.&lt;ref name="leicester"&gt;{{cite news|title=Establishment of a County Police|date=26 October 1839|work=The Leicester Chronicle: or, Commercial and Agricultural Advertiser|location=[[Leicester]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first county to form a constabulary under the 1839 Act was [[Wiltshire Constabulary|Wiltshire]]. On 13 November the court of quarter sessions agreed to adopt the act, and on 28 November appointed Commander Samuel Meredith, [[Royal Navy]] as chief constable. The appointment was approved on 5 December, and Wiltshire's example was quickly followed by Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Durham.&lt;ref name=wilts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiltshire.police.uk/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download%26gid%3D60%26Itemid%3D390&amp;ei=5jB6TZTjE4TLhAf89oTjBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaXtQTMQT5iWJDaIinHeleu5__bA&amp;sig2=GDKI6C11kmiK7mOawqIEFw|title=The Magistrates Take Action|work=The History of Wiltshire Constabulary|publisher=[[Wiltshire Constabulary]]|pages=9–10|accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few months of the first county constabularies being formed, a number of problems with the legislation became apparent. Accordingly, the Hon. [[Fox Maule]] introduced a bill to the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] in February 1840. Maule outlined the problems:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...difficulties had arisen from the mode of payment provided for carrying into effect the regulations of the act, by levying it out of the county rates; a difficulty as to that provision had arisen in various counties, in which certain districts only had adopted the act. In counties, also, in which there were isolated portions of other counties, it was difficult to say how those isolated portions were to be dealt with, because they were incorporated in the police districts of another county than that in which they were rated for the payment..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1840/feb/18/county-constabulary-act-amendment#S3V0052P0_18400218_HOC_78|title=County Constabulary Act - Amendment (HC Deb 18 February 1840 vol 52 cc385-92)|date=18 February 1840|work=Hansard 1803-2005|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bill was enacted as  the '''County Police Act 1840''' (3&amp;4 Vict., c. 88). It provided ''inter alia'' for the voluntary merging of [[Municipal borough|borough]] police forces with county constabularies and the levying of a new "police rate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sir George Kettilby Rickards|title=The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LMIuAAAAIAAJ|volume=80|year=1840|publisher=[[HMSO]]|location=London|pages=359–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main provisions of the Act were:
*Justices of the peace were permitted to transfer areas from one county to another for police purposes.
*A special police rate was to be levied to finance the county constabulary, instead of the cost being part of the general county rate.
*Where parts of one county were policed by the constabulary of another county, the rate payers were to pay the police rate to the county providing the constables.
*Boroughs were permitted to consolidate their police force with that of the county in which they were situate, and a single chief constable could be appointed for a consolidated force.
*The chief constable of a consolidated force could dismiss borough constables, but new constables for the area were to be appointed by the [[Watch Committee]] of the borough corporation.
*Justices were empowered to divide the county into districts, each with a population of not less than 25,000. Separate police rates could be levied on ratepayers of each division. However, constables were liable to serve throughout the county, regardless of which district they were assigned to.
*The act repeated the definition of a county as in the 1839 Act, and noted that the [[Isle of Ely]] should be considered a county for constabulary purposes.
*Permission was given to the justices to acquire land and buildings, and borrow money for the construction of police stations and to build strong rooms for the temporary confinement of prisoners.
*If, in the opinion of the justices in quarter sessions, the constables provided under the 1839 Act were no longer needed, they could disband them, having given six months notice to the Home Secretary. No county forces were dis-established, and a resolution in 1843 to dissolve the Worcestershire Constabulary as "the benefit derived from the employment of the rural police in the County of Worcester has not been equal to the expense it has occasioned to the ratepayers" was soundly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Worcester Quarter Sessions.

{{merge|Deportation and removal from the United States|date=October 2018}}
At law, '''criminal deportation''' is where an [[alien (law)|alien]] is ordered [[deportation|deported]] or physically removed from a country by reason of such alien's [[crime|criminal]] conduct.&lt;ref name="mlive"/&gt;

==In United States==
{{Further|Aggravated felony|Removal proceedings}}
Following the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] and the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996|Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]] (AEDPA), the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996|Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]] (IIRIRA), which made deportation mandatory for certain [[alien (law)#United States|aliens]] sentenced to a year or more of [[imprisonment]] for an [[aggravated felony]] conviction.

In 2003, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) was abolished and replaced by the now [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). In 2004, the DHS launched [[Operation Endgame]], a strategy to remove all deportable aliens. In 2005, a Homeland Security Spending Bill increased funds for immigration law enforcement to ten billion dollars, significantly raising the number of border patrol agents, immigration investigators and interior detention personnel.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 2006, Congress began considering more reform proposals that would impose even harsher restrictions for aliens who have broken the law and expand the definition of deportable crimes even further. As a result, minor past offenses can increasingly be used as grounds for expulsion.&lt;ref name="mlive"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2018/05/after_facing_deportation_ann_a.html |title=Michigan father of 4 was nearly deported; now he's a U.S. citizen |date=May 11, 2018 |accessdate=2018-10-16 |publisher=www.mlive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Denmark]] on 23 May 1939.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p524 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked whether they approved of a new [[Constitution of Denmark|constitution]]. Although it was approved by 91.9% of those who voted, a turnout of only 48.9% meant that the percentage of eligible voters approving it was only 44.46%, below the 45% required by the existing constitution of 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p505&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed changes from the existing constitution==
The two primary changes in the proposed constitution from 1939 was lowering the electoral age from 25 to 23 years, and replacing the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] with a new [[Chambers of parliament|chamber]] of parliament, the Rigsting.&lt;ref name=wendt&gt;Wendt, Frantz W. (1951). "Rigsdagen 1915-40", in Bomholt, J., Fabricius, K., Hjelholt, H., Mackeprang, M. &amp; Møller, A. (eds.): ''Den Danske Rigsdag 1849-1949 bind II - Rigsdagens histore 1866-1949'' {{da icon}}. Copenhagen: J. H. Schultz Forlag, pp. 554-556.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the united parliament ({{lang-da|den forenede [[rigsdag]]}}) consisting of the members of the two other chambers was to become a third chamber of parliament.&lt;ref name=skou&gt;Skou, Kaare R. (2005). ''Dansk politik A-Å'' {{da icon}}. Aschehoug, pp. 579-580. {{ISBN|87-11-11652-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The united parliament would handle the more important types of bills, including the Budget and proposed changes to the constitution.&lt;ref name=wendt /&gt; Other bills could be proposed in either the Folketing or the Rigsting, and in order to pass they would have to go through three readings in the chamber, in which they were proposed, and two readings in the other.&lt;ref name=skou /&gt; This would have been a simplification of the existing process where all bills had to go through three readings in each of the two chambers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15773">'''Default judgment''' is a binding [[Legal judgment|judgment]] in favor of either party based on some failure to take action by the other party.  Most often, it is a judgment in favor of a [[plaintiff]] when the [[defendant]] has not responded to a [[summons]] or has failed to appear before a [[court]] of law.  The failure to take action is the default.  The default judgment is the relief requested in the party's original petition.&lt;ref name="Legal Definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/default-judgment/|title=Legal Definition of default judgment|publisher=Legal-glossary.org|accessdate=3 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Default can be compared to a [[wikt:forfeit|forfeit]] [[victory]] in sports. In a [[civil trial]] involving [[damages]], a default judgment will enter the amount of damages [[plead]]ed in the original [[complaint]].  If [[Evidence (law)|proof]] of damages is required, the court may schedule another [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] on that issue. A party can have a default judgment [[vacated]], or [[Motion to set aside judgment|set aside]], by filing a motion, after the judgment is entered, by showing of a proper excuse.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===England and Wales===

====How judgment arises====

In [[England and Wales]], a [[Plaintiff|Claimant]] starts a case by [[issue (legal)|issuing]] a [[summons|Claim Form]]. This either states a monetary figure on it, together with fixed costs and court fees; alternatively if the amount cannot be determined, it will be for an amount 'to be assessed'. A Claimant may not wish to recover money at all, in which case the Claim Form states this.

The Claim Form (together with other documents, known as ''Particulars of Claim'' and a ''Response Pack'') are [[Service of Process|served]] on the Defendant.

If the Defendant fails to reply within 14 days of service, the Claimant can apply for Judgment in Default, either by simply requesting the court's administrative staff enter judgment ''filing a request for judgment'' (which is sufficient for routine cases), or by making a formal application to the Procedural Judge. The judgment is known as ''Judgment in Default of Acknowledgment of Service''.

If the Defendant did acknowledge to the court that the papers were served within the 14-day period, then the Defendant is given 28 days to take a further step. If the Defendant fails to do so, again judgment can be entered as above; this time formally known as ''Judgment in Default of Defense''.

If money is claimed, the Claimant can choose how their judgment will be phrased. Almost always there will be a request that the money claimed, the court fee, and interest at 8% on the money from when the Claim Form was issued up until date of judgment, and if legally represented a fixed contribution to legal costs, be ordered to be paid immediately. However, the Claimant could simply request the Defendant be ordered to pay at a later date or in installments.

If money is claimed but the amount is not fixed, a ''Disposal Hearing'' is listed to determine the amount of money.

If any other remedy is claimed, the Claimant would have had to apply to the procedural judge for the Judgment in Default, and therefore the Judge will determine what happens next.

Judgments in Default are covered by Part 12 of the '''[[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]]'''

====Effect of judgment====

The judgment is binding and failure to comply with it means that [[enforcement]] action could be taken.

The Defendant's name is also entered onto a register (although if they pay within a month it will be removed) which is open to everyone, and is particularly used to vet the credit-worthiness of people.

In the case of ''Masters -v- Leaver''[1999]EWCA Civ 2016 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1999/2016.html] it was held that a judgment in default means just that - it is a judgment obtained due to default. It does not mean that the court has agreed with what was claimed, or favors one or other case. Therefore if the issue arises again, the Defendant is not prevented from arguing the facts again.

That case also refers to Texas and US law being similar, although of course the English Court has no jurisdiction to determine that point.

====Varying default judgment====

If a Defendant accepts the judgment, and the amount, but is unable to pay, the Defendant may apply to ''Vary'' the judgment. A process is gone through whereby the Defendant states how soon they can afford to pay the debt (usually monthly installments) and the Claimant can either accept this, or request another amount. The court's staff will suggest a figure and ultimately a District Judge (N.B. In England and Wales a District Judge is one of the lowest levels of judge) will make a decision. The decision is binding, even if it means the Claimant is out of their money for a considerable amount of time, and even if interest cannot be charged on the outstanding sum (which it usually can't).

====Setting aside default judgment====

There are three grounds for canceling ('setting aside') the Default judgment.
:* The documents were not served correctly. The Defendant has to show that the documents were not served, which obviously would explain why the Claimant had ability to enter judgment. This has to be done by way of an 'Application on Notice' (motion). Evidence has to be shown to the procedural judge. This used to be called setting aside an 'irregular judgment'

:* There is some good reason why judgment in default should be set aside. This covers any situation but is commonly used when service was effected properly, but still did not come to the attention of the Defendant (perhaps they were on a long vacation, or in hospital).  Many jurisdictions also require the defendant to proffer a meritorious defense before vacating the default judgment.

:* The Claimant entered judgment when they were not entitled so to do. For example, perhaps a Defense was filed in time, but the Claimant still attempts to enter judgment. The court staff usually check for things like this, but occasionally things slip through the net. It used to be the obligation of the '''Claimant''' to apply to set aside their own judgment in these circumstances, but this obligation has recently (in 2005) been dropped.

In the last circumstance of the above, the Defendant can get the judgment canceled as of right. Otherwise, the Defendant needs to show what their Defense will be, and if the court thinks that the defendant is effectively 'stalling for time' they will not get the judgment set aside.

====Practice====

In practice an application to set aside Default Judgment is almost always granted. This fact is seized upon by so-called 'credit repair' companies. A person whose credit record is adversely affected by a registered judgment pays a credit repair company who advises them how to apply to have it set aside. This is usually of little effect: the judgment will be re-entered very quickly if there is no actual defense, and there are usually other records which affect a person's credit rating, not just the judgment.

Pragmatic reasons why judgments are set aside are mainly because on balance, it is seen as better to give a person who may have a good defense extra time, and avoid a potentially devastating judgment, and thereby keep a claimant out of their money for a further two to four weeks, than give the claimant the benefit.

However the court can, and often does, order conditions to be satisfied, such as a draft defense being filed first, money paid into court, or similar conditions.

Setting aside Judgment in Default is covered by Part 13 of the Civil Procedure Rules.

===United States===

In the United States the law relating to a default judgment depends upon the jurisdiction within which the civil action was filed.  [[State court (United States)|State courts]], [[United States Federal Courts]], [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Tribal Courts]] and many [[Independent agencies of the United States government|Administrative Agencies]] have their own laws and local procedural rules relating to the granting and setting aside of a default judgment.  The [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] (Rules [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure#Chapter VII - Judgment|55 and 60]]) are the basis for many procedures in default. Federal Rule 37(b)(iii) states that a balky plaintiff can be found in default and have his case dismissed if the plaintiff repeatedly fails to comply with things like court orders and discovery requests.

====Entry of default====
Typically, the plaintiff (or cross-complainant, cross-plaintiff, counter-claimant, counter-plaintiff, third-party plaintiff, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Md. R. 2-613(a).&lt;/ref&gt; must show that [[service of process]] was effected on the defendant (cross-defendant, counter-defendant, cross-defendant, third-party defendant, etc.).  This is typically achieved by the filing of an [[affidavit]] of service&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', F.R.Civ.P. 4(l).&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as a proof of service),&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Calif. Code Civ. Proc. § 417.30.&lt;/ref&gt; which gives enough information to allow the court to confirm that valid service has been accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;S. Baicker-McKee, W.M. Jansen, &amp; J.B. Corr, ''Federal Civil Rules Handbook'', Thomson/West, 2007, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically the affidavit states, under oath or penalty of perjury, that service was effected on a named defendant, briefly describes how it was effected, names the person who made service, and gives the place and date service was effected.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', D.C. Super. Ct. Civ. P. R. 4(''l'').&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the requisite time to respond to the complaint has passed, the defendant is "in [[Default (law)|default]]"; this may be automatic,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', F.R.Civ.P. 12(a); Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(a).&lt;/ref&gt; or it may require the court clerk to enter the default (which may, in turn, require that the plaintiff request entry of the default).&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Md. R. 2-613(b); Judicial Council of California, Form CIV-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some defaults do not take effect until a set period of time after the clerk acts.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', D.C. Super Ct. R. 55(a) (14 days, if the clerk dockets the default ''sua sponte'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The clerk may have to give the defendant notice of his default, affording a chance to have the default vacated.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Md. R. 2-613(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry of a default typically prevents the defaulted defendant from litigating his case or presenting evidence, and may excuse the other parties from giving him notice of further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Va. Sup Ct. R. 3:19(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relief from default====
A defaulted defendant may move the court from relief from his default,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Md. R. 2-613(d); Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(b).&lt;/ref&gt; but usually must do so promptly&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473(b), 473.5; Md. R. 2-613(d).&lt;/ref&gt; and must provide "good cause"&lt;ref&gt;F.R.Civ.P. 55(c).&lt;/ref&gt; for his failure to answer the complaint in time.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Calif. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473(b).&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, part of the procedure for relief from default involves the defendant filing an answer to the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', D.C. Super Ct. Civ. Proc. R. 55(c).&lt;/ref&gt;  The defendant relieved from default may also be required to pay any extra costs and fees incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the delay in the defendant's filing his answer.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Default judgment====
Often, a certain additional time is required before a default judgment is permissible, and there may need to be additional notice to the defendant.  Some states do not allow a default judgment to be entered against some defendants while other defendants are actively litigating the same case;&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; this is an application of the "one final judgment" rule.  Others will allow "several judgment" (judgment with respect to some defendants at one time, and with respect to others at another time), at least under some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Calif. Code Civ. Proc. § 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law (specifically the [[Servicemembers Civil Relief Act]]) significantly restricts default judgments against members of the military services.&lt;ref&gt;[[Servicemembers Civil Relief Act]] (formerly the [[Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act]]), 50 USC App. § 521.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law requires that before a default judgment may be entered, the plaintiff must make a certification as to the military service status of the defendant whose default is sought.&lt;ref&gt;50 USC App. § 521(b)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  This certification may be made in the complaint, in a document filed with the proof of service, or later.  Depending on the circumstances, other requirements may also apply.&lt;ref&gt;50 USC App. § 521(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions allow a clerk of court to enter default judgment in certain simple cases.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', F.R.Civ.P.55(b)(1); Calif. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 585(a), 1169.&lt;/ref&gt;  These typically involve no exercise of judgment or discretion.&lt;ref&gt;''See'', ''e.g.'', R.I. Weil &amp; I.A. Brown, Jr., ''California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial'', The Rutter Group, ¶ 5:121 ''ff.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, a default judgment must be issued by a judge, who may require the plaintiff to present proof of his claims.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relief from default judgment====
A defendant who has had a default judgment entered against him may move for an order vacating the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', F.R.Civ.P. 55(c), 60(b); Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(d).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a defendant must show "good cause" for his not having responded to the complaint.  However, "good cause" is rather easy to meet, compared to other instances where "good cause" might be required.  For example, mere "excusable neglect" is, at least at the federal level, a sufficient reason to vacate default judgments.&lt;ref name="E.g., F.R.Civ.P. 60c1"&gt;''E.g.'', F.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  There are often time limits and other requirements.&lt;ref name="E.g., F.R.Civ.P. 60c1"/&gt;

[[Sewer service]], where a default judgement is obtained by fraud by not properly notifying the defendant that they are being sued, may result in a [[motion to vacate]] the default judgement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lupoloverlaw.com/home/blog/146-debt-collection-through-sewer-service |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202085839/http://www.lupoloverlaw.com/home/blog/146-debt-collection-through-sewer-service |archivedate=2015-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a civil lawsuit against a dishonest plaintiff or process server, or criminal charges for swearing a false [[affidavit]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101117070043/http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2009/apr/apr14a_09.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A court entertaining a motion to vacate a default judgment often considers the reasons presented the defendant's failure to respond (such as "excusable neglect" and the prejudice that might be suffered by the other party).&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', F.R.Civ.P. 60(b); ''Jones v. Hunt'', 298 A.2d 220 (D.C. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court must weigh these factors in light of two competing considerations: the general preference for cases to be decided "on the merits", and the important need for "finality in litigation."&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Dunn v. Profitt'', 408 A.2d 991 (D.C. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Depository Library Act of 1962''' is a [[Law of the United States|federal statute]] revising the [[Legal deposit|depository library]] laws passed in the [[United States]] from 1895 to 1939. The [[Act of Congress]] mandated the availability of U.S. government publications through the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Superintendent of Documents]] for public information. The statute established requirements for two depository libraries as allocated by [[United States Congress|U.S. Congressional representatives]] per their respective [[United States congressional apportionment|congressional districts]]. The U.S. federal law provided provisions appointing [[Land-grant university|land-grant colleges]] and the [[United States service academies]] as depository libraries for U.S. government publications. The 87th U.S. Congressional [[legislation]] authorized regional depository libraries allocating two depository libraries per [[U.S. state]] as defined by a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]. The Act [[repeal]]ed Public Law 76-281 designating the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] library as a depository of U.S. government publications while redelegating the [[New London, Connecticut]] office of the Superintendent of Documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45909">The '''fairness doctrine''' of the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of [[broadcast license]]s both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was—in the FCC's view—honest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the ''Federal Register'' in August 2011.&lt;ref name="Finally"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boliek|first=Brooks|title=FCC finally kills off fairness doctrine|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61851.html|work=Politico|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of [[public interest]], and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented. The demise of this FCC rule has been considered by some to be a contributing factor for the rising level of [[Polarization (politics)|party polarization]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E. Patterson, Thomas. "The News Media: Communicating Political Images." We the People. 10th ed. McGraw-Hill Education, 2013. 336. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rendall |first=Steve |title=The Fairness Doctrine: How We Lost it, and Why We Need it Back |publisher=Extra! |date=January 1, 2005 |url=http://fair.org/extra/the-fairness-doctrine/ |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main agenda for the doctrine was to ensure that viewers were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints. In 1969 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC's general ''right'' to enforce the fairness doctrine where channels were limited. But the courts did not rule that the FCC was ''obliged'' to do so.&lt;ref name=RedLion&gt;[http://www.epic.org/free_speech/red_lion.html ''Red Lion Broadcasting Co.'' v. ''FCC''], decided June 8, 1969, also at {{Ussc|395|367|1969}} (Excerpt from Majority Opinion, III A; Senate report cited in footnote 26). Justice [[William O. Douglas]] did not participate in the decision, but there were no concurring or dissenting opinions.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts reasoned that the scarcity of the broadcast spectrum, which limited the opportunity for access to the airwaves, created a need for the doctrine.

The fairness doctrine is not the same as the [[equal-time rule]]. The fairness doctrine deals with discussion of controversial issues, while the equal-time rule deals only with political candidates.

==Origins==
In 1938, a former Yankee Network employee named Lawrence J. Flynn challenged the license of John Shepard III's WAAB in Boston, and also lodged a complaint about WNAC. Flynn asserted that these stations were being used to air one-sided political viewpoints and broadcast attacks (including editorials) against local [and federal] politicians that Shepard opposed. The FCC requested that Shepard provide details about these programs, and to appease the commission, the Yankee Network agreed to drop the editorials.  But Flynn created a company called Mayflower Broadcasting and tried to get the FCC to award him WAAB's license; however, the FCC refused. Instead, in 1941, the commission made a ruling that came to be known as the Mayflower Decision which declared that radio stations, due to their public interest obligations, must remain neutral in matters of news and politics, and they were not allowed to give editorial support to any particular political position or candidate.

In 1949, the FCC’s Editorializing Report&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Commission in the Matter of Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees'', 13 F.C.C. 1246 [1949].&lt;/ref&gt; repealed the [[Mayflower Doctrine]], which had forbidden editorializing on the radio since 1941, and laid the foundation for the Fairness Doctrine by reaffirming the FCC's holding that licensees must not use their stations “for the private interest, whims or caprices [of licensees], but in a manner which will serve the community generally.”&lt;ref&gt;''Report ... Licensees'', 13 F.C.C. 1246, 1248-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = America's Battle for Media Democracy: The Triumph of Corporate Libertarianism and the Future of Media Reform|last = Pickard|first = Victor|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781107694750|location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC Report established two forms of regulation on broadcasters: to provide adequate coverage of public issues, and to ensure that coverage fairly represented opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, D.L. (1996), ''The Federal Communications Commission, the broadcast industry, and the fairness doctrine 1981–1987'', New York: University Press of America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The second rule required broadcasters to provide reply time to issue-oriented citizens. Broadcasters could therefore trigger Fairness Doctrine complaints without editorializing. The commission required neither of the Fairness Doctrine's obligations before 1949. Until then broadcasters had to satisfy only general “public interest” standards of the Communications Act.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, H.(1988). ''The battle to control broadcast news''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine remained a matter of general policy and was applied on a case-by-case basis until 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion and Order, 8 F.C.C.2d 721 (August 7, 1967), which codified the personal attack doctrine and implemented provisions with respect to political editorials from Times-Mirror Broadcasting Co., 40 F.C.C. 531, 538 (1962); codified as 32 Fed. Reg. 10303 at para. 4 (1967).

In a 1969 textbook case, the [[United States courts of appeals]], in an opinion written by [[Warren Burger]], directed the FCC to revoke Lamar Broadcasting's licence for television station [[WLBT]] due to the station's segregationist politics and ongoing censorship of NBC network news coverage of the US civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/6/the_fcc_censorship_legendary_media_activist The FCC &amp; Censorship: Legendary Media Activist [[Everett Parker]] on the Revocation of WLBT’s TV License in the 1960s for Shutting Out Voices of the Civil Rights Movement], [[Democracy Now]], March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of the doctrine by the FCC ==

In 1974, the Federal Communications Commission stated that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] had delegated it the power to mandate a system of “access, either free or paid, for person or groups wishing to express a viewpoint on a controversial public issue...” but that it had not yet exercised that power because licensed broadcasters had “voluntarily” complied with the “spirit” of the doctrine. It warned that: {{cquote|Should future experience indicate that the doctrine [of 'voluntary compliance'] is inadequate, either in its expectations or in its results, the Commission will have the opportunity—and the responsibility—for such further reassessment and action as would be mandated.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of the Handling of Public Issues Under the Fairness Doctrine and the Public Interest Standards of the Communications Act'', 48 F.C.C.2d 1 (F.C.C. 1974); 39 Fed. Reg. 26.372, 26.374 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

In one landmark case, the FCC argued that [[teletext]] was a new technology that created soaring demand for a limited resource, and thus could be exempt from the fairness doctrine. The Telecommunications Research and Action Center (TRAC) and [[Media Access Project]] (MAP) argued that teletext transmissions should be regulated like any other airwave technology, hence the Fairness Doctrine was applicable (and must be enforced by the FCC). In 1986, Judges [[Robert Bork]] and [[Antonin Scalia]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] concluded that the Fairness Doctrine did apply to teletext but that the FCC was not required to apply it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/419289 ''Telecommunications Research and Action Center'' v. ''FCC'', 801 F.2d 501 (D.C. Cir. 1986)] retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; In a 1987 case, ''[[Meredith Corporation|Meredith Corp.]] v. FCC'', two other judges on the same court declared that Congress did not mandate the doctrine and the FCC did not have to continue to enforce it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/421421 ''Meredith Corp.'' v. ''FCC'', 809 F.2d 863 (D.C. Cir. 1987)], February 10, 1987, retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decisions of the United States Supreme Court==

In ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'', {{Ussc|395|367|1969}}, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld (by a vote of 8-0) the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine in a case of an on-air personal attack, in response to challenges that the doctrine violated the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. The case began when journalist [[Fred J. Cook]], after the publication of his ''Goldwater: Extremist of the Right'', was the topic of discussion by [[Billy James Hargis]] on his daily Christian Crusade radio broadcast on [[WGCB-TV|WGCB]] in [[Red Lion, Pennsylvania]]. Mr. Cook sued arguing that the fairness doctrine entitled him to free air time to respond to the personal attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Joyce: [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:YDRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FAE0731EA2EE1CD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=11ECDBF131F44C689BB0EDBA11D99EE0 “His call for a reply set up historic broadcast ruling; Fred J. Cook, whose book was attacked on Red Lion radio station WGCB in 1964, died recently at age 92.”] ''York Daily Record'' (Pennsylvania), May 6, 2003, retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar laws are unconstitutional when applied to the press, the Court cited a [[United States Senate|Senate]] report (S. Rep. No. 562, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9 [1959]) stating that radio stations could be regulated in this way because of the limited public airwaves at the time. Writing for the Court, Justice [[Byron White]] declared:{{cquote|A license permits broadcasting, but the licensee has no constitutional right to be the one who holds the license or to monopolize a radio frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens. There is nothing in the First Amendment which prevents the Government from requiring a licensee to share his frequency with others.... It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.&lt;ref name=RedLion /&gt;}}
The Court warned that if the doctrine ever restrained speech, then its constitutionality should be reconsidered.

However, in the case of ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', {{Ussc|418|241|1974}}, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] wrote (for a unanimous court):{{cquote|Government-enforced right of access inescapably dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate.}}
This decision differs from ''Red Lion'' v. ''FCC'' in that it applies to a newspaper, which, unlike a broadcaster, is unlicensed and can theoretically face an unlimited number of competitors.

In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not forbid editorials by non-profit stations that received grants from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (''FCC v. [[League of Women Voters]] of California'', {{Ussc|468|364|1984}}). The Court's 5-4 majority decision by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] stated that while many now considered that expanding sources of communication had made the fairness doctrine's limits unnecessary: {{cquote|We are not prepared, however, to reconsider our longstanding approach without some signal from Congress or the FCC that technological developments have advanced so far that some revision of the system of broadcast regulation may be required. (footnote 11)}}
After noting that the FCC was considering repealing the fairness doctrine rules on editorials and personal attacks out of fear that those rules might be "chilling speech", the Court added: {{cquote|Of course, the Commission may, in the exercise of its discretion, decide to modify or abandon these rules, and we express no view on the legality of either course. As we recognized in Red Lion, however, were it to be shown by the Commission that the fairness doctrine '[has] the net effect of reducing rather than enhancing' speech, we would then be forced to reconsider the constitutional basis of our decision in that case. (footnote 12)&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Section III C of ''Red Lion'' v. ''FCC'' {{Ussc|395|367|1969}}. Justice Brennan's opinion was joined by Justices [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun]], [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]] and [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. Dissenting opinions were written or joined by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] and Justices [[William Rehnquist]], [[Byron White]] and [[John Paul Stevens]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Revocation ==
=== Basic doctrine ===
In 1985, under FCC Chairman [[Mark S. Fowler]], a communications attorney who had served on Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign staff in 1976 and 1980, the FCC released its report on ''General Fairness Doctrine Obligations''&lt;ref&gt;''General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees'', Report, 50 Fed. Reg. 35418 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the doctrine hurt the public interest and violated [[free speech]] rights guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|First Amendment]]. The Commission could not, however, come to a determination as to whether the doctrine had been enacted by Congress through its 1959 Amendment to Section 315 of the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]]. 

In response to the 1986 ''Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. F.C.C.'' decision,&lt;ref&gt;801 F.2d 501 (D.C. Cir. 1986), ''reh'g denied'', 806 F.2d 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1986), ''cert. denied'', 107 S.Ct. 3196 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[99th Congress]] directed&lt;ref&gt;Making Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1987, P.L. 99-500. See also, ''Conference Report to Accompany H.J.Res. 738'', H.Rept. 99-1005. 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; the FCC to examine alternatives to the Fairness Doctrine and to submit a report to Congress on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40009.pdf | publisher=Congressional Research Service | date=13 July 2011 | accessdate=10 May 2016 |title=Fairness Doctrine: History and Constitutional Issues|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, in ''Meredith Corporation v. F.C.C.'' the case was returned to the FCC with a directive to consider whether the doctrine had been “self-generated pursuant to its general congressional authorization or specifically mandated by Congress.”&lt;ref&gt;809 F.2d 863 (D.C. Cir. 1987) at 872.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The FCC opened an inquiry inviting public comment on alternative means for administrating and enforcing the Fairness Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Inquiry into Section 73.1910 of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations Concerning Alternatives to the General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees in MM Docket No. 97-26'', 2 FCC Rcd 1532 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in its 1987 report, the alternatives—including abandoning a case-by-case enforcement approach, replacing the doctrine with open access time for all members of the public, doing away with the [[personal attack rule]], and eliminating certain other aspects of the doctrine—were rejected by the FCC for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of Inquiry into Section 73.1910 of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations Concerning Alternatives to the General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees''. 2 FCC Rcd 5272 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 5 August 1987, under FCC Chairman [[Dennis R. Patrick]], the FCC abolished the doctrine by a 4-0 vote, in the ''Syracuse Peace Council'' decision,&lt;ref&gt;''In re Complaint of Syracuse Peach Council against Television Station WTVH Syracuse, New York'', 2 FCC Rcd 5043 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; which was upheld by a panel of the Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit in February 1989, though the Court stated in their decision that they made "that determination without reaching the constitutional issue."&lt;ref name="syacuse_fcc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://openjurist.org/867/f2d/654/syracuse-peace-council-v-federal-communications-commission | title=867 F. 2d 654 - Syracuse Peace Council v. Federal Communications Commission | publisher=Openjurist | date=10 February 1989 | accessdate=7 December 2014 | quote=Under the "fairness doctrine," the Federal Communications Commission has, as its 1985 Fairness Report explains, required broadcast media licensees (1) "to provide coverage of vitally important controversial issues of interest in the community served by the licensees" and (2) "to provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on such issues." Report Concerning General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees, 102 F.C.C. 2d 143, 146 (1985). In adjudication of a complaint against Meredith Corporation, licensee of station [[WTVH]] in Syracuse, New York, the Commission concluded that the doctrine did not serve the public interest and was unconstitutional. Accordingly it refused to enforce the doctrine against Meredith. Although the Commission somewhat entangled its public interest and constitutional findings, we find that the Commission's public interest determination was an independent basis for its decision and was supported by the record. We uphold that determination without reaching the constitutional issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC suggested in ''Syracuse Peace Council'' that because of the many media voices in the marketplace, the doctrine be deemed unconstitutional, stating that: {{cquote|The intrusion by government into the content of programming occasioned by the enforcement of [the Fairness Doctrine] restricts the journalistic freedom of broadcasters ... [and] actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and the degradation of the editorial prerogative of broadcast journalists.}}

At the 4-0 vote, Chairman Patrick said:{{cquote|We seek to extend to the electronic press the same First Amendment guarantees that the print media have enjoyed since our country's inception.&lt;ref name="vote1987"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hershey, Jr. |first1=Robert D. |title=F.C.C.

[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/business/regulator-unregulated-dennis-patrick-fcc-another-man-who-loves-free-markets.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1987, Congress attempted to preempt the FCC decision and codify the Fairness Doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The Fairness in Broadcasting Act of 1987, S. 742 &amp; H.R. 1934, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; but the legislation was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Another attempt to revive the doctrine in 1991 was stopped when President [[George H.W. Bush]] threatened another veto.&lt;ref&gt;Val E. Limburg, [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/fairnessdoct/fairnessdoct.htm "Fairness Doctrine"], April 27, 2009, [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fowler said in February 2009 that his work toward revoking the Fairness Doctrine under the Reagan Administration had been a matter of principle (his belief that the Doctrine impinged upon the First Amendment), not partisanship. Fowler described the White House staff raising concerns, at a time before the prominence of conservative talk radio and during the preeminence of the [[Big Three television networks]] and PBS in political discourse, that repealing the policy would be politically unwise. He described the staff's position as saying to Reagan: {{cquote|The only thing that really protects you from the savageness of the three networks{{mdash}}every day they would savage Ronald Reagan{{mdash}}is the Fairness Doctrine, and Fowler is proposing to repeal it!&lt;ref name="Fowler-Levin;"&gt;[http://citadelcc.vo.llnwd.net/o29/network/Levin/MP3/levin02162009.mp3 The Mark Levin Show], February 16, 2009 (a 26-Megabyte [[MP3]] file), from about 17 minutes 15 seconds into the broadcast to 25 min. 45 sec.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Corollary rules ===
Two corollary rules of the doctrine, the [[personal attack rule]] and the "political editorial" rule, remained in practice until 2000. The "personal attack" rule applied whenever a person (or small group) was subject to a personal attack during a broadcast. Stations had to notify such persons (or groups) within a week of the attack, send them transcripts of what was said and offer the opportunity to respond on-the-air. The "political editorial" rule applied when a station broadcast editorials endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, and stipulated that the unendorsed candidates be notified and allowed a reasonable opportunity to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INFORMATION NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES: The policy and regulatory landscape|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-26-Broadcast.pdf|website=transition.fcc.gov|publisher=[[FCC]]|accessdate=22 August 2017|pages=277-278|format=pdf|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] ordered the FCC to justify these corollary rules in light of the decision to repeal the Fairness Doctrine. The FCC did not provide prompt justification so both corollary rules were repealed in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leweke|first1=Robert W.|title=Rules Without a Home: FCC Enforcement of the Personal Attack and Political Editorial Rules|journal=Communication Law and Policy|date=1 October 2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=557–576|doi=10.1207/S15326926CLP0604_02|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326926CLP0604_02|accessdate=22 August 2017|issn=1081-1680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairness Doctrine has been strongly opposed by prominent [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] who view it as an attack on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights and property rights. Editorials in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Washington Times]]'' in 2005 and 2008 said that Democratic attempts to bring back the Fairness Doctrine have been made largely in response to conservative [[talk radio]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 1987, Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, in applauding President Reagan's veto of a bill intended to turn the doctrine into law, said that the doctrine is an infringement on free speech and intrudes on broadcasters' journalistic judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-21/news/mn-8908_1_fairness-doctrine

In 2007, Senator [[Norm Coleman]] (R-[[Minnesota|MN]]) proposed an amendment to a defense [[appropriations bill]] that forbade the FCC from "using any funds to adopt a fairness rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/07/14/2514/

In the same year, the Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007 was proposed in the Senate by Senators Coleman with 35 co-sponsors (S.1748) and [[John Thune]] (R-SD) with 8 co-sponsors (S.1742)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1742/show Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007], Open Congress Foundation, retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and in the House by Republican Representative [[Mike Pence]] (R-[[Indiana|IN]]) with 208 co-sponsors (H.R. 2905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h2905/show Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007, introduced February 1, 2005, "To prevent the Federal Communications Commission from repromulgating the fairness doctrine"], Open Congress Foundation, retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It provided that: {{cquote|The Commission shall not have the authority to prescribe any rule, regulation, policy, doctrine, standard, or other requirement that has the purpose or effect of reinstating or repromulgating (in whole or in part) the requirement that broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance, commonly referred to as the `Fairness Doctrine', as repealed in General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees, 50 Fed. Reg. 35418 (1985).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-2905 Text of H.R. 2905: Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007], GovTrack.us, retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Neither of these measures came to the floor of either house.

On August 12, 2008, FCC Commissioner [[Robert M. McDowell]] stated that the reinstitution of the Fairness Doctrine could be intertwined with the debate over [[network neutrality]] (a proposal to classify network operators as [[common carrier]]s required to admit all Internet services, applications and devices on equal terms), presenting a potential danger that [[net neutrality]] and Fairness Doctrine advocates could try to expand content controls to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Poor, [http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2008/20080812160747.aspx "FCC Commissioner: Return of Fairness Doctrine Could Control Web Content"], August 13, 2008, Business &amp; Media Institute&lt;/ref&gt; It could also include "government dictating content policy".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyeblast.tv/Public/Video.aspx?rsrcID=34016 See also [http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-288134A1.pdf Commissioner McDowell's speech to the Media Institute] in January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;     The conservative [[Media Research Center]]'s Culture &amp; Media Institute argued that the three main points supporting the Fairness Doctrine — media scarcity, liberal viewpoints being censored at a corporate level, and public interest — are all myths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandmedia.com/specialreports/2008/Fairness_Doctrine/CMI_FairnessDoctrine_Single.pdf Culture &amp; Media Institute report on The Fairness Doctrine.] - accessed August 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, [[Barack Obama]]'s press secretary wrote that Obama (then a Democratic U.S. Senator from Illinois and candidate for President): {{cquote|Does not support reimposing the Fairness Doctrine on broadcasters ... [and] considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible. That is why Sen. Obama supports media-ownership caps, [[network neutrality]], [[public broadcasting]], as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets.&lt;ref&gt;John Eggerton, [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6573406.html "Obama Does Not Support Return of Fairness Doctrine"], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', June 25, 2008, retrieved on October 30, 2008, citing an e-mail from Obama's press secretary, Michael Ortiz.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On February 16, 2009, Mark Fowler said: {{cquote|I believe as President Reagan did, that the electronic press{{mdash}}and you're included in that{{mdash}}the press that uses air and electrons, should be and must be as free from government control as the press that uses paper and ink, ''Period''.&lt;ref name="Fowler-Levin;"/&gt;}}

In February 2009, a White House spokesperson said that President Obama continued to oppose the revival of the Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House: Obama Opposes 'Fairness Doctrine' Revival |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/02/18/white-house-opposes-fairness-doctrine/ |work=Fox News |date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[111th Congress]] (January 2009 to January 2011), the [[Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2009]] (S.34, S.62, H.R.226) was introduced to block reinstatement of the Doctrine.  On February 26, 2009, by a vote of 87-11, the Senate added that act as an amendment to the [[District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009]] (S.160),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate Backs Amendment to Prevent Fairness Doctrine Revival |work=FOXNews.com |date=February 26, 2009 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/26/demint-tries-prevent-fairness-doctrine-revival/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228062416/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/26/demint-tries-prevent-fairness-doctrine-revival/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [a bill which later passed the Senate 61-37, but not the House of Representatives].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/26/senate-votes-give-dc-full-house-vote/|title=Senate votes to give D.C. full House vote|last=Warren|first=Timothy|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=February 26, 2009}} The Senate roll call is [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073 here].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] reported that the vote on the Fairness Doctrine [[rider (legislation)|rider]] was: {{cquote|In part a response to conservative radio talk show hosts who feared that Democrats would try to revive the policy to ensure liberal opinions got equal time.}}
The AP report went on to say that President Obama had no intention of reimposing the doctrine, but Republicans (led by Sen. [[Jim DeMint]], R-[[South Carolina|SC]]) wanted more in the way of a guarantee that the doctrine would not be reimposed.&lt;ref&gt;Senate bars FCC from revisiting Fairness Doctrine The Associated Press, February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested alternatives===

{{distinguish|Unfairness doctrine}}

Media reform organizations such as [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] feel that a return to the Fairness Doctrine is not as important as setting stronger station ownership caps and stronger "public interest" standards enforcement (with funding from fines given to [[public broadcasting]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepress.net/files/talk_radio.pdf|title="The Structural Imbalance of Talk Radio", Free Press, Center for American Progress|author=|date=|website=freepress.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Accurate labeling rules ====
Under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the FTC requires that all 'consumer commodities' bear a label with an accurate 'statement identifying the commodity'.  If revenue-generating commercial broadcasts (whether by radio, tv, or internet) are a 'consumer commodity', then they must be accurately labeled.  That would seem to preclude 'News' that is not genuine, 'Opinion' that is not the author's actual opinion, or 'Analysis' that is not at least arguably analytical.  Note that in general the FTC only has authority over commercial aspects (pertaining to revenue) rather than speech.

===Public opinion===
In an August 13, 2008 telephone poll released by [[Rasmussen Reports]], 47% of 1,000 likely voters supported a government requirement that broadcasters offer equal amounts of liberal and conservative commentary, while 39% opposed such a requirement. In the same poll, 57% opposed and 31% favored requiring Internet [[website]]s and [[blog]]gers that offer political commentary to present opposing points of view. By a margin of 71%-20% the respondents agreed that it is "possible for just about any political view to be heard in today’s media" (including the Internet, newspapers, [[cable TV]] and [[satellite radio]]), but only half the sample said they had followed recent news stories about the Fairness Doctrine closely. (The [[margin of error]] was 3%, with a 95% confidence interval.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/47_favor_government_mandated_political_balance_on_radio_tv 47% Favor Government Mandated Political Balance on Radio, TV], Rasmussen Reports press release, Thursday, August 14, 2008 and [http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/pt_survey_toplines/august_2008/toplines_fairness_doctrine_august_13_2008 Toplines - Fairness Doctrine - August 13, 2008] (Questions and answers from the survey).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal revocation==
In June 2011, the Chairman and a subcommittee chairman of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]], both Republicans, said that the FCC, in response to their requests, had set a target date of August 2011 for removing the Fairness Doctrine and other "outdated" regulations from the FCC's rulebook.&lt;ref&gt;Gautham Nagesh, [http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/168807-fcc-sets-august-target-for-striking-fairness-doctrine FCC sets August target for striking Fairness Doctrine], "Hillicon Valley" blog, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', June 28, 2011, quoting Republican Representatives [[Fred Upton]] (R-Michigan), Chairman of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, and [[Greg Walden]] (R-Oregon), Chairman of its Telecommunications Subcommittee.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2011, the FCC voted to remove the rule that implemented the Fairness Doctrine, along with more than 80 other rules and regulations, from the ''[[Federal Register]]'' following an executive order by President Obama directing a "government-wide review of regulations already on the books" to eliminate unnecessary regulations.&lt;ref name="Finally"/&gt;

It was set up in response to the [[East Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, as the result of a perceived weakness in co-ordination between national regulators in matters of training and general understanding of financial systems.

The '''general principles of European Union law''' are general principles of law which are applied by the [[European Court of Justice]] and the national courts of the member states when determining the lawfulness of legislative and administrative measures within the [[European Union]]. General principles of European Union law may be derived from common legal principles in the various EU member states, or general principles found in international law or [[European Union law]]. Amongst others the European Court of Justice has recognised [[fundamental rights]] (see human rights), [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], [[legal certainty]], [[equality before the law]] and [[subsidiarity]] as general principles of European Union law. General principles of law should be distinguished from rules of law as principles are more general and open-ended in the sense that they need to be honed to be applied to specific cases with correct results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jans| first = J.H.| title = Europeanisation of Public Law| publisher = Europa Law Publishing| edition = 1st| year = 2007| pages = 418|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of general principles ==
The general principles of European Union law are rules of law which a European Union judge, sitting for example in the [[European Court of Justice]], has to find and apply but not create. Particularly for [[fundamental rights]], Article 6(3) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] provided:
: Fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, shall constitute general principles of the Union's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12012M006|title=EUR-Lex - 12012M006 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, Article 340 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (formerly Article 215 of the [[Treaty establishing the European Economic Community]]) expressly provides for the application of the "general principles common to the laws of the Member States" in the case of non-contractual liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT#page=195 |title = Treaty on the Functioning of the European Unionat=Article 340 |format = PDF |access-date = 11 November 2017 |quote=In the case of non-contractual liability, the Union shall, in accordance with the general principles common to the laws of the Member States, make good any damage caused by its institutions or by its servants in the performance of their duties. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In practice the European Court of Justice has applied general principles to all aspects of [[European Union law]]. In formulating general principles, European Union judges draw on a variety of sources, including: public international law and its general principles inherent to all legal systems; national laws of the member states, that is general principles common to the laws of all member states, general principles inferred from European Union law, and [[fundamental human rights]]. General principles are found and applied to avoid the denial of justice, fill gaps in European Union law and to strengthen the coherence of European Union law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kaczorowsky| first = Alina| title = European Union law | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 2008| pages = 231 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9atmZGmyJKoC&amp;dq=general+principle+of+community+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-415-44797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some examples of the principles ==

=== Fundamental rights ===
Fundamental rights, as in human rights, were first recognised by the European Court of Justice based on arguments developed by the German Constitutional Court in ''[[Stauder v City of Ulm]]'' Case 29/69 in relation to a European Community scheme to provide cheap butter to recipients of welfare benefits. When the case was referred to the European Court of Justice the ruling of the German Constitutional Court, the European Community could not "prejudice the fundamental human rights enshrined in the general principles of Community law and protected by the Court". This concept was further developed by the European Court of Justice in ''[[International Handelsgesellschaft v Einfuhr- und Vorratsstelle Getreide]]'' [1970] ECR 1125 Case 11/70 when it was held that "Respect for fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the Court of Justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the member states, must be ensured within the framework of the structure and objectives of the Community." Subsequently, in ''[[J Nold v Commission]]'' Case 4/73 the European Court of Justice reiterated that human rights are an integral part of the general principles of European Union law and that as such the European Court of Justice was bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states. Therefore, the European Court of Justice cannot uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states. The European Court of Justice also found that "international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the member states have collaborated or of which they are signatories, can supply guidelines which should be followed within the framework of Community law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kent| first = Penelope| title = Law of the European Union| publisher = Pearson Education| edition = 3rd| year = 2001| pages = 41–43 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6rYaL1Zaz3kC&amp;dq=general+principles+of+European+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-582-42367-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ====
None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights. It was not envisaged for European Union measures, that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions, to be subject to human rights. At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights, hence the establishment of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1950 and the establishment of the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. The [[European Court of Justice]] recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Giacomo| first = Di Federico| title = The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights: From Declaration to Binding Instrument| publisher = Springer| volume = Volume 8 of Ius Gentium Comparative Perspectives on Law and Justice| year = 2011| pages = 147 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZBAJwgzdWwEC&amp;dq=fundamental+rights+europe&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-94-007-0155-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the [[European Council]] set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions. The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] draws a list of fundamental rights from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the [[Declaration on Fundamental Rights]] produced by the [[European Parliament]] in 1989 and European Union Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Horspool| first = Margot| title = European Union law| publisher = Oxford University Press| series = Butterworths core text series| edition = 4th | year = 2006| pages = 132| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s1UqCRbQSVUC&amp;dq=european+convention+on+human+rights+%22european+union+law%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-19-928763-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2007 [[Lisbon Treaty]] explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in Article 6(1) that "The Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000, as adopted at Strasbourg on 12 December 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties." Therefore, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] has become an integral part of European Union law, codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of European Union law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Giacomo| first = Di Federico| title = The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights: From Declaration to Binding Instrument| publisher = Springer| volume = Volume 8 of Ius Gentium Comparative Perspectives on Law and Justice| year = 2011| pages = 38 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZBAJwgzdWwEC&amp;dq=fundamental+rights+europe&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-94-007-0155-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, after the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter and the convention now co-exist under European Union law, though the former is enforced by the European Court of Justice in relation to European Union measures, and the latter by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to measures by member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Giacomo| first = Di Federico| title = The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights: From Declaration to Binding Instrument| publisher = Springer| volume = Volume 8 of Ius Gentium Comparative Perspectives on Law and Justice| year = 2011| pages = 41–42 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZBAJwgzdWwEC&amp;dq=fundamental+rights+europe&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-94-007-0155-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal certainty ===
The concept of [[legal certainty]] is recognised one of the general principles of [[European Union law]] by the [[European Court of Justice]] since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| pages = 454 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important [[general principle of international law]] and [[public law]], which predates European Union law. As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, especially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kaczorowsky| first = Alina| title = European Union law | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 2008| pages = 232 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9atmZGmyJKoC&amp;dq=general+principle+of+community+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-415-44797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits [[Ex post facto law|retroactive laws]], i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties to know what the law is and comply with it. For example, in ''[[Opel Austria v Council]]'' [1997] ECR II-39 Case T-115/94 The European Court of Justice held that [[European Council]] Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The doctrine of [[legitimate expectation]], which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and [[good faith]], is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| pages = 455 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This means that a European Union institution, once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause the party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being ''[[Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij]]'' [1988] ECR 2321 Case 120/86.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The misuse of powers test is another significant element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that for which it was [[Principle of conferral|conferred]]. According to the misuse of power test a decision by a European Union institution is only a misuse of power if "it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been adopted with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving end other than those stated." A rare instance where the European Court of Justice has held that a European Union institution has misused its powers, and therefore violated the general principle of legal uncertainty, is ''[[Giuffrida v Commission]]'' [1976] ECR 1395 Case 105/75.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| pages = 456 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general principle of legal certainty is particularly stringently applied when European Union law imposes financial burdens on private parties.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Proportionality ===
The legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]] is recognised one of the general principles of [[European Union law]] by the [[European Court of Justice]] since the 1950s.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| pages = 448 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first recognised by the European Court of Justice in ''Federation Charbonniere de Belgique v High Authority'' [1954] ECR 245 Case C8/55&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kaczorowsky| first = Alina| title = European Union law | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 2008| pages = 102 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9atmZGmyJKoC&amp;dq=general+principle+of+community+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-415-44797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v Einfuhr- und Vorratsstelle Getreide]]'' [1970] ECR 1125 Case 11/70 the European Advocate General provided an early formulation of the general principle of proportionality in stating that "the individual should not have his freedom of action limited beyond the degree necessary in the public interest". The general concept of proportionality has since been further developed, notably in ''[[R v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ex parte Fedesa]]'' [1990] ECR 1–4023 Case C-331/88 in which a European directive prohibiting the use of certain hormonal substances in livestock farming was challenged. In its ruling the European Court of Justice held that by virtue of the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of the Directive depended on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued by the law in question. When there was a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted, and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The principle of proportionality is also recognised in Article 5 of the [[EC Treaty]], stating that "any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty".&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Prof Grainne de Burca has therefore argued{{cn|date=November 2017}} that the general principle in European Union law of proportionality entails a three-part test: 1) is the measure suitable to achieve a legitimate aim, 2) is the measure necessary to achieve that aim or are less restrictive means available, and 3) does the measure have an excessive effect on the applicant's interests. The general principle of proportionality therefore requires that a measure is both appropriate and necessary, and as such the European Court of Justice to review both the legality of a measure, but also to some extent the merit of legislative and administrative measures. Therefore, the general principle of European Union law of proportionality is often considered as the most far-reaching ground of [[judicial review]] and of particular importance in [[public law]] cases. However, because the proportionality concept potentially concerns the merits of a measure, European judges may defer to the choice of the authority which has adopted the measure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| pages = 449 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or make what are frequently political decisions. In ''[[Fedesa]]'' the European Court of Justice explained that "it must be states that in matters concerning the common agricultural policy the Community legislature has the discretionary power which corresponds to the political responsibilities given to it by... the Treaty. Consequently,  the legality of a measure adopted in that sphere can be affected only if the measure is manifestly inappropriate having regard to the objective which the competent institution is seeking to pursue...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| pages = 450 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly referred to as the "Guardianship Convention", the '''Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors,''' along with the other Conventions in 1902, was the Hague Conference's first effort at addressing international family law.  Within a few decades it was the only family law Convention to retain any currency.  It was also the only family law treaty that was expressly preserved and revived in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and other post [[World War I]] peace treaties.  The Guardianship Convention was written only in [[French language|French]] and, with the [[Boll case]], is the only Convention of the Hague Conference to ever be the principal subject of interpretation before a court with worldwide jurisdiction.

==Parties==
As of 2016, seven states are party to the convention: Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Six others: France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland have denounced the convention.

== Other Conventions of 1902 ==
*Convention of 12 June 1902 relating to the settlement of the conflict of the laws concerning marriage
*Convention of 12 June 1902 relating to the settlement of the conflict of laws and jurisdictions as regards to divorce and separation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3173">The '''International Dairy Agreement''' (IDA) replaced the International Dairy Arrangement, which had been established in 1980.  Its primary function was to expand and liberalize world trade in dairy products through international cooperation. The agreement terminated in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTO {{!}} legal texts - Marrakesh Agreement|url=https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/ida-94_01_e.htm|website=www.wto.org|publisher=World Trade Organisation|accessdate=17 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''Arrangement concerning certain Dairy Products'' ([[Geneva]], 12 January 1970),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1970/8.html “Arrangement concerning certain Dairy Products . ATS 8 of 1970”]. Australasian  Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; a treaty entered into by a number of nations, was established initially to set a minimum price of [[Powdered milk|skimmed milk powder]] to $20 per 100 kilograms.  The intention was to expand the arrangement to other dairy products.  It also established a management committee within the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] framework to oversee the arrangement.  Three years later, a ''Protocol relating to Milk Fat'' (Geneva, 2 April 1973) was agreed to, extending the skimmed milk powder controls to other internationally transportable milk products, such as [[Ghee]], anhydrous milk fat, anhydrous butteroil and anhydrous butterfat, butteroil and butterfat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1973/15.html "Protocol relating to Milk Fat. ATS 15 of 1973)”]. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 1, 1995, the IDA was placed under the aegis of the [[World Trade Organization]].  Its members included Argentina, Bulgaria, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Switzerland, and Uruguay.  The United States, which had been one of the original members, withdrew from the organization in 1985 to protest sales by the European Union of butter and other basic dairy products at prices below the minimum export prices established by the [[Committee on Certain Milk Products]] that, along with the [[International Dairy Council]], administered the Arrangement.  The International Dairy Council suspended minimum prices for dairy products in 1995.

The IDA was terminated, by decision of the International Dairy Council, as of January 1, 1998.

The '''International Safety Management''' ('''ISM''') '''Code''' provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships at sea.

==The purpose of the ISM Code==

* To ensure safety at sea and prevent damage to property, personnel and environment.

In order to comply with the ISM Code, Company operating the vessel has to be Audited first( after they submit their Safety Management System Manual and is approved by Flag Administration or Recognized Organization(RO)). Once Company is Audited,Document of Compliance (DOC) will be issued (validity 5 years). Company is subject to auditing every year(three months before and after anniversary date and before DOC expiration date).
Upon issuing DOC to Company (or Managing Company) each vessel can be audited to verify vessel compliance with ISM Code. Each vessel will be issued SMS( Safety Management Certificate)valid for 5 years and subject to verification of Compliance with ISM Code between second and third years of certificate validity.

Safety Management System Manual consists of the following elements:

* Commitment from top management
* A top tier policy manual
* A procedures manual that documents what is done on board the ship, during normal operations and in emergency situations
* Procedures for conducting both internal and external audits to ensure the ship is doing what is documented in the procedures manual
* A designated person ashore to serve as the link between the ships and shore staff and to verify the SMS implementation
* A system for identifying where actual practices do not meet those that are documented and for implementing associated corrective action
* Regular management reviews

Also, the ship must be maintained in conformity with the provisions of relevant rules and regulations and with any additional requirements which may be established by the company.
Comments from the auditor and/or audit body and from the ship are incorporated into the SMS by headquarters.

The requirements of the ISM Code may be applied to all commercial ships over 500 GT. The ISM Code is a chapter in SOLAS. If SOLAS does not apply then ISM is not mandatory. Compliance with ISM Code is sometimes required by vessel client regardless of Gross Tonnage ( GT).

The ISM Code was created by the IMO and Ferriby Marine's Capt. Graham Botterill, Specialist Advisor to the House of Lords in the UK on ship safety, among others.

==History of the development of the ISM Code==

{{main|Herald of Free Enterprise disaster}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
On the evening of March 6, 1987, the cross-channel Ro-Ro ferry ''[[MS Herald of Free Enterprise|Herald of Free Enterprise]]'', carrying more than 450 passengers, around 80 crew, more than 80 cars, and close to 50 freight vehicles, left the Belgian port of Zeebrugge for the English port of Dover. Soon after the ''Herald of Free Enterprise'' passed Zeebrugge's breakwater, water flooded into the ferry's lower car deck and destabilized it, causing it to sink in a matter of minutes. 193 lives were lost.

The immediate cause of the accident was that the bow door remained wide open, allowing a great inrush of water as the vessel increased speed, while the fatigued assistant boatswain directly responsible for closing it lay asleep in his cabin. The public inquiry led by Justice Sheen revealed that the assistant boatswain's negligence was simply the last in a long string of actions that laid the groundwork for a major accident. The Sheen Report did not stop at identifying the shortcomings of the ship's master and his crew. The inquiry revealed that the shore management, Townsend Car Ferries Ltd., was just as blameworthy. Numerous memos written by Townsend ship's masters pointing out the need to implement safety-enhancing measures or address serious deficiencies on board their vessels went unheeded (Rasmussen and Svedung, 2000). The report summed up the management's cavalier attitude towards safety in the following statement: 'From top to bottom the body corporate was infected with the disease of sloppiness' (Sheen, 1987).

The ''Herald of Free Enterprise'' was a modern ferry equipped with advanced technology and manned by a highly qualified crew. Only seven years prior to the accident, it was built in a German shipyard according to international maritime safety regulations. Why did it capsize? The general frustration in the shipping industry following the capsizing of the ''Herald of Free Enterprise'' is typical of the kind of accident that precipitated in a paradigm shift in maritime safety administration and the development of the ISM Code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5412">'''Katarism''' ({{lang-es|Katarismo}}) is a political tendency in [[Bolivia]], named after the 18th-century indigenous leader [[Túpac Katari]]. The katarista movement began in the early 1970s, recovering a political identity of the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] people. The movement was centered on two key understandings, that the colonial legacy continued in the Latin American republics after independence and that the indigenous population constituted the demographic (and thus essentially, the political) majority in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="p14"/&gt; Katarismo stresses that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of Bolivia suffer both from class oppression (in the Marxist, economic sense) and ethnic oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjinés, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The agrarian reform of 1953 had enabled a group of Aymara youth to begin university studies in [[La Paz]] in the 1960s. In the city, this group faced prejudices, and katarista thoughts began to emerge among the students. The movement was inspired by the rhetoric of the national revolution as well as by [[Fausto Reinaga]], writer and founder of the Indian Party of Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjinés, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The group formed the Julian Apansa University Movement (MUJA), which organized around cultural demands, including bilingual education. Its most prominent leader was [[Jenaro Flores Santos]] (who in 1965 returned to the countryside to lead peasants). Another prominent figure was Raimundo Tambo.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, pp. 390-391&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1971 Sixth National Peasant Congress, the congress of the National Peasants Confederation, the kataristas emerged as a major faction against the pro-government forces.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; The 1973 Tolata massacre (in which at least 13 [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peasants were killed) radicalized the katarista movement.&lt;ref&gt;Van Cott, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Following the massacre, the kataristas issued the 1973 Tiwanaku Manifesto, which viewed Quechua people as economically exploited and culturally and politically oppressed. In this vision, peasant class consciousness and Aymara and Quechua ethnic consciousness were complementary because capitalism and colonialism were the root of exploitation.

Katarismo made its political breakthrough in the late 1970s through the leading role kataristas played in [[CSUTCB]]. The kataristas pushed the CSUTCB to become more indigenized. Eventually, the kataristas split into two groups. The first, a more reformist strain, was led by Victor Hugo Cardenas, who later served as vice president under Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, heading efforts to institutionalize a neoliberal, state-led multiculturalism. A second strain articulated a path of Aymara nationalism. A political wing of the movement, the [[Tupaj Katari Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTK) was launched.&lt;ref name="p14"&gt;Sanjinés, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; This radical stream of katarismo has been represented by [[Felipe Quispe]] (aka El Mallku), who took part in founding the [[Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjinés, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; This group later became the MIP (Indigenous Movement Pachakuti), which became outspoken critics of the neoliberal Washington Consensus and which coalesced around ethnic-based solidarity. Quispe advocated the creation of a new sovereign country, the Republic of Quillasuyo, named after one of the four regions of the old empire where the Incas conquered the Aymaras. Current Vice President of Bolivia Alvaro Garcia Linera was a member of this group.

Katarista organizations were weakened during the 1980s. In this context [[NGO]]s began to appropriate katarista symbols. Populist parties, such as [[CONDEPA]], also began to integrate katarista symbols in their discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Van Cott, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (MNR) had incorporated katarista themes in its 1993 election campaign, other mainstream parties followed suit (most notably the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Van Cott, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

She is licensed and has permission to practice in Afghanistan, Wisconsin, the U.S. Supreme Court, [[Dubai|Dubai International Financial Courts]], and the International Criminal Courts.  She is considered one of the most effective defense attorneys operating in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web| title =How Can The Rule Of Law Bring "Justness" And Not Just Justice?| work =NPR| date =Dec 12, 2014| url =https://www.npr.org/2014/12/12/368759957/how-can-the-rule-of-law-bring-justness-and-not-just-justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the male-dominated Afghan court and prison system, wrote Tom Freston in ''Vanity Fair'', Motley "must appear to be someone from outer space. She acknowledges this but declares that she gets respect… She has proven to be a very effective and tenacious fighter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.caaspeakers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/04/MotleyK_Meet-Kim_Vanity-Fair.pdf|title = |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motley has been described as possessing "a rare kind of grit—the kind necessary to hang a shingle in Kabul, represent the under-represented, weather a kaleidoscope of threats, and win the respect of the Afghan legal establishment (and of tribal leaders)."&lt;ref name=ted&gt;{{cite web| title =Kimberely Motley| work =TED| url =https://www.ted.com/speakers/kimberley_motley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Rosenstock, an attorney who has worked in Kabul since 2008, told ''The Daily Beast'' in 2010 that Motley may be doing more "to promote [[rule of law]] than large ambitious programs which never get to where the rubber meets the road." A Western diplomat in Afghanistan called Motley "the kind of person who makes you change [your] opinion about lawyers."&lt;ref name=goto&gt;{{cite web| last =Jordan| first =Elise| title =A Beauty Queen Takes Kabul| work =The Daily Beast| date =Sep 17, 2010| url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/09/17/kim-motley-the-go-to-lawyer-in-kabul.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Motley was named by [[Richard Branson]] as one of the most inspirational people and described her as "an inspiring litigator with a powerful message: "The laws are ours – no matter your ethnicity, nationality, gender, race – they belong to us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 14 most inspirational people of 2014 - Virgin.com|url = http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/14-most-inspirational-people-of-2014|website = Virgin.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Motley's father is [[African-American]] and her mother is from rural [[North Korea]]. Her parents met when her father was in the military. Motley was raised in a "hard" neighborhood in [[Milwaukee]]. Her parents were "very nurturing, but outside the home, my environment was hard, harsh, even though we were very close as a family. There was a lot of crime, a lot of poverty, a lot of distrust of each other. A lot of people where I grew up felt invisible to the world. I have two brothers and a sister, and I can think of no other family, for instance, who lived in a two-parent household." She began working at a very early age. Every summer during her early childhood, Motley and her siblings were taken to a farm where they had to "plant turnips and pick green beans and strawberries" which would be frozen for the family to eat during the winter. Motley and her brother also had a newspaper route. In addition, she worked at an ice cream shop at age 13, and "at a juvenile-detention center, grocery stores, youth centers."&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite web| last =McClelland| first =Susan| title =From Beauty Queen to War-Zone Lawyer| work =The Daily Beast| date =Jun 10, 2013| url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/06/08/kimberley-motley-on-practicing-criminal-and-human-rights-law-in-kabul.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was interested in law from an early age. Although her parents ordinarily would not let her watch television, she had a teacher who told the class to watch ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''. "I loved it so much that for three years, I kept telling my parents, my teacher needs me to watch ''Law &amp; Order''." At one point, her father was injured in a car accident and was laid off as a result. "He wanted disability and had to spend years and go through so many lawyers to end up being not successful," she recalled. This spurred her interest in the law, as did the spectacle of "so many people in my neighborhood go[ing] in and out of jail." She has said that in fact "I wanted to be a doctor and a DJ. But law picked me."&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

Motley received an Associate of Arts and Sciences (A.A.S.) degree from [[Milwaukee Area Technical College]] in 1997. She received a B.A. from the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Milwaukee]] in 2000, and in 2003 received an M.A. from the same institution. In the same year, she earned a J.D. from [[Marquette University]] Law School.&lt;ref name=link&gt;{{cite web| title =Kimberely Motley| work =Linkedin| url =https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kimberley-motley-esq/24/bb8/101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motley was crowned [[Miss Wisconsin]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

==Career==
In 2008, after working as a public defender in Milwaukee for five years, Motley went to Afghanistan as part of a nine-month legal education program run by the [[U.S. State Department]] to train Afghan lawyers.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; She had never traveled outside the U.S. before.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; "In that nine months," she later recalled in a 2014 [[TED talk]], "I went around the country and I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up, and I talked to many businesses that were also operating in Afghanistan. And within these conversations, I started hearing the connections between the businesses and the people, and how laws that were meant to protect them were being underused, while gross and illegal punitive measures were overused. And so this put me on a quest for justness, and what justness means to me is using laws for their intended purpose, which is to protect. The role of laws is to protect. So as a result, I decided to open up a private practice, and I became the first foreigner to litigate in Afghan courts."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

At first she represented Westerners and other non-Afghans stranded in Afghan prisons.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; "What I found," she later recalled, "is that most did not have proper legal representation. If they were English-speaking, they had no idea what was going on in court. I felt and still feel a great responsibility for them as a person and as a lawyer."&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

Motley's first defendant was "an African woman convicted of drug trafficking. She was a drug mule sent to Afghanistan by a European pimp....She had been in prison for two years with her then-3-year-old daughter. She was convicted of 14 years in prison, so her child would have grown up in jail. She had gone through almost all of her legal options. I felt very helpless, and I do believe her case helped define and shape who I am. She was not afforded her [[due process]] under Afghan law. She and her child were tucked away in an Afghan prison, forgotten." Eventually Motley was able to secure a presidential decree ordering the woman's release.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

Since 2009, Motley has been the CEO of Motley Consulting International, of which she is a Founding Partner. Since the same year she has also been CEO of Motley Legal Services, which provides legal representation in the U.S. and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=link/&gt; She spends approximately six months in a fortified house in Kabul, where she provides representation for criminal and human-rights cases in the nation.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; She is preoccupied with the task of growing the capacity of rule of law internationally.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; She is registered as an attorney with the American, French, U.A.E., Australian, Spanish, Dutch, [[UK|British]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Germany|German]], and [[Canada|Canadian]] Embassies in Afghanistan, and is thus routinely contacted by expatriates who are facing legal troubles with Afghan authorities.&lt;ref name=goto/&gt;

"Motley works for the release of foreigners languishing in Afghan jails," reported ''The Daily Beast'' in 2010, "and often her work starts after the verdict—as in the case of an [[Australia]]n on death row, convicted of murdering an Afghan colleague; a [[South Africa]]n sentenced to fifteen years in prison on drug charges, and a Brit convicted of fraud." For example, "she negotiated the release of Bill Shaw, a former British military officer, who had been held in the notorious Pul-e-charki prison for five months."

She "has developed her own approach to operating in the Afghan courts," reported ''The Daily Beast''. For example, "she never wears a veil or a dress" during a trial. She explained, "I need to look like a man as much as possible...I find that men hear me more when I don’t wear a headscarf. I wore it at first, and when I took it off, I found men were more respectful."&lt;ref name=goto/&gt;

As of 2010, Motley was under a threat from the Afghan District Attorney's office to arrest her next time she set foot in Kabul, as retribution for her harsh criticism of Afghanistan's corrupt judicial system. She had no hesitation about returning. "I have clients back there," she said. "They need my help." She also noted that she received rape threats. "If I was a man, I’d get more death threats, I suppose. But I get those as well."&lt;ref name=goto/&gt; She has also "been temporarily detained" and "accused of running a brothel" and of espionage. A grenade was thrown at her office. But she has said that the rewards of her job "far outweigh the risks, and as many risks as I take, my clients take far greater risks, because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard, or worse, if they're penalized for having me as their lawyer. With every case that I take, I realize that as much as I'm standing behind my clients, that they're also standing behind me, and that's what keeps me going."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

On June 21, 2014, Motley's husband, Claudiare Motley, was shot in Milwaukee after attending a high school reunion due to an attempted carjacking committed by Nathan King a sixteen year old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Give crime victims a greater voice|url = http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/give-crime-victims-a-greater-voice-b99376107z1-280251422.html|website = www.jsonline.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teen who was shot, paralyzed by robbery target gets prison|url = http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/teen-who-was-shot-paralyzed-by-robbery-target-gets-prison-b99539268z1-315879111.html|website = www.jsonline.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually King was shot while attempting another robbery and became paralyzed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teen accused of shooting carjacking victim gets shot by another would-be victim the following day (VIDEO)|url = http://www.guns.com/2014/07/14/teen-accused-of-shooting-carjacking-victim-gets-shot-by-another-would-be-victim-the-following-day-video/|website = Guns.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28|first = Jennifer|last = Cruz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motley represented Claudiare and Victoria Davison, the woman who shot King, in Court.  On July 16, 2015, King  was found guilty of the two counts of Attempted Armed Robbery against Motley and Davison and ultimately received twelve years in prison and eight years extended supervision prison sentence.&lt;sup&gt;[9][10][11]&lt;/sup&gt;

On December 16, 2016, Motley went to Havana, Cuba to represent [[Danilo Machado]].  While in Havana Motley was arrested without charge and subsequently deported from Cuba.  Motley was instrumental to the release of Machado on January 21, 2017, who was released from El Combinado del Este prison without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.local10.com/news/cuba/artist-el-sexto-walks-out-of-prison-in-cuba-efe-reports|title=Artist 'El Sexto' walks out of prison in Cuba|last=Morejon|first=Andrea Torres, Liane|date=2017-01-21|newspaper=WPLG|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
In addition to practicing law, Motley teaches spinning classes at the U.S. military base while in Kabul. "I respect the military," she has said.&lt;ref name="beast" /&gt;

In December 2014, she gave a TED talk entitled "How can we all find ways to be courageous?" She described cases she has handled which illustrate "how a country's own laws can bring both justice and 'justness.'"&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; She also gave a talk at the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Kimberely Motley| work =Oslo Freedom Forum| url =https://oslofreedomforum.com/speakers/kimberley-motley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comments by Motley==
In her TED talk, Motley is noted as saying that "the reason for my success is very simple: I work the system from the inside out and use the laws in the ways that they're intended to be used." Motley also popularized the term "Justness" which she defines as using the laws for their intended purpose which is to protect. She just recently is working on the Justness Project which is a global campaign to "put laws back in the hands of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Justness Project|url = https://www.facebook.com/JustnessProject/?fref=ts|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also stated that there are three reasons why "achieving justness in places like Afghanistan is difficult." First, "people are very uneducated as to what their legal rights [are], and I find that this is a global problem. The second issue is that even with laws on the books, it's often superseded or ignored by tribal customs...And the third problem with achieving justness is that even with good, existing laws on the books, there aren't people or lawyers that are willing to fight for those laws. And that's what I do: I use existing laws, often unused laws, and I work those to the benefits of my clients. We all need to create a global culture of human rights and be investors in a global human rights economy, and by working in this mindset, we can significantly improve justice globally."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

Motley also has talked about Building A Global Human Rights Economy.&lt;ref name="zeitgeistminds.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">In [[law]], '''knowledge''' is one of the degrees of ''[[mens rea]]'' that constitute part of a [[crime]]. For example, in [[English law]], the offense of knowingly being a passenger in a vehicle taken without consent ([[TWOC]]) requires that the prosecution [[Legal burden of proof|prove]], not only that the defendant was a passenger in a vehicle and that it was taken by the driver without consent, the prosecution must also prove that the defendant knew that it was taken without consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theft Act 1968]], s.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principle of ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]'', ignorance of or mistake about the law is no defence. The ''mens rea'' of knowledge refers to knowledge about certain facts. It is "a positive belief that a state of affairs exists."&lt;ref&gt;Herring (2004) ''p.''170&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge can be actual, constructive, or imputed.

==Actual knowledge==
A defendant does not have '''actual knowledge''' if he believes something to the contrary. The standard is subjective and the belief of the defendant need not be [[reasonable person|reasonable]], only [[dishonesty|honest]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Herring (2004) ''p.''171&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[R v Williams (Gladstone)|R v. Williams]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 3 All ER 411, CA (England)&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant intervened in what he thought was a [[robbery|mugging]] but was in fact a [[citizen's arrest]]. His mistake was upheld as a defense against a charge of [[assault]]. In ''[[Beckford v R|Beckford v. R]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 3 All ER 425, (UK Privy Council)&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant was a [[police officer]] who shot and killed V. Beckford claimed that he believed that V was shooting at him. It was found that the correct test was whether D "honestly believed" facts which, if true, would establish a defense. The reasonableness of the belief would be [[evidence (law)|evidential]] in finding whether it was truly believed.

==Constructive knowledge==
Knowledge is also found where a defendant suspects that circumstances exist and "deliberately decides not to make any further enquiries" in case his suspicions prove well founded.&lt;ref name="H1"/&gt; A common example is a person who purchases significantly inexpensive and un[[provenance]]d, but desirable items from a stranger. Such a person is likely to be fixed with '''constructive knowledge''' that the items were [[theft|stolen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anderton v. Ryan'' [1985] AC 560, HL (England)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imputed knowledge==
This is relevant in [[strict liability]] offences and in [[corporate crime]]. For example, if a bar manager delegates his duties to others and those others know of unlawful activities on the premises, the manager can be fixed with '''imputed knowledge''' of the unlawful activities.&lt;ref&gt;''Ferguson v. Weaving'' [1951] 1 All ER 412 (England)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8074">The '''Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard''' is a set of file format specifications intended to facilitate electronic data transmission in the legal industry.  The phrase is abbreviated '''LEDES''' and is usually pronounced as "leeds".  The LEDES specifications are maintained by the LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC), which was formed by the Law Firm and Law Department Services Group within [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. Members of the committee have included law firms, corporate legal departments, universities, and software vendors.  The LOC was first informally created in 1995 to address e-billing issues and then incorporated as a California [[mutual-benefit nonprofit corporation]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jarman |first=Roger |date=Dec 2008 |title=Compliant Legal E-Billing: A Global Perspective | work=E-Billing White Paper and Survey Results |publisher=International Legal Technology Association |publication-place=Austin, TX |pages=3-4 |url=http://connect.iltanet.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=12ea8501-27c9-4920-94d8-3b7c0b22c099&amp;forceDialog=0 |accessdate=27 Feb 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LOC currently maintains four sets of data elements and four data exchange format types.  The four sets of data elements are: activity codes; expense codes; timekeeper classification codes; and [[Uniform Task-Based Management System]] codes.  The four data exchange format types are: [[electronic billing]] (e-billing); budgeting; timekeeper attributes; and intellectual property matter management.

==Electronic billing formats==
The electronic billing data exchange format types provide a standard data format for electronically transmitted invoices, typically from a [[law firm]] to a [[corporation|corporate]] client. The LEDES e-billing format currently has the following variations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wirtz | first = Scott | date = 1 Sep 2006 | title = Electronic Legal Invoice Delivery | magazine = Metropolitan Corporate Counsel | publisher = Metropolitan Corporate Counsel | publication-place = Mountainside, NJ | page = 22 | url = http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/articles/7198/electronic-legal-invoice-delivery | accessdate = 26 Feb 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''LEDES 1998''', the first "LEDES" format, created in 1998, but no longer in use.
* '''LEDES 1998B''', a pipe-delimited plain text file. The standard was adopted in 1998, and it is by far the more commonly used LEDES format. It lacks some flexibility, having a rigid structure. Another disadvantage of LEDES 1998B is that invoice-level data is repeated on every line item even though it is only needed once, as it does not vary per line. Many clients attempt to impose nonstandard customizations, thus defeating the purpose of having a standard.  Nonetheless, law firms prefer it for its simplicity and familiarity.
* '''LEDES XML2000''', adopted in 2000, is an [[Extensible markup language|XML]] format. Adoption was slow, but is now fairly widespread. One advantage of LEDES 2000 is that although the structure is well defined, the specification defines "extend" segments, allowing the insertion of client-specific fields without breaking the format or violating the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hodge |first=Jeff |date=March 2005 |title=LEDES on Steroids: 2K Is Coming! | work=Finance: Accounting in the Electronic Age |publisher=International Legal Technology Association |publication-place=Austin, TX |pages=15-16 |url=http://connect.iltanet.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=98c3a4c0-bad0-462d-b619-1e5932afa698&amp;forceDialog=0&amp;ssopc=1 |accessdate=27 Feb 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''LEDES 1998BI''' (international), a pipe-delimited plain text file, based on the LEDES 1998B standard.  This format was designed to accommodate legal bills generated outside of the United States.  It includes all of the fields in the LEDES 1998B format, plus additional ones. The format was proposed in 2004 by the Legal IT Innovators Group (LITIG).  The LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC) ratified the format in 2006.
*'''LEDES XML2.0''', ratified in 2006 and addresses international needs in XML format. Contains 15 segments and 153 data elements.
*'''LEDES XML2.1''', ratified in 2008. Contains 16 segments and 191 data elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bennitt |first=Jane A. |date=March 2012 |title=Global E-Billing and the LEDES Oversight Committee | work=Peer to Peer |publisher=International Legal Technology Association |publication-place=Austin, TX |pages=96-98 |url=http://connect.iltanet.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=280da4fb-7783-413e-8e55-a8dfb86df172&amp;forceDialog=0&amp;ssopc=1 |accessdate=27 Feb 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other data exchange formats==
The other LEDES data exchange formats are as follows:
*'''LEDES Budget''' was ratified in 2006.  This XML format facilitates the exchange of budget data between law firms and clients.
*'''LEDES Timekeeper Attribute''' was ratified in 2007 and revised in 2014. This XML format used to transmit timekeeper and rate data to from law firms to clients.
*'''IPMM Invention Disclosure Standard''' was ratified in 2015. This is a set of [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML schemas]] that can validate an XML document containing [[invention disclosure]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Plonsker | editor-first = Larry | date = December 2014 | title = Invention Disclosures—A Standard Is Needed | work = LES Global News | volume = XLIX | issue = 4 | publisher = Licensing Executives Society International | publication-place = Wellington, FL | pages = 7-8 | issn = 0270-174X | url = https://www.lesi.org/docs/default-source/les-news/lesglobalnews_12_14.pdf?sfvrsn=2#page=7&amp;zoom=auto,-202,417 | accessdate = 26 Feb 2016 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sikand |first=Sunjeev |date=17 Apr 2015 |title=Merits Of An XML-Based Invention Disclosure Standard | work=Law360 |publisher=Portfolio Media |publication-place=New York, NY |page= |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/640012/merits-of-an-xml-based-invention-disclosure-standard |accessdate=28 Mar 2016 | quote=In 2014, the Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard (LEDES) Intellectual Property Matter Management (IPMM) subcommittee proposed an extensible markup language (XML) invention disclosure standard.

This is a list of [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]].  It lists the Acts of Parliament of the old Parliament of [[Scotland]], that was merged with the old [[Parliament of England]] to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], by the [[Union with England Act]] 1707.

The numbers after the titles of the Acts are the chapter numbers. Acts are referenced using 'Year of reign', 'Monarch', c., 'Chapter number' — e.g. 16 Charles II c. 2 — to define a chapter of the appropriate [[statute book]]. Chapter numbers given in the duodecimo edition, where applicable, are given in square brackets.

This list is only a partial catalogue of Acts that remained on the statute books even after the Union of 1707. For a largely comprehensive edition of Scottish Acts of Parliament see ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', ed. Thomas Thomson. A new edition has been edited by the Scottish Parliament Project at the [[University of St Andrews]] and is available online as the [[Records of the Parliaments of Scotland]].

For the period after 1707, see [[list of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain]].

The following is a '''list of California ballot propositions''' broken down by decade.  Propositions can be placed on the ballot either through the [[initiative]] process or by a vote of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]]. Propositions were added to the California constitution as part of the ethics reform instituted by Governor [[Hiram Johnson]] in the early 1910s.

==History==
{{main|California ballot proposition}}
Ballot measures were not numbered prior to the general election of 1914.&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/history-initiatives-info.htm |title=History of California Initiatives |accessdate=October 4, 2014 |publisher=California Secretary of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the November 1982 general election, proposition numbers started with "1" for each election.  After November 1982, subsequent propositions received sequentially increasing numbers until November 1998 when the count was reset to "1".  Starting with November 1998, the count is reset in 10-year cycles.

Until 1960, citizen-led initiative measures appeared on general election ballots only. From 1960 to 2012, initiative measures appeared on primary, general, and special election ballots.&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; In October 2011, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed into law a bill which requires all future ballot initiatives to be listed only in general elections (held in November in even-numbered years), rather than during any statewide election. Two propositions had already qualified for the next statewide election (which was the June 2012 presidential primaries) prior to the signing of the law, making the June 2012 primaries the last statewide non-general election in California to have statewide initiatives on the ballot.  Propositions originating in the [[California State Legislature|State Legislature]] can still appear on non-general election ballots, as was the case with Propositions 41 and 42 in [[California elections, 2014|June 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/10/08/3968832/gov-jerry-brown-signs-bill-restricting.html|title=Gov.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3847">{{Apartheid legislation in South Africa}}
The '''Mines and Work Act''' was a piece of legislation in [[South Africa]], originally passed in 1911 and amended in 1912 and 1926 before undergoing further changes in 1956 and 1959. This act legally established South Africa's employment "colour bar." and was enacted to establish the duties and responsibilities  of workers in Mines and Works in South Africa.

==Colour Bar Act Reference==
This act (with/without/or its amendments) is sometimes referred to as the COLOUR BAR or the COLOUR BAR ACT. The term colour bar, however, usually refers to a group of labor practices, informal trade union practices, government regulations, and legislation, all of which were developed over time to prevent blacks from competing for certain categories of jobs monopolized by whites.

==Original 1911 Act==
At any rate, this act included various regulations which gave "white workers a monopoly of skilled operations". However, The Act did not specify that blacks should be discriminated against in any way. Indeed, it made no mention of race or colour. Nor did it specifically and clearly give the government Mining Engineer powers to introduce a legal colour bar. But under section 4(n) it gave the Governor-General powers to grant, cancel and suspend certificates of competency to mine managers, mine overseers, mine surveyors, mechanical engineers, engine-drivers and miners entitled to blast. It also gave him the power to decide which other occupations should be required to possess certificates of competency.

==MINES &amp; WORKS REGULATIONS ACT of 1912==
Some or other commission had criticized mine managements for employing large numbers of unskilled whites 'often entirely ignorant of mining, and whose principal and often only recommendation is their physical fitness and their suitability for rough work'. Yet when the commission reported in 1910, it submitted draft regulations that were heavy with colour bars. Some appeared in the interpretation of terms, as when the words 'white person' were inserted in the definition of banksman, onsetter, ganger and mine manager. Some took the form of an injunction to employ only whites in specified occupations, such as blasting, running elevators, driving engines, supervising boilers and other machinery; or as shift boss and mine overseer. Furthermore, only whites would be allowed to obtain the certificates of competence required, for instance, by engine drivers and boiler attendants. With some modifications, these draft regulations served as model for the MINES &amp; WORKS REGULATIONS ACT of 1912.

==MINES &amp; WORKS AMENDMENT ACT of 1926==
In contrast to the 1912 REGULATIONS, this Act bracketed Coloured with whites in a position of privilege. For there was no question of segregating the coloured who spoke the Afrikaner's language, shared his outlook and stood closer to one than to the black population. Furthermore, the key section of this act "stated that the minister, before announcing regulations for issuing certificates of competency (including the key blasting certificate, for nearly a century of license of the white miner), should seek the advice of the owners and of the organizations whose members hold a majority of the certificates, that is, the white unions, including the Mine Worker's Union. He was to do this through the formation of advisory committees". This act was further revised in 1956 to deal with the declaration of work in the national interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3329">The term '''older prisoners''' is used by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and/or state departments for corrections when referring to individuals that are 50 years of age and older. Conventionally, individuals are not usually classified as having reached [[old age]] until they reach the age of 65, but [[correctional facilities]] recognize individuals age 50 and above as older because of the few prisoners age 65 and above.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Older prisoners arguably age faster than their cohorts on the outside of the institution as a direct result of chronic, long-term diseases and a history more accustomed to drug and alcohol abuse. 8.6 percent of the total U.S. prison population is age 50 or older, and the average age for those considered to be older prisoners is 57.&lt;ref&gt;Hooyman, Nancy R. and H. Asuman Kiyak (2011). ''Social Gerontology: A Multidisciplinary Perspective'', ed. 9, p 481. Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|9780205763139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With both [[incarceration rate]]s and the nation's population higher than ever and stricter sentences being prescribed to perpetrators, the number of older prisoners is on the rise.  The demographics, particularly race, of older prisoners resemble those of their younger peers, being that African Americans are disproportionately represented in making up nearly five and a half times of the prison population than their white counterparts make up.&lt;ref&gt;Aday, R.H. (2006). Aging Prisoners. B. Berkman and S. D'Ambruoso (eds.). ''Handbook of Social Work in Health and Aging.'' Oxford Press. {{ISBN|9780195173727}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, P.M. and A.J. Beck (2006). Prisoners in 2005. ''Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin.'' NCJ 215092, 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, S.J. and A. AbuDagga (2006). Health-Related Research on Older Inmates. ''Research in Nursing and Health'', 29, 556-665.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly contracted diseases during incarceration share similar diagnoses to those [[Diseases of affluence|outside of the institutions]]; however, the rate at which they afflict older prisoners is escalated significantly - 25% compared to their free cohorts not confined to prison environments.&lt;ref&gt;Hooyman, Nancy R. and H. Asuman Kiyak (2011). ''Social Gerontology: A Multidisciplinary Perspective'', ed. 9, p 481. Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|9780205763139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychiatric conditions are claimed to be detrimental to older prisoners where, specifically, rates of depression are higher and tend to have a lifelong lasting effect in a large percentage of older prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, S.J. and A. AbuDagga (2006). Health-Related Research on Older Inmates. ''Research in Nursing and Health'', 29, 556-665.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitka, M (2004). Aging Prisoners Stressing Health Care System.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9486">In law, '''perfection''' relates to the additional steps required to be taken in relation to a [[security interest]] in order to make it effective against third parties&lt;ref&gt;See generally "Perfection of security interest," Black's Law Dictionary, pp. 1023-1023 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or to retain its effectiveness in the event of default by the grantor of the security interest.  Generally speaking, once a security interest is effectively created, it gives certain rights to the holder of the security and imposes duties on the party who grants that security.&lt;ref&gt;''Mace Builders v Lunn'' [1987] Ch 191&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in many legal systems, additional steps --- perfection of the security interest --- are required to enforce the security against third parties such as a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, section 395 of the Companies Act 1986 of the United Kingdom requires certain security interests to be filed at [[Companies House]] within 21 days of being created.  A failure to make such a filing does not affect the validity of the security interest between the debtor and the secured party, but if the debtor goes into insolvent liquidation, the security interest is [[void (law)|void]] against the liquidator.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

As a legal concept, perfection must be distinguished from:
*the ''grant'' or ''creation'' of the security interest, which creates its primary validity;
*''attachment'', which are steps that link the security interest to the underlying asset; and,
*''priority'', which is an ordering of competing security interests in same asset.

The same rule --- the [[common law]] [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']], for instance --- may govern both perfection against third parties (e.g., subsequent security holders) and prioritization of competing security interests.

In most legal systems, the need for perfection arises only in relation to security interests that are proprietary in nature (such as a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[equitable charge]]).  Other arrangements which constitute security in the loose sense of the word --- for instance, [[retention of title clause|title retention arrangements]], [[hire purchase]], and [[lease|leasing transactions]] --- need not in general be perfected in the legal sense.

In India, Section 125 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that certain charges shall be void against liquidator or creditors unless registered. Thus,if a charge is not registered with Registrar of Companies, and company happens to go for liquidation, even secured creditor shall be treated as unsecured.

==Types of perfection==

There are three principal modes by which a security interest may be perfected (which method of perfection is applicable depends upon the nature of the security interest and the laws of the relevant country).

# possession of the [[collateral (finance)|collateral]];
# statutory registration or filing;&lt;ref&gt;Such as the filing under section 395 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1986 referred to above&lt;/ref&gt; and
# notice to the debtor or a fundholder.

===Possession===

Some security interests can be perfected only by the actual possession of the asset.  For example, under a  common-law [[Pledge (law)|pledge]] (or pawn), the right to enforce the sale of the asset is contingent upon the possession of that asset: an agreement that leaves the debtor in possession of the pledged collateral does not give rise to an enforceable security interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Dublin City Distilery Co Ltd v Doherty'' [1914] AC 823&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases, the possession does not need to be ''actual'' possession, but may be ''constructive'' possession.  For example, possession of a document of title will often suffice where it is not possible to possess the goods.&lt;ref&gt;Although see ''Official Assignee of Madras v Mercantile Bank of India'' [1935] AC 53 where Lord Wright inferred that this may not be the case, discussed and explained in other terms in ''Commercial Law'' by [[Roy Goode]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In many legal systems, there may also be constructive possession by [[attornment]].

The law relating to perfection of security interests by taking of possession can sometimes be confused with the law relating to the granting of security interests, which provides that the deposit of certain assets (usually documents of title) can amount to an equitable mortgage of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent example an equitable mortgage created this way in Australia, see {{cite AustLII|HCA|45|2005|litigants=Theodore v Mistford Pty Ltd |courtname=auto |parralelcite=(2005) 221 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 612 |date=1 September 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration or filing===

Certain security interests may be perfected by some kind of registration or filing.  Although the terms are used interchangeably, it is more accurate to speak of registration as the lodgment of particulars, and filing as the lodgment of the security instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee on Consumer Credit (Cmnd. 4596, 1971), para 5.7.13; the distinction does have some meaning, as registration of particulars only makes third parties aware that there is a security interest, whereas filing they can see the terms of the security interest.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally systems of registration divide into two types:
# registration against a particular debtor; and
# registration against a particular asset.
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Registration against a particular asset only tends to be practical where the assets are of a nature and substance that makes it feasible to have a register for recording security interests against them.  Most countries have systems for the registration of security relating to land, aircraft, ships and intellectual property rights.  The advantage of a register relating to the asset is that if the debtor wishes to provide an asset as collateral, the proposed lender can swiftly check definitively whether the asset is encumbered or not. Nevertheless, specialist registers in some jurisdictions cannot always be considered "a one-stop source of information".&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the uncertainties surrounding Intellectual property registers in the UK see Andrea Tosato, Security interests over intellectual property  (2011) Journal of intellectual property law and Practice 99 [http://jiplp.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/2/93.short?rss=1][http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2073301]&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration against a debtor tends to operate by way of requiring the registration of certain security interests by the debtor.  The advantage is that a lender can quickly see which assets of the debtor are encumbered and which are not.  However, because many registration systems do not require all types of security interest to be registered gaps can remain.  Also, systems which register security against the debtor do not act as a check that the debtor actually has title to any of the relevant assets, merely that he has not created any security interest over them.&lt;ref&gt;A lender can still be in difficulty if it transpires that the goods are subject to a lease, or retention of title arrangement, or other form of non-registrable arrangement.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the position is complicated by the fact that many legal systems employ both, interchangeably.  A security interest granted by a debtor over a particular asset in any given country may need to be registered against the debtor, against the asset, both or neither.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] if a [[company (law)|company]] was to grant a mortgage over land and its rental income, this would be registrable both against the company (under section 395 of the Companies Act) and the asset (under the Land Registration Act and/or the Land Charges Act), but the same company granting a fixed equitable charge over a car would not be required to register it anywhere.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notice ===

In some legal systems, perfection of a security interest requires notice to be given to a relevant third party.  This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other ''[[Chose (English law)|chose in action]]'', notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund.  Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].  Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an [[equitable charge]] over that debt to B, and then grants a second equitable charge over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X.  The controversy in the rule relates to the fact that it is also a rule of ''priority'', meaning that (if their rights are otherwise equal) the first one to give notice to X has the prior claim, irrespective of the order in which the equitable charges were granted.

Similarly, in many common law legal systems, where there is an [[assignment (law)|assignment]] of a debt, the assignee cannot enforce the rights of the assigning creditor against the debtor unless notice of the assignment has been given, and until notice of the assignment has been given, the debtor can still discharge the debt by paying the money to the creditor, notwithstanding the assignment.

The '''Prüm Convention''' (inaccurately&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldselect/ldeucom/90/9005.htm Select Committee on European Union Eighteenth Report CHAPTER 2: Background]&lt;/ref&gt; known as '''Schengen III Agreement''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Europeanization and Democracy: Negotiating the Prüm Treaty and the Schengen III Agreement |author=Christopher Walsch |journal=Croatian Political Science Review |volume=45 |number=5 |date = July 2009|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/39933?lang=en |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[treaty]] which was signed on 27 May 2005 by [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain]] in the town of [[Prüm]] in [[Germany]], and which is open to all [[members of the European Union]], 14 of which are currently parties. 

The treaty was based on an initiative by the then German Minister [[Otto Schily]] from mid-2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu-consent.net/library/deliverables/D38c.pdf The Treaty of Prüm: A Replay of Schengen?]&lt;/ref&gt; Core elements of the convention were picked up by EU Council Decision 2008/615/JHA on 23 June 2008 on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime.&lt;ref name="council"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008D0615:EN:NOT OJ L 210, 6 August 2008, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full name of the treaty is ''Convention between the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Austria on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration''.

==Contents of the Convention==
The Convention was adopted so as to enable the signatories to exchange data regarding [[DNA]], [[fingerprint]]s and [[vehicle registration]] of concerned persons and to cooperate against [[terrorism]]. It also contains provisions for the deployment of armed [[sky marshal]]s on flights between signatory states, joint police patrols, entry of (armed) police forces into the territory of another state for the prevention of immediate danger ([[hot pursuit]]), and cooperation in case of mass events or disasters. Furthermore, a police officer responsible for an operation in a state may, in principle, decide to what degree the police forces of the other states that were taking part in the operation could use their weapons or exercise other powers.

==Relation to the European Union==
The Convention was adopted outside of the [[Institutions of the European Union|European Union framework]] (and its mechanism of [[enhanced co-operation]]), but asserts that it is open for accession by any [[member state of the European Union]] and that:
{{Quotation|provisions of this Convention shall only apply in so far as they are compatible with [[European Union law]] ... ''[EU law]'' should take precedence in applying the relevant provisions of this Convention|Convention on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration|Article 47}}
Additionally the text of the Convention and its annexes were circulated on 7 July 2005 between the delegations to the [[Council of the European Union]].

Some of the Convention provisions, falling under the [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|former third pillar of the EU]], were later subsumed into the police and judicial cooperation provisions of [[European Union law]] by a 2008 Council Decision,&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:210:0012:0072:EN:PDF Decision 2008/616/2008 implementing 2008/615/2008]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as the '''Prüm Decision'''. It provides for Law Enforcement Cooperation in criminal matters primarily related to exchange of fingerprint, DNA (both on a hit no-hit basis) and Vehicle owner registration (direct access via the [[EUCARIS]] system) data. The data exchange provisions are to be implemented in 2012. The remaining provisions of the Convention falling under the former third pillar are not yet adopted into EU law.

'''Psiphon''' is a [[free and open-source]] [[Internet censorship circumvention]] tool that uses a combination of secure communication and obfuscation technologies ([[Virtual private network|VPN]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], and [[Proxy server|HTTP Proxy]]). Psiphon is a centrally managed, and geographically diverse network of thousands
of proxy servers, using a performance-oriented, single and multi hop architecture.&lt;ref name="Fifield"&gt;{{cite web

Psiphon is specifically designed to support users in countries considered to be "enemies of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/internet-enemie-egypt,36679.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412165622/http://en.rsf.org/internet-enemie-egypt,36679.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The codebase is developed and maintained by Psiphon, Inc. which operates systems and technologies designed to assist [[Internet]] users to securely bypass the content-filtering systems used by governments to impose [[Internet censorship|censorship of the Internet]]. 

The original concept for Psiphon (1.0) was developed by the [[Citizen Lab]] at the [[University of Toronto]], building upon previous generations of web proxy software systems, such as the "Safe Web"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2002/02/50371 | work=Wired | title=SafeWeb's Holes Contradict Claims | date=2002-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Anonymizer" systems.

In 2007 Psiphon, Inc. was established as an independent Ontario corporation that develops advanced censorship circumvention systems and technologies. Psiphon, Inc. and the [[Citizen Lab]] at the [[Munk School of Global Affairs]], [[University of Toronto]] occasionally collaborate on research projects, through the Psi-Lab partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deibert.citizenlab.org/2009/05/psiphon-launch-let-the-revolution-begin/ |title=Ronald Deibert &amp;#124; Director, The Canada Centre for Global Security Studies and the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto |publisher=Deibert.citizenlab.org |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psiphon currently consists of three separate but related open source software projects:
* 3.0 – A cloud based run-time tunneling system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/psiphon/psiphon-circumvention-system |title=psiphon / Psiphon Circumvention System — Bitbucket |publisher=Bitbucket.org |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1.0 – The original home based server software (released by the Citizen Lab in 2004, rewritten  and launched in 2006). Psiphon 1.X is no longer supported by Psiphon, Inc. or the Citizen Lab.&lt;ref name="Psiphon.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psiphon.ca/?p=46 |title=Psiphon - Total Delivery Solution for the Censored Internet |publisher=Psiphon.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Psiphon.jpg|{{largethumb}}]]
The original concept for Psiphon envisioned an easy-to-use and lightweight Internet proxy, designed to be installed and operated by individual computer users who would then host private connections for friends and family in countries where the Internet is censored.   According to Nart Villeneuve "The idea is to get (users) to install this on their computer, and then deliver the location of that circumventor, to people in filtered countries by the means they know to be the most secure. What we're trying to build is a network of trust among people who know each other, rather than a large tech network that people can just tap into."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Boyd |title=Bypassing China's net firewall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3548035.stm |publisher=BBC News |id= |date=2004-03-10 |accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psiphon 1.0 was launched by the Citizen Lab on 1 December 2006 as open source software.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psiphon.ca/?page_id=94 |title=Psiphon - Total Delivery Solution for the Censored Internet |publisher=Psiphon.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Early—2007, Psiphon, Inc. was established as a Canadian corporation independent of the Citizen Lab and the University of Toronto. The original code (1.6) was made available under the [[GNU General Public License]]. In 2008, Psiphon was awarded the [[Netexplorateur award]] by the [[French Senate]].&lt;ref name="rue1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/comment/226747 |title=Psiphon, un logiciel anticensure, « Netxplorateur de l'année » |language=fr |publisher=Rue89 |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Psiphon was recognized with [[The Economist]] Best New Media Award by [[Index on Censorship]].&lt;ref name="indexoncensorship1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2009/04/freedom-of-expression-award-2009-recipients-announced/ |title=FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AWARD 2009 RECIPIENTS ANNOUNCED |publisher=Index on Censorship |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Psiphon 1.X was officially retired and is no longer actively supported by Psiphon, Inc., or the Citizen Lab.&lt;ref name="Psiphon.ca"/&gt;

In 2008, Psiphon, Inc. was awarded two sub-grants via the Internews operated SESAWE (Open Internet) project(s).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sesawe.net/ |title=is now offline |publisher=Sesawe.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of funding came from the European Parliament and the [[US State Department]] [[Internet Freedom programme|Internet Freedom program]], administered by the [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (DRL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2011/168684.htm |title=Promises We Keep Online: Internet Freedom in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Region |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of these grants was to develop Psiphon into a scalable anti-censorship solution capable of supporting large numbers of users across different geographic regions. The core development team grew to include a group of experienced security and encryption software engineers that previously developed [[Ciphershare]], a secure [[document management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provensecuritysolutions.com/products.html |title=CipherShare - High Performance, Secure Document Management and Collaboration |publisher=Provensecuritysolutions.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, Psiphon, Inc. began providing services to the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors (US)]], [[US Department of State]], and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]. Psiphon, Inc. currently (2015) operates on the basis revenues generated from commercial operations.

In 2012, Psiphon, Inc. began development of a mobile version of Psiphon 3 for use with phones running [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psiphon.ca/?page_id=411 |title=Psiphon - Total Delivery Solution for the Censored Internet |publisher=Psiphon.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RTP Control Protocol''' ('''RTCP''') is a sister protocol of the [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP). Its basic functionality and packet structure is defined in RFC 3550. RTCP provides [[Out-of-band signaling|out-of-band]] statistics and control information for an RTP session. It partners with RTP in the delivery and packaging of multimedia data, but does not transport any media data itself.

The primary function of RTCP is to provide feedback on the [[quality of service]] (QoS) in media distribution by periodically sending statistics information such as transmitted [[Octet (computing)|octet]] and packet counts, [[packet loss]], [[packet delay variation]], and [[round-trip delay time]] to participants in a streaming multimedia session. An application may use this information to control quality of service parameters, perhaps by limiting flow, or using a different [[codec]].

{{IPstack}}

==Protocol functions==
Typically RTP will be sent on an even-numbered [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port, with RTCP messages being sent over the next higher odd-numbered port.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3605, ''Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP)'', C. Huitema, Microsoft (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

RTCP itself does not provide any flow encryption or authentication methods. Such mechanisms may be implemented, for example, with the [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol]] (SRTP) defined in RFC 3711.

RTCP provides basic functions expected to be implemented in all RTP sessions:
*The primary function of RTCP is to gather statistics on quality aspects of the media distribution during a session and transmit this data to the session media source and other session participants. Such information may be used by the source for adaptive media encoding ([[codec]]) and detection of transmission faults. If the session is carried over a multicast network, this permits non-intrusive session quality monitoring.
*RTCP provides canonical end-point identifiers ([[CNAME]]) to all session participants. Although a source identifier (SSRC) of an RTP stream is expected to be unique, the instantaneous binding of source identifiers to end-points may change during a session. The CNAME establishes unique identification of end-points across an application instance (multiple use of media tools) and for third-party monitoring.
*Provisioning of session control functions. RTCP is a convenient means to reach all session participants, whereas RTP itself is not. RTP is only transmitted by a media source.

RTCP reports are expected to be sent by all participants, even in a multicast session which may involve thousands of recipients. Such traffic will increase proportionally with the number of participants. Thus, to avoid network congestion, the protocol must include session bandwidth management. This is achieved by dynamically controlling the frequency of report transmissions. RTCP bandwidth usage should generally not exceed 5% of total session bandwidth. Furthermore, 25% of the RTCP bandwidth should be reserved to media sources at all times, so that in large conferences new participants can receive the CNAME identifiers of the senders without excessive delay.

The RTCP reporting interval is randomized to prevent unintended synchronization of reporting. The recommended minimum RTCP report interval per station is 5 seconds. Stations should not transmit RTCP reports more often than once every 5 seconds.

* '''Version''': (2 bits) Identifies the version of RTP, which is the same in RTCP packets as in RTP data packets. The version defined by this specification is two (2).&lt;ref name=RFC3550&gt;{{IETF RFC|3550}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''P (Padding)''': (1 bits) Used to indicate if there are extra padding bytes at the end of the RTP packet. A padding might be used to fill up a block of certain size, for example as required by an encryption algorithm. The last byte of the padding contains the number of padding bytes that were added (including itself).&lt;ref name=RFC3550/&gt;
* '''RC (Reception report count )''': (5 bits) The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet. A value of zero is valid.&lt;ref name=RFC3550/&gt;
* '''PT (Packet type) ''': (8 bits) Contains a constant to identify RTCP packet type.&lt;ref name=RFC3550/&gt;
* '''Length''': (16 bits) Indicates the length of this RTCP packet.&lt;ref name=RFC3550/&gt;
* '''SSRC''': (32 bits) Synchronization source identifier uniquely identifies the source of a stream.&lt;ref name=RFC3550/&gt;

==Message types==
RTCP distinguishes several types of packets: ''sender report'', ''receiver report'', ''source description'', and ''goodbye''. In addition, the protocol is extensible and allows application-specific RTCP packets. A standards-based extension of RTCP is the ''extended report'' packet type introduced by RFC 3611.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3611, ''RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)'', T. Friedman (Ed.), R. Caceres, A. Clark (Ed.), The Internet Society (November 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sender report (SR): The sender report is sent periodically by the active senders in a conference to report transmission and reception statistics for all RTP packets sent during the interval. The sender report includes an absolute timestamp, which is the number of seconds elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1900. The absolute timestamp allows the receiver to synchronize RTP messages. It is particularly important when both audio and video are transmitted simultaneously, because audio and video streams use independent relative timestamps.
;Receiver report (RR): The receiver report is for passive participants, those that do not send RTP packets. The report informs the sender and other receivers about the quality of service.
;Source description (SDES): The Source Description message is used to send the CNAME item to session participants. It may also be used to provide additional information such as the name, e-mail address, telephone number, and address of the owner or controller of the source.
;Goodbye (BYE): A source sends a BYE message to shut down a stream. It allows an endpoint to announce that it is leaving the conference. Although other sources can detect the absence of a source, this message is a direct announcement. It is also useful to a media mixer.
;Application-specific message (APP): The application-specific message provides a mechanism to design application-specific extensions to the RTCP protocol.

==Scalability in large deployments==
In large-scale applications, such as in [[Internet Protocol Television]] (IPTV), very long delays (minutes to hours) between RTCP reports may occur, because of the RTCP bandwidth control mechanism required to control congestion (see [[#Protocol functions| Protocol functions]]). Acceptable frequencies are usually less than one per minute. This affords the potential of inappropriate reporting of the relevant statistics by the receiver or cause evaluation by the media sender to be inaccurate relative to the current state of the session. Methods have been introduced to alleviate the problems:&lt;ref&gt;Vít Novotný, Dan Komosný, ''Large-Scale RTCP Feedback Optimization'', Journal of Networks, Vol.3 (3), March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; RTCP filtering, RTCP biasing and [[RTCP hierarchical aggregation|hierarchical aggregation]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Hierarchical aggregation===
The Hierarchical Aggregation (or also known as RTCP feedback hierarchy) is an optimization of the RTCP feedback model and its aim is to shift the maximum number of users limit further together with [[quality of service]] (QoS) measurement.&lt;ref name=HA1/&gt;&lt;ref name=HA2/&gt; The [[RTCP]] [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] is constant and takes just 5% of session bandwidth. Therefore, the reporting interval about QoS depends, among others, on a number of session members and for very large sessions it can become very high (minutes or even hours)&lt;ref name=RFC3550/&gt;. However the acceptable interval is about 10 seconds of reporting. Bigger values would cause time-shifted and very inaccurate reported status about the current session status and any optimization made by sender could even have a negative effect to network or QoS conditions.

The Hierarchical Aggregation is used with [[Source-Specific Multicast]] where only a single source is allowed, i.e. [[IPTV]]. Another type of multicast could be [[Any-Source Multicast]] but it is not so suitable for large-scale applications with huge number of users.

{{asof|June 2007}}, only the most modern IPTV systems use Hierarchical aggregation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Feedback Target ===
Feedback Target is a new type of member that has been firstly introduced by the Internet Draft draft-ietf-avt-rtcpssm-13&lt;ref name=HA4/&gt;. The Hierarchical Aggregation method has extended its functionality. The function of this member is to receive Receiver Reports (RR) (see [[RTCP]]) and retransmit summarized RR packets, so-called Receiver Summary Information (RSI)&lt;ref name=HA4/&gt; to a sender (in case of single level hierarchy).

The regulation of '''therapeutic goods''', that is '''drugs''' and '''therapeutic devices''', varies by jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the [[United States]], they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions 
they are regulated at the [[State (administrative division)|state]] level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as is the case in [[Australia]].

The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed. There is usually some degree of restriction of the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers.

== History ==

Modern drug regulation has historical roots in the response to the proliferation of universal antidotes which appeared in the wake of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]]' death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How Ancient Cure-Alls Paved the Way for Drug Regulation|last=Silver|first=Carly|date=10 January 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mithridates had brought together physicians, scientists, and shamans to concoct a potion that would make him immune to poisons. Following his death, the Romans became keen on further developing the Mithridates potion's recipe. Mithridatium re-entered western society through multiple means.  The first was through the ''Leechbook of the Bald'' (''[[Bald's Leechbook]]''), written somewhere between 900 and 950, which contained a formula for various remedies, including for a theriac. Additionally, theriac became a commercial good traded throughout Europe based on the works of Greek and Roman physicians.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=J P|date=2004|title=Venetian Treacle and the Foundation of Medicines Regulation.|url=|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=58.3|pages=317–325|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2004.02147.x|pmc=1884566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting proliferation of various recipes needed to be curtailed in order to ensure that people were not passing off fake antidotes, which led to the development of government involvement and regulation. Additionally, the creation of these concoctions took on ritualistic form and were often created in public and the process was observed and recorded. It was believed that if the concoction proved unsuccessful, it was due to the apothecaries’ process of making them and they could be held accountable because of the public nature of the creation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 9th century, many Muslim countries established an office of the ''[[Hisbah|hisba]]'', which in addition to regulating compliance to Islamic principles and values took on the role of regulating other aspects of social and economic life, including the regulation of medicines. Inspectors were appointed to employ oversight on those who were involved in the process of medicine creation and were given a lot of leigh weigh to ensure compliance and punishments were stringent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penn|first=Rg|date=1979|title=The State Control of Medicines: The First 3000 Years|url=|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=8|pages=293–305|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1979.tb04710.x|pmc=1429842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first official 'act', the 'Apothecary Wares, Drugs and Stuffs' Act (also sometimes referred to as the 'Pharmacy Wares, Drugs and Stuffs' Act) was passed in 1540 by Henry VIII and set the foundation for others. Through this act, he encouraged physicians in his ''College of Physicians'' (founded by him in 1518) to appoint four people dedicated to consistently inspecting what was being sold in apothecary shops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In conjunction with this first piece of legislation, there was an emergence of standard formulas for the creation of certain ‘drugs’ and ‘antidotes’ through [[Pharmacopoeia]]s which first appeared in the form of a decree from [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Sicily]] in 1240 to use consistent and standard formulas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drug Benefits and Risks: International Textbook of Clinical Pharmacology|last=van Boxtel|first=C.J.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern pharmacopoeias were the Florence Pharmacopoeia published in 1498,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the Spanish Pharmacopoeia published in 1581 and the London Pharmacopoeia published in 1618.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key Issues in Pharmaceuticals Law.|last=Valverde|first=Jose Luis|publisher=IOS Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, regulation of drugs was originally a state right, as opposed to federal right. But with the increase in fraudulent practices due to private incentives to maximize profits and poor enforcement of state laws, increased the need for stronger federal regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Law: Regulation of Research, Development, and Marketing|last=Clark|first=Michael|publisher=Bloomberg BNA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Roosevelt signed the Federal Food and Drug Act (FFDA) in 1906 which established stricter standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A 1911 Supreme Court decision, ''United States vs. Johnson'', established that misleading statements were not covered under the FFDA.  This directly led to Congress passing the Sherley Amendment which established a clearer definition of ‘misbranded’.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another key catalyst for advances in drug regulation were certain catastrophes that served as calls to the government to step in and impose regulations that would prevent repeats of those instances. One such instance occurred in 1937 when more than a hundred people died from using sulfanilamide elixir which had not gone through any safety testing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This directly led to the passing of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] in 1938.  One other major catastrophe occurred in the late 1950s when Thalidomide, which was originally sold in Germany (introduced into a virtually unregulated market) and eventually sold around the world, led to approximately 100,000 babies being born with various deformities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The UK's Chief Medical Officer had established a group to look into safety of drugs on the market in 1959 prior to the crisis and was moving in the direction of address the problem of unregulated drugs entering the market. The crisis created a greater sense of emergency to establish safety and efficacy standards around the world. The UK started a temporary Committee on Safety of Drugs while they attempted to pass more comprehensive legislation.  Though compliance and submission of drugs to the Committee on Safety of Drugs was not mandatory immediately after, the pharmaceutical industry larger complied due to the thalidomide situation. The European Economic Commission also passed a directive in 1965 in order to impose greater efficacy standards before marketing a drug.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emanuel|first=Michael|date=2012|title=Thalidomide and its sequelae|url=|journal=The Lancet|volume=380|pages=781–783|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(12)60468-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States congress passed the Drug Amendments Act of 1962 The Drug Amendments Act required the FDA to ensure that new drugs being introduced to the market had passed certain tests and standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both the EU and US acts introduced the requirements to ensure safety and efficacy.  Of note, increased regulations and standards for testing actually led to greater innovation in pharmaceutical research in the 1960s, despite greater preclinical and clinical standards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1989, the International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities organized by the WHO, officials from around the world discussed the necessity for streamlined processes for global drug approval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Various other events throughout history have demonstrated the importance of drug and medicine regulation keeping up with scientific advances.  In 2006, the challenges associated with [[TGN1412|TGN 1412]] highlighted the shortcomings of animal models and paved the way for further advances in regulation and development for biological products.  [[Rofecoxib]] represents a drug that was on the market that had not clearly represent the risks associated with the use drug which led to the concept of 'risk management planning' within the field of regulation by introducing the need to understand how various safety concerns would be managed.  Various cases over recent years have demonstrated the need for regulation to keep up with scientific advances that have implications for people's health.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Regulation by country==

===Australia===
Therapeutic goods in Australia are regulated by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tga.gov.au TGA - Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of drugs and poisons is regulated by scheduling under individual state legislation, but is generally under the guidance of the national [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons]] (SUSDP).

Under the SUSDP, medicinal agents generally belong to one of five categories:
*Unscheduled/exempt
*Schedule 2 (S2) - Pharmacy Medicines
*Schedule 3 (S3) - Pharmacist Only Medicines
*Schedule 4 (S4) - Prescription Only Medicines
*Schedule 8 (S8) - Controlled Drugs

{{See also|Illicit drug use in Australia}}

===Brazil===
Therapeutic goods in [[Brazil]] are regulated by the [[Brazilian Health Ministry]], through its [[National Health Surveillance Agency]] (equivalent to the USA's FDA). There are five main categories:
*Normal Medicines - Cough, cold and fever medicines, [[antiseptic]]s, [[vitamin]]s and others. Sold freely in pharmacies and some large supermarkets.
*Red Stripe Medicines - These medicines are sold only with medical prescription. [[Antibiotics]], Anti allergenics, [[Anti-inflammatory|Anti inflammatories]], and other medicines. In Brazil, governmental control is loose on this type; it is not uncommon to buy this type of prescription medicine over the counter without a prescription.
*Red Stripe Psychoactive Medicines - These medicines are sold only with a "Special Control" white medical prescription with carbon copy, which is valid for 30 days. The original must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale and the patient keeps the carbon copy. Drugs include [[anti-depressant]]s, [[anti-convulsant]]s, some sleep aids, anti-psychotics and other non-habit-inducing controlled medicines. Though some consider them habit inducing, anabolic steroids are also regulated under this category.
*Black Stripe Medicines - These medicines are sold only with the "Blue B Form" medical prescription, which is valid for 30 days and must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale. Includes [[sedatives]] ([[benzodiazepines]]), some anorexic inducers and other habit-inducing controlled medicines.
*"Yellow A Form" prescription medicines - These medicines are sold only with the "Yellow A Form" medical prescription - the most tightly controlled, which is valid for 30 days and must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale. Includes amphetamines and other stimulants (such as [[methylphenidate]]), [[opioids]] (such as [[morphine]] and oxycodone) and other strong habit-forming controlled medicines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anvisa.gov.br/eng/institution/history.htm Anvisa - The History Of Health Surveillance In Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, regulation of therapeutic goods are governed by the [[Food and Drug Act]] and associated regulations. In addition, the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] requires additional regulatory requirements for controlled drugs and drug precursors.&lt;ref name="HealthCanadaFacts"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/index-eng.php |title=Health Canada: Drugs and Health Products |publisher=[[Health Canada]] |accessdate=2 July 2010 |year=2000 |isbn=0-662-29208-1 |location=[[Ottawa, Ontario]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burma (Myanmar)===
The regulation of drugs in Burma is governed by the [[Food and Drug Administration (Burma)]] and [[Food and Drug Board of Authority]].

===China===
The regulation of drugs in China is governed by the [[China Food and Drug Administration]].

===Europe===

====Germany====
{{main article|List of German drug laws}}
German law classifies drugs into
* Narcotics ("Betäubungsmittel")
** [[Anlage I]] BTMG (authorized scientific use only)
** [[Anlage II]] BTMG (authorized trade only, not prescriptible)
** [[Anlage III]] BTMG ([[special prescription form]] required &amp;ndash; "Betäubungsmittelrezept")
* [[Research chemical]]s ("neue psychoaktive Stoffe" &amp;ndash; permitted only for industrial and scientific purposes)
* [[Prescription drug]]s ("verschreibungspflichtig" or "rezeptpflichtig")

* General sales list drugs ("freiverkäuflich")
* [[Raw material]]s for synthesizing drugs
** Kategorie 1 (authorization required)
** Kategorie 2 (reporting required) 
** Kategorie 3 (export restrictions)

====United Kingdom====

Medicines for Human Use in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA). The availability of drugs is regulated by classification by the MHRA as part of marketing authorisation of a product.

The United Kingdom has a three-tiered classification system:
*General Sale List (GSL)
*Pharmacy medicines (P)
*Prescription Only Medicines (POM)

Within POM, certain agents with a high abuse/addiction liability are also separately scheduled under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] (amended with the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001); and are commonly known as [[Controlled Drug in United Kingdom|Controlled Drugs]] (CD).

====Norway====

Medicines in Norway are divided into five groups:

'''Class A'''
Narcotics, sedative-hypnotics, and amphetamines in this class require a [[special prescription form]]:
*[[morphine]] and its immediate family, [[heroin]], [[desomorphine]], [[nicomorphine]];
*[[codeine]] and its immediate family, [[dihydrocodeine]], [[ethylmorphine]], [[nicocodeine]];
*morphine relatives: [[hydromorphone]] and [[oxymorphone]];
*codeine relatives: [[hydrocodone]] and [[oxycodone]];
*synthetic [[opioids]]: [[pethidine]], [[methadone]], [[fentanyl]], and [[levorphanol]];
*various [[Hypnotic|sedative-hypnotic]]s: [[temazepam]], [[methaqualone]], [[pentobarbital]], and [[secobarbital]];
*various [[stimulant]]s: [[amphetamine]]s and [[methylphenidate]];
*[[flunitrazepam]] (moved from class B)
 
'''Class B'''  
Restricted substances which easily lead to addiction like:
*[[co-codamol]]
*[[tramadol]]
*[[diazepam]]
*[[nitrazepam]]
*all other [[benzodiazepine]]s (with the exception of temazepam and [[flunitrazepam]])
*[[phentermine]]
 
'''Class C''' - All prescription-only substances

'''Class F''' - Substances and package-sizes not requiring a prescription

'''Unclassifieds''' - Brands and packages not actively marketed in Norway

====Iceland====
Medicines in Iceland are regulated by the [[Icelandic Medicines Control Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imca.is/ Icelandic Medicines Control Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
Medicines in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are regulated according to the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Ireland)|Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988]]. Controlled drugs (CDs) are divided into five categories based on their potential for misuse and therapeutic effectiveness.

*'''CD1''': [[cannabis]], [[lysergamide]], [[coca leaf]], etc. Use is prohibited except in limited circumstances where a license has been granted.
*'''CD2''': [[amphetamine]], [[methadone]], [[morphine]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], [[tapentadol]], etc. Prescriptions must be handwritten and are only valid for 14 days. Repeat prescriptions are not permitted. Drugs must comply with safe custody and destruction of unsold/unused medication must be witnessed. Must be registered in a Controlled Drugs register.
*'''CD3''': [[temazepam]], [[flunitrazepam]], etc. As CD2, except witnessed destruction and CD register are not required.
*'''CD4''': [[benzodiazepines]], e.g. [[diazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], low dose [[Methylphenobarbital|(methyl)phenobarbitone]]
*'''CD5''': low-dose [[codeine]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imt.ie/mims/2011/08/controlled-drugs.html&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ie&amp;strip=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
Medicines in Switzerland are regulated by [[Swissmedic]]. The country is not part of the [[European Union]], and is regarded by many as one of the easiest places to conduct clinical trials on new drug compounds.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

There are five categories from A to E to cover different types of delivery category:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Supply of medicinal products|publisher=Federal Office of Public Health|url=http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/medizin/00709/04670/04679/index.html?lang=en|accessdate=2014-01-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203002122/http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/medizin/00709/04670/04679/index.html?lang=en|archivedate=2014-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{main|Drug policy of India}}
Medicines in [[India]] are regulated by [[Central Drugs Standard Control Organization]] (CDSCO) Under [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]]. Headed by [[Directorate General of Health Services]], CDSCO regulates pharmaceutical products through [[Drugs Controller General of India]] (DCGI) at Chair.

Drugs are classified under five headings. Under retail and distribution: 
* Schedule X drugs - narcotics
* Schedule H and L - injectables, antibiotics, antibacterials
* Schedule C and C1 - biological products, for example serums and vaccines
 
Under manufacturing practice:
* Schedule N - list of the equipment for the efficient running of manufacturing wing, qualified personnel

===United States===
{{Main|Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}

Therapeutic goods in the United States are regulated by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which makes some drugs available [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] (OTC) at retail outlets and others by [[Prescription drug|prescription only]].

The prescription or possession of some substances is controlled or prohibited by the [[Controlled Substances Act]], under the FDA and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA). Some US [[U.S. state|states]] apply more stringent limits on the prescription of certain controlled substances C-V and BTC (behind the counter) drugs such as [[pseudoephedrine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4879">The '''Scottish Reform Act 1832''' was an Act of Parliament that introduced wide-ranging changes to the election laws of [[Scotland]]. The act was passed at approximately the same time as the [[Reform Act 1832]], which applied to [[England and Wales]]. The chief architects of the act were [[Francis Jeffrey]] and [[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn|Henry Cockburn]].&lt;ref name="SHR66"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=W|date=April 1966|title=The Reform Act (Scotland) of 1832: Intention and Effect|journal=Scottish Historical Review {{Subscription required}} |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|volume=45|issue=139|page=105|jstor=25528653}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently given the official short title of the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832.  The Act revolutionized politics in Scotland, with its population of 2 million. Its old electorate was only 0.2% of the population compared to 4% in England.  The Scottish electorate overnight soared from 5000 to 65,000, or 13% of the adult men, and was no longer a private preserve for a few very rich families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rab Houston|title=Scotland: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edQf4L3BdyQC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2008|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act did not substantially change the method in which the Scottish counties elected members of Parliament. As a general rule the counties each continued to elect one member. However, before the Act six small counties elected  an MP only in alternate Parliaments. This arrangement was ended, but a different solution was adopted for each pair of counties. [[Clackmannanshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire]] and [[Kinross-shire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross-shire]] became [[Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire (UK Parliament constituency)|a single constituency]]. [[Buteshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buteshire]] and [[Caithness (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness-shire]] were given a separate MP in every Parliament. [[Cromartyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cromartyshire]] and [[Nairnshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Nairnshire]] were each united with a different neighbouring county, to form [[Ross and Cromarty (UK Parliament constituency)|Ross and Cromarty]], and [[Elginshire and Nairnshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Elginshire and Nairnshire]].&lt;ref name="SHR66"/&gt;

[[Edinburgh (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow]] now had two MPs; [[Aberdeen (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen]], [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]], [[Greenock (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenock]], [[Paisley (UK Parliament constituency)|Paisley]] and [[Perth (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth]] one each.  The remaining burghs combined in [[District of burghs|districts]] to elect 18 MPs, much as before; but now individual votes were added up among burghs across the constituency &amp;mdash; in the past the MP had been elected at a meeting of representatives from each burgh. Boundary changes meant that a burgh for parliamentary elections might not have the same boundaries as the burgh for other purposes.

The effect of the Reform Act was considerable.  Before 1832 the Scottish Parliamentary electorate had been about 5,000 adult males. Following the passing of the Act,  the number of Scottish MPs increased from 45 to 53 and the franchise increased by an even greater proportion, growing from under 5,000 of the 2,300,000 population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pentland|first=Gordon|date=April 2006|title=The Debate on Scottish Parliamentary Reform, 1830-1832|journal=Scottish Historical Review {{Subscription required}} |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|volume=85|issue=219|page=104|jstor=25529887}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 65,000 voters&lt;ref name="SHR66"/&gt; (now covering householders of £10 value in the burghs and property owners of £10 or tenants of £50 rental in the country seats).

[[File:OPSEC alert -- What is social engineering....jpg|thumb|400px|[[OPSEC]] alert]]

'''Social engineering''', in the context of [[information security]], refers to [[psychological manipulation]] of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This differs from social engineering within the social sciences, which does not contain the divulging of confidential information. A type of [[confidence trick]] for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional "con" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILaY4jBWXfcC|title=Security engineering: a guide to building dependable distributed systems|last=Anderson|first=Ross J.|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-06852-6|edition=2nd|location=Indianapolis, IN|page=1040|authorlink=Ross J. Anderson}} Chapter 2, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been defined as "any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/general-discussion/social-engineering-defined/|title=Social Engineering Defined - Security Through Education|work=Security Through Education|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information security culture==
Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. "Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture" provides the following definition of information security culture: "ISC is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contribute to the protection of information of all kinds."&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Joo S., et al. "Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture." Australian Information Security Management Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security "effort" and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests.&lt;ref name="Andersson &amp; Reimers 2014"&gt;Anderson, D., Reimers, K. and Barretto, C. (March 2014). Post-Secondary Education Network Security: Results of Addressing the End-User Challenge.publication date Mar 11, 2014 publication description INTED2014 (International Technology, Education, and Development Conference)&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows Information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In "Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change", authors commented, "It's a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance." To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: Pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlienger | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Teufel | first2 = Stephanie | year = 2003 | title = Information security culture-from analysis to change | url = | journal = South African Computer Journal | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 46–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analysis current security policy.
*Strategic Planning: to come up a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets. Clustering people is helpful to achieve it.
*Operative Planning: we can set a good security culture based on internal communication, management-buy-in, and security awareness and training program.&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/&gt;
*Implementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. They are commitment of the management, communication with organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the employees.&lt;ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/&gt;

==Techniques and terms==
All social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human [[decision-making]] known as [[List of cognitive biases|cognitive biases]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaco, K: "CSEPS Course Workbook" (2004), unit 3, Jaco Security Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; These biases, sometimes called "bugs in the human hardware", are exploited in various combinations to create attack techniques, some of which are listed below. The attacks used in social engineering can be used to steal employees' confidential information. The most common type of social engineering happens over the phone. Other examples of social engineering attacks are criminals posing as exterminators, fire marshals and technicians to go unnoticed as they steal company secrets.

One example of social engineering is an individual who walks into a building and posts an official-looking announcement to the company bulletin that says the number for the help desk has changed. So, when employees call for help the individual asks them for their passwords and IDs thereby gaining the ability to access the company's private information.
Another example of social engineering would be that the hacker contacts the target on a [[social networking site]] and starts a conversation with the target. Gradually the hacker gains the trust of the target and then uses that trust to get access to sensitive information like password or bank account details.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Social engineering relies heavily on the 6 principles of influence established by [[Robert Cialdini]].  Cialdini's theory of influence is based on six key principles: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity.

=== Six key principles ===

# [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|Reciprocity]] – People tend to return a favor, thus the pervasiveness of [[free sample]]s in marketing. In his conferences, he often uses the example of [[Ethiopia]] providing thousands of dollars in humanitarian aid to [[Mexico]] just after the 1985 earthquake, despite Ethiopia suffering from a crippling famine and civil war at the time. Ethiopia had been reciprocating for the diplomatic support Mexico provided when Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. The [[good cop/bad cop]] strategy is also based on this principle.
# [[Promise|Commitment]] and [[Consistency (negotiation)|consistency]] – If people commit, orally or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that commitment because of establishing that idea or goal as being congruent with their [[self-image]]. Even if the original incentive or motivation is removed after they have already agreed, they will continue to honor the agreement. Cialdini notes Chinese [[brainwashing]] of American [[prisoners of war]] to rewrite their self-image and gain automatic unenforced compliance. Another example is marketers make you close popups by saying “I’ll sign up later” or "No thanks, I prefer not making money”.
# [[Social proof]] – People will do things that they see other people are doing. For example, in one experiment, one or more confederates would look up into the sky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were seeing. At one point this experiment aborted, as so many people were looking up that they stopped traffic. See [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]], and the [[Asch conformity experiments]].
# [[Authority]] – People will tend to obey authority figures, even if they are asked to perform objectionable acts. Cialdini cites incidents such as the [[Milgram experiment]]s in the early 1960s and the [[My Lai massacre]].
# [[Friendship|Liking]] – People are easily persuaded by other people that they like. Cialdini cites the marketing of [[Tupperware]] in what might now be called [[viral marketing]]. People were more likely to buy if they liked the person selling it to them. Some of the many biases favoring more attractive people are discussed. See [[physical attractiveness stereotype]].
# [[Scarcity]] – Perceived scarcity will generate [[demand]]. For example, saying offers are available for a "limited time only" encourages sales.

His 1984 book, ''Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion'', was based on three "undercover" years applying for and training at used car dealerships, fund-raising organizations, and [[telemarketing]] firms to observe real-life situations of persuasion. It has been mentioned in ''50 Psychology Classics''.

=== Four Social Engineering Vectors ===

=== Vishing ===
Vishing, otherwise known as "[[voice phishing]]", is the criminal practice of using social engineering over the [[PSTN|telephone system]] to gain access to private personal and financial information from the public for the purpose of financial reward. It is also employed by attackers for [[reconnaissance]] purposes to gather more detailed [[Intelligence analysis|intelligence]] on a target organisation.

===Phishing===
{{Main|Phishing}}
Phishing is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information. Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business—a bank, or [[credit card company]]—requesting "verification" of information and warning of some [[Loss aversion|dire consequence]] if it is not provided. The e-mail usually contains a link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate—with company logos and content—and has a form requesting everything from a home address to an [[ATM card]]'s [[Personal identification number|PIN]] or a [[credit card number]]. For example, in 2003, there was a phishing scam in which users received e-mails supposedly from [[eBay]] claiming that the user's account was about to be suspended unless a link provided was clicked to update a [[credit card]] (information that the genuine eBay already had). Because it is relatively simple to make a Web site resemble a legitimate organization's site by mimicking the HTML code and logos the scam counted on people being tricked into thinking they were being contacted by eBay and subsequently, were going to eBay's site to update their account information. By [[spamming]] large groups of people, the "phisher" counted on the e-mail being read by a percentage of people who already had listed credit card numbers with eBay legitimately, who might respond.

=== Smishing ===
The act of using [[SMS]] text messaging to lure victims into a specific course of action. Like [[Phishing]] it can be clicking on a malicious link or divulging information.

=== Impersonation ===
Pretending or pretexting to be another person with the goal of gaining access physically to a system or building.

== Other Concepts ==

===Pretexting===
{{Redirect|Blagger|the video game|Blagger (video game)}}
'''Pretexting''' (adj. '''pretextual'''),  is the act of creating and using an invented scenario (the [[pretext]]) to engage a targeted victim in a manner that increases the chance the victim will divulge information or perform actions that would be unlikely in ordinary circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;The story of HP pretexting scandal with discussion is available at {{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/62262162/HP-Pretexting-Scandal|title=HP Pretexting Scandal by Faraz Davani|date=14 August 2011|publisher=Scribd|accessdate=15 August 2011|first1=Faraz|last1=Davani}}&lt;/ref&gt; An elaborate [[lie]], it most often involves some prior research or setup and the use of this information for impersonation (''e.g.'', date of birth, [[Social Security number]], last bill amount) to [[List of cognitive biases|establish legitimacy in the mind]] of the target.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre10.shtm Pretexting: Your Personal Information Revealed]", [[Federal Trade Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique can be used to fool a business into disclosing customer information as well as by [[private investigator]]s to obtain telephone records, utility records, banking records and other information directly from company service representatives.&lt;ref name="The Serial Swatter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/the-serial-swatter.html?_r=0|title=The Serial Swatter|website=[[New York Times]]|last1=Fagone|first1=Jason|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information can then be used to establish even greater legitimacy under tougher questioning with a manager, ''e.g.'', to make account changes, get specific balances, etc.

Pretexting can also be used to impersonate co-workers, police, bank, tax authorities, clergy, insurance investigators—or any other individual who could have perceived authority or right-to-know in the mind of the targeted victim. The pretexter must simply prepare answers to questions that might be asked by the victim. In some cases, all that is needed is a voice that sounds authoritative, an earnest tone, and an ability to think on one's feet to create a pretextual scenario.

====Vishing====
{{Main|Vishing}}
Phone phishing (or "[[vishing]]") uses a rogue [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) system to recreate a legitimate-sounding copy of a bank or other institution's IVR system. The victim is prompted (typically via a phishing e-mail) to call in to the "bank" via a (ideally toll free) number provided in order to "verify" information. A typical "vishing" system will reject log-ins continually, ensuring the victim enters PINs or passwords multiple times, often disclosing several different passwords. More advanced systems transfer the victim to the attacker/defrauder, who poses as a customer service agent or [[security]] expert for further questioning of the victim.

===Spear phishing===
{{Main|Spear phishing}}
Although similar to "phishing", spear phishing is a technique that fraudulently obtains private information by sending highly customized emails to few end users. It is the main difference between phishing attacks because phishing campaigns focus on sending out high volumes of generalized emails with the expectation that only a few people will respond. On the other hand, spear phishing emails require the attacker to perform additional research on their targets in order to "trick" end users into performing requested activities. The success rate of spear-phishing attacks is considerably higher than phishing attacks with people opening roughly 3% of phishing emails when compared to roughly 70% of potential attempts. Furthermore, when users actually open the emails phishing emails have a relatively modest 5% success rate to have the link or attachment clicked when compared to a spear-phishing attack's 50% success rate.&lt;ref name="The Real Dangers of Spear-Phishing Attacks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/best-defense-against-spear-phishing-attacks.html|title=The Real Dangers of Spear-Phishing Attacks|date=2016|publisher=FireEye|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spear Phishing success is heavily dependent on the amount and quality of [[OSINT]] (Open Source Intelligence) that the attacker can obtain.  [[Social media]] account activity is one example of a source of OSINT.

===Water holing===
{{Main|Watering hole attack}}
Water holing is a targeted social engineering strategy that capitalizes on the trust users have in websites they regularly visit. The victim feels safe to do things they would not do in a different situation. A wary person might, for example, purposefully avoid clicking a link in an unsolicited email, but the same person would not hesitate to follow a link on a website they often visit. So, the attacker prepares a trap for the unwary prey at a favored watering hole. This strategy has been successfully used to gain access to some (supposedly) very secure systems.&lt;ref name="Forbes.com watering hole attack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.invincea.com/2015/02/chinese-espionage-campaign-compromises-forbes/|title=Chinese Espionage Campaign Compromises Forbes.com to Target US Defense, Financial Services Companies in Watering Hole Style Attack|date=10 February 2015|publisher=invincea.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacker may set out by identifying a group or individuals to target. The preparation involves gathering information about websites the targets often visit from the secure system. The information gathering confirms that the targets visit the websites and that the system allows such visits. The attacker then tests these websites for vulnerabilities to inject code that may infect a visitor's system with [[malware]]. The injected code trap and malware may be tailored to the specific target group and the specific systems they use. In time, one or more members of the target group will get infected and the attacker can gain access to the secure system.

===Baiting===
Baiting is like the real-world [[Trojan horse]] that uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim.&lt;ref name="Social Engineering, the USB Way"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=95556&amp;WT.svl=column1_1|title=Social Engineering, the USB Way|date=7 June 2006|publisher=Light Reading Inc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713134051/http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=95556&amp;WT.svl=column1_1|archivedate=13 July 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[attack (computing)|attack]], attackers leave [[malware]]-infected [[floppy disk]]s, [[CD-ROM]]s, or [[USB flash drive]]s in locations people will find them (bathrooms, elevators, sidewalks, parking lots, etc.), give them legitimate and curiosity-piquing labels, and waits for victims.

For example, an attacker may create a disk featuring a corporate logo, available from the target's website, and label it "Executive Salary Summary Q2 2012". The attacker then leaves the disk on the floor of an elevator or somewhere in the lobby of the target company. An unknowing employee may find it and insert the disk into a computer to satisfy their curiosity, or a good Samaritan may find it and return it to the company. In any case, just inserting the disk into a computer installs malware, giving attackers access to the victim's PC and, perhaps, the target company's internal [[computer network]].

Unless computer controls block infections, insertion compromises PCs "auto-running" media. Hostile devices can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://md.hudora.de/presentations/firewire/PacSec2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011191205/http://md.hudora.de/presentations/firewire/PacSec2004.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a "lucky winner" is sent a free [[digital audio player]] compromising any computer it is plugged to. A "road apple" (the colloquial term for horse [[manure]], suggesting the device's undesirable nature) is any [[removable media]] with malicious software left in opportunistic or conspicuous places. It may be a CD, DVD, or [[USB flash drive]], among other media. Curious people take it and plug it into a computer, infecting the host and any attached networks. Hackers may give them enticing labels, such as "Employee Salaries" or "Confidential".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Computer Security, Fourth Edition (Official Comptia Guide)|last=Conklin|first=Wm.

One study done in 2016 had researchers drop 297 USB drives around the campus of the University of Illinois. The drives contained files on them that linked to webpages owned by the researchers. The researchers were able to see how many of the drives had files on them opened, but not how many were inserted into a computer without having a file opened. Of the 297 drives that were dropped, 290 (98%) of them were picked up and 135 (45%) of them "called home".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/bhusa-dropped-usb-experiement/|title=#BHUSA Dropped USB Experiment Detailed|last=Raywood|first=Dan|date=4 Aug 2016|website=info security|access-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quid pro quo===
Quid pro quo means ''something for something'':

*An attacker calls random numbers at a company, claiming to be calling back from technical support. Eventually this person will hit someone with a legitimate problem, grateful that someone is calling back to help them. The attacker will "help" solve the problem and, in the process, have the user type commands that give the attacker access or launch [[malware]].
*In a 2003 [[information security]] survey, 90% of office workers gave researchers what they claimed was their [[password]] in answer to a survey question in exchange for a cheap [[pen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/18/office_workers_give_away_passwords/|title=Office workers give away passwords|last=Leyden|first=John|date=18 April 2003|publisher=Theregister.co.uk|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar surveys in later years obtained similar results using chocolates and other cheap lures, although they made no attempt to validate the passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3639679.stm|title=Passwords revealed by sweet deal|date=20 April 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tailgating===
{{Main|Piggybacking (security)}}
An attacker, seeking entry to a restricted area secured by unattended, electronic [[access control]], e.g. by [[RFID]] card, simply walks in behind a person who has legitimate access. Following common courtesy, the legitimate person will usually hold the door open for the attacker or the attackers themselves may ask the employee to hold it open for them. The legitimate person may fail to ask for identification for any of several reasons, or may accept an assertion that the attacker has forgotten or lost the appropriate identity token. The attacker may also fake the action of presenting an identity token.

===Other types===
Common [[confidence trick]]sters or fraudsters also could be considered "social engineers" in the wider sense, in that they deliberately deceive and manipulate people, exploiting human weaknesses to obtain personal benefit. They may, for example, use social engineering techniques as part of an IT fraud.

A very recent{{When|date=October 2018}} type of social engineering technique includes spoofing or hacking IDs of people having popular e-mail IDs such as [[Yahoo!]], [[Gmail]], [[Hotmail]], etc. Among the many motivations for deception are:

* [[Phishing]] credit-card account numbers and their passwords.
* Cracking private e-mails and chat histories, and manipulating them by using common editing techniques before using them to extort money and creating distrust among individuals.
* Cracking websites of companies or organizations and destroying their reputation.
* Computer [[virus hoax]]es
* Convincing users to run malicious code within the web browser via [[self-XSS]] attack to allow access to their web account

===Countermeasures===
Organizations reduce their security risks by:

'''Training to Employees'''
Training employees in security protocols relevant to their position. (e.g., in situations such as tailgating, if a person's identity cannot be verified, then employees must be trained to politely refuse.)

'''Standard Framework'''
Establishing frameworks of trust on an employee/personnel level (i.e., specify and train personnel when/where/why/how sensitive information should be handled)

'''Scrutinizing Information'''
Identifying which information is sensitive and evaluating its exposure to social engineering and breakdowns in security systems (building, computer system, etc.)

'''Security Protocols'''
Establishing security protocols, policies, and procedures for handling sensitive information.

'''Event Test'''
Performing unannounced, periodic tests of the security framework.

'''Inoculation'''
Preventing social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Treglia, J., &amp; Delia, M. (2017). Cyber Security Inoculation. Presented at NYS Cyber Security Conference, Empire State Plaza Convention Center, Albany, NY, June 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Review'''
Reviewing the above steps regularly: no solutions to information integrity are perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Mitnick, K., &amp; Simon, W.  (2005).  "The Art Of Intrusion". Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waste Management'''
Using a waste management service that has dumpsters with locks on them, with keys to them limited only to the waste management company and the cleaning staff. Locating the dumpster either in view of employees so that trying to access it carries a risk of being seen or caught, or behind a locked gate or fence where the person must trespass before they can attempt to access the dumpster.&lt;ref&gt;Allsopp, William.

==Law==
In [[common law]], pretexting is an invasion of privacy tort of appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement 2d of Torts § 652C.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pretexting of telephone records===
In December 2006, [[United States Congress]] approved a Senate sponsored bill making the pretexting of telephone records a federal [[felony]] with fines of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison for individuals (or fines of up to $500,000 for companies). It was signed by President George W. Bush on 12 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/4709/|title=Congress outlaws pretexting|work=109th Congress (2005-2006) H.R.4709 - Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal legislation===
The 1999 [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act|"GLBA"]] is a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Federal]]  law that specifically addresses pretexting of banking records as an illegal act punishable under federal statutes. When a business entity such as a private investigator, SIU insurance investigator, or an adjuster conducts any type of deception, it falls under the authority of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). This federal agency has the obligation and authority to ensure that consumers are not subjected to any unfair or deceptive business practices. US Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 5 of the [[Federal Trade Commission Act|FTCA]] states, in part:
"Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect."

The statute states that when someone obtains any personal, non-public information from a financial institution or the consumer, their action is subject to the statute. It relates to the consumer's relationship with the financial institution. For example, a pretexter using false pretenses either to get a consumer's address from the consumer's bank, or to get a consumer to disclose the name of their bank, would be covered. The determining principle is that pretexting only occurs when information is obtained through false pretenses.

While the sale of cell telephone records has gained significant media attention, and telecommunications records are the focus of the two bills currently before the [[United States Senate]], many other types of private records are being bought and sold in the public market. Alongside many advertisements for cell phone records, wireline records and the records associated with calling cards are advertised. As individuals shift to VoIP telephones, it is safe to assume that those records will be offered for sale as well. Currently, it is legal to sell telephone records, but illegal to obtain them.&lt;ref&gt;Mitnick, K (2002): "The Art of Deception", p. 103 Wiley Publishing Ltd: Indianapolis, Indiana; United States of America. {{ISBN|0-471-23712-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1st Source Information Specialists===
U.S. Rep. [[Fred Upton]] (R-[[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], Michigan), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, expressed concern over the easy access to personal mobile phone records on the Internet during a House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee hearing on "'''Phone Records For Sale:''' ''Why Aren't Phone Records Safe From Pretexting?''" [[Illinois]] became the first state to sue an online records broker when Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued 1st Source Information Specialists, Inc. A spokeswoman for Madigan's office said. The Florida-based company operates several Web sites that sell mobile telephone records, according to a copy of the suit. The attorneys general of Florida and [[Missouri]] quickly followed Madigan's lead, filing suits respectively, against 1st Source Information Specialists and, in Missouri's case, one other records broker&amp;nbsp;– First Data Solutions, Inc.

Several wireless providers, including T-Mobile, Verizon, and Cingular filed earlier lawsuits against records brokers, with Cingular winning an injunction against First Data Solutions and 1st Source Information Specialists. U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-New York) introduced legislation in February 2006 aimed at curbing the practice. The Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 would create [[felony]] [[Criminal law|criminal]] penalties for stealing and selling the records of mobile phone, [[landline]], and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) subscribers.

===HP===
[[Patricia C. Dunn|Patricia Dunn]], former chairwoman of Hewlett Packard, reported that the HP board hired a private investigation company to delve into who was responsible for leaks within the board. Dunn acknowledged that the company used the practice of pretexting to solicit the telephone records of board members and journalists. Chairman Dunn later apologized for this act and offered to step down from the board if it was desired by board members.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/HP-chairman-Use-of-pretexting-embarrassing/2100-1014_3-6113715.html?tag=nefd.lede HP chairman: Use of pretexting 'embarrassing'] Stephen Shankland, 2006-09-08 1:08 PM PDT ''[[CNET]] News.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Federal law, California law specifically forbids such pretexting.

The '''south Andean deer''' (''Hippocamelus bisulcus''), also known as the '''southern guemal''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focusonnature.com/SouthAmericaMammalList.htm|title=Mammals and Other Wildlife in South America during Focus On Nature Tours|author=|date=|website=focusonnature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Chilean ''huemul''''' or ''''' güemul''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|eɪ|m|uː|l}} {{respell|WAY|mool}}, {{IPA-es|weˈmul|lang}}), is an endangered species of [[deer]] native to the mountains of [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. One of two mid-sized deer of the ''[[Hippocamelus]]'' [[genus]], the south Andean deer ranges across the high mountainsides and cold valleys of the [[Andes]]. The distribution and [[habitat]], behaviour, and diet of the deer have all been the subject of study. The viability of the small remaining population is an outstanding concern to researchers.

The huemul is part of [[Coat of arms of Chile|Chile's national coat of arms]] and it is since 2006 a National Natural Monument.

==Description==
[[Image:Coat of arms of Chile.svg|thumb|200px|left|[[Coat of arms of Chile]], huemul in left]] 
The south Andean deer is well-adapted to broken, difficult terrain with a stocky build and short legs. A brown to greyish-brown coat tapers to white undersides and a white marked throat; the long, curled hairs of the coat provide protection against cold and moisture. Does are 70 to 80&amp;nbsp;kg. (154-176&amp;nbsp;lbs.) and stand 80&amp;nbsp;cm. (31 in.), while bucks are 90&amp;nbsp;kg (198&amp;nbsp;lbs.) and 90&amp;nbsp;cm (35&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name=THESIS/&gt; (Other weight suggestions are lower.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worlddeer.org/southandeandeer.html |title=South Andean Deer ''Hippocamelus bisulcus'' |accessdate=2007-06-07 |last=Walker |first=Mark |year=2005 |work=World Deer |publisher=Biology Department, [[Siegen University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no sexual size difference amongst fawns, which are born unspotted.&lt;ref name=THESIS&gt;Van Winden, Jasper. ''Diet and habitat of the huemul (''Hippocamelus bisulcus'') in Bernardo O’ Higgins National Park, Chile'' (2006). THESIS, Department of Science, Technology and Society, [[University of Utrecht]]. ([http://www.chem.uu.nl/nws/www/publica/Studentenrapporten/Studrap2006/I2006-15.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410031918/http://www.chem.uu.nl/nws/www/publica/Studentenrapporten/Studrap2006/I2006-15.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }})Retrieved on: 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual dimorphism]] is notable. Only the bucks have antlers, which are shed each year toward the end of winter. Males also have a distinctive black "face mask", which curves into an elongated heart-shape surrounding a forehead of the principal brown colour.&lt;ref name=THESIS/&gt; Unusually for a [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] [[ungulate]], research has shown south Andean deer will congregate in mixed-sex groups, and the length of time spent inter-mixing increases with group size. The farther the animals are from rocky slopes the larger the size of observed groups, suggesting predation rates are lowest on slopes and greatest in open areas such as valley bottoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frid | first = Alejandro | year = 1999 | title = Huemul (''Hippocamelus bisulcus'') sociality at a periglacial site: sexual aggregation and habitat effects on group size | journal = [[Canadian Journal of Zoology]] | volume = 77 | issue = 7 | pages = 1083–1091 | doi = 10.1139/cjz-77-7-1083 | url = http://rparticle.web-p.cisti.nrc.ca/rparticle/AbstractTemplateServlet?journal=cjz&amp;volume=77&amp;year=&amp;issue=&amp;msno=z99-078&amp;calyLang=fra | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Huemul - IMG 8412-13 - Flickr - v.requesens.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Huemul resting in [[Cochrane, Chile]]]]
The animal ranges across a variety of often difficult habitat. Open [[periglacial]] [[scrubland]], low [[Cliff|bluffs]] and other rocky areas, and upland forests and forest-border are principal range types.&lt;ref name=THESIS/&gt; One study of coastal [[fjord]] populations found males and juveniles preferred periglacial grassland; females were mainly found on bluffs, and fawns exclusively so. [[Gunnera]] plants were a principal dietary item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frid | first = A. | year = 1994 | title = Observations on habitat use and social organization of a huemul Hippocamelus bisulcus coastal population in Chile | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–19 | url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=3528432&amp;q=Hippocamelus+bisulcus&amp;uid=1023712&amp;setcookie=yes | accessdate = 2007-06-07 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3207(94)90003-5 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110520042620/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=3528432&amp;q=Hippocamelus+bisulcus&amp;uid=1023712&amp;setcookie=yes | archivedate = 2011-05-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was previously found over much of southwestern South America, the current status of the south Andean deer is critical. Numbers in Argentina were estimated at 350–600, in fragmented groups, as of 2005.&lt;ref name=predicaments&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flueck | first = W.T. |author2=J. M.

Pressures on huemul populations include economic activities and [[invasive species]]. One study in Argentina's [[Nahuel Huapi National Park]] found thirty-two plant items in its diet. The most common of these, the [[Lenga beech]], was also a primary food item of the [[red deer]], causing displacement to marginal areas and increased vulnerability for the smaller South Andean Deer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gladys | first = Galende | author2 = Ramilo, Eduardo | author3 = Beati, Alejandro|date=April 2005 | title =  Diet of Huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) in Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina | journal = Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/snfe/2005/00000040/00000001/art00001 | accessdate = 2007-06-07 | doi =  10.1080/01650520400000822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both decreased reproduction rates and increased morbidity may be affecting the population in Argentina; predation by the [[cougar]], the South Andean deer's only natural predator, remains a principal cause of mortality in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smith-Flueck | first = Jo Anne M. |author2=W.

== Conservation ==
According to the [[Bonn Convention|International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]], the species’ original global population is estimated to have suffered reductions of 99 per cent in size and more than 50 per cent in distribution range. Therefore, the species is listed as “Endangered” on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name="iucnredlist.org"&gt;South Andean Huemul IUCN Red List: http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/10054/0&lt;/ref&gt; Habitat fragmentation and poaching remain the main threats to the species.

Under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]] (the Bonn Convention), [[South Andean Huemul Memorandum of Understanding|a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of the ''huemul'']] was concluded between Argentina and Chile, and came into effect on 4 December 2010. The MoU aims to improve the conservation status of the species by close cooperation between the two range States, since the species [[animal migration|migrate]] across the border region of these countries.

''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of the South Andean Huemul'' is a Bilateral Environmental [[Memorandum of Understanding]] between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile. It was concluded under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]], on 4 December 2010 and came into effect immediately. The MoU has to improve the conservation status of the ''South Andean Huemul'' by close cooperation between the two range States, since the species migrate across the border region of these countries. The MoU covers two range States (the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile), both of which have signed.

=== Development of MoU ===
To implement the decision of the Fifth Conference of the Parties of CMS to list the [[South Andean Huemul]] ''(Hippocamelus bisulcus)''&lt;ref&gt;South Andean Huemul Nature Footage: http://www.naturefootage.com/stockfootage/Southern_Andean_Huemul/owner%3Dslittlejohn&lt;/ref&gt; on Appendix I of the Convention due to its worrying conservation status, an Article IV agreement was concluded between the two range States, the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile, and entered into effect immediately on 4 December 2010.

Signatories to South Andean Huemul MoU:
* The Argentine Republic (4 December 2010)
* The Republic of Chile (4 December 2010)

=== Aim of MoU ===
With fewer than an estimated 1500 animals in the wild, grouped in small, largely isolated populations in 2010, and due to the fact that the South Andean Huemul’s habitat partly covers border areas between the two range States, both countries recognize the need to work in close collaboration in order to improve the situation and to prevent the species from extinction. Through this MoU both countries can take measures to address illegal hunting, habitat degradation, introduction of diseases and other threats to the species.

=== Species covered by MoU ===
The MoU protects all populations of the Huemul occurring within the range of Argentina and Chile. According to the [[IUCN|International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]], the species’ original global population is estimated to have suffered reductions of 99 per cent in size and more than 50 per cent in distribution range. Therefore the species is listed as “Endangered” on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name="iucnredlist.org"/&gt; Habitat fragmentation and poaching remain the main threats to the species.

=== Fundamental components ===
Both range States agree to work in close collaboration to:&lt;ref&gt;Text of South Andean Huemul Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/Huemul/MoU/MoU_Huemul_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Make efforts aimed at ensuring an effective protection of the populations of South Andean Huemul, shared by both countries, as well as at identifying and conserving those habitat which are essential for the survival of the species
# Identify and monitor the factors and processes which have a detrimental effect on the conservation status of the species, such as illegal hunting, degradation of habitats and introduction of diseases, and recommend appropriate measures to regulate, manage and/or control those factors and processes
# Elaborate a Bilateral Action Plan and report to the CMS Secretariat on its implementation
# Facilitate the sharing of scientific, technical and legal information necessary to coordinate conservation measures and facilitate professional, technical and park ranger staff sharing, and cooperate with national and international specialists and organizations in the implementation of the Action Plan
# Submit, at intervals of no more than one year, a report on the development of the MoU to the CMS Secretariat and the Sub-Commission for the Environment of Argentina and Chile, established within the framework of the Treaty of 2 August 1991 between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Chile on the Environment
# Hold annual meetings alternately in the territories of the two countries

The MoU took effect immediately following the signature by both range States (4 December 2010). It has a duration of three years and will be automatically renewed unless one Signatory withdraws from it.

=== Meetings ===
The MoU states that the two countries shall hold annual meetings, continuing the bilateral technical meetings held since 1992. In the framework of these meetings, the Action Plan implementation shall be evaluated and actions for the following year shall be planned and coordinated. Similarly, exchange of research results, as well as any other technical or legal information, which might be of benefit to the conservation of the species will be shared.

=== Secretariat ===
The secretariat functions are provided by the two Signatories themselves on a rotational basis. During the periods between the annual meetings, the country hosting the next meeting shall serve as interim Secretariat and shall be responsible also for the organization of the meeting. The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn, Germany]] – only acts as a depositary of the MoU.

=== Action Plan ===
National technical agencies of the two countries are developing a joint, bi-national Action Plan, based on existing national plans. This Action Plan will promote the exchange of scientific, technical and legal information as well as training of professional staff and park rangers to coordinate conservation measures. Research will be promoted to better understand the ecology and biology of the species as well as factors preventing the recovery of individual groups. Monitoring will be enhanced to collect more data on distribution, abundance and threats. Educational activities and media campaigns will raise awareness about the Huemul’s poor conservation status.

=== Activities ===
Between September 26 and 27 2011 a workshop entitled “Towards an Action Plan for the Conservation of Huemul in the Austral Zone” was held in [[Valdivia, Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;CMS Press release: http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2011/02_feb/nw_160211_South_Andean_Huemul.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this workshop was to develop the preliminary guidelines for the bi-national Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://biodiversity-l.iisd.org/news/argentina-chile-sign-agreement-to-conserve-the-south-andean-huemul/&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Argentina has taken some actions to implement the national plans. These include monitoring in the Los Alerces National Park, new Huemul survey work in Estancia Los Huemules, and continued updating of a database of records maintained by the National Parks Administration for both protected and unprotected areas. Contributions have been made to a study of the phylogeography and demographic history of the Huemul by Bio-Bio University in Chile. Work has also been underway in Argentina to update the management plans for the [[Lanín National Park]] and the Andino Norpatagónica Biosphere Reserve, with specific reference to measures for Huemul conservation. A project proposal has been developed for controlling livestock in the area occupied by Huemuls in the [[Los Alerces National Park]]. Awareness activities have included public talks, production of a two booklet on the conservation of the species linked to the Andino Norpatagónica Biosphere Reserve, and posters distributed in three of the country’s National Parks.&lt;ref name="cms.int"&gt;COP10 Document on Agreements: http://www.cms.int/bodies/COP/cop10/docs_and_inf_docs/doc_09_%20artiv_agreements_e.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chile, similar activities are underway, with an emphasis on monitoring by rangers of hunting, and future plans for reintroduction work, measures to reduce habitat competition with livestock, awareness raising and strengthening of regulations.&lt;ref name="cms.int"/&gt;

The Clean Water Act requires that state environmental agencies complete TMDLs for impaired waters and that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) review and approve / disapprove those TMDLs.&lt;ref name="EPA overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-impaired-waters-and-tmdls |title=Program Overview: Impaired Waters and TMDLs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-11-28 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because both state and federal governments are involved in completing TMDLs, the TMDL program is an example of [[cooperative federalism]]. If a state doesn't take action to develop TMDLs, or if EPA disapproves state-developed TMDLs, the EPA is responsible for issuing TMDLs. EPA published regulations in 1992 establishing TMDL procedures.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "Water Quality Planning and Management: Total maximum daily loads (TMDL) and individual water quality-based effluent limitations." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|130|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Application of TMDLs has broadened significantly in the last decade to include many watershed-scale efforts, including the [[Chesapeake Bay]] TMDL. TMDLs identify all [[point source pollution|point source]] and [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]] pollutants within a [[drainage basin|watershed]].

==State inventories==
The Clean Water Act requires states to compile lists of water bodies that do not fully support [[beneficial use]]s such as [[aquatic life]], [[fisheries]], [[drinking water]], recreation, industry, or [[agriculture]]; and to prioritize those water bodies for TMDL development. These inventories are known as '''303(d) Lists''' and characterize waters as '''fully supporting,''' '''impaired,''' or in some cases '''threatened''' for beneficial uses.

==Planning process==
Beneficial use determinations must have sufficient credible [[water quality]] data for TMDL planning.

Throughout the U.S., data are often lacking adequate spatial or temporal coverage to reliably establish the sources and magnitude of water quality degradation.

TMDL planning in large watersheds is a process that typically involves the following steps:  
# Watershed Characterization—understanding the basic physical, environmental, and human elements of the watershed.
# Impairment Status—analyzing existing data to determine if waters fully support beneficial uses
# Data Gaps and Monitoring Report—identification of any additional data needs and [[water quality#Sampling and measurement|monitoring]] recommendations
# Source Assessment—identification of sources of pollutants, and magnitude of sources.
# Load Allocation—determination of natural pollutant load, and load from human activities (i.e. diffuse nonpoint sources and point discharges).
# Set Targets—establishment of water quality targets intended to restore or maintain beneficial uses.
# TMDL Implementation Plan—a watershed management strategy to attain established targets.

===Water quality targets===
The purpose of water quality targets is to protect or restore beneficial uses and protect human health.  These targets may include state/federal numerical water quality standards or narrative standards, i.e. within the range of "natural" conditions.  Establishing targets to restore beneficial uses is challenging and sometimes controversial.  For example, the restoration of a fishery may require reducing temperatures, nutrients, sediments, and improving habitat.

Necessary values for each pollutant target to restore fisheries can be uncertain.  The potential for a water body to support a fishery even in a pristine state can be uncertain.

===Background===
Calculating the TMDL for any given body of water involves the combination of factors that contribute to the problem of nutrient concentrated runoff.  Bodies of water are tested for contaminants based on their intended use.  Each body of water is tested similarly but designated with a different TMDL. Drinking water reservoirs are designated differently from areas for public swimming and water bodies intended for fishing are designated differently from water located in wildlife conservation areas.  The size of the water body also is taken into consideration when TMDL calculating is undertaken.  The larger the body of water, the greater the amounts of contaminants can be present and still maintain a Margin of Safety.  The ''Margin of Safety (MOS)'' is numeric estimate included in the TMDL calculation, sometimes 10% of the TMDL, intended to allow a safety buffer between the calculated TMDL and the actual load that will allow the water body to meet its beneficial use (since the natural world is complex and several variables may alter future conditions).  TMDL is the end product of all point and non-point source pollutants of a single contaminant.  Pollutants that originate from a point source are given allowable levels of contaminants to be discharged; this is the ''Waste Load Allocation (WLA).''  Nonpoint source pollutants are also calculated into the TMDL equation with ''Load Allocation (LA).''

===Calculation===
The calculation of a TMDL is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS&lt;/math&gt;
where WLA is the waste load allocation for point sources, LA is the load allocation for nonpoint sources, and MOS is the margin of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. Shirmohammadi |author2=I. Chaubey |author3=R. D. Harmel |author4=D. D. Bosch |author5=R. Muñoz-Carpena |author6=C. Dharmasri |author7=A. Sexton |author8=M. Arabi |author9=M. L. Wolfe |author10=J. Frankenberger |author11=C. Graff |author12=T. M. Sohrabi |title=Uncertainty in TMDL Models |journal=Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers |year=2006 |volume=49 |issue=4 |doi=10.13031/2013.21741 |pages=1033–1049|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=1403&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Load allocations===
Load allocations are equally challenging as setting targets.  Load allocations provide a framework for determining the relative share of natural sources and human sources of pollution.

The natural background load for a pollutant may be imprecisely understood. Industrial dischargers, [[farming|farmers]], [[land development|land developers]], [[Local government in the United States|municipalities]], natural resource agencies, and other watershed stakeholders each have a vested interest in the outcome.

==Implementation==
To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into discharge permits for these sources.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual ''NPDES Permit Writers' Manual.''] "Chapter 6: Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations." September 2010. Document No. EPA-833-K-10-001.&lt;/ref&gt; The permits are issued by EPA or delegated state agencies under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ([[NPDES]]). [[Nonpoint source pollution|Nonpoint source discharges]] (e.g. agriculture) are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario.  The TMDL implementation plan is intended to help bridge this divide and ensure that watershed beneficial uses are restored and maintained. Local watershed groups play a critical role in educating stakeholders, generating funding, and implementing projects to reduce nonpoint sources of pollution.

The '''Truth and Justice Commission''' of Mauritius was an independent [[Truth and reconciliation commission|truth commission]] established in 2009, which explored the impact of [[slavery]] and [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]] in [[Mauritius]]. The Commission was tasked to investigate the dispossession of land, and “determine appropriate measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentured laborers.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/ROL/Truth%20and%20Justice%20Act%2028%20No_%202008-2.pdf|title = Truth and Justice Commission Act 2008|date = 28 August 2008|access-date = |website = |publisher = Government Gazette of Mauritius No. 84 of 28 August 2008|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was “unique in that it [dealt] with socio-economic class abuses" and explored the possibility of reparations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The inclusion of [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]], whether for individuals or communities, was a controversial decision within the country which aimed to correct inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Commission attempted to cover more than 370 years, the longest period of time that a truth commission has ever covered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Commission consisted of five members who were appointed by the then President Sir [[Anerood Jugnauth]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The President selected [[Alex Boraine]], the former deputy chair of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], and four Mauritians to oversee the research and publication of a document consisting of seven volumes, and detailing over three centuries of Mauritian history.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Justice Commission]] documented the "economics of [[colonialism]], slavery, and indentured servitude, the experiences of indentured Africans, Indians, and French engagés, and living and working conditions on sugar estates."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to aid Mauritians in reconciling the past the commission recommended: "1) memorializing slavery; 2) a better understanding and more inclusive account of Mauritian history and culture; 3) a better and increased protections of Mauritian heritage; 4) a less racist and elitist society; 5) a more democratic public life, and; 6) empowerment of Mauritians of African and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] origin, as well as other recommendations to increase economic and social justice, particularly related to land issues and equitable and judicious use of the environment."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of these recommendations have yet to be acted upon.

== Creation of Commission ==
The Truth and Justice Commission of [[Mauritius]], beginning its work in February 2009, sought to explore the impact of [[slavery]] and [[Indentured servant|indentured labour]] on the islands since colonization in 1638.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Truth Commission: Mauritius|url = http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-mauritius|website = United States Institute of Peace|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally the historic narrative presented to Mauritians has been “the history of the ruling class consisting of French ''colons'' and their descendants.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/ROL/TJC_Vol1.pdf|title = Truth and Justice Commission of Mauritius|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery and indentured labourers entry into the popular Mauritian historiography has been a recent phenomenon, something which the commission hoped to rectify.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Uniquely the Mauritian Truth commission sought to “investigate complaints of the dispossession of land, and to ‘determine appropriate measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentures labours.’"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inclusion of reparations, whether for individuals or communities, was a controversial decision within the country which aimed to correct inequality. Despite the advance brought by the last century many of Afro-Malagasy origin are living in poverty, while descendants of the plantation class enjoy higher living conditions, and importantly land ownership. The Truth and Justice Commission wished to correct this land owning imbalance on the islands.

Prime Minister Ramgoolam, calling for the creation of the commission, argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Years have passed since slavery and indentured labor were abolished. The horrors of such brutality and bondage no longer exist today. But such treatment meted out to human beings does have its psychological impact, which can be permanent and as destructive if not more so, compared to physical slavery''.”''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unspeakable Truths: Transitional Justice and the Challenge of Truth Commissions.|last=Heyner|first=Priscilla|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Prime Minister outlined his hopes for the commission stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of our country is based on a continuous quest for freedom and social justice. Our past has been marked by the forcible removal of thousands of people from the mainland of Africa, Madagascar and Asia. These are the darkest and most shameful pages of our history. The introduction of indentured labour under slavish conditions was no less shameful and evil.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the Prime Minister stated his hope that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Commission will pave the way to reconciliation, social justice and national unity through the process of re-establishing the historical truth. It is the legitimate expectation of everyone to know our true history. It is only after we have been faced with this reality that we can consolidate unity in our country. It is important therefore that we recognise our past history and lay that past to rest so that we can move on to reconciliation, justice and national unity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History of Slavery and Indentured Servitude in Mauritius  ==

[[File:Slave population graph.png|thumb|Top line represents deaths.]]The [[Dutch East India Company]] introduced slavery to Mauritius in 1638. The labour force, largely from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], were the preferred form of labour used by the Dutch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The company would maintain their control of the islands until 1710, leaving due to piracy, and the result of wars with both France and Britain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before their exit however, the Dutch made several attempts to develop the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The French were the next colonial power to enter the Mauritians, taking possession of what they named [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]], in 1715.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The French continued the Dutch practice of using slave labour in the islands agricultural sector. The Islands were ceded to the [[French East India Company]] who began dividing the land, the upper classes receiving 126 hectares and the soldiers and workers being given 63 hectares.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout the French rule of the territory, until its loss following the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris of 1814]], the slave trade would continue to grow in economic importance in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following the defeat of [[Napoleon]] and the loss of Mauritius to Great Britain, the territory continued to rely upon slave labour until slavery's abolition in the British Empire in the 1830s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would not end exploitation however, as the [[plantocracy]], reliant upon cheap labour, turned to indentured labourers from India and China to work the fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These labourers, having little rights, would be ruthlessly exploited by the planter class until the late colonial period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Commissioners ==
* Dr. [[Alex Boraine|Alexander Boraine]] - Chairperson from January 2010 until release of the report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Professor [[Robert Carl-Heinz Shell|Robert Shell]] - Chairperson until November 2009.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itcoach.intnet.mu/portal/goc/pm/file/PNQ07-12.pdf|title=Private Notice Questions|last=|first=|date=12 July 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. Vijayalakshmi Teelock - Vice-Chairperson&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Mr. Jacques David - Commissioner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Mr. Rephael Benjamin Moutou - Commissioner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Dr. Parmaseeven P. Veerapen - Commissioner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Mr. Lindsay Morvan - Commissioner until April 2009.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
During the first month of the Commission planning difficulties were experienced due to Professor Shell being unable to assume full-time chairmanship, visiting the Islands on three occasion during his tenure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A search began for a replacement, and with the aid of Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], Dr. Alex Boraine was selected.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Dr. Boraine, a South African Professor of Law, was one of the main architects of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa]], a commission often viewed as a model in the reconciliation process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Lindsay Morvan, due to personal reasons, was forced to resign as a member of the Commission in April 2010, replaced by Jacques David in July 2011.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Mandate  ==
The Truth and Justice Commission sought to “conduct inquiries into slavery and indentured labour in Mauritius during the colonial period.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Commission had as its mandate:
* Make an assessment of the consequences of slavery and indentured labour during the colonial period up to the present;
* Conduct inquiries into slavery and indentured labour in Mauritius during the colonial period and, for that purpose, gather information and receive evidence from any person;
* Determine appropriate reparative measures to be extended to descendants of slaves and indentured labourers;
* Enquire into complaints, other than a frivolous and vexatious complaints, made by any person aggrieved by a dispossession or prescription of any land in which he/she claimed to have an interest; and
* Prepare a comprehensive report of its activities, research and findings, based on factual and objective information and evidence received by it and submit the report to the President.

In addition, the Commission also had an underlying mandate to promote reconciliation. In Mauritius, "reconciliation was seen by many as being possible, only if one did not talk about one’s history. This was no longer possible in contemporary Mauritius."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activities of the Commission ==
[[File:Slave badge.png|thumb|Collar worn by slaves.]]
In order to carry out its mandate the Commission "focused on three aspects: History; consequences, and how to achieve a more just society."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To understand the 'Truth' of the past the Commission adopted the perspective of [[Public history|public historians]], choosing to understand the perception of truth in Mauritian society, over a traditional historical understanding of the past often changing with new data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The commission conducted interviews, archival research, archival digs, and hearings while conducting their research, largely acting as oral historians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/mauritianachlgy/research/Project%20Report%20-%20Le%20Morne%202010%20-%20Low%20Res.pdf|title=Le Morne Cemetery: Archaeological Investigation.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission sought the impute of all members of the public, asking those who wished to participate to submit notices.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Over 400 cases relevant to the mandate were received, resulting in 230 hearings spanning 2 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While conducting inquiries the Commission, wishing to streamline the process, identified 9 areas of interest to be researched. The areas were:
* Slave Trade and Indentured Immigration
* The Economics of slavery and indenture
* Land Issues
* Culture, Ethnicity, and Identity
* Health
* Education
* Demographic history and spatial distribution 
* Monitoring and Communication of the Commission 
* The territories of [[Rodrigues]], [[Agaléga|Agalega]], and [[Chagos Archipelago|Chagos.]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
Originally scheduled to complete their report in June 2011 the Commission requested an extension to September, then October, and finally to completion on 25 November 2011.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The delay was primarily due to administrative problems experienced while finalizing the report.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Findings and Recommendations ==
The Commission published its report in 2011 recommending:
* “That in the light of injustices suffered by descendants of slaves and indentured labourers, the Republic of Mauritius and other institutions make an official apology through the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and private institutions connected with slavery and indenture, such as the Catholic Church, the Chamber of Commerce and the Mauritius Sugar Producers’ Association.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A [[memorial]] and Slave Museum be constructed to remember the inhuman treatment suffered by the victims constituting a crime against Humanity. The Commission further recommended the 23rd of August be recognised as a Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The creation of an enhanced Technical College to train adult Creoles in an attempt to increase equity within Mauritian society. Creole be introduced in schools to aid working class families in understanding course material.
* The State, it is recommended, should consider granting small pieces of land to deserving citizens, and establish a “Land Monitoring and Research Unit” to assist persons in “their search for land which they believe [to be] rightly theirs.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The report makes over 300 recommendations to the Mauritian government. These largely detail ways in which to bring those persons affected by slavery and indentured labour out of poverty.

== Impact and Criticism  ==
The Truth and Justice Commission submitted its report to the President of Mauritius on 25 November 2011. In the subsequent 3 years several government committees were established to study the report and investigate which of the over 300 recommendations were to be implemented.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/labour-and-truth-and-justice-commission|title=Labour and the Truth and Justice Commission|last=VEERAPEN|first=PARMASEEVEN|date=2 May 2015|website=le Mauricien|publisher=le Mauricien|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These committees have provided little feedback and the implementation of recommendations made by the Commission has been so slow in coming that Parmaseeven Veerapen, a former commissioner, has accused the government committees of being little more than an "eyewash."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is unclear if the recommendations forwarded to the government will ever be implemented throughout the country.

[[File:Weimar Constitution.jpg|thumb|The ''''''Weimar Constitution'''''' in booklet form. The constitution itself required that it be provided to school children at the time of their graduation.]]
The '''Constitution of the German Reich''' ({{lang-de|Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs}}), usually known as the '''Weimar Constitution''' (''Weimarer Verfassung'') was the [[constitution]] that governed [[Germany]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] era (1919–1933). The constitution declared Germany to be a democratic [[parliamentary]] republic with a legislature elected under [[proportional representation]]. [[Universal suffrage]] was established, with a minimum voting age of 20. The constitution technically remained in effect throughout the [[Nazi era]] from 1933 to 1945.

The constitution's title was the same as the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] that preceded it.  The German state's official name was ''Deutsches Reich'' until the adoption of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|1949 Basic Law]].

== Origin ==
Following the end of [[World War I]], a [[German National Assembly]] gathered in the town of [[Weimar]], in the state of [[Thuringia]], after the [[German federal election, 1919|19 January 1919 Federal elections]], in order to write a constitution for the ''[[Reich]]''.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; The nation was to be a democratic [[federal republic]], governed by a [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|president]] and [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|parliament]].

The constitution was drafted by the lawyer and liberal politician [[Hugo Preuss]], who was then state secretary in the Ministry of the Interior, and later became Minister of the Interior. Preuss criticized the [[Triple Entente]] decision to prohibit the incorporation of post-[[Austro-Hungarian]]-dissolution [[German Austria]] into the nascent German republic, saying it was a contradiction of the [[Wilsonian]] principle of [[self-determination]] of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E04EFDD153AE03ABC4C52DFBF668382609EDE&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22german+democratic+republic%22&amp;st=p PREUSS DENOUNCES DEMAND OF ALLIES], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 14, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

Disagreements arose between the delegates over issues such as the national flag, religious education for youth, and the rights of the provinces (''Länder'')  that made up the [[Reich]]. These disagreements were resolved by August 1919, though sixty-seven delegates abstained from voting to adopt the Weimar Constitution.

The Republic's first [[President of Germany|President]], [[Friedrich Ebert]], signed the new German constitution into law on 11 August 1919. The constitution is named after Weimar although it was signed into law by Friedrich Ebert in [[Schwarzburg (municipality)|Schwarzburg]]. This is because Ebert was on holiday in Schwarzburg, while the parliament working out the constitution was gathered in Weimar.

Federal elections were held in Germany on [[German federal election, 1920|6 June 1920 in line with the Weimar Constitution]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p762 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerhard Anschütz]] (1867–1948), a noted German teacher of constitutional law, was a prominent commentator of the Weimar Constitution.

== Provisions and organization ==
The Weimar Constitution was divided into two main parts ''(Hauptteile)''. The two parts were divided into seven and five sections, respectively.  In all, there were over 180 articles in the Constitution.

Some of the more noteworthy provisions are described below, including those provisions which proved significant in the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the rise of [[Nazi Germany]].

The [[preamble]] to the Constitution reads:

: ''Das Deutsche Volk einig in seinen Stämmen und von dem Willen beseelt, sein Reich in Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit zu erneuen und zu festigen, dem inneren und dem äußeren Frieden zu dienen und den gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt zu fördern, hat sich diese Verfassung gegeben.''

In English, this can be translated as:

: The German people, united in its tribes and inspired with the will to renew and strengthen its realm ''(Reich)'' in liberty and justice, to serve internal and external peace, and to promote social progress, has adopted this Constitution.

=== Main Part I: Composition of the Reich and its Responsibility ===

The first part (''Erster Hauptteil'') of the Constitution specified the organization of the various components of the Reich government.

==== Section 1: The Reich and its States ====

Section 1 consisted of Articles 1 to 19 and established the German Reich as a republic whose power derived from the people. ("The power of the state emanates from the people.") The Reich was defined as the region encompassed by the German states (''Länder''), and other regions could join the Reich based on popular self-determination and Reich legislation.

Section 1 also established that generally recognized principles of international law were binding on Germany and gave the Reich government  exclusive jurisdiction of:
* foreign relations, colonial affairs, citizenship
* freedom of movement
* immigration, emigration, and extradition.
* defense
* customs and trade
* currency and coinage
* postal, telegraph, and telephone service

With the exceptions of the subjects for which the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction, the states could govern their respective territories as they saw fit.  However, Reich law superseded or nullified state law in the event of a conflict. Adjudication of conflicts between the ''Länder'' and the Reich government was the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

State authorities were required to enforce Reich law and must have a constitution on free state principles. Each state parliament (''[[Landtag]]'') was to be elected by an equal and secret ballot according to representative election. Each state government could serve only so long as it had the confidence of the respective state parliament.

=== Section 2: The Reichstag and the Reich Government ===

Articles 20 to 40 described the national [[parliament]], the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'', which was seated in the capital, [[Berlin]].  The Reichstag was composed of representatives elected by the German people by an equal and secret ballot open to all Germans aged 20 or older.  [[Proportional representation]] principles governed Reichstag elections.

Members of the Reichstag represented the entire nation and were bound only to their own conscience.  Members served for four years. The Reichstag could be dissolved by the Reich president and new elections held not more than 60 days after the date of dissolution.

Members of the Reichstag and of each state parliament (''Landtag'') were immune from arrest or investigation of a criminal offense except with the approval of the legislative body to which the person  belonged. The same approval was required for any other restriction on personal freedom which might harm the member's ability to fulfil his duties. (Article 37)

The President served a term of seven years and could be re-elected once. He could be removed from office by [[plebiscite]] upon the vote of two-thirds of the Reichstag. Rejection of the measure by the voters would act as a re-election of the president and causes the Reichstag to be dissolved.  If a state failed to fulfil its obligations under the constitution or Reich law, the president could use armed force to compel the state to do so.  Furthermore, [[Article 48]] gave the President the power to take measures – including the use of armed force and/or the suspension of civil rights – to restore law and order in the event of a serious threat to public safety or Reich security.  The president was required to inform the Reichstag of these measures and the Reichstag could nullify such a presidential decree. ([[Adolf Hitler]] later used this Article to legally sweep away the civil liberties granted in the constitution and facilitate the establishment of a dictatorship.)

The Reich chancellor determined the political guidelines of his government and was responsible to the Reichstag. The chancellor and ministers were compelled to resign in the event the Reichstag passed a [[vote of no confidence]]. The Reich government (cabinet) formulated decisions by majority vote; in the case of a tie, the Reich president's vote was decisive. The Reichstag could accuse the Reich president, chancellor, or any minister of willful violation of the Constitution or Reich law, said case to be tried in the Supreme Court.

=== Section 3: The President of the Reich and the National Ministry ===
Articles 41 to 59 describe the duties of the President, including criteria for the office. Furthermore, they also further explain his relationship to the National Ministry and its relation to the Chancellor.

==== Section 4: The Reichsrat ====

Section 4 consisted of Articles 60 to 67 and established the ''Reichsrat'' (State Council). The Reichsrat was the means by which the states could participate in the making of legislation at the national level. Members of the Reichsrat were members or representatives of the state parliaments, and were bound by the instructions of their respective state governments. Government ministers were required to inform the Reichsrat of proposed legislation or administrative regulations to permit the Reichsrat to voice objections.

==== Section 5: Reich legislation ====

Articles 68 to 77 specified how legislation is to be passed into law. Laws could be proposed by a member of the Reichstag or by the Reich government and were passed on the majority vote of the Reichstag. Proposed legislation had to be presented to the Reichsrat, and the latter body's objections were required to be presented to the Reichstag.

The Reich president had the power to decree that a proposed law be presented to the voters as a [[plebiscite]] before taking effect.

The Reichsrat was entitled to object to laws passed by the Reichstag. If this objection could not be resolved, the Reich president at his discretion could call for a plebiscite or let the proposed law die. If the Reichstag voted to overrule the Reichsrat's objection by a two-thirds majority, the Reich president was obligated to either proclaim the law into force or to call for a plebiscite.

Constitutional amendments were proposed as ordinary legislation, but for such an amendment to take effect, it was required that two thirds or more of the Reichstag members be present, and that at least two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the legislation.

The Reich government had the authority to establish administrative regulations unless Reich law specified otherwise.

==== Section 6: Reich administration ====

Articles 78 to 101 described the methods by which the Reich government administered the constitution and laws, particularly in the areas where the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction – foreign relations, colonial affairs, defence, taxation and customs, merchant shipping and waterways, railroads, and so forth.

==== Section 7: Justice ====

Articles 102 to 108 established the justice system of the Weimar Republic. The principal provision established [[judicial independence]] – judges were subject only to the law.

This section established a Supreme Court and also established administrative courts to adjudicate disputes between citizens and administrative offices of the state.

=== Main Part II: Basic rights and obligations of Germans ===

The second part (''Zweiter Hauptteil'') of the Weimar Constitution laid out the basic rights (''Grundrechte'') and basic obligations (''Grundpflichten'') of Germans.

The [[constitution]] guaranteed individual rights such as the freedom of speech and assembly to each citizen. These were based on the provisions of the earlier [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|constitution of 1848]].

==== Section 1: The Individual ====

Articles 109 to 118 set forth individual rights of Germans, the principal tenet being that every German was equal before the law. Both genders had the same rights and obligations. Privileges based on birth or social status were abolished. Official recognition of the titles of [[nobility]] ceased, except as a part of a person's name, and further creation of noble titles was discontinued.

A citizen of any of the German provinces was likewise a citizen of the Reich.  Germans had the right of mobility and residence, and the right to acquire property and pursue a trade. They had the right to immigrate or emigrate, and the right to Reich protection against foreign authorities.

The "national identity" of foreign language communities in Germany was protected, including the right to use their native language in education, administration, and the judicial system.

Other specific articles stated that:

&lt;div id="article_114"&gt;
* The rights of the individual are inviolable. Individual liberties may be limited or deprived only on the basis of law.  Persons have the right to be notified within a day of their arrest or detention as to the authority and reasons for their detention and be given the opportunity to object. This is equivalent to the principle of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[common law]] of England and elsewhere. (Article 114){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="article_115"&gt;
* A German's home is an asylum and is inviolable. (Article 115){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="article_117"&gt;
* [[Privacy of correspondence]], of mail, telegraph, and telephone are inviolable. (Article 117){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="article_118"&gt;
* Germans are entitled to free expression of opinion in word, writing, print, image, etc. This right cannot be obstructed by job contract, nor can exercise of this right create a disadvantage. Censorship is prohibited. (Article 118){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}&lt;/div&gt;

==== Section 2: Community Life ====

Articles 119 to 134 guided Germans' interaction with the community and established, among other things, that:
&lt;div id="article_123"&gt;
* Germans had the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed without prior permission. (Article 123){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="article_124"&gt;
* Germans were entitled to form clubs or societies, which were permitted to acquire legal status. This status could not be denied because of the organization's political, socio-political or religious goals. (Article 124){{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}&lt;/div&gt;
* Free and secret elections were guaranteed. (Article 125)
* All citizens were eligible for public office, without discrimination, based on their abilities. [[Gender discrimination]] toward female civil servants was abolished (Article 128). This allowed the first women, like [[Anita Augspurg]] to practice law.
* Civil servants served the whole nation, not a specific party.  They enjoyed freedom of political opinion. (Article 130)
* Citizens could be required to provide services to the state and community, including compulsory military service under regulations set by Reich law.

==== Section 3: Religion and Religious Communities ====

The religious rights of Germans were enumerated in Articles 135 to 141. Residents of the Reich were granted freedom of belief and conscience. Free practice of religion was guaranteed by the constitution and protected by the state, and no state church was established.

Furthermore, the exercise of civil and civic rights and admission to state office were independent of one's religious beliefs. Public declaration of religious beliefs were not required, and no one was forced to join in a religious act or swear a religious oath.

Five articles from this section of the Constitution (Nos. 136-139 and 141) were explicitly incorporated into the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (passed in 1949), &lt;ref name=Article /&gt; and so remain Constitutional Law in Germany today.

==== Section 4: Education and School ====

Articles 142 to 150 guided the operation of educational institutions within the Reich. Public education was provided by state institutions and regulated by the government, with cooperation between the Reich, the province, and the local community. Primary school was compulsory, with advanced schooling available to age 18 free of charge.

The constitution also provided for private schooling, which was likewise regulated by the government.
In private schools operated by religious communities, religious instruction could be taught in accordance with the religious community's principles.

==== Section 5: The Economy ====

Constitutional provisions about economic affairs were given in Articles 151 to 165. One of the fundamental principles was that economic life should conform to the principles of justice, with the goal of achieving a dignified life for all and securing the [[economic freedom]] of the individual.
&lt;div id="article_153"&gt;
The right to property was guaranteed by Article 153. [[Nationalization|Expropriation]] of property could be made only on the basis of law and for the public welfare, with appropriate compensation.{{Ref label|Article_48|†|}}&lt;/div&gt;

The Reich protected labor, intellectual creation, and the rights of authors, inventors, and artists. The right to form unions and to improve working conditions was guaranteed to every individual and to all occupations, and protection of the self-employed was established.
Workers and employees were given the right to participate, on an equal footing with employers, in the regulation of wages and working conditions as well as in economic development.

==== Transition and Final Clauses ====

The final 16 articles (Articles 166 to 181) of the Weimar Constitution provided for the orderly transition to the new constitution, and stipulated in some cases when the various provisions of the new constitution take effect. In cases where legislation had yet to be passed (such as the laws governing the new Supreme Court), these articles stipulated how the constitutional authority would be exercised in the interim by existing institutions. This section also stipulated that new bodies established by the constitution took the place of obsolete bodies (such as the National Assembly) where those bodies were referred to by name in old laws or decrees.

It was mandated that public servants and members of the armed forces are to take an oath on this constitution.
The previous constitution, dated 15 April 1871, was suspended but other Reich laws and decrees that didn't contradict the new constitution remained in force. Other official decrees based on hitherto-valid law remained valid until superseded by law or by decree.

The National Assembly was regarded as the Reichstag until the first Reichstag was elected and convened, and the Reich president elected by the National Assembly was to serve until 30 June 1925.

==Weaknesses==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--only last paragraph has a citation--&gt;
In his book ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', historian [[William L. Shirer]] described the Weimar Constitution as "on paper, the most liberal and democratic document of its kind the twentieth century had ever seen&amp;nbsp;... full of ingenious and admirable devices which seemed to guarantee the working of an almost flawless democracy." Yet, the Weimar Constitution had serious problems.

The allocation of presidential powers was deeply problematic. The Weimar Constitution allowed the president to dismiss the chancellor, even if the chancellor retained the confidence of the Reichstag. Similarly, the president could appoint a chancellor who didn't have the support of the Reichstag. Further, the government structure was [[Semi-presidential|a mix of presidential and parliamentary]] systems, with the president acting as a "[[Ersatz|replacement]] [[Kaiser]]" and assuming some of the powers the monarch would have wielded.  [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]], the so-called ''Notverordnung'' (emergency decree) provision, gave the president broad powers to suspend civil liberties with an insufficient system of [[checks and balances]]. This presented an opportunity that [[Adolf Hitler]] was quick to seize once he became [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|chancellor]]. (see [[Reichstag fire]]).

The use of a [[Proportional representation|proportional electoral system]] without [[election threshold|thresholds]] to win representation has also been cited. This system, intended to avoid the [[wasted vote|wasting of votes]], allowed the rise of a multitude of splinter parties, many of which represented the extreme ends of the political spectrum, which in turn made it difficult for ''any'' party to establish and maintain a workable parliamentary majority. This factionalism was one contributing factor in the frequent changes in government. Shirer cites the presence of some 28 political parties in the 1930 national elections; Otto Friedrich cites 40 different groups in the Reichstag in 1933. There was no [[election threshold|threshold]] to win representation in the Reichstag, and hence no safeguard against a quick rise of an extremist party. It was possible to win a seat in the chamber with as little as 0.4 percent of the vote. In the 1924 elections, for instance, the Bavarian Peasants' League got just 0.7% of the vote—but this was enough for three seats in the Reichstag. However, the rise of the Nazis (NSDAP) to form the largest party during the 1932 elections, can only be attributed to the sentiment of electors in Weimar Germany. Critics of electoral thresholds dispute the argument that the Nazis' token presence in the Reichstags of the 1920s significantly aided their rise to power and that the existence of thresholds in the Weimar constitution would not in fact have hindered Hitler's ambitions - indeed, once the Nazis had met the thresholds they would likely their existence would have actually aided the Nazis by allowing them to marginalize smaller parties even more quickly.

Even without these real and/or perceived problems, the Weimar Constitution was established and in force under disadvantageous social, political, and economic conditions. In his book ''[[The Coming of the Third Reich]]'', historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argues that "all in all, Weimar's constitution was no worse than the constitutions of most other countries in the 1920s, and a good deal more democratic than many. Its more problematical provisions might not have mattered so much had the circumstances been different. But the fatal lack of legitimacy from which the Republic suffered magnified the constitution's faults many times over."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J (2004): ''The Coming of the Third Reich''; New York, The Penguin Press, p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hitler's subversion of the Weimar Constitution ==

Less than a month after [[Adolf Hitler]]’s appointment as chancellor in 1933, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] invoked [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Weimar Constitution, suspending several constitutional protections on [[civil rights]].  The articles affected were [[#article 114|114 (habeas corpus)]], [[#article 115|115 (inviolability of residence)]], [[#article 117|117 (correspondence privacy)]], [[#article 118|118 (freedom of expression /censorship)]], [[#article 123|123 (assembly)]], [[#article 124|124 (associations)]], and [[#article 153|153 (expropriation)]].

The subsequent [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], passed by the Reichstag on 23 March 1933, stated that, in addition to the traditional method of the Reichstag passing legislation, the Reich government could also pass legislation. It further stated that the powers of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] and Reich President were not affected. The normal legislative procedures outlined in Articles 68 to 77 of the constitution did not apply to legislation promulgated by the Reich government.

The Enabling Act was effectively a constitutional amendment because of the foregoing alterations to the normal legislative process. The act met the constitutional requirements (two-thirds of the Reichstag's members were present, and two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the measure).  The Act did not explicitly amend the Weimar Constitution, but there was explicit mention to the fact that the procedure sufficient for constitutional reform was followed.  The constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that all its other provisions were a dead letter.

Two of the penultimate acts Hitler took to consolidate his power in 1934 actually violated the Enabling Act. Article 2 of the act stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Laws enacted by the government of the Reich may deviate from the constitution as long as they do not affect the institutions of the Reichstag and the Reichsrat. The rights of the President remain undisturbed.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hindenburg died on 2 August, and Hitler appropriated the president's powers for himself in accordance with a law passed the previous day. However, in 1932 the constitution had been amended to make the president of the High Court of Justice, not the chancellor, acting president pending new elections. Nonetheless, the Enabling Act did not specify any recourse that could be taken if the chancellor violated Article 2, and no legal challenge was ever mounted.

==Legacy==
After the passage of the Enabling Act, the constitution was largely forgotten. Nonetheless, Hitler used it to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. Three Reichstag elections were held during his rule. However, voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and "guest candidates". Secret voting technically remained possible, but the Nazis utilized aggressive extralegal measures at the polling stations to intimidate the electors from attempting to vote in secret. Thousands of his decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48.

In Hitler's 1945 [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler#Testament|political testament]] (written shortly before his suicide), he appointed Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] to succeed him.  However, he named Dönitz as President, not Führer, thereby re-establishing a constitutional office which had lain dormant since Hindenburg's death ten years earlier. On 30 April 1945, Dönitz formed what became known as the [[Flensburg government]], which controlled only a tiny area of Germany near the Danish border, including the town of [[Flensburg]]. It was dissolved by the Allies on 23 May. On 5 June, the Allied [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]] abolished all the institutions of German civil government, and this established that the constitution no longer held any legal force.

The 1949 [[Constitution of the German Democratic Republic]] contained many passages that were directly copied from the 1919 constitution.&lt;ref&gt; Markovits, Inga. [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1144&amp;context=wmlr Constitution Making After National Catastrophes: Germany in 1949 and 1990], William &amp; Mary Law Review 1307. Volume 49. Issue 4. Article 9 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to be the constitution of a united Germany, and was thus a compromise between liberal-democratic and Marxist–Leninist ideologies. It was replaced by a new, explicitly Communist constitution in 1968, which remained in force until [[German reunification|the reunification of East and West]] in 1990.

The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], enacted in 1949, said 'provisions of Articles 136, 137, 138, 139 and 141 of the German Constitution of 11 August 1919 shall be an integral part of this Basic Law'.&lt;ref name=Article&gt;See Article 140 of the [http://www.bundestag.de/interakt/infomat/fremdsprachiges_material/downloads/ggEn_downloand.pdf Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany] (last amended on 23 December 2014), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; These articles of the Weimar constitution (which dealt with the state's relationship to the different Christian denominations) remain part of the German Basic Law.

In the judicial system based on the Basic Law, the Weimar constitution initially retained the force of law (with the exception of the Church articles on a non-constitutional level), where the Basic Law contained nothing to the contrary. These norms were, however, largely redundant or dealing with matters reserved to the ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'', and as such officially set out of force within two decades; aside from the Church articles, the rule that [[Nobility in Germany|titles of nobility]] are to be considered part of the name and must no longer be bestowed (Art. 109 III) is the only one left in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wrv/index.html#BJNR013830919BJNE000200314 ''Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs. Art 109'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official constitution of the [[Republic of Korea]] was originally based on the Weimar Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Idea Behind the Constitution: an interview with Chaihark Hahm | journal = Neatherlands Institute For Advanced Study In The Humanities And Social Science | first = Johan | last = Kwantes | issue = 43| id = | url = http://www.hiil.org/assets/782/The_confused_Korean_Constitutional_Identity-article_in_NIAS_newsletter_2_.pdf | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Green Building Council''' ('''WorldGBC''') is a non-profit organisation and global network of national [[Green Building Council]]s (GBCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/|title=Home {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has member councils in over 70 countries worldwide, which collectively have 49,000 members (25,000 member companies and 24,000 individual members).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/news-media/worldgbc-annual-report-201617|title=WorldGBC Annual Report 2016/17 {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation is committed to achieving the following goals by 2050: limiting global temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius; reducing the building and construction sector’s [[carbon dioxide|CO2]] emissions by 84 gigatonnes; and ensuring all buildings have net zero emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/our-mission|title=Our Mission {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals will ensure the buildings and construction sector plays its part in delivering on the ambition of the [[Paris Agreement]].

==History==
In 1993, the first Green Building Council was founded in the US, formed by Rick Fedrizzi, David Gottfried and Mike Italiano with a mission to promote sustainability-focused practices in the building and construction industry. Around the world, other green leaders in the industry looked at the impact of the [[U.S. Green Building Council|USGBC]] and decided to start similar movements in their own countries, led by a GBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/our-story|title=Our Story {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals from across the globe were supported by the USGBC. Gottfried seeded and managed the formation of the “United Nations of the Green Building Councils” with the mission of supporting the development of GBCs, and uniting them with a common voice and purpose.

In 1999, the founding meeting of WorldGBC was held in California, US. In 2002, WorldGBC was officially formed with eight founding GBCs: Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and USA.

In 2007, a Secretariat for WorldGBC was formally established in Toronto, Canada, supported by the [[Toronto and Region Conservation Authority]] – which continues to work with WorldGBC. Start-up funding of over $1 million dollars per year for three years was provided by the [[Province of Ontario]], Canada.

Since then, WorldGBC has seen growth and evolution in its focus and structure. In 2009, WorldGBC launched five regional networks and three membership levels (Prospective, Emerging and Established). In 2010 a Corporate Advisory Board was formed to deliver strategic insight from the industry to the WorldGBC Board. By 2012, there were 71 member GBCs.

The WorldGBC began to produce reports such as ''The Business Case for Green Building'' in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/news-media/business-case-green-building-review-costs-and-benefits-developers-investors-and-occupants|title=The Business Case for Green Building: A Review of the Costs and Benefits for Developers, Investors and Occupants {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Health, Wellbeing and Productivity in Offices'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/news-media/health-wellbeing-and-productivity-offices-next-chapter-green-building|title=Health, Wellbeing and Productivity in Offices: The Next Chapter for Green Building {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the WorldGBC Board agreed a new strategic plan for the organisation with five focus areas: Membership; Regional Networks; Projects and Partnerships; Marketing, Communications and Influence; and Governance and Operations.

==Mission and structure==
WorldGBC’s mission is to "create green buildings for everyone, everywhere"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/our-mission|title=Our Mission {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - enabling people to thrive both today and tomorrow.

WorldGBC has a board of directors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/about-us/our-board|title=Our Board {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising building industry professionals who hold senior positions on the staff or boards of member GBCs (or who are closely affiliated with them). The board’s role is to advise and oversee WorldGBC’s organisational strategy and governance, and to ensure it is operating effectively as a not for profit organisation and delivering on its mission.

===Member Green Building Councils===
GBCs are independent, non-profit organisations made up of businesses and organisations working in the building and construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/our-green-building-councils|title=Our Green Building Councils {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As members of WorldGBC, they work to advance green building in their own countries, as well as working with other GBCs to achieve environmental, economic and social goals on a larger, global scale.

GBCs are organised into five Regional Networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/our-regional-networks|title=Our Regional Networks {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - powerful, collaborative platforms where they can effectively exchange knowledge, generate new ideas and design solutions that speed up green building in their own markets and across the region. WorldGBC’s five main areas are the Americas, Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa.

Member GBCs also stand at one of WorldGBC’s three levels of development: Prospective, Emerging and Established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/news-media/worldgbc-annual-report-201617|title=WorldGBC Annual Report 2016/17 {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate Advisory Board===
WorldGBC’s Corporate Advisory Board is a select group of companies which are leaders on sustainability and which serve to guide WorldGBC on its strategy and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/about-us/our-corporate-advisory-board|title=Our Corporate Advisory Board {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial support of the Corporate Advisory Board enables WorldGBC to advance green buildings as an effective solution to environmental, social and economic issues, and help member Green Building Councils to grow and flourish.

There are currenrtly members of the Corporate Advisory Board: AkzoNobel, City Developments Ltd, JLL, JPMorgan Chase, Keppel Land, Lendlease, Majid Al Futtaim, Philips, Saint-Gobain, Shaw Contract, United Technologies Corporation and Volvo Construction Equipment.

===Supporters===
In addition to its Corporate Advisory Board, WorldGBC has a range of other supporters such as global project sponsors, regional project sponsors, regional partners and pro bono supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/news-media/worldgbc-annual-report-201617|title=WorldGBC Annual Report 2016/17 {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staff===
WorldGBC has 17 members of staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/about-us/our-team|title=Our Team {{!}} World Green Building Council|website=www.worldgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in two main offices, in London and Toronto. The organisation is led by CEO Terri Wills. Five members of staff are regional heads, based in Colombia, Kenya, Singapore, London and Jordan.

==Activities==

===Global projects===

'''''X. and Church of Scientology v. Sweden''''' (7805/77) was a case decided by [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in 1979.

==Facts==

In 1973, the [[Church of Scientology]] of Sweden placed an advertisement for an [[E-meter]] in its periodical. The [[Consumer Agency (Sweden)|Consumer Ombudsman]], acting upon complaints, requested Market Court an injunction prohibiting the use of certain passages in the advertisement, namely that it was ''an invaluable aid to measuring man's mental state and changes in it''. The court granted the injunction, and the Church's petition was rejected by the Supreme Court.

==Decision==

The commission declared the application inadmissible. Concerning Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]] ([[freedom of religion]]), it mentioned that ''the Market Court did not prevent the Church from selling the E-meter or even advertising it for sale as such'' and stated that ''the concept, contained in the first paragraph of Article 9, concerning the manifestation of a belief in practice does not confer protection on statement of purported religious belief which appear as selling 'arguments' in advertisements of a purely commercial nature by a religious group'', therefore founding no interference with Church's rights.

Concerning Article 10 ([[freedom of expression]]), the Commission found an interference with applicant's rights. However, it found the interference necessary in a democratic society, stating that ''the test of 'necessity' in the second paragraph of Article 10 should therefore be a less strict one when applied to restraints imposed on commercial 'ideas' '' (compared with 'political' ideas).

The case was also significant, since the Commission recognised in its decision the right of a church to petition on behalf of its members, changing the previous practice.

'''''Zorach v. Clauson''''', 343 U.S. 306 (1952),&lt;ref name="Zorach"&gt;{{ussc|name=Zorach v. Clauson|volume=343|page=306|pin=|year=1952}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] considered a school district allowing students to leave school for part of the day to receive religious instruction.

==Background==
[[New York State]] law permitted schools to allow some students to leave school during school hours for purposes of religious instruction or practice while requiring others to stay in school. Accordingly, students in New York City were allowed to leave only on written request of their guardians but the schools did not fund or otherwise assist in the development of these programs. The Greater New York Coordinating Committee on Released Time of Jews, Protestants and Roman Catholics shared their attendance with [[New York City Department of Education]] to prevent students from [[playing hooky]], however.&lt;ref name="Zorach"/&gt; Several parents sued the district for providing official sanction for religious instruction.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court upheld the arrangement by finding that it did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]] of the First Amendment or the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment because the instruction was not held within the school building and received no public funds.  [[William O. Douglas]], writing for the majority, reasoned that "this 'released time' program involves neither religious instruction in public school classrooms nor the expenditure of public funds.... The case is therefore unlike ''McCollum v. Board of Education''."&lt;ref name="Zorach"/&gt;

Three Justices dissented from the decision; [[Hugo Black]], [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Robert H. Jackson]] considered the law unconstitutional. All three cited ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' (1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McCollum v. Board of Education|volume=333|page=203|pin=|year=1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the Court did not adequately distinguish between the circumstances in ''McCollum'' and the ones in ''Zorach''. Jackson's dissent was especially strong: "Today's judgment will be more interesting to students of psychology and of the judicial processes than to students of constitutional law."&lt;ref name="Zorach"/&gt;
