      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4930">'''Abbreviations for Classical authors and texts''' are abbreviations used to refer to ancient authors and their works that are used in academic publications in the field of [[Classics]] ([[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] language, literature, history, [[classical archaeology|archaeology]]). Two systems are in common use, based on the abbreviations lists of standard reference works:

* The [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.oxfordre.com/staticfiles/images/ORECLA/OCD.ABBREVIATIONS.pdf |title=OCD Abbreviations |website=classics.oxfordre.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''OCD''), which covers both Greek and Latin authors and texts.
* [[Liddell &amp; Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/01-authors_and_works.html | title=Authors and Works}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LSJ) (or [[Diccionario Griego-Español]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dge.cchs.csic.es/lst/2lst-int.htm | title=DGE: Bibliographical Lists}} ''DGE'' uses the same abbreviations as LSJ, but is more up to date and covers a much larger selection of texts (“all Greek writers and documentary texts from Mycenaean times until the end of the antiquity”).&lt;/ref&gt; [''DGE'']) for Greek authors and texts, combined with either the [[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thesaurus.badw.de/hilfsmittel-fuer-benutzer/index.html | title=Index: Thesaurus linguae Latinae}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''ThLL'') or the [[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/page/abbreviations | title=Abbreviations - Oxford Scholarly Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''OLD'') for Latin authors and texts.

The two systems overlap substantially: [[Homer]] and [[Plato]], for instance, are "Hom." and "Pl." in both the ''OCD'' and LSJ; [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]] are "Cic." and "Hor." in the ''OCD'', the ''ThLL'', and the ''OLD''. Occasionally, however, abbreviations in LSJ are shorter than in the ''OCD'': for instance, [[Aeschylus]] and [[Euripides]] are "A." and "E." in LSJ, "Aesch." and "Eur." in the ''OCD''. As a consequence, abbreviations in the ''OCD'' can be clearer than those in LSJ. However, the ''OCD'' has fewer abbreviations for authors and texts than LSJ and the ''OLD'' or ''ThLL'' combined, so publications dealing with minor authors and texts not included in the ''OCD'' often have to resort to the other, fuller system. 

Both for Greek and for Latin texts, in both the systems referred to above, abbreviations are conventionally based on the Latin name of the author and title of the work. For instance, [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Frogs|Frogs]]'' is abbreviated ''Ra.'' or ''Ran.'' (from ''Ranae'') and [[Horace]]'s ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' are abbreviated ''Carm.'' (from ''Carmina''). This is due to the former status of Latin as the language of scholarly communication in the discipline as well as to the usefulness of having a set of references that is valid across present-day national and linguistic boundaries.

When a work is falsely attributed to an author by ancient sources, his abbreviated name is often put between square brackets: for instance, the ''[[Shield of Heracles]]'' falsely attributed to [[Hesiod]] is abbreviated as [Hes.] ''Sc.'' (from ''Scutum''). An alternative is "Pseudo-" (abbreviated "Ps.") attached to the purported author's name, such as the anonymous "Pseudo-Longinus" who authored the treatise ''[[On the Sublime]]''. 

Fragments and certain kinds of texts, such as [[dictionary|lexica]] and [[scholia]], are generally referenced with the surname(s) of the editor(s) of the edition used, so as to disambiguate it from other editions of the same text which may have different numbering systems. The surname(s) can be cited entire or abbreviated: for instance, [[Bruno Snell|Snell]]-[[Herwig Maehler|Maehler]] or Sn.-M. for the fragments of Pindar. 

As well as authors' names and the titles of works, Classical publications often use abbreviations for other items that are relevant to Classical antiquity. These also tend to come in standardised form:

* For [[papyrus|papyri]] and similar materials such as [[ostracon|ostraca]], the ''Checklist of Editions of Greek, Latin, Demotic and Coptic Papyri, Ostraka and Tablets''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://papyri.info/docs/checklist | title=Papyri.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* For [[epigraphy|inscriptions]], the abbreviations list of the ''[[Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum]]'' (''SEG'')&lt;ref&gt;https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/supplementum-epigraphicum-graecum/abbreviations-aabbr (paywalled)&lt;/ref&gt;.
* For [[academic journals|journals]], the abbreviations list of the ''[[L'Année Philologique|Année Philologique]]''&lt;ref&gt;Available on the [https://about.brepolis.net/lannee-philologique-aph/ ''Année Philologique'' website]. The most recent list (as of 25 November 2018) is: https://aboutbrepolis.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/aph_abbrc3a9viations.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses''''' is a [[book]] written by [[Richard Arum]] and Josipa Roksa, published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in January 2011.

The book examines the current state of [[higher education in the United States]]. The book and its findings received extensive national media coverage and sparked a debate about what undergraduate students learn once they get into college.

The research draws on transcript data, the [[Collegiate Learning Assessment]], and survey responses from more than 2,300 undergraduates at twenty-four institutions in their first semester and again at the end of their second year. The analysis reveals that 45 percent of these students demonstrated no significant improvement in a range of skills—including [[critical thinking]], complex reasoning, and writing—during their first two years of college.

The '''Bahrain National Museum''' ({{lang-ar|متحف البحرين الوطني}}, also referred to as '''National Museum of Bahrain''') is the largest and one of the oldest public [[museum]]s in [[Bahrain]]. It is constructed near the King Faisal Highway in [[Manama]] and opened in December 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Museum of Bahrain |url=http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/9069/doc/DPC1383.PDF |work=ArchNet |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120064247/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/9069/doc/DPC1383.PDF |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States dollar|US$]]30 million museum complex covers 27,800 sq meters and consists of two buildings. The [[National Theatre of Bahrain]] lies next to the museum.

==Exhibitions==

The museum possess a rich collection of [[Bahrain]]'s ancient [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s acquired since 1988, and covers nearly 5000 years of [[History of Bahrain|Bahrain's history]]. The complex includes three halls devoted to archaeology and the ancient civilisation of the [[Dilmun]], while two other halls depict the [[Culture of Bahrain|culture]] and lifestyle of Bahrain's recent pre-industrial past. A notable exhibit is the [[Durand Stone]], a long black [[basalt]] sculpture dating back to the [[Babylonia]]n era.

In 1993, a further hall was opened, the [[Natural History]] Hall, focusing on the [[Bahrain#Biodiversity|natural environment]] of Bahrain. This hall features specimens of Bahrain's [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. Among the exhibits in the ancient history section is an actual [[Dilmun Burial Mounds|burial mound]] which was transported from its site in the desert and reassembled in the museum. Another feature is a [[Tableau vivant|tableau]] which depicts a scene from the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] (in which reference to Bahrain is made as the paradise of [[Dilmun]]).

Old [[Quran]]ic manuscripts, notes on [[astronomy]] and historical documents and letters are exhibited in the ''Documents and Manuscripts Hall''. The building was designed by [[KHR Arkitekter]] of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khr.dk/#/142128/ |title=Kronologisk |publisher=KHR Arkitekter |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building contains the original nine major galleries, educational hall, [[gift shop]] and a [[cafeteria]], in addition to administrative offices, laboratories and warehouses for the Conservation of holdings and parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain Museum |url=http://bahraindiscovery.com/bahrain_museum.html |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120005035/http://bahraindiscovery.com/bahrain_museum.html |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6300">'''BeeLine Reader''' is a software system which adds color gradients to digital text to improve reading ability and focus. The text at the end of each line is colored the same as the beginning of the next, so the color of the text acts as a flagpost that directs the reader's eyes through the text more easily. In each line, the color of the text transitions from one color to another, with each character being slightly different than the preceding and following characters.

'''Bloc '''is an online interactive platform that offers a variety of online [[Coding Bootcamp|coding bootcamps]] in several areas including [[web development]], [[Mobile application development|mobile development]], and [[design]].

It also adopted the apprenticeship model where students are paired with an experienced mentor who provides support and guidance throughout the curriculum using [[Skype]].

== History ==
Bloc was founded in February 2012 by Roshan Choxi and Dave Paola.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc|url = https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bloc-2|website = www.crunchbase.com|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 2008, before moving to [[San Francisco]] where the company is currently headquartered. Subsequently, Paola and Choxi began tutoring students over Skype in 2012, then later introduced Bloc at the Launch Festival in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = S.F. startup Bloc offers a new way to learn coding online|url = http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/S-F-startup-Bloc-offers-a-new-way-to-learn-5109574.php|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company raised $250,000 in [[Seed money|seed funding]] in May 2012, $2 million in another seed funding in December 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Code School Bloc Raises $2 Million For Its Web Development "Apprenticeship" Program|url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/05/online-code-school-bloc-raises-2-million-for-its-web-development-apprenticeship-program/|accessdate = 2015-04-14|first = Sarah|last = Perez}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $6 million in [[Series A round|Series A]] funding in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc Raises $6 Million Series A Round Led by Shasta Ventures|url = http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/bloc-raises-6-million-series-a-round-led-by-shasta-ventures-1969387.htm|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest round of funding was Harrison Metal with First Round Capital.

In 2017 Bloc had 96 people enrol in their User experience design course of which 14 completed.

In April 2018, Bloc was acquired by online bootcamp Thinkful for an undisclosed sum. Officials at Thinkful said Bloc was not profitable and “almost breaking even” at the time the deal closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-10-online-coding-bootcamp-thinkful-acquires-leading-competitor-bloc|title=Online Coding Bootcamp Thinkful Acquires Leading Competitor, Bloc - EdSurge News|date=2018-04-10|work=EdSurge|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courses ==
Bloc has a total of 5 courses, and they are separated into 2 phases, foundation and building real projects phase. In the last 2 weeks of the courses, students and their mentors will work on a capstone project of their choice. All courses cost $5,000.

=== Rails Web Development ===
In the Foundation Phase, students will design, build, and ship their own version of web app. Mentors will guide students on how to use [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[JavaScript]], [[jQuery]], [[Ruby on Rails]], and [[SQL]] to build the app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc {{!}} The World's Largest Online Web Development Bootcamp|url = https://www.bloc.io/web-development-bootcamp|website = Bloc|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Building Real Projects Phase, students will build web apps including versions of [[Wikipedia]], [[Google Analytics]] and [[Digg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc {{!}} The World's Largest Online Web Development Bootcamp|url = https://www.bloc.io/web-development-bootcamp|website = Bloc|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frontend Web Development ===
In the Foundation Phase, students will learn the foundation of frontend development by building a clone of [[Rdio]], a streaming music service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc {{!}} The World's Largest Online Frontend Developer Bootcamp|url = https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp|website = Bloc|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Building Real Projects Phase, students will learn frontend frameworks and libraries including jQuery, [[AngularJS]], and JavaScript testing frameworks.

=== User Experience Design ===
In the Foundation Phase, students will learn the fundamentals of design and the essence of problem solving, while creating brands and websites using [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]], HTML, CSS and Javascript. Students will have an understanding of responsive design while learning how to launch their finished projects using [[GitHub|Github]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc {{!}} The World's Largest Online UX Design Bootcamp|url = https://www.bloc.io/ux-design-bootcamp|website = Bloc|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Building Real Projects Phase, students will build projects such as mobile app concepts. Students will learn the principles of user experience and create user flows and wireframes for a web application to understand how these personas can affect the final product. In the last 2 weeks, instead of the usual capstone project, students will build their personal brand and portfolio using the skills acquired from the course.

=== Android Development ===
In the Foundation Phase, students will set up a developer environment using [[Android Studio]], Github, and their own [[Moto G (2nd generation)|Moto G]] android phone. After gaining an understanding of Java programming concepts, they will also code their first app and deploy to their test phone. In the Building Real Projects Phase, students reinforce their Android developer skills by choosing from a menu of apps to build.

=== iOS Development ===
In the Foundation Phase, students will set up a developer environment using [[Xcode#6.x series|Xcode6]], [[Git (software)|Git]] and GitHub. Fundamental programming topics such as variables, loops, arrays and objects, are explored using both [[Objective-C]] and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]]. Students will then learn how to build real apps, [[Test-driven development|test-driven Development]], [[debugging]] and launching their apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learn iOS Programming with a Mentor {{!}} Bloc|url = https://www.bloc.io/ios-bootcamp|website = Bloc|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Build &amp; Ship Phase, students take on open-ended projects with the help of their mentors, learning how to work with [[Application programming interface|APIs]], game dynamics, [[iCloud]] integration and mobile back-ends.

== Scholarships ==
Bloc offers 2 scholarships, the [[New Relic]] Diversity Scholarship in Software Development and Design and the Veterans Scholarship in Software Development and Design.

=== New Relic Diversity Scholarship in Software Development and Design ===
In 2013, Bloc and New Relic created this ongoing scholarship to promote diversity in [[software development]] and [[User experience design|UX design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc {{!}} Programming Bootcamp Diversity Scholarship|url = http://try.bloc.io/new-relic-bootcamp-diversity-scholarship/|website = try.bloc.io|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scholarship caters to females, veterans of the U.S. military and ethnic minority groups underrepresented in the software engineering field. Recipients of the scholarship will receive $500 partial scholarship toward any Bloc program. Since its inception, it has handed out over 1000 scholarships.

=== Veterans Scholarship in Software Development and Design ===
Targeted at the U.S. military veterans, this scholarship aims to help by equipping the U.S. veterans with the necessary tools to launch their tech careers. Recipients of the scholarship will receive $500 partial scholarship towards any Bloc program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bloc {{!}} Online Dev Bootcamp Scholarship for Veterans|url = http://try.bloc.io/dev-bootcamp-for-veterans/|website = try.bloc.io|accessdate = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blue sign''' or '''blue board''' is used by inland waterways vessels within the [[Trans-European Inland Waterway network]] when performing a special manoeuvre or passing on the starboard side.  On navigable [[waterways]] vessels normally pass each other on the [[Port and starboard|port]]-side, so the display of the blue sign and flashing white light signal intention to pass each other on the [[starboard]]-side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varendoejesamen.nl/sites/default/files/folders/EN%20The%20Blue%20Sign.pdf|title=The Blue Sign|year=2014|author1=Varen doe je samen!|author2=Numericanal|author3=Department of Waterways|author4=Rotterdam Harbour|author5=Groningen Seaports|author6=Amsterdam Harbour|author7=Koninklijke Schuttevaer|author8=ANWB|author9=Watersportverbond|author10=HISWA|author11=SRN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723230511/http://www.varendoejesamen.nl/sites/default/files/folders/EN%20The%20Blue%20Sign.pdf|archivedate=2015-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as '''blue boarding''' or historically '''blue flagging'''.&lt;ref name="harwood"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yG91CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162|chapter=Appendix|title=Cruising the Inland Waterways of France &amp; Belgium|edition=18th|isbn=978-1-326-11343-8|publisher=[[The Cruising Association]]|year=2015|first=Margaret|last=Harwood|page=162|quote=Blue Flagging.

Or, more simply, that the skipper is keeping to the left instead of the right because he wants the current, or can't steer properly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{lang|fr|[[Code Européen des Voies de la Navigation Intérieure]]}}'' (CEVNI) regulations require upstream vessels operating on the opposite side to display a light-blue sign and scintillating (flashing) white light.&lt;ref name="cevni-6.06"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/finaldocs/sc3/ECE-TRANS-SC3-115-Rev.5e_WEB.pdf|title=European Code for Inland Waterways|edition=5th|publisher=[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]|author=Inland Transport Committee|author2=Working Party on Inland Water Transport|isbn=978-92-1-117090-0|issue=ECE/TRANS/SC.3/115/Rev.5|chapter=Rules of the Road|pages=53|quote=Article 6.04 – Meeting: Normal rules … 4.

The presence and status of the blue sign is transmitted by the ship's Inland-[[Automatic Identification System]] (Inland-AIS) transponder to other vessels.  The status of the sign is transmitted using two bits of the "regional application flags"/"special manoeuvre field" in the AIS position reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.ccr-zkr.org/files/documents/ris/ais20_e.pdf|title=Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine (CCNR) Test Standard Inland AIS|edition=2.0|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=22 July 2015|series=Vessel Tracking and Tracing Standard for Inland Navigation|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This must be transmitted every ten seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32007R0415&amp;from=EN|title=Commission Regulation (EC) No 415/2007|format=concerning the technical specifications for vessel tracking and tracing systems referred to in Article 5 of Directive 2005/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on harmonised river information services (RIS) on inland waterways in the Community of 13 March 2007|date=23 April 2007|accessdate=22 July 2015|work=Official Journal of the European Union|quote=1.3.2.

The '''Boston Bar Association''' ('''BBA''') is a volunteer non-governmental organization in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States. With headquarters located at 16 [[Beacon Street]] in the historic [[Chester Harding House]], across from the [[Massachusetts State House]] on [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]], the BBA has 11,000&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonbar.org/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; members drawn from private practice, corporations, government agencies, [[legal aid]] organizations, the courts and law schools. It traces its origins to meetings convened by [[John Adams]], the lawyer who provided ''[[pro bono]]'' representation to the British soldiers prosecuted for the [[Boston Massacre]] and went on to become the second president of the United States.

'''Constantin I. Dobrescu''', better known as '''Dobrescu-Argeș''' (June 28, 1856 – December 10, 1903), was a [[Romania]]n peasant activist and politician, also active as a teacher, journalist, and jurist. Active from his native [[Mușătești]], in [[Argeș County]], he established a regional, and finally national, base for [[Agrarianism|agrarian politics]]. He is considered Romania's second agrarianist, after [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], and, with [[Dincă Schileru]], a revivalist of the peasant cause in the [[Romanian Kingdom]] era. Dobrescu was notoriously unpersuaded by [[agrarian socialism]], preferring a mixture of [[communalism]] and [[Romanian nationalism]], with some echoes of conservatism. Thus, he stopped short of advocating [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], focusing his battles on democratization through [[universal suffrage]], and on obtaining state support for the [[cooperative movement]]. He himself founded some of the Kingdom's first [[cooperative]]s, also setting up model schools, the first rural theater, and the first village printing press—which put out his various periodicals.

Although well liked by cultural and political figures of all hues, with whom he collaborated on various projects, Dobrescu's clandestine support for the concept "[[Greater Romania]]" made him a political liability. Technicalities were invoked to block him out of the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]], despite his repeatedly winning in elections. Eventually, he served four contiguous terms in the 1880s and '90s, moving from alliances with the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative]] and [[Radical Party (Romania)|Radical Parties]] to the position of an isolated independent, and, in 1895, to leader of his own ''Partida Țărănească'' ("Peasants' Party").

Dobrescu's nationalism and his association with ill-reputed figures such as [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]] contributed to his marginalization, as did his reputation as a "carnival peasant", one who had backstage dealings with the establishment. Such ridicule and one public beating closely preceded scandals involving his financial misdeeds, alleged or proven. Upon the end of a publicized trial lasting to 1903, Dobrescu was found guilty of fraud, and emerged from prison after three months with his health compromised, dying in his peasant home. He remained cited as a martyr and precursor of agrarian and [[Poporanist]] movements, revived during the interwar. He was also credited as a forerunner of the [[National Peasants' Party]].

==Biography==
===Beginnings===
Born in Mușătești, his father Ion Dobrescu was a [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;[[Dinu C. Giurescu]], ''Dicționar biografic de istorie a României'', pp. 176–177. Bucharest: Editura Meronia, 2008.  {{ISBN|978-973-7839-39-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The family ancestors included ''[[Pitar (rank)|Pitar]]'' Nicolae Popescu, who had fought in the [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|Wallachian uprising of 1821]], becoming secretary to its leader, [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]; Vladimirescu would serve as an inspiration to Dobrescu in his own efforts of social improvement.&lt;ref name="ou170"&gt;Octavian Ungureanu, "Tudor Vladimirescu în conștiința argeșenilor. Momente și semnificații", in ''Argessis. Studii și Comunicări, Seria Istorie'', Vol. VIII, 1999, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; A grandfather, Toma, also credited as an influence on the young Dobrescu, had participated in the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]] and had gone into hiding upon its defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, p. 213. See also Teodorescu, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Dobrescu was much inspired by the political articles of [[Mihai Eminescu]], which he also read out, and put into more accessible language, for his peasant constituents.&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending primary school in his native village, where he used dirt and his own fingers as writing utensils,&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, pp. 213–214&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrescu continued his education at [[Curtea de Argeș]] and [[Pitești]]. He studied at the theological seminary in the former town, one of several peasant inductees.&lt;ref name="id214"&gt;Dobridor, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 or 1875, he became a teacher in Mușătești.&lt;ref name="g"/&gt;&lt;ref name="id214"/&gt; During this period, he became interested in the cause of peasant representation, militating against the [[weighted suffrage]] established under the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|Constitution of 1866]], and implicitly against the [[two-party system]] that it favored. As he put it, the peasant could have "an active part, of the uttermost importance".&lt;ref name="sn510"&gt;Neagoe, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; He challenged the political establishment by noting that peasant representation had steadily declined, from 36 deputies in the [[ad-hoc Divans]] to 33 in the "[[United Principalities]]" era, and then to none in the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]].&lt;ref name="sn511"&gt;Neagoe, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by the agrarianist writer [[Ilariu Dobridor]], Dobrescu was the second person in Romanian history, after [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], to have championed peasantism as a political, not merely "philanthropic", effort.&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Dobridor, Dobrescu's first attempts to set up an agrarian movement brought him into contact with left-wing figures such as [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]] and [[Constantin Mille]]—both disappointed him.&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, pp. 196, 211&lt;/ref&gt; He put himself up as a candidate in the [[Romanian general election, 1879|legislative election of 1879]], winning an Assembly seat for the Fourth College in Argeș. However, the electoral law specified that he had to be aged 25 to qualify, and so his mandate was invalidated.&lt;ref name="sn511; id212"&gt;Dobridor, p. 212; Neagoe, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; The elections did produce one peasant deputy, [[Dincă Schileru|Dincă Schileru (Schileriu)]], who affiliated with the [[Radical Party (Romania)|Radical Party]] of [[C. A. Rosetti]] and [[George Panu]]. He served almost continuously [[Romanian general election, 1911|to 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alin Ion, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160209095252/http://adevarul.ro/locale/targu-jiu/povestea-incredibila-unui-ales-poporului-nu-vom-mai-gasi-romania-dinca-schileru-deputatul-venea-parlament-straie-populare-1_5575c21ccfbe376e3510e75c/index.html "Povestea incredibilă a unui ales al poporului cum nu vom mai găsi în România: Dincă Schileru, deputatul care venea în Parlament în straie populare"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', [[Târgu Jiu]] edition, June 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobrescu's other work was focused on cultural activism, for the goal of creating and popularizing "rural dramas, rural comedies, rural poetry, [...] our own philosophy, our own arts, purpose, traditions and our own sort of civilization".&lt;ref name="sn510"/&gt; In order to facilitate the peasantry's access to education and the amenities of modern life, Dobrescu also advocated for the establishment of free libraries, rural banks and general stores. In 1879, the Central Rural Athenaeum, devoted to teaching adult peasants to read and write, was founded under his guidance. This institution comprised a choral and folk dance ensemble, a public library, an ethnographic and pedagogic museum, an agronomical station, a gymnastics arena, a school for adults, several cultural circles, a popular bank and a magazine that disseminated news of these venues' achievements.&lt;ref name="g"/&gt; In 1882, Dobrescu also created the first rural theater in the entire [[Romanian Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, "Momente din lupta...", p. 517. See also Dobridor, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1884 by the country's first [[cooperative]], set up at [[Domnești, Argeș|Domnești]] under the name of ''Frăția'' ("Brotherhood")—although Mușătești remained the hub for the [[cooperative movement]] for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="sn510"/&gt;

[[File:DE LA PITESCI LA FLORICA SI VICE-VERSA, Bobârnacul, 23 mar 1886.jpg|thumb|380px|The political domination of [[Argeș County]] by [[Ion Brătianu]], as lampooned in ''Bobârnacul'' (March 1886)]]
In order to better organize for his struggle, in 1881 Dobrescu founded at Mușătești a Peasants' Committee, a political network that brought together activists from Argeș and [[Gorj County|Gorj]], later expanded into other regions of [[Muntenia]] and [[Oltenia]]. Its co-leaders were Schileru and Mucenic Dinescu, and its first congress was held at [[Corbeni]] in August 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, pp. 14–15, 211–212; Neagoe, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dobridor, this was a historic moment, bringing together peasants who had hitherto been separated by sectarian causes. Dobrescu "simply lifted up his sword to sever the ropes of coterie that had penetrated the very soul of the peasants, had carved the mark of slavery into their napes, like a yoke carving into the neck of a buffalo."&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early political work===
An ardent [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] and "[[Irredentism|irredentist]]", Dobrescu also supported the clandestine activities of Romanians in [[Transylvania]] and other parts of [[Austria-Hungary]]. These brought him to the attention of [[Ion Brătianu]], doyen of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and Argeș-based squire, who wanted to preserve good relations with the Austrian establishment and civil peace in his constituency. Dobrescu was secretly investigated by a Captain Vinieru, who reported from [[Sălătrucu]] that Dobrescu was coordinating illegal activities over the frontier, and had himself traveled to the area around [[Turnu Roșu|Rothenturm]] for unknown purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, "Momente din lupta...", pp. 513–517&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vinieru episode came shortly after the democratization reforms initiated by Brătianu, which had increased representation for the middle classes, rural ones included, and merged the lower two electoral colleges into a Third. Such enfranchisement came with its own limitations: some 98% of the electorate could only vote for Assembly with [[indirect suffrage]], the rest being excluded from this by wealth and literacy requirements; some 41% of the deputies elected under these new laws represented rural constituencies, but most of them were not land-working peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Iosa, pp. 1419–1420&lt;/ref&gt; By Dobrescu's own calculations, there was still a 1:20,000 ratio of representation in the new college, whereas the upper two had 1:180 and 1:421, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Iosa, p. 1426&lt;/ref&gt;

Belonging to an intermediary class, Dobrescu himself returned as a peasant candidate [[Romanian general election, 1884|elections of that year]], winning a seat for Argeș's Third College. He was again invalidated, since, as a teacher, he had a [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref name="sn511; id212"/&gt; He ran again in by-elections, and, although he had suspended his work in state education, was again faced with invalidation. This time, he was reproached for not having served in the Army,&lt;ref name="sn511; id212"/&gt; but the real reason may have been his irredentist subversion.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, "Momente din lupta...", p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Vinieru suggested that Dobrescu was involved in the June 1887 episode that ended with a shootout between an "irredentist" group and the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]], at [[Albeștii de Muscel|Albești]]. Also according to Vinieru, the affair was kept secret by the National Liberals, and altogether ignored by the opposition [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, "Momente din lupta...", p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Romanian general election, October 1888|October 1888 election]], Dobrescu took a Third College seat at Argeș, with 491 votes from 571. He ran on a Conservative ticket—backing the government of [[Theodor Rosetti]], and defeating the National Liberal Theodor T. Brătianu.&lt;ref&gt;"Ultime informațiuni", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', October 15 (27), 1888, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His mandate coincided with the peasant revolts of 1888, which Dobrescu anticipated in his Assembly speeches.&lt;ref&gt;"A 3a edițiune. Resultatul alegeri Col. III", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', November 30 (December 12), 1888, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the rebellion's quashing, he expressed a moderate position, refusing to condemn Rosetti for his violent response to violence, and agreeing with him on the underlying causes of rural unrest.&lt;ref&gt;"Dupe interpelări" and "Discursul Domnului Theodor Rosetti asupra rescoalei țeranilor", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', November 30 (December 12), 1888, pp. 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Registering as an independent, he was closely aligned with Schileru's Radicals in February 1889,&lt;ref name="fiz22-02-89"&gt;"Fizionomia Camereĭ", in ''[[Lupta]]'', February 22, 1889, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and is tentatively described by scholar Philip Gabriel Eidelberg as a "[[Liberal populism|liberal populist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1889, he was listed as one of 17 Radical and dissident Liberal deputies, all of whom voted against the project to fortify [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;"Votul fortificațiunilor", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', April 6 (18), 1889, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Dobrescu argued for [[class collaboration]] "on social issues", an attitude for which he was cited approvingly by the Conservative doyen [[Petre P. Carp]].&lt;ref&gt;"A 2a edițiune. Camera. Ședința de la 2 Decembre 1888", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', December 3 (15), 1888, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Mihai Săulescu]], he drafted a bill for [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], but later backed down from supporting it, arguing that "peasants require justice more than they require land reform". As noted by the Radical paper ''[[Lupta]]'', it was impossible to tell whether this meant that Dobrescu was for or against land redistribution.&lt;ref name="fiz22-02-89"/&gt; He later elaborated that what was needed were "syndicates" of state-sponsored producers, and noted that the one existing [[credit union]] only helped peasants to marginally "eke out a living".&lt;ref name="ttbinscr"&gt;[[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște]], "Inscripții pe soclu", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', October 28, 1933, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Rosetti relied on selling state land to modest producers, in lots of 5 [[hectare]]s, marginalizing both the landless and wealthier peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, pp. 29, 106, 160–162, 233–234&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also brought his involvement in the controversy about socialist agitation in the countryside. Dobrescu had been curious about socialism, and frequented the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Ioan Nădejde]]. However, he soon grew to dislike both the movement and Nădejde, exposing the later as an "ass in a lion's pelt".&lt;ref&gt;Panu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that Nădejde had failed the test of [[proletarian internationalism]], since, allegedly, he opposed the naturalization of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]]—possibly referring to the specific case of [[Ralian Samitca]].&lt;ref&gt;"Indigenatele", in ''Revista Israelită'', Nr. 4/1889, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Mille, by then co-opted by the socialist journal ''Drepturile Omului'', ridiculed Dobrescu as a "carnival peasant".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1889, with fellow deputie Grigore Cozadini, Mihail Caracostea, and Ernest Sturdza, Dobrescu visited [[Roman County]] to investigate the election of Lascăr Veniamin as socialist deputy.&lt;ref&gt;"Informațiuni", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', February 4 (16), 1889, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's findings eventually led the other socialist deputy, [[Vasile Morțun]], to resign and demand that he be formally tried.&lt;ref&gt;"Camera. Ședința de la 17 Februarie 1889" and "Ultime informațiuni", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', February 18 (March 2), 1889, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the peasants he met asked him to run for their constituency, following Veniamin's looming invalidation. Reportedly, this showed the abrupt decline of the socialist movement.&lt;ref name="ui89-2-15"&gt;"Ultime informațiuni", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', February 15 (27), 1889, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reelection and ''Partida Țărănească''===

Dobrescu also edited several periodicals: ''Țĕranul'' (1881–1884), Romania's first rural cultural and political publication; and ''Gazeta Poporului'' and ''Gazeta Țăranilor'' (1892–1903), through which he attempted to spread his ideas into the villages, aiming to integrate all rural teachers into cultural societies.&lt;ref name="g"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://fmi.upit.ro/bibl/Pagina%20WEB/Site_nou/Enciclop_AG_Muscel/Vol_II_BUP/Litera%20D.pdf ''Enciclopedia Argeșului și Muscelului'' – D], at the [[University of Pitești]] [http://fmi.upit.ro/bibl/Pagina%20WEB/Site_nou/Encicl_Arges.htm ''Enciclopedia Argeșului și Muscelului'' site], p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, pp. 510, 511; Nicolescu, pp. 43–44, 47, 68; Teodorescu, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Gazeta Țăranilor'' had a "talented" editor, but a "mostly local" influence; the statement is qualified by [[Constantin Bacalbașa]], who argues that this venue also "planted the very first seeds of a rural awakening".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga &amp; Bacalbașa, pp. 165, 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in 1894–1898 with the sheet ''Școala Poporului'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; the periodicals were put out by his own printing press in Mușătești, which he had purchased with money granted by [[Ghenadie Petrescu]], the [[Archdiocese of Argeș and Muscel|Bishop of Argeș]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cărți noi. ''Tipografiile din România dela 1801 până azi'' de Gr. Crețu, profesor", in ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', Nr. 12/1911, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; It was "the first printing press and bookbinder ever to have functioned in a rural commune."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru Macedonski]], "Notițele ''Literatoruluĭ''. Banchiet Țĕrănesc", in ''[[Literatorul]]'', Nr. 6/1892, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued his mission in various other ventures: pioneering institutions founded by Dobrescu during this interval include, in 1893, the cooperative in Mușătești, named after [[Vlad Țepeș]],&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe, pp. 510–511&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1895, ''Școala Nouă'' ("The New School") of Domnești, furnished with a library and reading room.&lt;ref name="g"/&gt;

Before September 1890, Dobrescu had come under investigation for supposedly illegal activities also involving the artillery guards, and was shamed for this by both the left-wing daily ''[[Adevărul]]'' and the Conservative organ ''[[Timpul]]''. They suggested that he should resign his seat, and argued that his self-promotion was distasteful.&lt;ref name="judecat"&gt;"Deputatul Dobrescu-Chitanță judecat de ''Timpul'' și ''Adevĕrul''", in ''[[Voința Națională]]'', September 12 (24), 1890, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrescu was again elected to the Assembly, at Argeș, following the [[Romanian general election, 1891|race of 1891]], and reelected [[Romanian general election, 1892|in 1892]].&lt;ref name="sn511"/&gt; During these legislatures, Dobrescu listed himself as an unaffiliated "Democrat",&lt;ref&gt;Iosa, p. 1425; Panu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and became known as ''Dobrescu-Argeș'' to be distinguished from another Constantin Dobrescu, the Radical deputy of [[Prahova County|Prahova]].&lt;ref name="satyr"&gt;Satyr, "Satira zileĭ. Chitanțele lui CC. Lascarache", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', May 2, 1893, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; His political stances were becoming ambiguous, and left-wingers came to suspect that he was secretly an ally of [[Lascăr Catargiu]] and his Conservative cabinet. Dobrescu openly supported some Conservative causes: with his theater, he performed one of his plays in front of [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], who awarded him a decoration and his own portrait as a souvenir;&lt;ref name="id214"/&gt; in November 1892, he voted for adding 300,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] to the [[civil list]], going to the royal family.&lt;ref name="fizio"&gt;"Fizionomia Camereĭ. Ploconul de 300,000 leĭ", in ''[[Lupta]]'', November 26, 1892, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious scandal erupted in November 1893, during debates over the establishment of an agricultural bank. Dobrescu promised nationalists [[A. C. Cuza]] and Constantin Popovici that he would endorse their amendment, excluding non-Romanians from the enterprise. He took the paper for signing, but never returned it, and found himself chased around the Assembly, threatened by Major N. Pruncu, and pummeled by Popovici.&lt;ref name="hoția"&gt;Bran, "Hoția de la Cameră" and Rigolo, "Satira zilei. Tamazlîcul parlamentar", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', November 25, 1933, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was witnessed by writer (and deputy) [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], who declared himself disgusted and demoralized by the casualness of the affair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru Vlahuță]], ''Un an de luptă'', pp. 27–30. Bucharest: Editura Librărieĭ Carol Müller, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; Such displays prompted his 1889 rival Morțun to reuse the derisive moniker of "carnival peasant",&lt;ref name="fizio"/&gt; an insult later popularized by ''Adevărul'', alongside "poisonous mushroom" and "inveterate thief".&lt;ref name="hoția"/&gt;

The incongruity was also noted by the Radical Panu, who argued that the "extremely congenial" Dobrescu showed up in [[Romanian dress]] but was "not a peasant, however much he may enjoy that designation [...] he merely dresses like one". He honored in Dobrescu the "intelligent man of the Argeș", noting how fast he picked up on new things, but also that he lacked discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Panu, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; His abilities were also noted by the staff journalist at ''Foaia Populară'', who described Dobrescu as the "miraculous" figure of a self-made man,&lt;ref name="fp20feb00"&gt;"Cronica săptămâneĭ", in ''Foaia Populară'', Nr.8/1900, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; and by the journalist [[Constantin Bacalbașa]], who remembered him as "highly intelligent, cultured, and overflowing with political ambitions".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga &amp; Bacalbașa, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1895, Dobrescu stood in the generic opposition, and, alongside Cuza, attacked Catargiu's cabinet, and the Conservative Party in general, for not doing enough to improve rural education. The claim enlisted a lengthy retort from the Conservative [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]], who furnished evidence for the role of upper classes in rural advancement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]], ''Lumină tuturora... (Discursul Domnuluĭ B. Ștef. Delavrancea pronunțat în ședința Camereĭ de la 17 Martie 1895)'', pp. 3–8, 18–21, 35–37. Bucharest: [[Voința Națională|Tipografia Voința Națională]], 1895&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, in Bucharest, Dobrescu held a congress that initiated a peasants' own political organization, ''Partida Țărănească'' ("Peasants' Party"). The platform, voted by peasant representatives from 20 counties, restated and detailed some of Dobrescu's main goals, including state investment into cooperatives and [[breeding program]]s, [[communalism]] with room for personal property and [[common land]] for gazing, and the auditing of peasant debt. It also had [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] requests, suggesting that peasants access a land reserve created from land repurchased by the state from non-nationals, and that leases on land be granted only by locals; an additional goal was the establishment of [[Greater Romania]] "spread as far as the Romanian language is spoken".&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; The first party of its kind in Romania, ''Partida'' operated until 1899.&lt;ref name="g"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brett, p. 31; Neagoe, pp. 511–512&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disgrace, arrest, and death===
Dobrescu was again reelected, a final time, [[Romanian general election, 1895|in 1895]], after defeating the National Liberal Daniil Sterescu 645 votes to 280.&lt;ref name="c.iiicam"&gt;"Rezultatele C. III Cameră", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', November 3, 1895, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter race, he shared a ticket with Alexandru Valescu.&lt;ref name="valescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://fmi.upit.ro/bibl/Pagina%20WEB/Site_nou/Enciclop_AG_Muscel/Vol_IV_Golesti/08_LITERA%20%20V.pdf ''Enciclopedia Argeșului și Muscelului'' – V], at the [[University of Pitești]] [http://fmi.upit.ro/bibl/Pagina%20WEB/Site_nou/Encicl_Arges.htm ''Enciclopedia Argeșului și Muscelului'' site], pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt; ''Partida'' also won a seat for [[Muscel County]], taken by M. Moisescu, with Dincă Schileru as a dissident National Liberal.&lt;ref name="c.iiicam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iosa, pp. 1425–1426, 1429&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Dobrescu's party shifted some of its weight toward Muscel, with ''Gazeta Țăranilor'' printed from [[Câmpulung]],&lt;ref&gt;Simionescu, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; before relocating to Bucharest. According to Dobrescu, during the electoral campaign Catargiu had ordered a clampdown on the printing press in Mușătești, with authorities threatening his readers throughout the region. The editorial offices, however, remained in place.&lt;ref name="nght111"&gt;Teodorescu, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrescu eventually obtained a doctorate in law from the [[Free University of Brussels]]&lt;ref name="g"/&gt; after studying there from 1894 to 1897.&lt;ref name="d"/&gt; This activity sparked another controversy in 1897, upon notice that he had been awarded a scholarship by the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture Ministry]], then under the National Liberal [[Anastase Stolojan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Informații", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', May 30, 1889, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his clashes with Catargiu, Dobrescu found himself competing with the left-wing factions of the National Liberal Party, respectively led by the [[Spiru Haret]] and [[Nicolae Fleva]]. These now fought for the peasant vote, and openly attacked the landed gentry within their own party, in particular [[Dimitrie Sturdza]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; On various topical causes, Dobrescu worked with both Fleva and Haret, but also with other major figures in politics and militant culture, including [[Vasile Kogălniceanu]], [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Nicolae Filipescu]], and [[Take Ionescu]].&lt;ref name="g"/&gt; In the 1895 legislature, he and Moisescu intervened to propose bills for [[universal suffrage]] with [[proportional representation]], supporting and being supported by Fleva, Morțun, Kogălniceanu, Nicu Ceaur-Aslan, George A. Scorțescu, and [[Iuniu Lecca]].&lt;ref&gt;Iosa, pp. 1425–1429. See also Eidelberg, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Dobrescu was still adamantly opposed to Morțun's Marxism and the [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]], possibly because the latter was also trying to win over peasant constituents—but also because Dobrescu respected the [[right of property]] and did not consider either an extensive land reform or [[collective farming]].&lt;ref name="sn511"/&gt; According to the cultural sociologist [[Z. Ornea]], Dobrescu and his party only offered "palliatives" to landless peasants, and as such "had no real mass basis, [were] weightless in political life."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobrescu also found himself ignored by the establishment: in the session of March 10, 1898, his [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellation]] about [[Moonshine|bootlegging]] ended inconclusively, as most of his colleagues got up and left the Assembly hall.&lt;ref&gt;"Corpurile Legiuitoare. Camera Deputaților. Ședința de la 10 Martie (urmare). Interpelarea d-luĭ Dobrescu-Argeș", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', March 12, 1898, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He received some attention from [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]], the new [[Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure|Minister of Public Works]], who agreed with him on building a railway link between Curtea de Argeș and [[Câineni]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurelian Chistol, "Aspecte legate de activitatea lui Ion I. C. Brătianu în fruntea Ministerului Lucrărilor Publice (31 martie 1897 – 30 martie 1899)", in ''Argesis. Studii și Comunicări, Seria Istorie'', Vol. XVII, 2008, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Dobrescu had been formally indicted of falsifying an insurance policy and embezzling funds. In June, he was arrested and sent to [[Văcărești prison]], but made [[bail]]. As reported by Filipescu's ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', his time in confinement was needlessly prolonged by hostile bailiffs, causing Dobrescu's mother to faint in public. However, the authorities discarded normal procedure, and left out [[biometrics]] when Dobrescu refused to comply, threatening to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Afacerea Dobrescu-Argeș", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', June 5, 1898, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded his case at the Correctional Tribunal, arguing that the counterfeiting was the work of his mistress, a Ms Ionescu.&lt;ref name="fp20feb00"/&gt; According to various accounts, he was being framed by the ruling class,&lt;ref&gt;Brett, pp. 31–32; Dobridor, pp. 214–216; Ionescu, "Momente din lupta...", p. 517; Neagoe, p. 512; Simionescu, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; although such accusations had surfaced independently in earlier years. In 1889, the peasants of Mușătești had complained that Dobrescu, hired to legalize their land claims, had absconded with their money.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae P. Leonăchescu, "Lichidarea 'Treimii proprietății' din Stroești-Argeș", in ''Argessis. Studii și Comunicări, Seria Istorie'', Vol. VIII, 1999, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, Dobrescu also financed his party selling worthless bonds to peasants across the country. The scheme was only uncovered when one of his invoices showed up in a bankruptcy lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Ludo, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently derided by his adversaries as ''Dobrescu-Chitanță'' ("Dobrescu-Invoice").&lt;ref name="judecat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="satyr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoția"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludo, pp. 308–309; Ionescu, "Momente din lupta...", pp. 516–517&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobrescu's work in public subscription also collected funds for a statue of [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], in [[Târgu Jiu]]. He bagen this project in March 1895, with articles in ''Gazeta Țăranilor'', increasingly revolutionary in tone; he also oversaw the printing of a Vladimirescu biography.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorescu, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, as he inaugurated the statue, Dobrescu spoke about his mission of bringing about "rule of the people, by the people", "democracy in both name and fact."&lt;ref name="ou170"/&gt; During [[Romanian general election, 1899|that year's elections]], he was again in contact with the controversial candidate [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], at [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]]. He acted as electoral agent among the peasants, promising them that Bogdan-Pitești would redistribute land from a national reserve. When his patron was defeated, the enraged peasants rioted and had to be repressed using military force.&lt;ref&gt;N. Leobeanu, "Dosarul lui Bogdan-Văcărești. 'Directorul ziarului Seara' autorul moral al unor măceluri țărănești", in ''Opinia'', June 20, 1913, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, his trial, in which he was represented by Fleva, came before the [[Ilfov County]] tribunal, being postponed there over the absence of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;"Ultima oră", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', June 24, 1898, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally receiving a nine-month jail term in February 1900,&lt;ref name="fp20feb00"/&gt; reduced to a three-month term in 1903, Dobrescu served his sentence at Văcărești. After being released, he was completely demoralized and soon disappeared from public life. Near the end of the same year, gravely ill and paralyzed in both legs, he was taken from Bucharest to Mușătești. He was discreetly employed by [[Vasile Lascăr]], the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]], to review or even draft new legislation, but died in his parental home before receiving any pay.&lt;ref&gt;Dobridor, pp. 214–216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liceul Agricol C. Dobrescu Arges din Curtea de Arges (12).JPG|thumb|300px|Dobrescu-Argeș Agricultural High School in [[Curtea de Argeș]]]]
Sociologist [[Dumitru Drăghicescu]] suggests that, "for all we know", the "peasant issue" was introduced on the Romanian political agenda by Dobrescu. The "brilliant and likeable forerunner" directly inspired Drăghicescu to publish his own magazine for the peasants, ''România Rurală'', which came out in 1899–1900.&lt;ref&gt;Drăghicescu, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandru Valescu, who was also Dobrescu's brother-in-law, and his friend Kogălniceanu also sought to preserve the gains, and, in September 1906, reestablished ''Partida Țărănească''.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, pp. 138–147, 184–189; Ionescu, "Bucureștii...", pp. 133–134, and "Momente din lupta...", p. 517; Neagoe, p. 512; Scurtu, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gazeta Țăranilor'' also continued to appear, with Valescu as publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, p. 155; Ionescu, "Bucureștii...", p. 133; Iorga &amp; Bacalbașa, p. 165; Scurtu, pp. 512–516&lt;/ref&gt; It accepted Kogălniceanu's leadership of the party, but maintained a Dobrescu-like stance on land reform, only favoring the renting of estates to cooperatives (rather than full redistribution among individual owners).&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, pp. 135–136, 138–139, 146–147, 155, 184–187, 205–207, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

This project blended with [[conservative populism]] through its deep association with Filipescu and the ''Epoca'' group,&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, pp. 187–189, 205–228&lt;/ref&gt; then was altogether thwarted by the [[1907 Romanian peasants' revolt|peasants' revolt of 1907]], which Valescu had ominously predicted.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, "Bucureștii...", pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; During the events, Kogălniceanu was found to be running a network which sold [[Romanian Orthodox icons]] "for pledges".&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, "Bucureștii...", p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Both leaders were arrested,&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; with their ''Gazeta'' being singled out as a "rebels' nest".&lt;ref name="nght111"/&gt; The movement went inactive for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, pp. 31–32; Neagoe, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; Although Valescu still convened a Congress of the Peasants in 1910, its demands were moderate, and its focus was on petitioning; other, more radical cells claiming the "peasants' party" pedigree were founded by [[Nicolae Basilescu]] and Alexandru Popescu-Berca. Overall, Valescu supported the reforms enacted by the National Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, pp. 512–518&lt;/ref&gt; As Drăghicescu notes, the latter now integrated a [[Poporanist]] current, and made the peasant issue, including advocacy for land reform, one of its core doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Drăghicescu, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, following World War I, land reform and universal suffrage were introduced throughout the newly established Greater Romania, making it possible for teacher [[Ion Mihalache]] to form his own [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], the first of several interwar agrarianist movements. He was joined by Valescu, who took a [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] seat at Argeș in the [[Romanian general election, 1919|elections of 1919]].&lt;ref name="valescu"/&gt; In 1920, at [[Priboieni]], the folklorist Constantin Rădulescu-Codin relaunched ''Gazeta Țăranilor'' as a National Liberal mouthpiece, critical of Mihalache's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Simionescu, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The period also saw a reevaluation of Dobrescu's role in the movement. Research into his politics was hampered by the destruction of his ''Țĕranul'', issues of which are exceedingly rare.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the consolidated [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) was claiming Dobrescu as its patriarch. An earlier bust done by [[Frederic Storck]] from live sittings&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Saint-Georges, "Texte și documente. Activitatea de medalist a sculptorului Frederic Storck", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 9/1943, pp. 627–628&lt;/ref&gt; was raised at Curtea de Argeș in October 1933. PNȚ leaders Mihalache and [[Armand Călinescu]] were guest speakers at that ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;"Actualitățile săptămânii", in ''[[Realitatea Ilustrată]]'', Nr. 353, November 1933, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Also for the occasion, ''[[Adevărul]]'' revisited its earlier stances, dedicating Dobrescu a retrospective and quoting him on its frontispiece. As argued therein by editor [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște]], "most of [Dobrescu's] goals, to this day, are just goals". The land reform, he claimed, was haphazard and purposefully unsustainable; the enfranchisement was also compromised by "savage elections", and by Mihalache's own praise of [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name="ttbinscr"/&gt; In January 1937, a "Dobrescu-Argeș Canteen" was founded by the PNȚ for rural peasants studying in Bucharest. Speaking at its inauguration rally, which doubled as an anti-fascist protest, [[Paul Bujor]] honored Dobrescu as the "precursor and martyr of peasantism".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. P., "Studențimea, sub flamura lui Dobrescu-Argeș...", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', January 31, 1937, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Pitești also hosted a Dobrescu-Argeș cooperative bank, managed by the PNȚ cadre Petre Gr. Dumitrescu.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://fmi.upit.ro/bibl/Pagina%20WEB/Site_nou/Enciclop_AG_Muscel/Vol_II_BUP/Litera%20D.pdf ''Enciclopedia Argeșului și Muscelului'' – D], at the [[University of Pitești]] [http://fmi.upit.ro/bibl/Pagina%20WEB/Site_nou/Encicl_Arges.htm ''Enciclopedia Argeșului și Muscelului'' site], p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Communist Romania|communist period]], Dobrescu-Argeș was subjected to official criticism.

'''Cosmopolitanism''' is the [[ideology]] that all [[human being]]s belong to a single [[community]], based on a shared morality. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a '''cosmopolitan''' or '''cosmopolite'''.

A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive [[morality]], a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. In a cosmopolitan community individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships of mutual respect. As an example, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing [[Belief|beliefs]] (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Anthony Appiah |first1 = Kwame

Various cities and locales, past or present, have been or are identified as "cosmopolitan"; that does not necessarily mean that all or most of their inhabitants consciously embrace the above philosophy.  Rather, locales may be called "cosmopolitan" simply because people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious background live in proximity and interact with each other.

In origin, cosmopolitanism suggests the establishment of a cosmo [[polis]] or ‘[[world state]]’ that would embrace all humanity.  Cosmopolitanism has come to stand for peace and harmony among nations, founded upon understanding, tolerance and interdependence.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the {{lang-grc|κοσμοπολίτης}}, or ''kosmopolitês'', formed from "{{lang|grc|κόσμος}}", ''[[cosmos|kosmos]]'', i.e. "world", "universe", or "cosmos", and {{lang|grc|πολίτης}}, "''politês''", i.e. "citizen" or "[one] of a city". Contemporary usage defines the term as "citizen of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kosmopoli/ths|κοσμοπολίτης|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cosmopolitan|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolitan&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}} {{cite web|title=cosmopolite|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolite&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of "citizen of the world". However, as Appiah points out, "world" in the original sense meant "cosmos" or "universe", not earth or globe as current use assumes.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', W.W. Norton, New York, 2006, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; One definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite Article = Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= https://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical roots===
[[File:Waterhouse-Diogenes.jpg|thumb|Diogenes]]
Cosmopolitanism can be traced back to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] movement in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|The Lives of Eminent Philosophers]]'', Book VI, passage 63; online text [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=D.+L.+6.2.63&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0257 in Greek] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D2 in English] at the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, the broadest basis of social identity in at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Stoics, who later took Diogenes' idea and developed it, typically stressed that each human being "dwells [...] in two communities&amp;nbsp;– the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. (1997). Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism, in The ''Journal of Political Philosophy'' Volume 5, Nr 1, pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt;
A common way to understand [[Stoicism|Stoic]] cosmopolitanism is through [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]]' circle model of identity that states that we should regard ourselves as concentric circles, the first one around the self, next immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of "affinity" or "endearment" towards others, which the Stoics termed [[Oikeiôsis]]. The task of world citizens becomes then to "draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Modern cosmopolitan thinkers===
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Immanuel Kant]], who argued for a ''ius cosmopoliticum'']]
In his 1795 essay ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] stages a ''ius cosmopoliticum'' (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to protect people from war, and morally grounds this cosmopolitan right by the principle of universal hospitality. Kant there claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" (see [[common heritage of humanity]]) would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy – Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical concepts of [[Emmanuel Levinas]], on ethics, and [[Jacques Derrida]], on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no "universal moral law," only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth.  The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas's concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response.

For Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one's home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas's and Derrida's theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake.

Derrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized "cosmopolitanism",&lt;ref name=Bennington1997&gt;

{{Quote
| text  = There is a tradition of cosmopolitanism, and if we had time we could study this tradition, which comes to us from, on the one hand, Greek thought with the Stoics, who have a concept of the 'citizen of the world'. You also have St. Paul in the Christian tradition, also a certain call for a citizen of the world as, precisely, a brother. St. Paul says that we are all brothers, that is sons of God, so we are not foreigners, we belong to the world as citizens of the world; and it is this tradition that we could follow up until Kant for instance, in whose concept of cosmopolitanism we find the conditions for hospitality. But in the concept of the cosmopolitical in Kant there are a number of conditions: first of all you should, of course, welcome the stranger, the foreigner, to the extent that he is a citizen of another country, that you grant him the right to visit and not to stay, and there are a number of other conditions that I can't summarise here quickly, but this concept of the cosmopolitical which is very novel, very worthy of respect (and I think cosmopolitanism is a very good thing), is a very limited concept. (Derrida cited in Bennington 1997).

A further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the [[Second World War]].  As a reaction to the [[Holocaust]] and the other massacres, the concept of [[crimes against humanity]] became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Ulrich (2006). The Cosmopolitan Vision, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical cosmopolitans are [[Moral universalism|moral universalists]]: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Appiah, Kwame Anthony (2006), Cosmopolitanism. Ethics in a World of Strangers, London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today's unique historical moment, an emerging [[planetary phase of civilization]], creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as [[global citizen]]s and possible formation of a [[global citizens movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/PDFFINALS/15Movements.pdf Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement]'', paper #15, and ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt; These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of [[global warming]] and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], or [[International Criminal Court]]; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic [[globalization]]; the emergence of global [[NGO]]s and [[Transnationalism|transnational]] social movements, such as the [[World Social Forum]]; and so on. [[Globalization]], a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place.

===Contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers===
{{Cleanup section|Numbers with no known meaning appear in several places|date=February 2012}}
A number of contemporary theorists propose, directly and indirectly, various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual.

[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] discusses what he calls "Interbeing" as a way of living one's life in relation to others; "Interbeing" might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh's philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of [[Buddhist]] teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996/&gt;{{rp|88}} He further describes what he calls "Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing" as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996&gt;{{cite book |first=Thich |last=Nhất Hạnh |author-link=Thich Nhat Hanh |editor-last=Kotler |editor-first=Arnold |others=Illustrations by Mayumi Oda |title=Being Peace |orig-year=1987 |location=Berkeley |publisher=Parallax |date=1996 |oclc=36745774 |isbn=978-0-938077-97-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–95}} Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others' suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people.

Other theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In ''[[Scared Sacred]]'', [[Velcrow Ripper]] takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Ripper, Velcrow (director) |title=Scared Sacred |medium=Film |publisher=National Filmboard of Canada |date=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Planet", [[Paul Gilroy]] explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what [[Judith Butler]] calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise.

In ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] notices something important about how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, "at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion" for valuing others?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |location=New York |publisher=Verso |date=2004 |oclc=803802111 |isbn=978-1-84467-005-5 |page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that "methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|67}} This estrangement entails a "process of exposure to otherness" in order to foster "the irreducible value of diversity within sameness."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilroy |first=Paul |chapter=The Planet |title=After Empire: Multiculture or Postcolonial Melancholia |location=London |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |oclc=56454095 |isbn=978-0-415-34307-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness.

For Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In "The Planet", Gilroy describes the cases of [[Tom Hurndall]] and [[Rachel Corrie]];&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy's figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents) and their stories might serve as affirmations of familiarity, rather than models of estrangement. Gilroy’s model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy’s theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar.&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;

[[The Venus Project]], an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by [[Jacque Fresco]], works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding our interdependence with nature and each other.

Some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Frantz Fanon]], in ''The Wretched of the Earth'', observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became "manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fanon |first=Frantz |author-link=Frantz Fanon |date=1963 |chapter=The Pitfalls of National Consciousness |title=The Wretched of the Earth |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |translator-first=Constance |translator-last=Farrington |pages=148–205 |oclc=817260777 |isbn=978-0-8021-5083-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}} When "third world" nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself.

Further, Mahmood Mamdani in ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim'' suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and [[Christianity]] to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mamdani |first=Mahmood |title=Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |date=2004 |oclc=53315228 |isbn=978-0-375-42285-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appiah |first=Kwame Anthony |author-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |chapter=Kindness to Strangers |title=Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=W.

Much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken [[nationalism]] and the framework of the sovereign [[nation-state]] for granted. Now, with the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it  is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. [[Jesús Mosterín]] analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2008 |title=La cultura de la libertad |location=Madrid |publisher=Espasa-Calpe |isbn=978-84-670-2697-9 |oclc=693823808 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the [[Internet]] provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods.  Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2005 |title=A World without Nation States |journal=Acta Institutionis Philosophiae et Aestheticae |volume=23 |pages=55–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes the difference between international institutions, led by representatives of the national governments, and world or universal institutions, with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications, independently of any national bias or proportion.

Criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, [[Charles Blattberg]] has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be "rooted," by which he means based upon a "global patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blattberg |first=Charles |date=5 April 2012 |editor1-last=Kymlicka |editor1-first=Will |editor2-last=Walker |editor2-first=Kathryn |ssrn=2034932 |chapter=We Are All Compatriots |title=Rooted Cosmopolitanism |location=Vancouver |publisher=UBC Press |via=Social Science Research Network |isbn=978-0-7748-2262-6 |oclc=886376838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares the [[John Searle]]'s opposition to multiculturalism with [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s celebration of it. She uses [[Richard Rorty]] as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nicholson |first=Carol |date=1998 |title=Three Views of Philosophy and Multiculturalism: Searle, Rorty, and Taylor |conference=Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy |url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Educ/EducNich.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference on "Philosophy in a Multicultural Context", Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism.  He develops [[Bruno Latour]]'s conception of the philosopher as public diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Winther |first=Rasmus Grønfeldt |date=2012 |title=Free to Universalize or Bound by Culture? Multicultural and Public Philosophy |type=White Paper |url=http://philpapers.org/archive/WINFTU.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and sociological==

[[Emile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) observed the development of what he called the 'cult of the individual', which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation's constitutions. A society's sacred object would be the individual's human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country's way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile. "Individualism and Individuals": Originally published as "L'individualisme et les intellectuels," Revue bleue, 4e serie, 10 (1898): 7-13. Translated by Mark Traugott. Article accessed: https://www.scribd.com/document/85771137/Durkheim-Individualism-and-the-Intellectuals&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's cult of the individual has many similarities to [[John Rawls]]' [[political liberalism]], which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;See Cladis, Mark. 'A Communitarian Defense of Liberalism: Emile Durkheim and Contemporary Social Theory' (Stanford University Press: Stanford, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ulrich Beck]] (May 15, 1944 – January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional [[nation-state]] politics.  Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the [[nation-state]] model.  Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players.

It is important to mark a distinction between Beck's cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered [[hegemony|hegemonic]] at best and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] at worst.  Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations:
* "Acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the future"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of nature"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the object"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities"

A number of philosophers, including [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have introduced the concept of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]". For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will—the ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other's address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.&lt;ref name="Levinas"&gt;Emmanuel Levinas. Totality and Infinity. An Essay on Exteriority. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;

During this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we've formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Levinas"/&gt;

Cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of [[Moral universalism|universalism]] – namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stojadinović|first1=Mladen|title=UNIVERSALISM REVIVED: NEEDS-BASED COSMOPOLITANISM AS A FOUNDATION OF GLOBAL DEMOCRACY|journal=Facta Universitatis, Series: Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology and History|date=2014|volume=13|pages=78–80|url=http://casopisi.junis.ni.ac.rs/index.php/FUPhilSocPsyHist/article/view/331/333|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

As an example, [[Judith Butler]] discusses a Western discourse of "human" in ''Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence''. Butler works through the idea of "human" and notes that "human" has been "naturalized in its 'Western' mold by the contemporary workings of humanism" (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all "human" lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places.&lt;ref name="Barua Circulating"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barua, Maan |year=2013 |title=Circulating Elephants: Unpacking the Geographies of a Cosmopolitan Animal |journal= Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |volume=0 |issue= |url=https://www.academia.edu/5089770|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is reiterated in [[Sunera Thobani]]'s "Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada," where she discusses a discourse in which [[Muslim people]] fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a "good Muslim" is one who has been Westernized and a "bad Muslim" is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully "human" and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized [[Cultural identity|cultural identities]].

According to those who follow Beck's reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of [[civil society]] actors such as Non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today's conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of [[Global Citizen]] will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a [[global citizens movement]] would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as [[global warming]]) and [[subsidiarity]] (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniele Archibugi]] proposes a renewed model for [[Global Citizen|global citizenship]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html   The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward a Cosmopolitan Democracy], Princeton University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], Debating Cosmopolitics, London: Verso, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political rhetoric==
{{Further|Rootless cosmopolitan}}
"Cosmopolitanism" became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against "alien" ideas that went counter to orthodoxy.  European Jews were frequently accused of being "rootless cosmopolitans."&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Miller and Scott Ury, "Cosmopolitanism: the end of Jewishness?" ''European Review of History—Revue européenne d'histoire'' 17.3 (2010): 337-359 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13507486.2010.481923 abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] in a 1946 Moscow speech attacked writings in which “the positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Greenfield, "The Ugly History of Stephen Miller’s ‘Cosmopolitan’ Epithet: Surprise, surprise—the insult has its roots in Soviet anti-Semitism." [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/03/the-ugly-history-of-stephen-millers-cosmopolitan-epithet-215454  ''Politico'' 3 August, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century the epithet became a weapon used by [[Vladimir Putin]] in Russia, and by nationalists in Hungary and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Greenfield, "The Ugly History of Stephen Miller’s ‘Cosmopolitan’ Epithet"&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]], a [[Trump administration]] senior policy advisor, has publicly criticized CNN reporter [[Jim Acosta]] as exhibiting "cosmopolitan bias" during a discussion on the government's new immigration plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/08/whats-the-matter-with-cosmopolitan-bias/535746/|title=What 'Cosmopolitan Bias' Really Means|website=citylab.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Kolb''' (born 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n85-374118}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American philosopher and the [[Charles A. Dana (philanthropist)|Charles A. Dana]] Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[Bates College]] in [[Maine]].

Kolb received a B.A. from [[Fordham University]] in 1963 and an M.A. in 1965.  He later received a M.Phil. from [[Yale University]] in 1970 and a Ph.D. in 1972.  Kolb's Dissertation was titled "Conceptual Pluralism and Rationality." Most of Kolb's writing deals with "what it means to live with historical connections and traditions at a time when we can no longer be totally defined by that history."  Professor Kolb taught at the [[University of Chicago]] before moving to Bates in 1977 and teaching there until 2005, when he took emeritus status.

==Works==
Kolb has written many articles and published several books including:
*''The Critique of Pure Modernity: [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]], and After'', 1987
*''Postmodern Sophistications: Philosophy, Architecture, and Tradition'', 1990
*''New Perspectives on Hegel's Philosophy of Religion'', 1992

==Development of EYLF==
The EYLF has been developed collaboratively by the Australian and State and Territory Governments with substantial input from the early childhood sector and early childhood academics.  The Framework has incorporated feedback from an extensive consultation process, including two national symposiums, national public consultation forums, focus groups, an online forum and case-study trials.

The Early Years Learning Framework Professional Learning Program (EYLF PLP), was developed for the Australian Government by Early Childhood Australia in 2010, to provide ongoing professional support to services as they engage in the EYLF implementation process. The program has recently been updated and expanded from the Early Years Learning Framework Professional Learning Program (EYLF PLP) to the [[National Quality Standard Professional Learning Program]] (NQS PLP). The NQS PLP has all the features of the EYLF PLP, along with a new focus to assist services to meet the [[National Quality Standard]].

==Description==
The EYLF consists of three parts, that outlines the world that educators in Australia should shape around [[children]]:&lt;ref name="EYLF" /&gt;

:1) Principles, the first part, are goals for the care, e.g. "Secure, respectful and [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocal]] relationships";
:2) Practices are guidelines for how to achieve the goals set out in the principles, the document EYLF document includes several hands-on examples; 
:3) Outcomes is a list of 5 overall goals, each with 2-5 sub-goals. Each of those sub-goals has a list of things that the child could have done to meet the overall goal, serving as an easy reference for teachers (see example structure below):
:*Outcome 2: Children are connected to and contribute to their world
:*Children respond to diversity with respect
:*(Children) begin to show concern for others.&lt;ref name="EYLF" /&gt;

'''Crossover''', sometimes referred to as cross-pollination, is a philosophical presupposition of [[Liberal arts]], [[Great books]], and [[Integrative learning]] approaches to education. The value of such crossover is disputed by those who adhere to certain versions of [[Pragmatism]], especially [[John Dewey]].

The '''Federation of Indian Student Associations in Australia''' was incorporated in 2002 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fisa.org.au/content/history-aims&lt;/ref&gt; by Gautam Gupta after he was the victim of a drunken assault leading to depression and his decision to start the federation.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8097526.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Violence against Indians in Australia controversy]] began, the FISA has had a high profile in many Australian,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/levy-plan-targets-highrisk-colleges-20100308-psqw.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/death-a-wake-up-call-to-indian-media/story-e6frg6nf-1225838412865&lt;/ref&gt; Indian,&lt;ref&gt;http://news.oneindia.in/2010/03/14/claimthat-australia-top-choice-of-indian-students-giventhu.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Racial-attacks-Indians-rally-in-Australia/articleshow/4627571.cms&lt;/ref&gt; and other international sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8097526.stm&lt;/ref&gt;
 
FISA's stated purpose is;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisa.org.au/ FISA]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Integration: To unify Indian students in Australia and integrate them with the Australian community at large.
*Representation: To partner at all levels of the Australian political and social spectrum to represent views and opinions of Indian students.
*Empowerment: To increase the spiritual, political, social and economic strength of Indian students in Australia.

FISA's aims are;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisa.org.au/content/history-aims FISA history and aims]&lt;/ref&gt;
* FISA to be recognised as a point of reference for Indian students nationally.
* To construct an effective and long lasting communication network amongst students who are Indian by pedigree.
* The network would consist of all University Unions/Organisations and other like-minded associations, representative bodies and interested individuals.
* Organise events to provide a social interaction point for students.
* Increase dialogue between other community representative bodies to provide students a perspective of multicultural [[Australia]].
* FISA Executives consist of dynamic Indians and Australians from various cultures whose primary aim is to form a synthesis of [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16523">A '''graduate diploma''' ('''GradD''', '''GDip''', '''GrDip''', '''GradDip''') is generally a qualification taken after completion of a [[undergraduate degree|first degree]], although the level of study varies in different countries from being at the same level as the final year of a [[bachelor's degree]] to being at a level between a [[master's degree]] and a [[doctorate]]. In some countries the graduate diploma and [[postgraduate diploma]] are synonymous, while in others (particularly where the graduate diploma is at undergraduate degree level) the postgraduate diploma is a higher qualification.

==Canada==
{{see also|Education in Canada}}

Graduate diplomas offered in Canada (French: ''[[Diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hec.ca/en/programs/specialized-graduate-diplomas//|title=Specialized Graduate Diplomas (DESS)|publisher=[[HEC Montréal]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are typically taken following a bachelor's degree and a successful award allows progression to a master's degree. Depending on the institution, a graduate diploma in Canada may be at graduate level or bachelor's level.&lt;ref name=SFU&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/dean-gradstudies/administration/curriculum-planning/creating-new-programs/graduate-diploma-programs.html|title=Graduate Diploma Programs|publisher=*[[Simon Fraser University]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Concordia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/computer-science-diploma.html|title=Computer Science (GrDip)|publisher=[[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar courses at other Canadian institutions may be termed [[postgraduate diploma]]s at graduate level and [[Postbaccalaureate program|post-baccalaureate diploma]] at bachelor's level.

==Australia==
{{see also|Education in Australia}}

The graduate diploma is normally taken following a bachelor's degree, and some master's degree programs have graduate diploma as a nested (interim) award&lt;ref name="Master of Data Science- Alternative exits"&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of Data Science- Alternative exits |url=http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/courses/C6004.html |website=Monash University |publisher=Monash University}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The qualification is at level '''8''' of the Australian Qualifications Framework, the same as an [[honours degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqf.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AQF-2nd-Edition-January-2013.pdf|title=Australian Qualifications Framework 2nd edition|date=January 2013|page=16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910151628/http://www.aqf.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/aqf-2nd-edition-january-2013.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This qualification is at the same level as the '''post graduate diploma''' qualifications awarded in New Zealand institutions and Australian graduate diplomas should not be confused with New Zealand graduate diplomas as they belong to two different qualification levels.&lt;ref name="NZQA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Qualification types on the NZQF |url=https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/studying-in-new-zealand/understand-nz-quals/ |website=New Zealand Qualification Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AQF Level 8 criteria for the Graduate Diploma |url=https://www.aqf.edu.au/aqf-qualifications |website=AQF Qualifications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/about-us/our-role/our-role-in-international-education/country-specific-recognition-arrangements/australia/executive-summary/|title=Enhancing Mobility – Referencing of the Australian and New Zealand Qualifications Frameworks|publisher=Australian Government Department of Education and Training and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
{{see also|Education in New Zealand}}

In New Zealand, a graduate diploma is an "advanced undergraduate" qualification normally completed after a bachelor's degree or done at the same time of the bachelors study, and may be used to prove the student's ability to undertake postgraduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/studying-in-new-zealand/understand-nz-quals/graduate-diploma/|title=Graduate Diploma|publisher=[[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]]|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A graduate diploma (e.g., Graduate Diploma in Education etc.) is different from a [[postgraduate diploma]], which is a course of study at [[postgraduate]] level (e.g., Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology etc.).

==UK==
{{see also| Education in the United Kingdom}}

In the UK, a graduate diploma is a short course at the level of a [[bachelor's degree]] that is normally studied by students who have already graduated in another field. Graduate diplomas are distinguished from [[Graduate certificate#UK|graduate certificates]] by having a longer period of study, equivalent to two thirds of an academic year or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education | url =http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf| title = The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|date=October 2015|page=36|quote="Graduate diplomas and certificates are at the same level (6 on the FHEQ/SCQF level 10 on the FQHEIS) but are differentiated from each other by volume of study and learning outcomes. The title 'certificate' normally signifies learning outcomes which would imply study equivalent to at least one-third of a full-time academic year, and the title 'diploma' normally signifies study equivalent to at least two-thirds of a full-time academic year at the relevant level (and/or, where credit is awarded, the volume of credit specified by the relevant credit framework)."| accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Until the 1990s, the British conservatoires of music offered three year undergraduate courses to some of their students, leading the award of the Graduate Diploma, e.g. [[GRSM]], [[GTCL]], equivalent to a university first degree in music.  When a  number of conservatoires became affiliated to or constituent colleges of universities, the graduate diplomas were gradually replaced by the award of the BMus degree to all successful students.

Graduate diplomas should not be confused with a [[postgraduate diploma]], which is a [[master's degree]]-level qualification. Historically, this has not always been the case, with postgraduate diploma and graduate diploma used interchangeably, but the [[Quality Assurance Agency]] now makes a clear distinction between these titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education | url =http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf| title = The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|date=October 2015|page=35|quote="titles with the stem 'graduate' (for example, 'graduate diploma') are used for qualifications from programmes of study that typically require graduate entry, or its equivalent, and have learning outcomes that match relevant parts of the descriptor for a qualification at level 6 on the FHEQ or SCQF levels 9 or 10 on the FQHEIS"| accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions have renamed courses as a result, e.g. [[University of Law|The College of Law]] renamed the official title for its [[law conversion course]] from ''Postgraduate Diploma in Law'' to ''Graduate Diploma in Law'' as, although the law conversion course is studied postgraduately, the contents of the course are only [[undergraduate]] in nature.

In 2018, the [[Royal College of Art]] launched a new Graduate Diploma in Art and Design programme aimed at preparing graduate students for it's master’s degree programmes in Art and Design &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=RCA|title=The Royal College of Art Announces Graduate Diploma in Art &amp; Design|url=https://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/royal-college-art-announces-graduate-diploma-art-design/|website=RCA|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
{{see also|Education in the Republic of Ireland#Further education}}
The graduate diploma or [[higher diploma]] in the Republic of Ireland is an award at the same level as an [[honours degree|honours]] [[bachelor's degree]]. It comprises one year of full-time study and is taken after, and in a different subject from, an earlier bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfq-qqi.com/index.html|title=Irish National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)|publisher=Quality and Qualifications Ireland|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of courses are offered; it is also possible to progress to a [[master's degree]].

The diploma is generally in two forms:
*A reorientation type qualification to [[reskilling|reskill]] a graduate with new specialised skills, for instance the ''HDipStats - Higher Diploma in Statistics'' is aimed at offering additional skills in [[statistics]]. See also [[Higher Diploma]].
*A professional type qualification which is necessary to enter a profession, for instance the HDipEd - Higher Diploma in Education allows a person to register and practice [[teaching]]. See also [[Postgraduate Diploma]].

The graduate diploma (GradDip) is offered by the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]], [[Dublin City University]], [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council|HETAC]] and the [[University of Limerick]]. The [[Higher diploma#Ireland|higher diploma]] (HDip) is offered by [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council|HETAC]], [[National University of Ireland|NUI]] institutions, and [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

==India==
In India [[postgraduate diploma]], is a [[master's degree]]-level qualification which usually is a 1 yr advanced program. Certain institutes provide master's level programs with increased number lower credit courses for 2 years, such courses are also called postgraduate diploma. At times for transnational equivalency the same is casually noted as Graduate diplomas. Advanced diplomas provided are equivalent to a [[Postbaccalaureate program|post-baccalaureate diploma]], this is an eight-month to one-year course.

==Singapore ==
{{see also|Education in Singapore}}

The '''graduate diploma''' is an academic or vocational qualification; as an academic qualification it is often taken after a [[bachelor's degree]] although sometimes only a [[foundation degree]] is required. It is usually awarded by a [[university]] or a [[graduate school]] and usually takes 2 terms of study to complete. It is also possible for academic graduate diploma holders to progress to a [[master's degree]] on an accelerated pathway compared to first embarking on a 3- or 4-year degree program. To ensure that the graduate diploma qualification is recognised, the awarding body must be registered with the Singapore [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]].

The graduate diploma is generally a professional conversion qualification to reskill a graduate with new specialised skills, for instance the ''GDipPsy - Graduate Diploma in Psychology'' is aimed at offering specialised skills in [[psychology]]. See also [[postgraduate diploma]].

The graduate diploma is offered at different levels by different institutions. The [[National University of Singapore]] requires study at [[master's degree|master's]] level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/education-at-nus/graduate-education/degree-requirements.html|title=Graduate Degree Requirements|publisher=[[National University of Singapore]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the graduate diplomas at the [[Singapore University of Social Sciences]] are UK (i.e. [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]]-level) graduate diplomas awarded by the [[University of London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simge.edu.sg/gePortalWeb/appmanager/web/default?_nfpb=true&amp;_st=&amp;_pageLabel=pgProgrammeFinder&amp;menu_academic=Postgraduate|title=Programmes|publisher=[[Singapore University of Social Sciences]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly the Ngee Ann - Adelaide Education Centre offers Australian graduate diplomas (i.e. Australian [[honours degree]] level) awarded by the [[University of Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa.edu.sg/programme/graduate-diploma-in-computer-science/|title=Graduate Diploma in Computer Science|publisher=Ngee Ann - Adelaide Education Centre|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Graduate Diploma of [[Singapore Raffles Music College]] is a post-[[foundation degree]] qualification rather than post-bachelor's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srmc.edu.sg/index.php/menu-courses/88-category-courses/133-courses-srmc-gpad|title=Graduate Diploma In Professional Artist|publisher=[[Singapore Raffles Music College]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate diplomas from [[Aventis School of Management]] are part-time courses that is accredidated by The Association of Psychotherapists and Counsellors Singapore (APACS) or registered with European Foundation for Management Development and the European Council for Business Education (ECBE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asm.edu.sg/graduate-diploma-in-training-development/|title=Graduate Diploma in Training &amp; Development|publisher=[[Aventis School of Management]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asm.edu.sg/postgraduate-diploma-in-business-administration/|title=Postgraduate Diploma in Business Administration|publisher=[[Aventis School of Management]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSQ Graduate Diploma is the highest qualification in Singapore's vocational Workforce Skills Qualifications framework, administered by the [[Singapore Workforce Development Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wda.gov.sg/content/wdawebsite/L207-AboutWSQ.html?parent=topnavabtwsq&amp;openTab=2|title=About WSQ|publisher=[[Singapore Workforce Development Agency]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not tied to the levels of academic degrees.

==Denmark==
Graduate Diplomas (in Danish: HD) are two-year full-time-equivalent programmes at [[bachelor's degree]] level, normally studied as four-year part-time courses. They are studied in business-related fields such as Business Administration and Innovation Management. Programs are normally split into Part 1 ([[graduate certificate]]) and Part 2 (graduate diploma), each being 60 ECTS Credits (one year of full-time-equivalent study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.dk/en/efter_videreuddannelse/diplom/hd_fjern|title=Graduate Diploma in Business Administration|publisher=[[University of Southern Denmark]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/executive-degrees/graduate-diploma-in-business-administration|title=Graduate Diploma in Business Administration|publisher=[[Copenhagen Business School]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/executive-degrees/graduate-diploma-in-business-administration/graduate-diploma-hd-in-innovation-management|title=Graduate Diploma (HD) in Innovation Management|publisher=[[Copenhagen Business School]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the US, graduate diplomas are "Intermediate Graduate Qualifications" involving study beyond [[master's degree|master's]] level but not reaching [[PhD]] level. They are generally found in professional, rather than academic, fields. Other qualifications at this level include advanced graduate certificates, specialist certificates and [[specialist degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/grad.doc|title=Structure of the U.S. Education System: Intermediate Graduate Qualifications|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]]|date=February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysia==
The graduate diploma forms part of the [[lifelong learning|lifelong education]] pathway on the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]]. They are qualifications at the level of a [[bachelor's degree]] but with half of the credit value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adteckulim.gov.my/adtec/index.php/ms/mqa-info/28-malaysian-qualification-framework-mqfenglish-version/file|title=Malaysian Qualifications Framework|publisher=[[Malaysian Qualifications Agency]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''György P. Bulányi''' (Budapest, 9 January 1919 – Budapest, June 6, 2010{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}}) was a [[Piarist]] priest, teacher, and leader of the [[Bokor (Catholic)|Bokor]] Catholic youth discipleship movements in [[Religion in Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Religion in Hungary|Hungary]] which faced strong suppression from the Hungarian [[Hungarian People's Republic|communist government]] and Catholic hierarchy for their advocacy of [[conscientious objection]].

== Early life ==

Bulányi graduated from the College of Teacher Education, the College of Paleontology, and then the [[Eötvös Loránd University|Pázmány Péter University of Sciences]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} In 1943 he was ordained a priest in the Piarist Order.{{sfn|Ramet|2014|p=113}}{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}}{{sfn|Partizano|2010}} He then taught in a [[Catholic school|Piarist high school]] serving [[Sátoraljaújhely]], [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]], and [[Debrecen]].
In March 1945, a [[Croatian Province of the Society of Jesus|Croatian Jesuit]] named [[Kolaković]]s came to Hungary to form [[base communities]] of youth with the permission of [[József Mindszenty]], bishop of [[Veszprém]]. {{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}} Kolakovićs viewed the model of base communities or [[cell groups]] as a survival strategy in the face of likely [[Persecution of Christians in the Eastern Bloc|communist suppression]] where leaders might be unavailable.{{sfn|Partizano|2010}} Bulányi and Kolakovićs collaborated to in the [[Formation (Catholic)|formation]] of the high school students who joined this community, and the group came to be called Bokor{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}} meaning "[[bush (plant)|bush]]".{{sfn|Ramet|2014|p=100}} They were sometimes also called Bulányists.{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}}

== Bokor ==

Bokor was focused on following [[Jesus]] and cultivating a love for Jesus.{{sfn|Adogame|Olson|Obinna|Vincett|2016|p=149f}}{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}} Bokor taught principles of [[altruism]], [[humility]], [[voluntary poverty]], service to the poor, and [[Christian pacifism]]. Bokor opposed all involvement in the military and use of force.{{sfn|Adogame|Olson|Obinna|Vincett|2016|p=149f}}{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}} It was a [[Christian movement|movement]] designed for [[exponential growth]], intending to train participants to start their own [[Leaderless resistance|leaderless]] [[cell group]] of 4–12 friends.{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}}{{sfn|Partizano|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvtxt|Ramet|2014|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was [[egalitarian]], offering all participants the opportunity to share their opinions, and group [[prayer]]s were performed by [[taking turns]].{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}}

In 1949, Bulányi wrote a pamphlet {{lang|hu|Régi Írás}} (Old Scripture) on behalf of a group calling itself {{lang|hu|Bokor-Öko}} (Bush-Eco). The pamphlet asserted that humanity has a [[moral responsibility]] to respect [[nature]], [[Conservation (ethic)|preserve]] the [[natural environment]], and consider the impacts of actions on [[future generation]]s. This is one of the earliest documents of the modern [[environmental movement]] in Hungary.{{sfn|Tibor Valuch|2001}}

Bokor opposed the [[atheist]] [[communist]] ideology of the Hungarian state under [[Mátyás Rákosi]],{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} and continued to clash specifically on the topic of pacifism. The Hungarian State Church Office to the Bishop warned them that this position would not be tolerated, but Bokor held firm on this issue.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt;{{sfn|Partizano|2010}} The Hungarian government viewed the Bokor community as an illegal anti-state organization,{{cn|date=April 2018}} and sentenced Bulányi to [[life imprisonment]] in 1952.{{sfn|Ramet|2014|p=113}}{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} He escaped in October 1956 during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]]{{sfn|Ramet|2014|p=113}} and became a [[parish priest]] in downtown [[Budapest]].{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} However, he was arrested again in April 1958 and later released again in 1960.{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} At this time, he was one of the most controversial figures in Hungarian Catholicism.{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} He then worked as an unskilled laborer while he wrote a book, ''Seek the kingdom of God!''{{sfn|Partizano|2010}}

Bokor grew throughout the 1960s and became even more visible after 1970,{{sfn|Murzaku|2015|p=173}} despite ongoing suppression from both the government and the Catholic hierarchy.{{cn|date=April 2018}} For those interested in deeper discipleship, Bokor offered a 5 year theological course involving about 78–80 [[Spiritual practice|spiritual exercises]] per year.{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}}
In 1989, Bokor had 185 leaders, 35 of whom were priests.{{sfn|Gyula Havasy|1993}} The movement was connected to the base communities of Latin American [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Partizano|2010}} Bokor continued to be suppressed by the Hungarian government until 1990.{{sfn|Ramet|2014|p=104}}

== Conscientious objection advocacy ==

From the end of the 1970s into 1981, Bulányi became more vocal in preaching pacifism and [[conscientious objection]] publicly, and the practice increased markedly.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Miszlivetz|1999|p=11}} Dozens of Bokor members were imprisoned for their pacifist stance.{{sfn|Murzaku|2015|p=173}}{{sfn|Miszlivetz|1999|p=11}} [[Catholic Church in Hungary|Hungarian Catholic]] officials, led by [[László Paskai]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest|archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest]], strongly objected to Bulányi's teaching, considering it harmful and dangerous.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Adogame|Olson|Obinna|Vincett|2016|p=149f}} They issued a formal condemnation of conscientious objection in October 1986.{{sfn|Miszlivetz|1999|p=12}} These officials supported government suppression of conscientious objectors,{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=162}} and imprisonments continued throughout the 1980s.{{sfn|Adogame|Olson|Obinna|Vincett|2016|p=149f}} Continued advocacy from groups like Bokor and interaction with Catholics outside of Hungary softened their perspective, however, and in March 1988, Paskai suggested that the Prime Minister allow [[alternative civilian service]].{{sfn|Miszlivetz|1999|p=12}} Paskai later claimed to have been constrained by the autocratic government and said that he had no choice but to collaborate in suppression.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=162}}

== Conflict with Catholic hierarchy ==

The Hungarian government and Catholic hierarchy responded by seeking to discredit Bulányi by presenting evidence that his writings were heretical. There was significant debate about Bulányi's writings such as ''Church order'' and ''Is obedience a virtue?'', drawing input from theologians such as [[Hans Küng]].{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} In a 31 December 1986 letter, Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], asked Bulányi to publicly withdraw his teachings on the universal priesthood of the laity as false, dangerous ambiguous, and [[heretical]].{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}}&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gerlo"&gt;[http://www.gerlo.hu/hvall/enci/bulanyi.html Ki tért meg? (Bulányi György piarista atya egyházi rehabilitációja, HVG, 1997. október 4.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Bulányi did not agree with Ratzinger's assessment, and for a decade these strong official statements against Bulányi remained.{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} After the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|change in government in Hungary in 1989]], the Hungarian state requested forgiveness from Bulányi.&lt;ref name="belfold" /&gt; However, leaders of the Catholic Church did not apologize.&lt;ref name="belfold"&gt;[https://index.hu/belfold/2010/06/07/meghalt_bulanyi_gyorgy/ Index.hu (Meghalt Bulányi György, 2010. június. 7.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in February 1997, Bulányi and Ratzinger came to an agreement, with [[John Paul II]] offering greater [[freedom of conscience]] than Ratzinger had previously accepted.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Bulányi cooperated, clarified his teachings, and signed a statement requested of him.{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} On 5 April 1997, Ratzinger wrote that he considered the matter closed.{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} On 10 September 1997, there was a public announcement of the formal [[Rehabilitation (Catholic)|rehabilitation]] of Bulányi in the Catholic Church,{{cn|date=April 2018}} and he was once again permitted to conduct mass.{{sfn|Ramet|2014|p=104}}

The [[Hungarian Catholic Bishops' Conference]] published the statements of Bulányi and Ratzinger without comment. Some Hungarian Catholics were disappointed that the Conference didn't offer an apology for their behavior toward Bulányi and his supporters. These Catholic viewed the actions of the Catholic hierarchy as improper use of power in collaboration with an immoral autocratic state.{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}} Even after rehabilitation, Bulányi continued to be marginalized within the Catholic community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nol.hu/belfold/bulanyi_gyorgy_halalara_ Népszabadság Online (Bulányi György halálára, 2010. June 7.)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Partizano|2010}} From 2005 until his death, Bulányi lived with other Piarists in the {{ill|Kalazantinum|hu}} of Budapest.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Views ==
Bulányi identified with the views of [[Marcion of Sinope]] in rejecting the [[Old Testament]] as [[Biblical inspiration|uninspired]], immoral, and incompatible with the character of the God of Jesus who is love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=2014 |title=Az Ószövetség nem Isten igéje |trans-title=The Old Testament is not the Word of God |work=Flag Polgári Magazine |language=hu |url=https://flagmagazin.hu/mondom-a-magamet/bulanyi-gyorgy-atya-az-oszovetseg-nem-isten-igeje |access-date=16 April 2018}}, reprinted from an April issue of Magyar Mérce, published by [[Jobbik]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulányi affirmed a church structure consisting of [[base communities]],&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;[http://bocs.hu/ford/bocsf16.htm Idézi Jupp Wagner]&lt;/ref&gt; based on a theological affirmation of [[universal priesthood]] of the [[laity]].{{sfn|Zala Lama|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvtxt|Ramet|2014|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Half Assini Senior High School''' is a coeducational senior high school located at [[Half Assini]] in the [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western Region]] of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PTA provides school with lavatory|url = http://www.ghananewsagency.org/education/pta-provides-school-with-lavatory--89715|access-date = 22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nzemas Celebrate Founder's Day – Daily Guide Ghana|url = http://www.dailyguideghana.com/nzemas-celebrate-founders-day/|website = www.dailyguideghana.com|access-date = 22 May 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150705125114/http://www.dailyguideghana.com/nzemas-celebrate-founders-day/|archivedate = 5 July 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was one of the schools founded by the first [[president of Ghana]], Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. He founded the school with sixty students and four teachers. The school was among the few early established schools in the country (Modern Ghana) and it attracted the best of brains across the continent. Most of the infrastructure in the school now was originally put up by Nkrumah, and sincerely it had one of the best science resource centers in the country at the time. 

==Student body==
The school has about 1,500 students.

'''JFLAP''' (Java Formal Languages and Automata Package) is interactive educational software written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] 
for experimenting with topics in the [[computer science]] 
area of [[formal languages]] and [[automata theory]], primarily intended for use at the undergraduate level or as an advanced
topic for high school.  JFLAP allows one to create and simulate structures, such as programming a finite state machine, and 
experiment with proofs, such as converting a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to a 
deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

JFLAP is developed and maintained at [[Duke University]], with support from the  [[National Science Foundation]] since 1993. It is [[freeware]] and the source code of the most recent version is available, but under some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/jflap/jflaptmp/aug28-09/license.html|accessdate=2 October 2016|title=JFLAP 7.0 LICENSE|author=Susan H. Rodger}}&lt;/ref&gt; JFLAP runs as a Java application.

==History==

Before JFLAP, there were several software tools related to automata theory developed by [[Susan H. Rodger]] and her students starting around 1990 
in the Computer Science Department at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]. In 1992, the first published paper at a DIMACS 2012 workshop described a related tool called NPDA 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=D. Caugherty |author2=S. H. Rodger |year = 1992
 |title =NPDA: A Tool for Visualizing and Simulating Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata
 |journal =DIMACS Workshop March 12–14, 1992
 |pages = 365–377
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the paper was published later in 1994 in a DIMACS series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author =Nathaniel Dean and Gregory E. Shannon, Editors
 |title = DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science: Computational Support for Discrete Mathematics, DIMACS Workshop, March 12-14, 1992
 |year = 1994
 |publisher =American Mathematical Society
 |volume = 15
 |location = United States of America
 |isbn =0821866052
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NPDA then evolved into FLAP, including also finite state machines and Turing machines.
In 1993, a paper on Formal Languages and Automata Package
(FLAP) was published
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=M. LoSacco |author2=S. H. Rodger |year = 1993
 |title = FLAP: A Tool for Drawing and Simulating Automata
 |journal =EDMEDIA '93, World Conference on Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia
 |pages = 310–317
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the tool was written in C++ and [[X Window System|X Window]]. Around 1994, Rodger moved to 
[[Duke University]] and continued tool development. Around 1996, FLAP was converted to 
Java and the first paper mentioned JFLAP was published in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=M. Procopiuc, O. Procopiuc |author2=S. Rodger,
 |year =1996
 |title =Visualization and Interaction in the Computer Science Formal Languages Course with JFLAP
 |journal =1996 Frontiers in Education Conference
 |pages = 121–125
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along the way, other tools were developed as stand alone tools and then later integrated into JFLAP. 
For example, a  paper in 1999 described how JFLAP now allowed one to experiment with construction
type proofs, such as converting an NFA to a DFA to a mininal state DFA, and as another example, 
converting NPDA to CFG and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=E. Gramond  |author2=S. H. Rodger,
 |year =1999
 |title =Using JFLAP to Interact with Theorems in Automata Theory
 |journal =Thirtieth SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education
 |pages = 336–340
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 JFLAP was converted to Swing. In 2005-2007 a study was run with fourteen institutions using 
JFLAP. A paper on this study in 2009 showed that students using JFLAP thought JFLAP made them feel more engaged in the 
class, and made learning the concepts easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |journal =Fortieth SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education
 |pages = 403–407
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of JFLAP is covered on the jflap.org site, and includes 
over 35 students from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] and [[Duke University]] who have worked on 
JFLAP and related tools since 1990.

A paper by Chakraborty, Saxena and Katti entitled "Fifty years of automata simulation: a review" 
in ACM Inroads magazine in December 2011 stated the following about JFLAP:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 |author1=P. Chakraborty |author2=P.C. Saxena |author3=C. P. Katti |year = 2011
 |title =Fifty years of automata simulation: a review
 |journal =ACM Inroads
 |volume =2
 |issue=4
 |pages = 59–70
 |doi=10.1145/2038876.2038893
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The effort put into developing this tool is unparalleled in the field of simulation of automata. As a result, today it is the most sophisticated tool for simulating automata. It now covers a large number of topics on automata and related fields. The tool is also the best documented among the tools for simulation of automata." and "The tool uses state of the art graphics and is one of the easiest to use. The tool is undoubtedly the most widely used tool for simulation of automata developed to date. Thousands of students have used it at numerous universities in more than a hundred countries."

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books on JFLAP==

Rodger and Thomas Finley wrote a book on JFLAP in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author1=Susan  Rodger |author2=Thomas Finley |title = JFLAP: An Interactive Formal Languages and Automata Package
 |year = 2006
 |publisher = Jones and Bartlett
 |location =Sudbury, MA
 |isbn =0-7637-3834-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
that can be used as a supplemental book with an automata theory course. 
Gopalakrishnan wrote a book on Computation Engineering &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author = G. L. Gopalakrishnan
 |title = Computation Engineering: Applied Automata Theory and Logic
 |year = 2006
 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media LLC
 |isbn =978-0387244181
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and in his book he encourages the use of JFLAP for experimenting with machines. JFLAP is also suggested to use for exercises. Mordechai Ben-Ari wrote a book entitled Principles of the [[SPIN model checker]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author =Mordachai Ben-Ari
 |title = Principles of the Spin Model Checker
 |year = 2008
 |publisher = Springer-Verlag London Limited
 |isbn =978-1846287695
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and JFLAP is referenced in the book. In particular the Visualizing Nondeterminism (VN) software the book is
about reads finite automata in JFLAP file format. 
Maxim Mozgovoy wrote an automata theory textbook in which he uses screen shots from JFLAP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author = Maxim Mozgovoy
 |title = Algorithms, Languages, Automata, and Compilers
 |year = 2010
 |publisher =Jones and Bartlett

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other people have written books that refer to the use of JFLAP in some way; several are mentioned on the JFLAP
web site.

[[Image:Htmlhelp.png|thumb|Lissa Explains it All site logo]]
'''LissaExplains.com''' is a [[Web site]] created by '''Alyssa "Lissa" Daniels''' (born 1986), a girl from [[Orlando, Florida]], to teach people, especially children, how to make their own Web sites. She was 11 years old when she set up the first site in 1997, and is currently{{when|date=August 2012}} a [[Junior (education)#College|university junior]] in Florida. Her site has taught many people how to create a Web site by writing their own [[HTML]] without the use of [[Web page]] creators. The web site includes [[tutorials]] and an [[internet forum]].

==History==
Daniels had trouble remembering all of the [[HTML]] codes that she needed to create her site, so she created a page which listed HTML codes. Eventually, more people noticed this page, and as she got more requests for the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], she decided she would make the site public, first publishing it at [[GeoCities]]. When she was 12 years old in 1998, she decided to purchase a [[domain name]] for her site, and renamed the site "Lissa Explains it All".

Daniels was approached in August 1999 by Ronald L. Wagner, columnist for ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. He had seen her site online and wanted to feature her and her site in his weekly column, "Family PC Fun".&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Ronald L., ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', September 26, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The article was published on September 26, 1999. At the time, her site was using large amounts of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and the [[wikt:Monthly|monthly]] [[Web hosting service|hosting]] cost for her site was beginning to be too expensive for her to keep it online. She discussed this with Wagner, who suggested that she contact a few Internet [[advertising agencies]] to see if they would like to advertise on her site. She was accepted by one agency, and soon started earning enough money through advertising to keep Lissa Explains it All online.

By summer 2000, her site was receiving over 500,000 hits a month. In June 2000, [[CNN Headline News]] aired a story about her and the website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0006/30/tod.09.html "HTML for Dummies: 13-Year-Old Girl Creates Web Site to Explain Language of the Internet"], ''[[CNN Headline News]]'', June 30, 2000, access-date=September 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CNN]] show ''Science and Technology'' also aired a story about her and her site in July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-cgi.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/07/14/whiz.kid_t.t/index.html "Whiz kid Web Designer"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225172548/http://www-cgi.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/07/14/whiz.kid_t.t/index.html |date=2014-12-25 }}, ''[[CNN]]'', July 14, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels later added a forum to her site because of the large volume of email she received. The forum allowed her visitors to get answers to the many questions they had. Lissa's HTML help forum had over 75,000 members, but due to a hard drive failure with site backups that occurred in August 2007, was offline for almost two years. The forums were reinstalled on 3 July 2009, but later went down again and are currently{{When|date=September 2016}} not available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8516">The '''Monitorial System''', '''Madras System''', '''or Lancasterian System''' was an [[education]] method that became popular on a global scale during the early 19th century. This method was also known as "mutual instruction" or the "Bell-Lancaster method" after the [[United Kingdom|British]] educators [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] and [[Joseph Lancaster]] who both independently developed it.  The method was based on the abler pupils being used as 'helpers' to the teacher, passing on the information they had learned to other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9053367/monitorial-system | contribution = Monitorial system | title = Britannica Encyclopedia | edition = online}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitorial Systems==
The Monitorial System was found very useful by 19th-century educators, as it proved to be a cheap way of making primary education more inclusive,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} thus making it possible to increase the average class size.  Joseph Lancaster's motto for his method was ''Qui docet, discit'' -- "He who teaches, learns." The methodology was adopted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[England and Wales]],{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} and later by the [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]]s System.

The system is not entirely unlike the way [[professor]]s, [[Teaching assistant|assistant]]s and [[tutor]]s work together in [[university]] education.{{Original research inline|date=January 2017}}{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The Monitorial System, although widely spread and with many advocates, fell into disfavour with [[David Stow]]'s "Glasgow System" which advocated trained teachers with higher goals than those of monitors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The basic teaching and learning process used in the Monitorial System has been used in passing knowledge between people in many cultures because of its low cost to benefit ratio. Numerous institutions use the basic concept as their primary mode of instruction. There have been many observations regarding its efficacy,
in 35{{nbsp}}AD in Rome, [[Seneca the Younger]], in an epistle to his friend, Lucillus, noted: ''[[Docendo discimus]]'' - we learn by teaching.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== The Lancasterian System ==
[[File:Giovanni Migliara - Confalonieri e Pellico alla applicazione del metodo Lancaster-Bell di mutuo insegnamento - aquarello.jpg|thumb|Count Confalonieri and [[Silvio Pellico]] attend a demonstration of the Bell-Lancaster method in the Piedmont, Italy (1860s).]]
Lancaster specified an ideal classroom (hall) as being a "parallelogram, the length about twice the width. The windows were to be six feet from the floor. The floor should be inclined, rising one foot in twenty from the master's desk to the upper end of the room, where the highest class is situated.  The master's desk is on the middle of a platform two to three feet high, erected at the lower end of the room.  Forms and desks, fixed firmly to the ground, occupy the middle of the room, a passage being left between the ends of the forms and the wall, five or six feet broad, where the children form semicircles for reading."

According to Gladman, to stimulate effort and reward merit, "Lancaster used Place Taking abundantly. He also had medals and badges of merit... Tickets could be earned too; these had a trifling pecuniary value." Prizes were given "to excess" ceremonially.&lt;ref name=Gladman&gt;{{Citation | title = School Work Control and Teaching Organisation and Principles of Education | first = JF | last = Gladman | publisher = Jarrold &amp; Sons | year = 1886}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequent changes of routine aided discipline. A code of command and exact movements also reinforced discipline. Class lists and registers were kept.

Children were classified on a dual principle according to their ability in reading and arithmetic.

Lancaster described his system as to produce a "Christian Education" and "train children in the practice of such moral habits as are conducive to the welfare of society."

== The Madras System ==
{{See also|Madras School}}
Bell's "Madras System" was so named because it originated at the Military Male Orphan Asylum, [[Egmore]], near [[Chennai|Madras]]. Gladman describes Bell's system from notes taken from "Bell's Manual" which had been published by the National Society two years after Bell's death, in 1832. "After observing children in a native school, seated on the ground, and writing in the sand, he set a boy, John Frisken, to teach the alphabet on the same principle... Bell was consequently led to extend and elaborate the system."

Bell declared "There is a faculty, inherent in the mind, of conveying and receiving mutual instruction". In 1796, John Frisken was 12 years and 8 months old. With assistants, he was in charge of 91 boys.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Dr. Bell's School, Great Junction Street.jpg|thumb|[[Dr Bell's School]], Leith]]
The school was arranged in forms or classes, each consisting of about 36 members of similar proficiency, as classified by reading ability.

The young teachers were kept to task through registers. Reading, Ciphering and Religious rehearsals were tracked through the paidometer register. Discipline was held through a 'Black Book', which had entries which were read to the entire school, and the faults were explained in moral terms.

The hall was built in rectangles, with windows five feet from the floor, but opening at the top. Desks were placed against walls, and the Master's desk was raised.  "Fixing the master thus, deprived him of much of his power; he would do more good in passing from class to class, and teaching." critics said.&lt;ref name=Gladman/&gt;

==Comparison==
[[Frederick John Gladman]], writing in the 1880s, distinguishes between the Lancasterian system and the Madras System. The Lancasterian System is described as preferring smaller classes, unlike Bell's Madras System.&lt;ref name=Gladman/&gt;

Despite the many similarities of the two systems, and the initial friendship of Lancaster and Bell, divisions appeared between their advocates. In 1805, a Mrs Trimmer published a paper claiming Lancaster's system was antagonistic to the Anglican Church. It was said that the country was soon divided into two camps; speeches, sermons, magazine articles and pamphlets appeared on each side. The [[National school (England and Wales)|National Society]] was formed to propagate Bell's System and the [[British and Foreign School Society]] (B&amp;FSS) was formed to propagate Lancaster's System. &lt;!-- I haven't the reference to state that the differences had little to do with teaching methods but more the content of the syllabus- and the way religious instruction was implemented. Anglican (National Schools) versus Evangelical/Non-conformist (British Schools). --&gt;

There is one surviving [[British Schools Museum|British School]] in Hitchin, Hertfordshire- and this is now run as a museum with and experiential educational program suitable for Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=England|first1= Mark|last2=Saunders|first2=Jack |title=British Schools Museum, Hitchin|url=http://www.britishschoolsmuseum.co.uk/ed/monitorial|website=www.britishschoolsmuseum.co.uk|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:mmds dish1.jpg|thumb|right|MMDS microwave dish]]
'''Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service''' ('''MMDS'''), formerly known as '''Broadband Radio Service''' ('''BRS''') and also known as '''Wireless Cable''', is a wireless [[telecommunications]] technology, used for general-purpose [[broadband]] [[computer network|networking]] or, more commonly, as an alternative method of [[cable television]] programming reception.

MMDS is used in the [[Sudan]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Iceland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Barbados]], [[Australia]], [[Portugal]], [[Madeira]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Panama]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Uruguay]], [[India]], [[Belarus]], [[Lebanon]], [[Cambodia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. It is most commonly used in sparsely populated [[rural]] areas, where laying cables is not economically viable, although some companies may also offer MMDS services in [[Urban area|urban]] areas, most notably in Ireland where MMDS was phased out in 2016.

==Technology==
The BRS band uses [[microwave]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequencies]] from 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz to 2.7 [[GHz]]. Reception of BRS-delivered television and data signals is done with a rooftop microwave [[Antenna (electronics)|antenna]].  The antenna is attached to a down-converter or transceiver to receive and transmit the microwave signal and convert them to frequencies compatible with standard [[TV tuner]]s (much like on [[satellite dish]]es where the signals are converted down to frequencies more compatible with standard TV [[coaxial cable|coaxial cabling]]), some antennas use an integrated [[Digital down converter|down-converter]] or transceiver. Digital TV channels can then be decoded with a standard cable [[set-top box]] or directly for TVs with integrated digital tuners. Internet data can be received with a standard DOCSIS Cable Modem connected to the same antenna and transceiver.

The MMDS band is separated into 33 6&amp;nbsp;MHz "channels" (31 in USA) which may be licensed to cable companies offering service in different areas of a country.  The concept was to allow entities to own several channels and [[multiplexing|multiplex]] several television, radio, and later Internet data onto each channel using digital technology.  Just like with Digital Cable channels, each channel is capable of 30.34&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s with 64QAM modulation, and 42.88&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s with 256QAM modulation. Due to [[forward error correction]] and other overhead, actual throughput is around 27&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for 64QAM and 38&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for 256QAM.

The newer BRS Band Plan makes changes to channel size and licensing in order to accommodate new WIMAX TDD fixed and mobile equipment, and reallocated frequencies from 2150–2162&amp;nbsp;MHz to the AWS band.  These changes may not be compatible with the frequencies and channel sizes required for operating traditional MMDS or DOCSIS based equipment.

==MMDS and DOCSIS+==
[[Local Multipoint Distribution Service]] (LMDS) and BRS have adapted the [[DOCSIS]] (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) from the [[cable modem]] world. The version of DOCSIS modified for wireless broadband is known as [[DOCSIS+]].

Data-transport security is accomplished under BRS by encrypting traffic flows between the [[broadband]] [[wireless modem]] and the WMTS (Wireless Modem Termination System) located in the [[base station]] of the provider's network using [[Triple DES]].

DOCSIS+ reduces theft-of-service vulnerabilities under BRS by requiring that the WMTS enforce [[encryption]], and by employing an authenticated client/server [[Key (cryptography)|key-management protocol]] in which the WMTS controls distribution of [[Cryptographic protocol|keying]] material to broadband wireless modems.

LMDS and BRS wireless modems utilize the DOCSIS+ key-management protocol to obtain authorization and traffic encryption material from a WMTS, and to support periodic reauthorization and key refresh. The key-management protocol uses [[X.509]] digital certificates, [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[Public-key cryptography|public key encryption]], and Triple DES encryption to secure [[Key (cryptography)|key]] exchanges between the wireless modem and the WMTS.

MMDS provided significantly greater range than LMDS.

MMDS may be obsoleted by the newer [[IEEE 802.16|802.16]] [[WiMAX]] standard approved since 2004.

MMDS was sometimes expanded to Multipoint Microwave Distribution System or Multi-channel Multi-point Distribution System. All three phrases refer to the same technology.

==Current status==
In the United States, [[WATCH Communications]] (based in Lima, Ohio), Eagle Vision (based in Kirksville, MO), and several other companies offer MMDS-based wireless cable television, Internet access, and [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-based telephone services.

In certain areas, BRS is being deployed for use as wireless high-speed [[Internet access]], mostly in rural areas where other types of high-speed internet are either unavailable (such as cable or [[DSL]]) or prohibitively expensive (such as satellite internet). CommSPEED is a major vendor in the US market for BRS-based internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commspeed.net/ CommSPEED]&lt;/ref&gt;

AWI Networks (formerly Sky-View Technologies) operates a number of MMDS sites delivering high-speed Internet, VoIP telephone, and Digital TV services in the Southwestern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awinetworks.com/ AWI Networks]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, AWI began upgrading its infrastructure to DOCSIS 3.0 hardware, along with new microwave transmission equipment, allowing higher modulation rates like 256QAM.  This has enabled download speeds in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, over distances up to 35 miles from the transmission site.

In the early days of MMDS, it was known as "Wireless Cable" and was used in a variety of investment scams that still surface today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sos.state.ms.us/regenf/Securities/Scams.asp Wireless Cable Scams&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequent solicitations of Wireless Cable fraud schemes were often heard on talk radio shows like ''[[The Sonny Bloch Show]]'' in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/26/business/sonny-bloch-radio-show-host-charged-with-fraud.html Sonny Bloch Radio Show Host Charged with Fraud&lt;/ref&gt;

Several US telephone companies attempted television services via this system in the mid-1990s{{snd}}the [[Tele-TV]] venture of [[Bell Atlantic]], [[NYNEX]] and [[Pacific Bell]]; and the rival [[Americast]] consortium of [[Ameritech]], [[BellSouth]], [[AT&amp;T|SBC]], [[Southern New England Telecommunications|SNET]] and [[GTE]]. The Tele-TV operation was only launched from 1999 to 2001 by Pacific Bell (the merged Bell Atlantic/NYNEX never launched a service), while Americast also petered out by that time, albeit mainly in GTE and BellSouth areas; the systems operated by Ameritech utilized standard wired cable.

In the Canadian provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Craig Wireless]] operates a wireless cable and internet service (MMDS) for rural and remote customers.

In Mexico, the 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz band spectrum was reclaimed by the government in order to allow newer and better wireless data services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sct.gob.mx/despliega-noticias/article/acordaron-sct-y-concesionarios-de-banda-de-25-ghz-reintegrar-al-estado-130-mhz/&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, MAS TV (formerly known as MVS Multivision) had to relinquish the concessions for TV broadcast and shut down its MMDS pay TV services in 2014 after 25 years of service.

In Ireland, since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCFBSjuiyUY The Launch of the MMDS TV Distribution System 12.04.1990]&lt;/ref&gt; [[UPC Ireland]] (previously [[Chorus Communications|Chorus]] and [[NTL Ireland]]) offered MMDS TV services almost nationwide. The frequency band initially allocated was 2500–2690&amp;nbsp;MHz (the "2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz band") consisting of 22–23 8&amp;nbsp;MHz analogue channels; digital TV was restricted to 2524–2668&amp;nbsp;MHz, consisting of 18 8&amp;nbsp;MHz digital channels. Two digital TV standards were used: DVB-T/MPEG-2 in the old Chorus franchise area and DVB-C/MPEG-2 in the old NTL franchise area. The existing licences were to expire 18 April 2014 but Comreg, the Irish communications regulator, extended the licences for a further 2 years to 18 April 2016 at which date they expired together with all associated spectrum rights of use. The 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz band spectrum will be auctioned off so that when the existing MMDS licences expire new rights of use can issue on a service and technology neutral basis (by means of new licences). As a result, holders of the new rights of use may choose to provide any service capable of being delivered using 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz spectrum. For instance, they could distribute television programming content, subject to complying with the relevant technical conditions and with any necessary broadcasting content authorisations, or they could adopt some other use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comreg.ie/publications/response_to_consultation_and_final_decision_on_proposal_to_renew_the_existing_mmds_licences_from_19_april_2014_to_18_april_2016.583.104337.p.html ComReg Ireland] Final Decision on proposal to renew the existing MMDS licences from 19 April 2014 to 18 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iceland, since November 2006, [[Vodafone Iceland]] runs Digital Ísland (Digital Iceland){{snd}}the broadcasting system for [[365 (media corporation)]], (previously operated by 365 Broadcast Media). Digital Ísland offers digital MMDS television services using [[DVB-T]] technology alongside a few analogue channels. The MMDS frequency range extends from 2500–2684&amp;nbsp;MHz for a total of 23 8&amp;nbsp;MHz channels, of which 21 are considered usable for broadcasting in Iceland. Analogue MMDS broadcasting began in 1993, moving to digital in 2004.

In Brazil, the shutdown of the MMDS technology started in 2012 to release the frequency for the 2500–2600&amp;nbsp;MHz LTE-UTRAN band, which would make the service infeasible. The national shutdown was planned to be finished at the end of 2012; as of 2013, the service had already been shutdown in most cities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telesintese.com.br/telefonica-vivo-comeca-desocupacao-da-faixa-de-mmds-em-sao-paulo-curitiba-e-porto-alegre/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dominican Republic]], Wind Telecom started operations using MMDS technology in 2008; at that time and ever since it became a pioneer taking advantage of such implementations. The company uses the DVB standard for its digital television transmissions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10428">The '''National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition''' ('''NCCDC''') is the championship event for the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition system – the largest college-level cyber defense competition in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalccdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The event is held annually in the San Antonio area.

In an effort to help facilitate the development of a regular, national level cyber security exercise, the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security at the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] (UTSA) hosted the first Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition for the Southwestern region in May 2005.  On June 29, 2010, United States House legislature passed recognizing the National CCDC for promoting cyber security curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hr111-1244&lt;/ref&gt;

While similar to other cyber defense competitions in many aspects, the NCCDC, is unique in that it focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing network infrastructure. While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire semester, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing commercial network. Teams are assessed based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://seccdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The NCCDC is operated under the rules as published by the Center for Infrastructure and Assurance at UTSA.&lt;ref&gt;http://cias.utsa.edu/competitions.html&lt;/ref&gt; The current rules can be found at [http://www.nationalccdc.org/ Homepage].

==Regional Competitions==
Several regional groups have formed to provide qualifying events for the NCCDC annual event. Some regions share and overlap various states. Every effort is made to make each regional event consistent with the NCCDC event.

==Historical overview==
In 1607 the [[Jesuit]] order established itself in Zagreb. In addition to founding a grammar school, the Jesuits founded a Jesuit College with an accompanying library. By 1645 the library was housed in a special hall, it had a librarian and rules were established regarding the preservation and lending of books. In 1669 the Jesuit College acquired the status of an  Academy by the Charter of King Leopold I and became ''Academia Zagrabiensis''. The library and its holdings were moved into an old building of the abandoned Dominican monastery in today’s 5 St. Catherine’s Square in the Old Town of Zagreb.

The Jesuit order was disbanded in 1773. The College continued with its provisional activities until 1776, when the library became part of the Royal Zagreb Academy of Sciences (''Regia Academia Zagrabiensis'') as an academy of law, philosophy and theology. The following year the library received a bequest containing historical material from the clergyman Adam Baltazar Krčelić, with a stipulation that this material be made available to the wider public.

As a result of [[legal deposit]] regulations introduced in 1816 bearing on the [[University of Pest]], the library's national importance began to increase. Such legal deposit regulations were extended to the whole territory of Croatia and Slavonia in 1837. Antun Kukuljević, politician and the founder of the Croatian educational system, changed the name of the library to the Latin name, ''Nationalis Academica Bibliotheca'', highlighting the dual nature of the library’s educational and national functions, which it has jointly developed since then and symbolically preserved in its name to this day.

The Franz Josef I Royal University in Zagreb was founded in 1874, and the Academy library (''Bibliotheca Regiae Academiae Zagrabiensis'') became part of the University and changed its name to University Library, increasing its significance and role in higher education.

In 1913 the library with its approximately 110,000 volumes moved from the building of the present-day Rector’s Office into an impressive Art Nouveau edifice located in 21 Marko Marulić Square, the first building built specifically for the purposes of the library. As it was designed to house 500,000 volumes, its premises soon become inadequate for the library’s 2,500,000 volumes – books, journals, newspapers and the particularly valuable items of the library’s special collections.&lt;ref name="Stam2016" /&gt;  A new library building, the Pantheon of the Croatian Book, was commissioned: its foundation stone was laid in 1988 and the building opened on 28 May 1995 as part of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of Croatia’s independence. This modern edifice was designed by Croatian architects [[Velimir Neidhardt]], Marijan Hržić, Zvonimir Krznarić and Davor Mance.&lt;ref name="Stam2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=David H. Stam|title=International Dictionary of Library Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=APtYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA457|date=8 January 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77785-1|page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noored Kooli''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] for ''Young people to schools'') is a solution to address the critical [[teacher]] shortage in [[Estonia]], drawing inspiration from a similar scheme, [[Teach First]], in the [[United Kingdom]]. Launched on February 6, 2006, Noored Kooli aims to place 10-15 exceptional [[Estonia]]n [[college graduate|graduates]] into the schools that need them the most for a minimum of 2 years.

After this period participants can choose to remain in teaching or move on into other careers where the skills and experience gained from the programme will enable them to become leaders in any field

Noored Kooli participants receive an intensive [[teacher training]] course before entering schools to teach full-time on regular teachers' salaries with an added stipend provided by Noored Kooli.

During their time in schools, participants receive mentoring and support from leaders in education to ensure that they become exceptional and effective teachers.

Beyond the impact in the classroom, Noored Kooli participants take part in training and mentorships from both opinion and business leaders in Estonia.

Noored Kooli enjoys a wide breadth of support from both the public and private sectors.

'''OATS''' ("'''Open Source Assistive Technology Software'''") is a [[source code repository]] or "[[Forge (software)|forge]]" for [[assistive technology]] software. It was launched in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;Steve Lee: "[http://eduspaces.net/stevelee/weblog/13994.html OATSoft, a new service and a landmark for Accessibility]", 6 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal to provide a one-stop “shop” for end users, clinicians and open-source developers to promote and develop [[open source]] assistive technology software. It also allows users to find other software that is free but not open source,&lt;ref name="projectSummary"&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Info/Project/ProjectSummary/ Project Summary].&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source software that is developed elsewhere, for example [[NonVisual Desktop Access|NVDA]],&lt;ref&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/nvda NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access)].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orca (assistive technology)|Orca]]&lt;ref&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/orca-1 Orca].&lt;/ref&gt; and FireVox.&lt;ref&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/fire-vox Fire Vox].&lt;/ref&gt;

The OATS website was launched at the end of the OATS project, a one-year pilot project that ended in March 2006, and claimed to be the first open-source repository dedicated to assistive technology.&lt;ref name="projectSummary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Info/News/pressrelease.2006-05-03.7588301469 OATS Launch Press Release], 3 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) announced that it was backing the OATS project;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Richards: "[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2006/04/20/215458/BCS-backs-open-source-project-to-boost-software-for-disabled.htm BCS backs open source project to boost software for disabled users]" ''Computer Weekly'', Thursday 20 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; in August 2006, the British Computer Society's Open Source Specialist Group organised a meeting about the project.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ossg.bcs.org/2006/08/11/oats-meeting-aftermath/ OATS Meeting Aftermath]", BCS Open Source Specialist Group Blog, Friday, August 11th 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OATS project was made up of five partner organisations co-ordinated by the [[ACE Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Info/Project/OatsConsortium/ OATS Consortium].&lt;/ref&gt; The OATS repository wants to offer an efficient and intuitive way to access good quality assistive technology.&lt;ref&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Info/Project/ProjectContext Project Context].&lt;/ref&gt; The OATS repository offers the following facilities to developers:&lt;ref&gt;OATS: [http://www.oatsoft.org/Forge/Info/hosting-on-oats Hosting on OATS].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:UNESCO_CSF_logo.jpg|250px|frameless|left|Image on left]]
OpenEMIS is an initiative launched by [[UNESCO]].  The initiative is in line with UNESCO's effort to promote EMIS to address the issues of access, equity, quality, and relevance in education and subsequent gaps between Member States in providing an adequate decision support system since early 2000s, in keeping with the [[Education for All]] goals adopted in Dakar in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Almaty Cluster Office and the Ministry of Education of Tajikistan (2002). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001568/156818eo.pdf "Education Management Information System (EMIS) and the Formulation of Education for All (EFA): Plan of Action, 2002-2015".] Retrieved 11 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  OpenEMIS was conceived to be a royalty-free software that can be customized to meet the specific needs of implementing countries, without conditions or restrictions for use,&lt;ref name="New Open Source"/&gt; with the purpose of encouraging country-level capacity development and helping countries upgrade their local skills for managing the tool.&lt;ref name="An Open Source"&gt;[http://www.unescobkk.org/education/ict/online-resources/databases/ict-in-education-database/item/article/openemis-an-open-sourced-education-management-information-systems-emis/ "OpenEMIS: An Open-Sourced Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)".] Retrieved 11 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The initiative is coordinated by UNESCO in partnership with a [[nonprofit organization]] (NPO), Community Systems Foundation (CSF)  for the implementation and technical support since 2012.

==Architecture==
OpenEMIS is a suite of interrelated software solutions that supports data collection (Survey; Classroom; Staffroom), management (Core; School; Integrator), and analysis (Visualizer; Monitoring; Dashboard; Analyzer; DataManager; Profiles).&lt;ref name="An Open Source"/&gt;  Each application is designed to provide unique standalone features to support different information management requirements at different levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.openemis.org/products Products.] OpenEMIS. Retrieved 11 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  These features could be customized and integrated with existing systems.  As open-source solutions, OpenEMIS benefits from coding contributions from the larger community. The OpenEMIS Initiative utilizes End-user license agreements and Contributor license agreements to ensure maintenance of standards, quality assurance and that the product remains free from commercialization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.openemis.org/resources#w10 Resources &gt;&gt; Agreements.] OpenEMIS.

'''Publons''' is a website and free service for academics to track, verify and showcase their [[post-publication peer review|peer review]] and editorial contributions for academic journals. It was launched in 2012 and by 2017 more than 200,000 researchers have joined the site, adding more than one million reviews across 25,000 journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/02/getting-credit-peer-review|title=Getting credit for peer review|last=Ravindran|first=Sandeep|date=2016-02-08|website=Science|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Paul: [http://idealog.co.nz/venture/2016/09/wellington-startups-stayed "Wellington startups that stayed up"], in ''Idealog'', 15 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://publons.com/blog/spread-of-peer-review-workload/&lt;/ref&gt; Publons' mission is to "speed up science by harnessing the power of peer review".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publons|url = https://publons.com/about/|website = publons.com|accessdate = 2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publons claims that by turning peer review into a measurable research output, academics can use their review and editorial record as evidence of their standing and influence in their field. Publons says its business model is based on partnering with publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publons.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/5000543451-what-is-publons-business-model-|title=What is Publons' business model? : Publons|website=publons.freshdesk.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publons produces a verified record of a person's review and editorial activity for journals. This evidence is showcased on reviewers' online profiles and can be downloaded to include in CVs, funding and job applications, and promotion and performance evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Peer review is essential to good science – it's time to credit expert reviewers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/01/peer-review-is-essential-to-good-science-its-time-to-credit-expert-reviewers|last=Curry|first=Stephen|date=2017-06-01|website=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publons also provides:
* tools for publishers to find, screen, contact, and motivate peer reviewers;
* data and publications about global peer review behaviour;
* peer review training for early-career researchers; and
* features for academics to discuss and evaluate published research.  
Reviewers can choose whether or not to make the content of their review [[open access]] following publication of the reviewed publication, though journals can choose to override this. Review content is shared using a [[Creative Commons]] CC BY 4.0 [[Creative Commons license|license]]. It has partnerships with major publishers, including [[Springer Nature]], [[Taylor and Francis]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[BMJ (company)|BMJ]], [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] and [https://publons.com/community/our-partners/ more], and with related services such as [[Altmetric]] and [[ORCID]].

== Background ==
Publons was founded by Andrew Preston and Daniel Johnston to address the static state of peer-reviewing practices in academic research publishing, in view of encouraging collaboration and speeding scientific development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Future of Academic Research|url = http://figshare.com/articles/The_Future_of_Academic_Research/871466|doi = 10.6084/m9.figshare.871466|last = Preston|first = Andrew|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Johnston}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Publons name is an homage to the "publon", the "[[Least publishable unit|minimum unit of publishable material]]". The company is registered in New Zealand and has an office in London, UK.

Publons was acquired by [[Clarivate Analytics]] in 2017. Clarivate's citation network and researcher tools, including products like [[Web of Science]], [[EndNote]], and [[ScholarOne]], has generated customers in more than 100 countries and 7,000 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Page|first1=Benedicte|title=Clarivate Analytics buys Publons|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/clarivate-analytics-buys-publons-562691|access-date=2017-11-01|work=The Bookseller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publons — which continues to run as a stand-alone business - say the partnership will bring more transparency, recognition, and training to peer review, helping to solve some of the critical problems facing research today.&lt;ref&gt;https://publons.com/blog/publons-joins-clarivate-analytics/&lt;/ref&gt; This includes speeding up research by helping editors find skilled and motivated peer reviewers, and tackling issues such as peer review fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Web of Science owner buys up booming peer-review platform|url=https://www.nature.com/news/web-of-science-owner-buys-up-booming-peer-review-platform-1.22094|access-date=2017-11-01|work=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publons Academy ==
The Publons Academy is Publons' peer review training course for early-career researchers.&lt;ref&gt;https://publons.com/community/academy/&lt;/ref&gt; The free, online course requires students to practice writing real reviews that are assessed by a supervisor. Upon completion of the course, graduate reviewers are made discoverable to Publons partner journals on the site who can invite these reviewers to perform real pre-publication peer reviews.

== Publons Peer Review Awards ==
Publons Peer Review Awards&lt;ref&gt;https://publons.com/awards/&lt;/ref&gt; are recognitions for top peer reviewers and editors. Publons' Awards started in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the world's top peer reviewer|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/23/meet-the-worlds-top-peer-reviewer/|access-date=2017-11-01|work=Stat News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 an award program called the Sentinel Award was added, for outstanding advocacy, innovation or contribution to scholarly peer review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time to open the curtains on peer review|url=https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/time-to-open-the-curtains-on-peer-review|access-date=2017-11-01|work=Nature Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[TechCrunch]] remarked that lack of transparency leads to many problems in the publication process, and Publons purports to help with that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shu|first1=Catherine|title=Academic Startup Publons Gives Peer Reviewers Credit For Their Work|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/08/academic-startup-publons-gives-peer-reviewers-credit-for-their-work/|accessdate=5 September 2014|work=Techcrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Research Information'' noted that while the site supports both pre- and post-publication review, not all reviews are published, in deference to existing publication norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Sian|title=Tracking and Validating Reviews|url=http://www.researchinformation.info/features/feature.php?feature_id=448|website=Research Information|publisher=Europa Science Limited|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' noted that peer review is an important job, and reported on the reactions of two of Publons's most prolific reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Noorden|first1=Richard|title=The scientists who get credit for peer review|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-scientists-who-get-credit-for-peer-review-1.16102|website=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publons sends [[unsolicited bulk email]] to academics to advertise its service.  This was cited by [[Mailbox provider|email service providers]] for being violation of acceptable use policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ScientificSpam DNSBL on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/scientificspam/status/621620534426628096|website = Twitter|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7522">Professor '''Reuben James Olembo''' (1937 - 2005) was a prominent Kenyan academic, scientist and environmentalist. He was a Deputy Executive Director of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), which he played a pivotal role in helping found,  and United Nations Assistant Secretary General from 1994-1998.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=429&amp;ArticleID=4753&amp;l=en |title=Speeches - March 2005 - The Passing Away of An Environmental Icon: Prof. Reuben Olembo - United Nations Environment Programme |publisher=UNEP |date= |accessdate=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Acting Secretary General of the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cites.org/eng/disc/what.php |title=What is |publisher=CITES |date= |accessdate=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his retirement from UNEP.

==Early life==
Reuben Olembo was born on November 28, 1937 in [[Bunyore]] in the then Vihiga District of Kakamega in [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western Province]], Kenya. He excelled in his studies at Wanakhale Primary School, and then Maseno School, both of which were [[mission school]]s. Faith played a key role in his early family life and education. His parents were both ministers in the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], established in his village by American missionaries.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Olembo was among the students airlifted to the US in 1959 as part of the [[The Kennedy Airlift|Mboya airlifts]].&lt;ref name=DailyNation1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/lifestyle/Top-Kenyan-students-flying-high-in-America/-/1214/2842452/-/rmxjk2z/-/index.html|title=They were given wings and are now flying high in top American multinationals|work=[[Daily Nation]]|date=22 August 2015|author=Vincent Achuka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33629577|title=The airlift education scholarship that changed the world|publisher=BBC|date=23 July 2015|author=Milton Nkosi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Purdue University]] in [[Indiana]]{{cn|date=October 2016}} and between 1961 and 1965 he was awarded his bachelor's (Biology and Chemistry), master's and doctoral degrees (genetics, with minors in biochemistry and statistics).&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7PPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 |title=Kenyan Student Airlifts to America 1959-1961: An Educational Odyssey |last=Stephens |first=Robert F. |publisher=Kenway Publications |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His academic accomplishments were notable because "he did not come from a scientific background and had no laboratory experience."&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Olembo taught at [[Makerere University]] in Uganda between 1965 and 1969, where he earned the nickname "Prof." He is said to have helped many Ugandans enter the UN system through scholarships and was instrumental in the establishment of Makerere University's National Institute for Environment.

The '''Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies''' ('''RUSI'''), sometimes still referred to by its pre-2004 name, the '''Royal United Services Institution''', is a [[United Kingdom|British]] defence and security [[think tank]]. It was founded in 1831 by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington, Sir Arthur Wellesley]].&lt;ref name = "Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details)_2018"&gt;{{ cite web | title = Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details) | url = http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=174682 | publisher = The British Museum, UK | language = en | accessdate = 2018-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. RUSI is an independent, non-government and non-partisan organisation registered &lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=210639&amp;subid=0 registered]&lt;/ref&gt; with the UK's Charity Commission. 

RUSI's President is [[Royal Highness|HRH]] the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]] and its Director is Karin von Hippel.

== History ==
RUSI was founded in 1831&amp;nbsp;– making it the oldest defence and security think tank in the world&amp;nbsp;– at the initiative of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Its original mission was to study naval and military science.

The Duke of Wellington spearheaded the establishment of RUSI in a letter to ''Colbourn's United Service Journal'' arguing that "a United Service Museum" should be formed, managed entirely by naval and military officers, and under patronage of the monarch, then [[King George IV]], and the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces. Such an institution would prove that the two professions have entered the lists of science, and are ready to contend for honours ''tam Artibus quam Armis'' – 'as much through the arts as through weapons'.&lt;ref name = "Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details)_2018" /&gt;

Subsequently, Commander Henry Downes, Royal Navy, assembled a group with a view to forming a committee for action, to which King George's First ADC was commanded to convey "His Majesty's gracious and high approbation of the undertaking and of the principles on which it is proposed to conduct it", which were stated to be suitable for "a strictly scientific and professional society, and not a club". The death of the King delayed matters, but the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] expressed his readiness to become a patron so, encouraged by the powerful support of the Duke of Wellington, the First [[Aide-de-camp]], [[Herbert Taylor (Major General)|Sir Herbert Taylor]], re-submitted the project to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] (the former Duke of Clarence), and was able to assure the committee that "it could proceed under his Majesty's gracious auspices".

On 25 June 1831 the committee met. The chair was taken by [[Howard Douglas|Major General Sir Howard Douglas]], in his person a symbol of the "United Service": a soldier who was the leading expert on naval gunnery. The resolution that the institution be established was put by the future Field Marshal [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Viscount Hardinge]] and seconded by the future [[Francis Beaufort|Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort]], the famous hydrographer. The first name adopted was the '''Naval and Military Museum''': this was altered in 1839 to the '''United Service Institution''', and in 1860 to the '''Royal United Service Institution''' by a [[royal charter|royal charter of incorporation]]. In 2004 the name was changed to the '''Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies'''. Fellows of RUSI may use the five-letter post-nominal abbreviation, '''FRUSI'''.

===Premises===
Prior to moving into its current purpose-built headquarters in 1895, RUSI began its existence in Whitehall Court, then moved to a house in what was then known as Middle [[Great Scotland Yard (street)|Scotland Yard]] in 1832. Queen Victoria granted RUSI the use of the [[Banqueting House]]. It finally moved to its current location next door to the Banqueting House in 1895.&lt;ref name = "Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details)_2018" /&gt;

== Activities ==
RUSI is a British institution, but operates with an international perspective. It promotes the study and discussion of developments in military doctrine, defence management and defence procurement. In recent years RUSI has broadened its remit to include all issues of defence and security, including financial and organised crime,  terrorism and the ideologies which foster it and the challenges which we face from other man-made or man-assisted threats and from natural disasters. The 2016-2017 Review and Annual Report are available &lt;ref name="rusi.org"&gt;https://rusi.org/rusi-reports/annual-report-2016-17&lt;/ref&gt;  It won ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine's Think Tank of the Year Award in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2008/10/and-the-prospect-2008-think-tank-of-the-year-is/ |title=Prospect Magazine's Think Tank of 2008 |publisher=Prospectmagazine.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the same magazine named RUSI "Foreign Policy Think Tank of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2009/10/prospect-think-tank-of-the-year-the-winners/ |title=Prospect Think Tank of the Year: The Winners |publisher=Prospect Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''European initiave Science on Stage''' - initially launched as Physics on Stage in 1999 – is designed for European teachers to share [[Best practice|good practice]] in [[science]] teaching and to discuss (new) ways of improving the quality of science lessons. This is driven by the foreseen lack of young scientists in all [[European countries]]. Science on Stage Europe believes that a good way to encourage schoolchildren to consider a career in [[science]] or [[engineering]] is to motivate and educate their teachers. Therefore, Science on Stage Europe provides a forum for science teachers to exchange teaching ideas and gives them access to science teaching resources.

== History ==

=== Physics on Stage ===

Organised by [[Eiroforum|EIROforum]], a collaboration of European research organisations, the initiative Science on Stage began in 1999 as Physics on Stage (POS),&lt;ref name="Physics on Stage"&gt;[http://physicsonstage.web.cern.ch/physicsonstage/index.html Physics on Stage], official website of the Physics on Stage festival 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; with financial support from the [[European Commission]] [POS was half funded by EIROforum]. [[Eiroforum|EIROforum]] launched the initiative to address the decreasing numbers of young physicists. The first Physics on Stage festival was at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], in 2000.&lt;ref name="Physics on Stage" /&gt; Over the course of an inspiring week, more than 500 teachers from 22 countries shared activities and projects in a fair, in workshops, in performances and in presentations showed that physics can be fun. On the back of this success, Physics on Stage 2 was arranged in 2002 at [[ESA]] in [[Noordwijk]], the [[Netherlands]]. Physics on Stage 3 followed a year later at the same location.

=== Science on Stage ===

The members of [[Eiroforum|EIROforum]] soon realised that the lack of young scientists was not limited to the field of physics, so the initiative was broadened to cover all sciences and renamed Science on Stage. The first Science on Stage festival &lt;ref name="Science on Stage festival 2005"&gt;[http://science-on-stage.web.cern.ch/science-on-stage/ Science on Stage festival 2005], official website.&lt;/ref&gt; took place in 2005, again at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]], and the second in 2007 at [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility|ESRF]]/[[Institut Laue–Langevin|ILL]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. The format of the Physics on Stage festivals remained and still remains unchanged. In May 2008, the financial support of the [[European Commission]] ran out. In March 2009, under the guidance of Stage on Stage Germany &lt;ref name="Science on Stage Germany"&gt;[http://www.science-on-stage.de/ Science on Stage Germany], official website.&lt;/ref&gt; the 27 European
countries involved unanimously affirmed their wish to continue the cooperation. All participants stressed the importance of regular European festivals as the flagship of the European Science on Stage activities. Alternative funding would be sought for the festivals. In October 2008, the first of these alternatively funded Science on Stage festivals took place at Urania in [[Berlin]], organised by Science on Stage Germany &lt;ref name="Science on Stage Germany" /&gt; and sponsored by THINK ING.,&lt;ref name="THINK ING."&gt;[http://www.think-ing.de/ THINK ING.], official website.&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative of the Federation of German Employers‘ Associations in the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industries. The second alternatively funded European Science on Stage festival took place from 16–19 April 2011 at the Ørestad Gymnasium &lt;ref name="Ørestad Gymnasium"&gt;[http://www.oerestadgym.dk/welcome/ Ørestad Gymnasium], upper secondary school in Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Copenhagen]] under the motto “Science Teaching: Winning Hearts and Minds”. It was funded by the Danish Ministry of Education and organised by Danish Science Communication and the Science on Stage Europe office. The next Science on Stage festival will take place from 25–28 April 2013 in Slubice and Frankfurt/Oder at the German-Polish border. For the first time, the festival will be organised by two countries, represented by the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and Science on Stage Germany, under the motto “Crossing Borders in Science Teaching”. 350 science teachers from across Europe will present their most innovative teaching ideas, workshops and performances. Participants are chosen at competitive national events or processes in each country involved.

== Organisation ==

Initially launched as an initiative in 2008, Science on Stage Europe became an officially registered [[non-profit association]] in January 2012, with headquarters in Berlin and recognised by German law.

Science on Stage Europe is organised in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] structure. The basis is the Science on Stage community in the participating countries. Each country has a national steering committee (NSC). The NSCs get together in the Science on Stage assembly and elect the [[executive board]]. The board is supported by invited [[experts]] and by the Science on Stage Europe office in [[Berlin]]. The Science on Stage international festivals take place every two years, as the culmination of all the national Science on Stage activities. The festivals are organised jointly by a European festival programme committee and a national organising committee.

*"Stability of operation.
*Leadership and administration.
*Financial responsibility.
*Number and qualifications of full-time faculty.
*Relationship to the Christian community at large.
*Resources — human and physical - supporting the programs.
*Attention to Christian character development in students."

Member colleges are regularly reassessed to assure that the standards are maintained.

'''The Loft Literary Center''' is a nonprofit literary organization located in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] incorporated in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: About the Loft |url=https://www.loft.org/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Loft is one of the nation’s largest and most comprehensive independent literary centers, and offers a variety of writing classes, conferences, grants, readings, writers' studios and other services to both established and emerging writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The New York Times: With Books as a Catalyst, Minneapolis Neighborhood Revives |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/realestate/commercial/30books.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Resources |url=https://www.loft.org/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the Loft hosts more than 400 writers and performers that draw more than 12,000 people, and collaborates with at least 30 local and national organizations. The Loft additionally claims to have more than 170,000 unique visitors through digital resources and online writing classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Annual Report |url=https://www.loft.org/about/annual_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Inception===

Incorporated in 1975, the Loft started in a bookstore when a group of writers decided to offer classes and readings in the upstairs loft. Following a series of successful events held at Rusoff &amp; Co. Book Dealers in [[Dinkytown]], Minnesota, bookstore owner Marly Rusoff and writers Jim Moore, [[Patricia Hampl]], Phebe Hanson, and Michael Dennis Browne formed a ‘poets’ club’ with support from a fundraising party emceed by [[Garrison Keillor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Altered Scale: Rebecca Weaver on The Loft in the 70s |url=http://alteredscale.com/contentsandnavigation/rebecca-weaver-on-the-loft/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘poets’ club’ eventually became known as ‘The Loft,’ and in 1975 filed for nonprofit status and received a grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board to sponsor several writing workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Pioneer Press: Marly Rusoff: St. Paul native, Loft 'mother,' literary agent and now publisher |url=http://www.twincities.com/entertainment/ci_23974915/loft-mother-and-literary-agent-rusoff-is-now}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, the Loft hosted a number of benefit readings that featured poets such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Robert Bly]], and [[Etheridge Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued growth===

Over the years, the Loft grew organically as a community-based nonprofit to become one of the nation’s leading independent literary centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Minnesota Women's Press: A Home for Writers |url=http://www.womenspress.com/print.asp?ArticleID=2327&amp;SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With support from the Jerome Foundation the Loft launched the Mentor Series in 1980, bringing together nationally prominent authors with promising local writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Jerome Foundation: The Loft Literary Center |url=http://www.jeromefdn.org/grantees/2008-loft-literary-center-mentor-series}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first year featured New York Times bestselling author [[Marge Piercy]] and Pulitzer Prize-winning poets [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]] and [[Galway Kinnell]]. Other programs launched in the organization’s first decade include the McKnight Artist Fellowship in Creative Writing (1982), The Loft Scholarship Fund (1984), and a radio program in collaboration with [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The McKnight Foundation: McKnight honors artists selected for fellowships and residencies in 30th year of fellowships program |url=http://www.mcknight.org/newsroom/news-releases/mcknight-honors-artists-selected-for-fellowships-and-residencies-in-30th-year-of-fellowships-program}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Loft membership passed the 2,000 mark, and in 1996 the Loft awarded more than $160,000 in grants to writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social engagement===

The Loft initiated the Amnesty Action Project in 1988, which coordinated letter-writing campaigns on behalf of imprisoned writers as identified by [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Malawian poet [[Jack Mapanje]] was the first, followed by political prisoners Jaki Seroke, [[Zwelakhe Sisulu]], [[Nguyễn Chí Thiện]], [[Dai Qing]], Lee San-ha, and Bligesu Erenus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, WCCO anchor [[Dave Moore (newscaster)|Dave Moore]] read from [[Salman Rushdie]]’s Satanic Verses at the Loft in protest of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]’s sentence of death on Rushdie. The reading was also a response from the Twin Cities Artistic Community Ad Hoc Committee in Protest of Censorship and Intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Loft hosted a week-long series of events celebrating freedom of expression that coincided with National Banned Books Week. The events included a dialogue with [[Kathy Acker]], [[Amiri Baraka]], and [[Nat Hentoff]]; a reading and forum with [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Mona Simpson]]; free speech read-ins; and performance art with J. Otis Powell and Patrick Scully at the Rogue Nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000-present===

In 1999, the Loft joined forces with [[Minnesota Center for Book Arts]] and publisher [[Milkweed Editions]] to build the nonprofit literary and book arts center [[Open Book Minneapolis|Open Book]], which opened in May 2000 and is the current home of the Loft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=With Books as a Catalyst, Minneapolis Neighborhood Revives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/realestate/commercial/30books.html|accessdate=2009-03-27 | work=The New York Times | first=Lisa | last=Chamberlain | date=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was followed by the launch of the Loft Equilibrium Spoken Word Series in 2002, which was recognized with the Minnesota Nonprofit Anti-Racism Initiative Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Star Tribune:The Loft Literary Center awarded $150,000 grant for spoken word|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/152329425.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Loft hosted a reading by former senator and anti-war presidential candidate [[Eugene McCarthy]], and collaborated with the [[Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] and [[Minnesota International Center]] to host a discussion and book signing by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Loft celebrated its 35th anniversary with the publication release of ''Views from the Loft: A Portable Writer's Workshop'' and the launch of its online education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Publishers Weekly: Views from the Loft: A Portable Writer's Workshop|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57131-323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loft now has an annual budget of over $2.4 million, and through contracts, awards, and grants pays writers more than $400,000 each year. The Loft annually serves thousands of writers by offering hundreds of classes, numerous fellowships, readings from award-winning authors, and literary resources such as a small library, writing studios, and a book club room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Resources |url=https://www.loft.org/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Loft hired 227 writers to teach 323 classes and 5 conferences. In their evaluations, 96% of students reported that their class helped them improve their writing, 91% identified their next steps as a writer, and 94% would recommend their class to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Annual Report |url=https://www.loft.org/about/annual_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tribhuvan University''' ('''TU''', {{lang-ne|[[:ne:त्रिभुवन विश्वविद्यालय|त्रिभुवन विश्वविद्यालय]]}}) is a public university in [[Kirtipur]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]. Established in 1959, TU is the oldest university in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409152/Nepal/23651/Health-and-education#ref=ref387221|title=Nepal :: Health and education|publisher=[[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of enrollment, it is the tenth [[List of largest universities by enrollment|largest university in the world]]. The university offers 2,079 undergraduate and 2,000 postgraduate programs across a wide range of disciplines.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} As of March 2017, the university has 60 constituent campuses and 1,084 affiliated colleges across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FSU elections held in just 143 colleges|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/15739|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=[[Republica (Nepalese newspaper)|Republica]]|date=2 March 2017|quote=TU has 60 constituent colleges and around 1,084 affiliate colleges including community colleges across the country, according to TU officials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is government financed, it is less expensive than private universities.

==History==
Established under the TU Act in 1959, Tribhuvan University is the oldest and largest university in Nepal. The university was named after the late [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]]. In its early years, all the postgraduate classes were held at Tripureshwor Campus. The administrative office was also located in Tripureshwor. It was only in 1967, that the university was relocated to its main campus in [[Kirtipur]] – an ancient town about 5{{nbsp}}km south-west of the city of [[Kathmandu]]. The university at Kirtipur, which spreads over an area of 154.77 hectares, constitutes the Central Administrative Office and the Central Campus.&lt;ref name="TU"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/about-us/|website=tribhuvan-university.edu.np|publisher=Tribhuvan University|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TU marked its golden jubilee in 2009 organizing programmes.

==Academics==
[[File:TU building.jpg|thumb|Tribhuvan University Administrative Building]]

Since its inception, the state-owned university has expanded its programmes. There are five technical institutes and four general faculties. The university offers 115 courses for the technical proficiency certificate level. TU offers 1079 courses at Bachelor's level and 1000 courses at Master’s level. It offers Ph.D. degrees in the technical institutes and faculties.

TU ran its programmes only through its constituent campuses before 1980. With the increasing number of students wanting higher education, it was not possible to accommodate all the students in the constituent campuses. This situation led to the establishment of colleges in the private sector because the constituent campuses alone could not meet the demand. From 1979–80, TU started providing affiliation to private colleges. As of April 2016, 1,084 private and public colleges were affiliated with TU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/1000-colleges-temporarily-affiliated-tribhuvan-university/|title=Over 1,000 colleges only temporarily affiliated to Tribhuvan University - The Himalayan Times|date=2016-04-09|newspaper=The Himalayan Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014–2015 academic session 4,05,341 students were enrolled in TU academic programmes. 1,48,141 (36.55%) students study in its 60 constituent campuses including 38 central departments, while 2,57,200 (63.45%) students study in 1,053 affiliated colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/about-us/|title=About Us - Tribhuvan University of Nepal|work=tribhuvan-university.edu.np|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

TU has 7,841 teaching faculty and 7,413 non-teaching staff including the support staff in its constituent campuses. The number of total employees is 15,254.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribhuvan-university.edu.np/about-us|title=about us|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}

'''Tuition payments''', usually known as '''tuition''' in [[American English]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fast Facts |url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as '''tuition fees''' in [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]],{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} are fees charged by education institutions for instruction or other services. Besides public spending (by governments and other public bodies), private spending via tuition payments are the largest revenue sources for education institutions in some countries. In most countries, especially countries in Scandinavia and Continental Europe, there are no or only nominal tuition fees for all forms of education, including university and other higher education.&lt;ref name="Garritzmann"&gt;Garritzmann, Julian L., 2016. ''The Political Economy of Higher Education Finance. The Politics of Tuition Fees and Subsidies in OECD countries, 1945-2015''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payment methods ==

Some of the methods used to pay for tuition include:
* [[Scholarship]]
* [[Bursary]]
* [[Company sponsorship]] or funding
* [[Grant (money)|Grant]]
* Government [[student loan]]
* Educational loan (private)
* Family (parental) money
* [[Saving]]s

== By location ==

Countries such as [[South Africa]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have “up-front tuition policies."&lt;ref name="Marcucci/Johnstone"&gt;Marcucci, Pamela N. and D. Bruce Johnstone, "Tuition Fee Policies in a Comparative Perspective: Theoretical and Political Rationales", ''Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management'', Volume 29, Number 1 (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;25-40. (Taylor &amp; Francis Online, retrieved 13 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; These policies generally include a tuition fee that is large enough to give parents or [[Legal guardian|guardians]] "a responsibility to cover some portion of their children’s higher education costs."&lt;ref name="Marcucci/Johnstone"/&gt; This responsibility can make it difficult for a low-income student to attend college without requiring a grant or one or more [[student loan|loans]].

[[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom]] were introduced in 1998, with a maximum permitted fee of £1,000. Since then, this maximum has been raised to £9,000 in most of the United Kingdom, while Scotland has abolished tuition.

[[College tuition in the United States]] is one of the costs of a post-[[secondary education]]. The total cost of college is called the [[cost of attendance]] (or, informally, the "sticker price") and, in addition to tuition, can include [[room and board]] and fees for facilities such as books, transportation, or commuting provided by the college.

[[Tuition fees in France|French tuition fees]] are capped based on the level of education pursued, from 183 Euros per year for undergraduate up to 388 for doctorates. Some public universities have autonomous status, meaning that they can charge much higher tuition, and all private universities charge tuition.

In the  [[Education in Germany|German Education system]] almost all universities and most universities of applied sciences are funded by the state and do not charge tuition fees. In exceptional cases universities may offer courses for professionals (e.g. executive MBA programmes) which may require tuition payment. Some of the local governments have recently decided that students from non-EU countries can be charged, although [[ERASMUS]] students, students from developing countries and other special groups are exempt. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2017-05/baden-wuerttemberg-landtag-stuttgart-studiengebuehren-auslaender|title=Baden-Württemberg: Stuttgarter Landtag beschließt Studiengebühren für Ausländer|author=|date=3 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018|via=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/service/presse/pressemitteilung/pid/internationale-studiengebuehren-gerecht-gestalten/|title=Internationale Studiengebühren gerecht gestalten|author=|date=|website=baden-wuerttemberg.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are private institutions of higher education which are run on a tuition-based model.   

[[Education in Greece|In Greece]] there are no tuition fees as Bachelor-level higher education and Master-level post-graduate education is provided for free to all Hellene (Greek) citizens as a benefit of citizenship paid by taxes. However, universities accept very few students who have excelled at high school, with the selection being done through the Panhellenic Examinations, a system of state-administered examinations in which the chance of failure is too high and thus only a small percentage of students is able to pass and there is a limit to the number of students that can be accepted each year. Furthermore, it is difficult for [[mature student]]s to be accepted at universities. Doctorate-level higher education is often also provided for free, but some universities may charge some fees for PhD degrees. Students who weren't able to pass the Panhellenic Examinations in a few attempts are effectively banned for life from the Greek university system and those who wish to have a higher education must resort to registering at private universities (called colleges, κολέγια) which charge tuition fees or emigrate to other countries in order to get an education. Sometimes it may happen that a student was academically excellent in school but failed to get a good "ethics performance mark" or was disqualified from entering the Panhellenic Examinations because of non-academic factors, since the Greek educational system also marks the student's "ethics performance" (διαλογή, dialogi) rather than only his or her academic performance: for example, an unruly student or a student caught cheating or drinking may receive a disqualifying mark in his or her "ethics performance" which can disqualify the student from entering university (or in extreme cases from continuing in the high school) even if the student has excellent academic skills.

== By institution ==

Tuition is charged at different rates from one type of institution to the next. Net tuition indices mark an increase in the “relative real burden” for payments at various types of institutions for higher education; in the period between 1980 and 1995, for example, this burden increased by approximately 80 percent for students at [[Public university|public universities]] and by 148 percent for students at [[Private university|private universities]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Robert E., [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40722155?sid=21105384640211&amp;uid=3738032&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2 “Why Tuition Costs Are Rising So Quickly”], ''[[Challenge: The Magazine of Economic Affairs|Challenge]]'', Volume 45, Number 4 (2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;88-108. (JSTOR, retrieved 13 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most students or their families who pay for tuition and other education costs don't have enough savings to pay in full while they are in school.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.salliemae.com/files/doc_library/file/HowAmericaPaysforCollege2014FNL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some students must work or borrow money to afford an education. In the United States, [[Student financial aid (United States)|student financial aid]] is available to defray the cost of a post-secondary education: “Financial aid is typically thought to exert the most influence in [attendance], when admitted students consider whether to enroll in a particular institution.”&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, Stephen L., “Assessing the Effects of Changing Institutional Aid Policy”, ''Research in Higher Education'', Volume 42, Number 6 (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;653-78. (JSTOR, retrieved 13 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; It is often the case that the lower the cost of the school, the more likely a student is to attend.

Developed countries have adopted a dual scheme for education: while basic (i.e. high-school) education is supported by taxes rather than tuition, higher education usually requires tuition payments or fees.

People may purchase [[tuition insurance]] to protect themselves from fees related to involuntary withdrawal (illness, death of a parent or guardian, etc.)

== History ==
[[File:College Tuition State Funding.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Study comparing college revenue per student by tuition and state funding in 2008 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Delta Cost Project, "[http://www.deltacostproject.org/resources/pdf/Trends-in-College-Spending-98-08.pdf Trends in College Spending 1998-2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808055659/http://www.deltacostproject.org/resources/pdf/Trends-in-College-Spending-98-08.pdf |date=2013-08-08 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]], universities were mainly institutions of the [[Catholic Church]]. As they mainly trained clergy, most of these universities did not have any need to exact fees from the students{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} with one notable exception: during the 12th century, while under the supervision of [[Petrus Comestor|Pierre le Mangeur]], the [[University of Paris]] began collecting two [[Sou (coin)|sous]] weekly in tuition. &lt;!--?: Their situation was comparable with the modern [[Corporate university|corporate universities]] and [[Military academy|military academies]].--&gt;

Later, the main duty of universities in most [[Protestant]] countries was the training of future [[civil servant]]s. Again, it was not in the interest of the state to charge tuition fees, as this would have decreased the quality of civil servants. On the other hand, the number of students from the lower classes was usually kept in check by the expenses of living during the years of study, although as early as the mid-19th century there were calls for limiting the university entrance by middle-class persons.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} A typical family, however, could not afford educating a child or young adult, even if the education itself was free. A similar situation exists today in many [[Third World]] countries, where the expenses of "free" schooling (food, books, school uniform, etc.) prevent some children from attending any school.

After [[World War II]] the tuition systems of all of today's advanced democracies still were highly similar: Education institutions in all countries charged no or only very low tuition fees.&lt;ref name="Garritzmann"/&gt; It was not before the 1950s that the countries' education systems developed in different directions. Some countries, especially the Anglo-Saxon countries (for example the United States) but also Asian countries such as Japan, introduced considerable tuition payments already in the early post-war period.&lt;ref name="Garritzmann"/&gt; Other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and continental Europe, in contrast remained tuition-free. These developments were unrelated to the massive educational expansion that took place at the same time.

Since the early 1970s, the average cost of tuition has steadily outpaced the growth of the average American household. This trend continued particularly under President Reagan's higher education policies in the 1980s. Likewise, there has been a steady decrease in [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal funding]] for grants and a rise in the [[interest rate]]s of most major student loans, leaving many students struggling to pay debt for years after graduation.

===College tuition for undocumented students===
The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate.  It would allow the estimated 50,000 to 65,000 [[undocumented students in the United States]] to gain in-state tuition as well as a path towards [[Citizenship in the United States|American citizenship]].  The Act would apply only to those students with tangible proof of residence in the United States before the age of 18.  This Act has stirred debate in numerous groups, including institutions, families, and the Senate itself.

As of March 2013, undocumented students in most States were required to pay the higher out-of-state students' tuition charged at public universities, often between [[United States dollar|$]]20,000 and $35,000 at a local public university.  In addition, these students were denied federal assistance as they lacked valid [[Social Security number]]s.  Because such students often come from comparatively poor families, the costs were too high to allow many undocumented students to seek university education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgs.law.ucla.edu/CLLR/Documents/2003/galassi.pdf|title=Student Organizations|author=|date=|website=orgs.law.ucla.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, allegations of irregularities surfaced against the college, with the chairman of [[Bihar School Examination Board]] being suspected of aiding the college in its "[[Bihar topper scam 2016|topper scam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160603/jsp/frontpage/story_89109.jsp#.V43SG_l97IU|title=Topper cradle home truths At centre of raging controversy, a college like no other}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the students of VR College topped both science and arts streams, but were exposed as cheaters after a video of them failing to answer basic questions went viral. Subsequently, the college was de-recognized and the BSEB chairman was forced to resign.

== Establishment ==

The college was established in 1997-98. Its director and principal is Amit Kumar alias Bachcha Rai, a local political leader. The college is named after his grandfather. The family also runs other colleges, including four [[Higher Secondary Examination#Intermediate_Examination|Intermediate]] colleges and a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] college. Rai is considered close to the [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] (RJD) leader [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]]. During the [[Bihar Legislative Assembly election, 2015|2015 Assembly elections]], he spent one month [[canvassing]] for Yadav's son [[Tej Pratap Yadav|Tej Pratap]]. His father Rajdeo Rai had also unsuccessfully fought a Legislative Council election as an RJD candidate.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_cradle"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160603/jsp/frontpage/story_89109.jsp |title=Topper cradle home truths - At centre of raging controversy, a college like no other |date=3 June 2016 |newspaper=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examination success ==

Soon after its establishment, VR college became famous for its high success rate in [[Higher Secondary Examination|Class XII]] exams. In 2014, 7 out of the Bihar's 10 toppers were from this college.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_cradle"/&gt; In 2015, Bachcha Rai's daughter Shalini was the state topper in the science stream. Because of its "stellar record" the college attracted students from far-off districts.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_cradle"/&gt;

Since 2014, the college faced allegations of irregularities. Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh, the chairman of the [[Bihar School Examination Board]] (BSEB) was suspected of favouring the college.&lt;ref name="ToI_chairman"/&gt; Once a principal of the [[Patna College]], Singh was promoted to BSEB Chairman thanks to the state's chief minister [[Nitish Kumar]]. During 2010-2015, his wife Usha Singh was an [[Member of Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] from [[Hilsa (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Hilsa]], which is located in Nitish Kumar's home district, [[Nalanda district|Nalanda]]; she was a member of Nitish Kumar's political party, the [[Janata Dal (United)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/551649/absconding-ex-bseb-chief-not.html |title=Absconding ex-BSEB chief not new to controversy |author=Abhay Kumar |newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]] |date=11 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singh personally decided that G A Inter College in [[Hajipur]] would be the examination centre for the students of the VR College. He also decided that the Balak High School in [[Patna]] would be the evaluation centre for the answer sheets of the college's students. He personally visited these two places a number of times. When allegations of irregularities surfaced, he formed a judicial committee for investigation, but did not inform the state's education department.&lt;ref name="ToI_chairman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Topper-scam-Bihar-board-chairman-quits-goes-underground/articleshow/52663185.cms |title=Topper scam: Bihar board chairman quits, goes underground |author=Sheezan Nezami |date=9 June 2016 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016 de-recognition ==
{{Main|Bihar topper scam 2016}}
On 28 May 2016, the BSEB publicly declared the intermediate results, however it released its official merit list for 10 May 2016 itself but due to some issues, it made the results public to a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-board-intermediate-arts-ia-results-declared-sharp-dip-in-pass-percentage/story-vYP0qU1EDs1cYXrzCK1MDM.html|title=Bihar board intermediate arts (IA) results declared, check it here}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ToI_Shalinee"/&gt; VR College students emerged as toppers in both arts and science streams in Class XII exams. Ruby Rai topped arts stream with 89% marks, while Saurabh Shresth topped science stream with 97% marks.&lt;ref name="TH_real"/&gt; Rahul Kumar, another science student of VR College, obtained the third highest marks in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/3-boys-notch-up-85-2-to-top-ISc-exam/articleshow/52211218.cms |title=3 boys notch up 85.2% to top ISc exam |author=Vithika Salomi |date=10 May 2016 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, Bachcha Rai's daughter Shalinee Roy had topped the science stream: she had obtained 4 marks more than Saurabh Shresth. However, the corrupt Board officials did not release her name to avoid a controversy: they intended to release her name later, in a clandestine manner.&lt;ref name="ToI_Shalinee"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Topper-scam-Shalinee-Roy-is-Worthy-dads-worthy-daughter/articleshow/52663144.cms |title=Topper scam: Shalinee Roy is ‘Worthy’ dad’s ‘worthy’ daughter |author=Sheezan Nezami |date=9 June 2016 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2014, Shalinee had topped the Class X exams, scoring 97.2% marks. Around 1,323,000 students had appeared for the exams: no other student had scored more than 90% marks.&lt;ref name="ToI_Shalinee"/&gt;

When interviewed by the [[Aaj Tak]] TV channel, Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shresth were unable to answer basic questions. The arts topper Ruby Rai named "prodikal science" (actually [[political science]]) as one of the subjects she had studied. When asked what this subject dealt with, she answered that it was about cooking. She stated that the exam was of 600 marks, while it was actually of only 500 marks. The science topper Saurabh Shresth could not describe the link between water and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (the chemical formula for water). He also wrongly named [[aluminium]] was the most [[reactivity series|reactive element]].&lt;ref name="TH_real"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/are-you-for-real-bihar-asks-its-class-12-toppers/article8678143.ece |title=Are you for real, Bihar asks its Class 12 toppers |date=2 June 2016 |newspaper=The Hindu |author=Amarnath Tewary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the video of their interviews went [[viral video|viral]], the BSEB asked them and other toppers to appear before a team of experts for a test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/education/bihar-intermediate-exam-toppers-bihar-toppers-bihar-rank-holders-2833118/ |title=Bihar: Rank holders appear before experts team after viral video |newspaper=Indian Express |date=3 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saurabh Shresth and Rahul Kumar of VR College failed in this test. Ruby Rai did not appear for the test, citing poor health. The Board subsequently de-recognized VR College, and ordered an inquiry into the irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/two-bihar-board-toppers-flunk-retest-lose-results/story-b7lAYz6UrWK3TwrutbQC9N.html |title=Two Bihar board ‘toppers’ flunk retest, lose results |author=Arun Kumar and Anish |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=5 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachcha Rai's daughter Shalinee, who actually topped the science stream, but whose name was withheld from the official merit list, was not invited for the re-test.&lt;ref name="ToI_Shalinee"/&gt;

On 8 June 2016, the BSEB chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh resigned after being served a show-cause notice by the Bihar state's education department.&lt;ref name="ToI_chairman"/&gt; On 25 June, Ruby Rai appeared before BSEB team for re-evaluation, and failed to answer a single question correctly. She was subsequently arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ruby-rai-bihars-fake-topper-age-18-arrested-1423356?pfrom=home-lateststories |title=Ruby Rai, Bihar's Fake Class 12 Topper, Arrested |publisher=NDTV |date=25 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
