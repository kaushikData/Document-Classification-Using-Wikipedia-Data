The '''Armenian hypothesis''' of the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], proposed by Georgian [[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze]] and Russian linguist [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] in 1985, suggests that [[Proto-Indo-European]] was spoken during the 5th–4th millennia BC in "eastern [[Anatolia]], the southern [[Caucasus]], and northern [[Mesopotamia]]".{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995|p=791}}

Recent DNA-research has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian homeland for a 'pre-proto-Indo-European'.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}{{sfn|Reich|2018|p=177}}{{sfn|Damgaard|2018}}{{sfn|Wang|2018}}{{sfn|Grolle|2018|p=108}} It also lends support to the [[Indo-Hittite]] hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto-Indo-European split-off from a common mother language "no later than the 4th millennium BCE."{{sfn|Kroonen|Barjamovic|Peyrot|2018|p=9}}

==Hypothesis==
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov presented their hypothesis in Russian in 1980–1981 in two articles in ''Vestnik drevnej istorii''. During the following years they expanded and developed their work into their voluminous book, published in Russian in 1984; the English translation of the book appeared in 1995.{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995}} In English a short sketch of the hypothesis first appeared in ''The Early History of Indo-European Languages'', published in ''Scientific America'' in 1990.{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1990}}{{sfn|Drews|1994|p=33ff}} [[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze|Tamas Gamkrelidze]] published an update to the hypothesis in 2010.{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|2010|}}

According to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, the [[Indo-European languages]] derive from a language originally spoken in the wide area of eastern [[Anatolia]], the southern [[Caucasus]], and northern [[Mesopotamia]]. The [[Anatolian languages]], including [[Hittite language|Hittite]], split-off before 4000 BCE, and migrated into Anatolia at around 2000 BCE. Around 4000 BCE, the proto-Indo-European community split into [[Graeco-Armeno-Aryan|Greek-Armenian-Indo-Iranians]], Celto-Italo-Tocharians, and Balto-Slavo-Germanics. At around 3000–2500 BCE, Greek moved to the west, while the Indo-Aryans, the Celto-Italo-Tocharians and the Balto-Slavo-Germanics moved east, and then northwards along the eastern slope of the Caspian Sea. The Tocharians split from the Italo-Celtics before 2000 BCE and moved further east, while the Italo-Celtics and the Balto-Slavo-Germanics turned west again towards the northern slopes of the Black Sea. From there, they expanded further into Europe between around 2000 and 1000 BCE.{{sfn|Drews|1994|p=33ff}}{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995}}

The phonological peculiarities of the consonants proposed in the [[glottalic theory]] would be best preserved in Armenian and the [[Germanic languages]]. [[Proto-Greek]] would be practically equivalent to [[Mycenaean Greek]] from the 17th century BC and closely associate [[history of Greece|Greek migration]] to [[Greece]] with the [[Indo-Aryan migration]] to [[India]] at about the same time (the [[Indo-European expansion]] at the transition to the [[Late Bronze Age]], including the possibility of Indo-European [[Kassites]]).

The hypothesis argues for the latest possible date of Proto-Indo-European (without Anatolian), roughly a millennium later than the mainstream Kurgan hypothesis. In this respect, it represents an opposite to the [[Anatolian hypothesis]] in spite of the geographical proximity of the respective suggested ''Urheimaten'' by diverging from the timeframe suggested there by approximately 3000 years.

==Reception==

===Criticism===
[[Robert Drews]] says that "most of the chronological and historical arguments seem fragile at best, and of those that I am able to judge, some are evidently wrong". However, he argues that it is far more powerful as a linguistic model, providing insights into the relationship between the Indo-European and the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Kartvelian languages]].{{sfn|Drews|1994|p=33ff}}

J. Grepin wrote in a review in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' the model of linguistic relationships is "the most complex, far reaching and fully supported of this century".&lt;ref&gt;J. Grepin, ''Times Literary Supplement'', March 14, 1986, p.278.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewed interest===
Recent DNA-research has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian homeland for a 'proto-proto-Indo-European'.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}{{sfn|Reich|2018|p=177}}{{sfn|Damgaard|2018}}{{sfn|Wang|2018}}{{sfn|Grolle|2018|p=108}} It also lends support to the [[Indo-Hittite]] hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto-Indo-European split-off from a common mother language "no later than the 4th millennium BCE."{{sfn|Kroonen|Barjamovic|Peyrot|2018|p=9}}

Haak et al. (2015) states that "the Armenian plateau hypothesis gains in plausibility" since the [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya]] partly descended from a Near Eastern population, which resembles present-day [[Armenians]]. Yet, they also state that "the question of what languages were spoken by the 'Eastern European hunter-gatherers' and the southern, Armenian-like, ancestral population remains open."{{sfn|Haak|2015}}

[[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], in his 2018 publication ''[[Who We Are and How We Got Here]]'', states that  "the most likely location of the population that first spoke an Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus Mountains, perhaps in present-day Iran or Armenia, because ancient DNA from people who lived there matches what we would expect for a source population both for the Yamnaya and for ancient Anatolians."{{sfn|Reich|2018|p=177}} Nevertheless, Reich also states that some, if not most, of the Indo-European languages were spread by the Yamnaya people.&lt;ref&gt;Indo-European.eu, [https://indo-european.eu/2018/03/proto-indo-european-homeland-south-of-the-caucasus/ ''Proto-Indo-European homeland south of the Caucasus?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kroonen et al. (2018), Damgaard et al. (2018) "show no indication of a large-scale intrusion of a steppe population."{{sfn|Kroonen|Barjamovic|Peyrot|2018|p=7}} They further note that the earliest attestation of Anatolian names, in the [[Armi (Syria)|Armi]] state, must be dated to 3000-2400 BCE, contemporaneous with the Yamnaya culture, concluding that "a scenario in which the Anatolian Indo-European language was linguistically derived from Indo-European speakers originating in this culture can be rejected."{{sfn|Kroonen|Barjamovic|Peyrot|2018|p=9}} They further note that this lends support to the [[Indo-Hittite]] hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto-Indo-European split-off from a common mother language "no later than the 4th millennium BCE."{{sfn|Kroonen|Barjamovic|Peyrot|2018|p=9}}

Wang et al. (2018) note that the Caucasus served as a corridor for gene flow between the steppe and cultures south of the Caucasus during the Eneolithic and the Bronze Age, stating that this "opens up the possibility of a homeland of PIE south of the Caucasus."{{sfn|Wang|2018|p=15}}

[[Kristian Kristiansen (archaeologist)|Kristian Kristiansen]], in an interview with ''Der Spiegel'' in may 2018, stated that the Yamnaya culture may have had a predecessor at the Caucasus, where "proto-proto-Indo-European" was spoken.{{sfn|Grolle|2018|p=108}}

'''Ashok Ramchandra Kelkar''' (1929–2014) was a linguist and critical [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], India. He was honoured with the [[Padma Shri]] in 2002 and [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Marathi|Sahitya Akademi Award for Marathi]] in 2008.

==Biography==
Kelkar was born on 22 April 1929 in Pune. He did his schooling from New English School and then from Ferguson College. As he was fond of grammar and had interest in linguistic puzzles, he graduated from Ferguson in English and Philosophy. He received a master's degree in English and French literature from [[Pune University]].&lt;ref name=Bhaskar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MAR-AUR-internationally-known-analyst-dr-4751351-NOR.html |title= आंतरराष्ट्रीय ख्यातीप्राप्त भाषाशास्त्राचे ज्येष्ठ अभ्यासक डॉ. अशोक केळकर यांचे निधन |language=Marathi |publisher=''[[Divya Bhaskar|Bhaskar]]'' |date=20 September 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied Linguistics (1956–58) from Rockfeller and Comparative Literature and Review from Lily Institute in 1958 and received scholarships there.
In the period of 1958–62, he served the [[Agra University]] teaching Linguistics. During 1962–67, he served as a reader at [[Pune University]], and during the next 22 years, he served as professor of Linguistics and later as director of the Centre of Advanced Studies and Linguistics at Deccan College in Pune. He also had a PhD in Linguistics and Anthropology from [[Cornell University]] in the USA. He used to guide the students of linguistics completing their M.Phil. and PhD&lt;ref name=Loksatta&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loksatta.com/maharashtra-news/international-language-expert-dr-ashok-kelkar-passes-away-937856/ |title= आंतरराष्ट्रीय भाषातज्ज्ञ डॉ. अशोक केळकर यांचे निधन |language=Marathi |publisher=''[[Loksatta]]'' |date=20 September 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took retirement from academics in 1989.&lt;ref name=Bhaskar/&gt;

Kelkar founded the Marathi Abhyas Parishad and served as its director. There he started the trimonthly ''Bhasha Ani Jeewan (भाषा आणि जीवन'') in 1982 and served as its editor until 1989.&lt;ref name=Bhaskar/&gt;

Kelkar was honoured with the [[Padma Shri]] from the Indian government in 2002 for his literary accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/01/26/stories/2002012605090500.htm|title=2002 Padma awards|date=26 January 2002|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he received the [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Marathi|Sahitya Akademi Award for Marathi]] for his book ''Rujuvaat (रूजुवात)''. His book ''Prachin Bhartiya Sahitya Mimansa – Ek Aakalan (प्राचिन भारतीय साहित्य मीमांसा – एक आकलन'') was translated into Hindi and won a national award.&lt;ref name=Bhaskar/&gt;

Kelkar had a son and a daughter. He died on 20 September 2014 at Aurangabad where he lived with his daughter Roshan Ranade since two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.esakal.com/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=5661460768886580290&amp;SectionId=14&amp;SectionName=%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A0%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%BE&amp;NewsDate=20140921&amp;Provider=-&amp;NewsTitle=%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9E%20%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89.%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B3%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%20%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%A8 |title= आंतरराष्ट्रीय भाषातज्ज्ञ डॉ. केळकर यांचे निधन |language=Marathi |publisher=''[[Sakal]]'' |date=21 September 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australia-Asia Debate''', sometimes referred to as "Australasian Debating" or "Australs Style", is a form of academic [[debate]]. In the past few years, this style of debating has increased in usage dramatically throughout both [[Australia]] and the [[Asia]]n region, but in the case of the [[Philippines]], the format is also used alongside the British Parliamentary Format. The context in which the Australia-Asia style of debate is used varies, but it is commonly used in Australia at the primary and secondary school level, ranging from small informal one-off intra-school debates to larger more formal inter-school competitions with several rounds and a finals series which occur over a year. It is also commonly used at university level.

==Content==
Australia-Asia style debates consist of two teams who debate over an issue, more commonly called a topic or proposition. The issue, by convention, is presented in the form of an affirmative statement beginning with "That", for example, "That cats are better than dogs," or "This House," for example "This House would establish a world government." The subject of topics can vary from region to region.

The two teams in Australia–Asia debating are called the "Affirmative" or "Proposition" or "Government" and the "Negative" or "Opposition". The affirmative team agrees with the topic and presents arguments to demonstrate the truth of the topic. The negative team disagrees with the topic and presents arguments to disprove the truth of the topic. Each team must convince the adjudicator(s) (judge(s)) that their side of the topic is correct and that their opposition's is incorrect. Depending on the context in which a debate is being presented it may be appropriate for the audience to decide the winner of the debate. However, in formal debating the adjudicator is responsible for deciding the winner of the debate.

==Speeches==
Each team comprises three members, each of whom is named according to their team and speaking position within his or her team. For instance, the second speaker of the affirmative team to speak is called the "second affirmative speaker" (or "second proposition speaker"). Alternatively, the affirmative speakers may be referred to as "Prime Minister", "Deputy Prime Minister", and "Government Whip", while the negative speakers may be referred to as "Opposition Leader", "Deputy Opposition Leader", and "Opposition Whip". However, these names are not commonly used. Each of the six speakers (three affirmative and three negative) speak in succession, beginning with the first affirmative speaker. The speaking order is therefore as follows: first affirmative, first negative, second affirmative, second negative, third affirmative, and finally third negative.

Each speaker has a set speaking time according to the rules agreed to by both teams. In formal debate contexts, such as school debating competitions in Australia, the speaking time is proportional to the school Year Level division that a team is competing in. For example, Year 6 debaters may have a speaking time of ~3 minutes, while Year 11 and 12 debaters may have a speaking time of ~8–10 minutes. There is no universally adopted speaking time.

The adjudicator will usually ring a bell one or two minutes before the speaker's time expires as a first warning (such as at 6 minutes in an eight-minute speech). A second warning is then given at the end of the allotted time, signalling that the debater ought to conclude as soon as possible (in many Australian schools, failure to conclude at this point will cause the speaker to lose points). Sometimes the second warning will be a double bell so as to distinguish between the first and second warnings. Some competition rules specify that a speaker must complete his or her speech within 30 seconds either side of the final bell, the warning bell acting only as a warning and not as an indicator that a speaker must stop speaking.

Short interjections which can be questions, comments, or statements are called Points of Information. They are allowed between the first minute and the sixth minute of the speech, but the points of information are not allowed during the reply speech. When a team is delivering speech, the other team can do the point of information by standing up and exclaiming a short interjection. The speaker can decide to accept or reject it. If it is accepted, the point of information can be said. Otherwise, the person making the points of information must sit down.

Under some rules, a 'reply speech' will be able to be made by one of the speakers after all speakers have spoken. The negative team will usually be allowed to make their reply speech first. Often, only the first or second speaker of a team is allowed to make the reply speech. Points for the reply speeches are worth only half of points scored in the substantive speeches.

=== Order of delivering speech ===

1. Prime Minister
2. Leader of Opposition
3. Deputy Prime Minister
4. Deputy Leader of Opposition
5.Government Whip
6. Opposition Whip
7. Opposition Reply
8. Government Reply

==Speakers' roles==
First speakers should first give a brief introduction, contextualising the debate, and perhaps exploring the basic philosophical questions raised by the topic. Ordinarily, the first affirmative speaker would then explain the affirmative team's 'model', or 'mechanism'. It is not enough for a team simply to argue that we should implement some policy. The team must also explain to us how the policy is going to be implemented. That explanation is the 'model'. The first negative speaker can also use a 'model', often called a 'counter-model', but would only do so in particular circumstances. The first negative speaker should always make some points in rebuttal at this stage of the speech. However, such rebuttal should be kept short. 
The first speaker, whether affirmative or negative, should then outline the 'team split', that is, what each of the team's speakers will be discussing. This is very important, as it helps to guide the adjudicator. The first speaker should then proceed to make substantive arguments in favour of his or her position.

The second speaker's role is both to refute the main arguments of the opposing first speaker, and to further advance his or her own team's case. New arguments ought to be introduced by the second speaker. The second speaker should spend about half of the speech rebutting the opposing team, and half advancing their own case.

The third speaker's role is to refute the opposing team's case, and to conclude and summarise his or her own team's case. The third speaker cannot make 'new' arguments in favour of his or her position. The goal of the third speaker should not be simply to pick out technical and practical flaws in the opposing team's case, but to undermine the deepest, most basic philosophical premises of the opposing team's argument. 

Reply speakers should speak as if they are adjudicators passing judgment on the debate, although of course always looking favourably on their own side.

==Scoring==
In formal debating contexts speakers are scored according to three categories: Matter, Manner and Method. Matter is the category that assesses the content of a speaker's speech which includes the arguments and evidence that they present to support his/her team's side of the topic. Manner is the category that assesses the way in which a speaker presents his/her material and usually includes factors such as eye contact, gesturing and voice projection. Method is category that assesses the way in which a speaker structures his/her speech and includes factors such as dynamics (the way that a speaker responds to their opposition's strategy) and rebuttal. The specific assessment criteria of Matter, Manner and Method depends on the rules under which the debate is conducted. The score ranges that are used to score Matter, Manner and Method, again vary. Generally speaking the entire speech is scored out of a total of 100 points, with 40 points allocated to Matter and Manner respectively and 20 points allocated to Method. To allow consistency in scoring some programs have adopted another system derived from the 100 point system. This other system reduces the range of scores. Both Matter and Manner are reduced from 40 points to 32 points, with a minimum score of 28 points respectively. Method is reduced from 20 points to 16 points, with a minimum of 14 points. Thus the score range is 70 points to 80 points with an average of 75 points. Since there are three speakers on each team the team's score can range from 210 points to 240 points with an average of 225 points. The team that is victorious in a debate has a higher team score than their opposition. On the rare occasion that a team is not prepared for a debate or unable to attend the other team is automatically given maximum points.

In the event that there are several rounds, teams generally are given a preparation time ranging from several weeks to half an hour. Debates where teams have less than a day to prepare are called Short Preparation or Impromptu debates. In these particular formats teams are usually restricted in the material that they have access to. In the event of restricted materials the speaking times may be shortened. Short Preparation debates are used in some programs as several debates are held on the same day, while others where rounds are held on different days over a longer period of time have Short Preparation debates in one or more of the rounds to complement the prepared debates. Some programs call the day on which several debating rounds are held "Gala Day".

==Variations==
There are a number of variations to the Australia–Asia style of debating. One variation is that there are four members on each team, the fourth member acting as an adviser to the other three. Another variation is that one of the three speakers in each team speaks an additional time after the Third Negative speaker. This is known as the Reply-Speaker format of debate. The order in which the additional speakers speak is dependent on the specific rules that the Affirmative and Negative Teams have agreed to debate under. Another variation used by The [[Australasian Intervarsity Debating Association]] is the Affirmative Action requirement, whereby the top three teams from each university must have at least three female members and one third of the entire contingent must be female.

Another variation used at university level debates is the 'secret topic' debate, where debate topics and sides are allocated only an hour before the debate. This format is primarily used at a university level, and is used by SAAUCC for intercollege debates. It is, however, also used in some high school-level debates, such as in the [[New South Wales]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070829140240/http://www.premiers.nsw.gov.au/ThePremierAndGovernment/FromThePremier/PremiersDebatingChallenge.htm Premier's Debating Challenge], the [http://www.isdadebating.com/ Sydney ISDA Competition] (Independent School's Debating Association), the Western Australian Debating League senior debates, the Debating Association of Victoria, and the [[Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales|GPS debating association]].

[[Image:BelgieGemeenschappenkaart.svg|thumb|right|Linguistic map of Belgium. Officially [[Francophone]] areas in red.]]

'''Belgian French''' ({{lang-fr|français de Belgique}}) is the variety of French spoken mainly among the [[French Community of Belgium]], alongside related [[Langues d'oïl|Oïl languages]] of the region such as [[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Champenois]] and [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] (Gaumais). The French language spoken in Belgium differs very little from that of [[France]] or [[Switzerland]]. It is characterized by the use of some terms that are considered archaic in France, as well as loanwords from languages such as Walloon, Picard and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Lebouc]], ''Dictionnaire de belgicismes'', Lannoo Uitgeverij, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

French is one of the three official languages of Belgium alongside Dutch and [[German language|German]]. It is spoken natively by around 39% of the population, primarily in the southern region of [[Wallonia]] and the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]].

==Influences==
While a number of [[Langues d'oïl|oïl languages]] have traditionally been spoken in different areas of Wallonia, French emerged as the regional language of literature in the 13th century. This was a result of heavy French cultural influence on the region over the past few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Félix Rousseau, ''Wallonie, terre Romane'', Ed. Jules Destrée, 1967, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of local languages influenced French in Wallonia, with words from [[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Champenois]] and [[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] making their way into the local variant. Until the 20th century, Walloon was the majority language of Wallonia, and most speakers were bilingual in both French and Walloon.&lt;ref&gt;Francard, pp.9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the French spoken in Wallonia was influenced by local languages, the variant spoken in Brussels was influenced by Dutch, specifically the local [[Brabantian dialect]]. The city, geographically in the [[Flanders|Flanders region]], originally spoke only Dutch. However, a gradual [[Francisation of Brussels|Francisation]] began in the 19th century and intensified the end of the century and continued throughout 20th century. Today, many Dutch expressions have been translated into French and are used in the language in the Brussels area.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
There are a few consistent phonological differences between the French in France and Belgium but usually no more than the differences between regional dialects within France (or the ones that exist between in the English of Toronto and Vancouver, for instance), which might even be nonexistent. Regional accents however, can vary from city to city (the [[Liège (city)|Liège]] accent being an example). However, on the whole, accents may vary more according to one's social class and education.

While stronger accents have been more typical of working-class people, they have become much less pronounced since [[World War I]] and the widespread use of television, which have helped to standardise accents and the types of words used by speakers. Francophones are taught the pronunciation of Standard French in schools. The following differences vary by speakers, according level of education, age and native region:
*The lack of {{IPA|/ɥ/}}. The combination {{IPA|/ɥi/}} is replaced by {{IPA|/wi/}}, and in other cases, {{IPA|/ɥ/}} becomes a full vowel {{IPA|/y/}}. Thus, ''enfuir'' (to run away) and ''enfouir'' (to bury) are pronounced the same, unlike in France and Quebec.
*The nasal vowels are pronounced like in France. {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}} → {{IPA|[ɒ̃]}}, {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} → {{IPA|[æ̃]}}, {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} → {{IPA|[õ]}}. The distinction between the nasal vowels {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}} has been retained in Belgium, but in many regions of France such as Paris, the two have merged. For example, in Belgium, ''brin'' (stalk) and ''brun'' (brown) are still pronounced differently, like in Quebec but unlike in Paris.
*The distinction between the vowels {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛː/}} has been retained in Belgium, but they have merged in France. For example, ''mettre'' (put) and ''maître'' (master) are still pronounced differently, unlike in France.
*The distinction between the vowels {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} has been maintained in final open syllables. For example, ''peau'' (skin) and ''pot'' (jar) are still pronounced differently, unlike in France and Quebec.
*There is a stronger distinction between long and short vowels in Belgium:
** Long vowels are allowed in closed syllables in Belgium, even at the end of a word: {{angbr|ée}}, {{angbr|aie}} {{IPA|[eː]#}}, {{angbr|ue}} {{IPA|[yː]#}}, {{angbr|ie}} {{IPA|[iː]#}}, {{angbr|oue}} {{IPA|[uː]#}} and {{angbr|eue}} {{IPA|[øː]#}}. As a result, almost all feminine adjectives are still phonetically distinct from their masculine counterparts in Belgium, unlike in France and Quebec.
** The marginal phoneme {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is usually pronounced as a lengthened version of {{IPA|/a/}}: {{IPA|[aː]}}.
*The letter "w" is almost always pronounced as {{IPA|/w/}}, like in English, which also approximates the Flemish "w". In France, it is often pronounced {{IPA|/v/}}, as in German. For example, the word ''wagon'' (train car) is pronounced {{IPA|/vaɡɔ̃/}} in France but {{IPA|/waɡɔ̃/}} in Belgium.
*Some speakers devoice final stops; then, ''d'' is pronounced like ''t'', ''b'' is pronounced like ''p'' and ''g'' is pronounced like ''k''. That, when it is combined with the dropping of consonants in final consonant clusters, causes pronunciations like {{IPA|[ɡʁɒ̃ːt]}} for {{IPA|[ɡʁɒ̃ːd]}} ("grande"), {{IPA|[taːp]}} for {{IPA|/tabl/}} ("table") and [tik] for {{IPA|[tigʁ]}}.
*Sometimes, the "r" after a ''d'', a ''b'', or a ''g'' isn't pronounced. Like in [arb] for {{IPA|[arbʁ]}} ("arbre") and [cat] for {{IPA|[cadʁ]}} ("cadre").

Certain accents, such as in certain cities (notably Brussels and Liège) and those of speakers who are older and particularly less educated, are farther from the pronunciation of France. For example, in the dialect in and around Liège, particularly for older speakers, the letter "h" is pronounced in certain positions. It is always silent, however, in Standard French. That dialect is known also for its slow, slightly singing [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], a trait that is even stronger toward the east, in the [[Verviers]] area.

==Vocabulary==
Words unique to Belgian French are called "[[Belgicism]]s" (French: ''belgicismes''). Incidentally, that term is also used to refer to Dutch words used in Belgium but not in the Netherlands. In general, the francophone upper-middle class and educated speakers understand the meaning and use of words in Standard French, and they may also use Standard French if they speak with non-Belgians who speak in Standard French, as their accent hints. Overall, the lexical differences between Standard French and Belgian French are minor. They could be compared to the differences that might exist between two well-educated speakers of American English living in different parts of the United States or those between a well-educated Canadian English speaker and a well-educated British English speaker.

Furthermore, the same speakers would often be well aware of the differences and might even be able to "standardise" their language or use each other's words to avoid confusion. Even so, there are too many forms to try to form any complete list in this article. However, some of the better-known usages include the following:
*The use of ''septante'' for "seventy" and ''nonante'' for "ninety", in contrast to Standard French ''soixante-dix'' (literally "sixty-ten") and ''quatre-vingt-dix'' ("four-twenty-ten"). Those former words occur also in [[Swiss French]]. Unlike the Swiss, however, Belgians never use ''huitante'' for ''quatre-vingts'' ("four twenties"), with the use of ''octante'' in the local [[Brussels]] dialect as being the only exception. Although they are considered Belgian and Swiss words, ''septante'' and ''nonante'' were common in France until around the 16th century, when the newer forms began to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The words for meals vary, as described in the table below. The usage in Belgian, Swiss and Canadian French accords with the etymology: ''déjeuner'' comes from a verb meaning "to break the fast". In France, however, breakfast is rendered by ''petit déjeuner''. ''Souper'' is used in France to refer instead to a meal taken around midnight, after the opera, the theatre or a similar event at night.

*Many Walloon words and expressions have crept into Belgian French, especially in the eastern regions of Wallonia:
**''Qu'à torate'' (similar to ''à bientôt'', "see you soon")
**''pèkèt'' ("[[jenever]]")
**''barakî'' (similar to the word ''[[chav]]'' in British English).
**Qué novel ? (similar to ''quoi de neuf ?, "what's up ?")''
*Germanic influences are also visible:
**''Crolle'' ("curl") reflects the Brabantic pronunciation of the Dutch word ''krul''.
**''S'il vous plaît'' is used to mean "here" (when someone is handed something) as well as "please", but in France, the meaning is limited to "please", "voilà" is used for "here". That is comparable to the use of ''alstublieft'' in Dutch.
**''Sur'' (from Dutch ''zuur'') means "sour", but in France, the word ''acide'' is used.
**''Dringuelle'' (Standard French "pourboire"), "tip", from the Dutch word ''drinkgeld'', but it is less commonly used in Brussels.
**''Kot'' (student room in a dormitory) from Belgian Dutch "kot".
**''Ring'' (ring road) from Dutch "ring". In Standard French, the term is "ceinture périphérique" ou "périph'".
**''Savoir'' (to know) is often used in the place of ''pouvoir'' (to be able [to]). It was quite common, however, in older forms of French.
**''Blinquer'' (to shine), instead of ''briller'', has a Germanic origin and passed through Walloon.
**''Bourgmestre'' (mayor), instead of ''maire''.

==Grammar==
Belgian French grammar is usually the same as that of Standard French, but Germanic influences can be seen in the following differences:
*''Ça me goûte'', Standard French "ça me plaît", "I like it" (only for food), is a [[calque]] of Dutch ''Dat smaakt'': Spanish 'me gusta'.
*''Tu viens avec ?'', Standard French "Tu m'accompagnes?", literally "Are you coming with?" (meaning "Are you coming with me?"), is a [[calque]] of Dutch ''Kom je mee?''.
*''Ça tire ici'' (used mostly in Brussels), for Standard French "Il y a un courant d'air") "There is a draught" is a [[calque]] of the Belgian Dutch ''Het trekt hier'' (Netherlands Dutch ''Het tocht hier'').
*Phrases like ''pour + V'' : "Passe-moi un bic pour écrire" (Standard French "Donne-moi un stylo afin que je puisse écrire") "Give me a pen, so that I can write / for me to write" is a grammatical structure found in Dutch ("om te +V").
*"''Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça pour'' un animal ?" Standard French "Qu'est-ce que c'est comme animal ?" / "Quelle sorte d'animal c'est ?", "What kind of animal is this?" (literally, "What is that for an animal?"), Dutch "Wat is dat voor (een) dier?" or "Wat voor dier is dat?"
*The use of ''une fois'' ("once") in mid-sentence, especially in Brussels, is a direct translation of Dutch "eens". French people who want to imitate the Belgian accent often use a lot of "une fois" at the end of the sentences, often wrongly: "Viens une fois ici, literally from the Dutch "Kom eens hier" ("Come once here"). "Une fois" cannot really be translated to other languages; its function is to soften the meaning of the sentence. The English equivalent would be "Could you come here?" or "Why don't you come here?"
*''Jouer poker'' ("Standard French "Jouer au poker") "Play poker" is influenced by the Dutch ''Poker spelen''.

'''Botho Strauß''' (born 2 December 1944) is a German [[playwright]], [[novelist]] and [[essayist]].&lt;ref name="Adelson1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelson|first=Leslie A.|title=Crisis of subjectivity: Botho Strauss's challenge to West German prose of the 1970s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4z0U3NQEV0C&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=25 April 2011|year=1984|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-6203-906-7|pages=240ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Botho Strauß's father was a chemist. After finishing his secondary education, Strauß studied German, History of the Theatre and Sociology in Cologne and Munich, but never finished his dissertation on ''[[Thomas Mann]] und das Theater''. During his studies, he worked as an extra at the [[Munich Kammerspiele]]. From 1967 to 1970, he was a critic and editorial journalist for the journal ''[[:de:Theater heute|Theater heute]]'' (''Theater Today''). Between 1970 and 1975, he worked as a [[Dramaturge|dramaturgical]] assistant to [[Peter Stein]] at the West Berlin [[:de:Schaubühne am Halleschen Ufer|Schaubühne am Halleschen Ufer]]. After his first attempt as a writer, a [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] adaptation for the screen, he decided to live and work as a writer. Strauß had his first breakthrough as a dramatist with the 1977 ''Trilogie des Wiedersehens'', five years after the publication of his first work. In 1984 he published his important work ''[[The Young Man|Der Junge Mann]]'' (''The Young Man'', translated by Roslyn Theobald in 1995).

With a 1993 ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' essay, "Anschwellender Bocksgesang" ("Swelling He-Goat Song"&lt;ref group=N&gt;"He-goat song" is the translation of the Greek "[[Wikt:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]" ("[[tragedy]]")&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13681004.html|title=Anschwellender Bocksgesang|first=Botho|last=Strauss|work=''[[Der Spiegel]]|date=8 February 1993|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; a critical examination of modern civilisation, he triggered a major political controversy as his conservative politics was anathema to many.

In his theoretical work, Strauß showed the influence of the ancient classics, [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] as well as [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]], but his outlook was also radically anti-[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]].

His work as a writer has been recognized with numerous international awards and his dramas are among the most performed in German-language theatres.

Strauß presently lives in [[Berlin]] as well as in the nearby [[Uckermark]] region. In 2017, he switched from his long-time publisher [[Carl Hanser Verlag]] to [[Rowohlt Verlag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=26 January 2017|url=https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-autor_verlaesst_hanser_verlag.1282638.html|title=Botho Strauß künftig bei Rowohlt|language=German|work=Boersenblatt.net|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7968">In [[formal language theory]], the '''Chomsky&amp;ndash;Schützenberger enumeration theorem''' is a theorem derived by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]] about the number of words of a given length generated by an [[ambiguous grammar|unambiguous context-free grammar]]. The theorem provides an unexpected link between the theory of [[formal languages]] and [[abstract algebra]].

==Statement==
In order to state the theorem, a few notions from algebra and formal language theory are needed. 

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of nonnegative integers. A ''power series'' over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[infinite series]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;f = f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k = a_0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
with coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The ''multiplication'' of two formal [[power series]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is defined in the expected way as the [[convolution]] of the sequences &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\cdot g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}\right) x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, we write &lt;math&gt;f^2 = f(x)\cdot f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^3 = f(x)\cdot f(x)\cdot f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. In analogy to [[algebraic numbers]], a power series &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called ''algebraic'' over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, if there exists a finite set of polynomials &lt;math&gt;p_0(x), p_1(x), p_2(x), \ldots , p_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; each with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients such that

:&lt;math&gt;p_0(x) + p_1(x) \cdot f + p_2(x)\cdot f^2 + \cdots + p_n(x)\cdot f^n = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

A context-free grammar is said to be ''unambiguous'' if every [[string (computer science)|string]] generated by the grammar admits a unique parse tree 
or, equivalently, only one [[leftmost derivation]].
Having established the necessary notions, the theorem is stated as follows. 

:'''Chomsky&amp;ndash;Schützenberger theorem'''. If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-free language]] admitting an unambiguous context-free grammar, and &lt;math&gt;a_k := | L \ \cap \Sigma^k |&lt;/math&gt; is the number of words of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G(x)=\sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_k x^k&lt;/math&gt; is a power series over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; that is algebraic over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Asymptotic estimates===

The theorem can be used in [[analytic combinatorics]] to estimate the number of words of length ''n'' generated by a given unambiguous context-free grammar, as ''n'' grows large. The following example is given by {{harvtxt|Gruber|Lee|Shallit|2012}}: the unambiguous context-free grammar ''G'' over the alphabet {0,1} has start symbol ''S'' and the following rules

:''S'' → ''M'' | ''U''
:''M'' → 0''M''1''M'' | ''ε''
:''U'' → 0''S'' | 0''M''1''U''.

To obtain an algebraic representation of the power series {{tmath|G(x)}} associated with a given context-free grammar ''G'', one transforms the grammar into a system of equations. This is achieved by replacing each occurrence of a terminal symbol by ''x'', each occurrence of ''ε'' by the integer '1', each occurrence of '→' by '=', and each occurrence of '|' by '+', respectively. The operation of concatenation at the right-hand-side of each rule corresponds to the multiplication operation in the equations thus obtained. This yields the following system of equations:

:''S'' = ''M'' + ''U''
:''M'' = ''M''²''x''² + 1
:''U'' = ''Sx'' + ''MUx''²

In this system of equations, ''S'', ''M'', and ''U'' are functions of ''x'', so one could also write {{tmath|S(x)}}, {{tmath|M(x)}}, and {{tmath|U(x)}}. The equation system can be resolved after ''S'', resulting in a single algebraic equation:

:{{tmath|1=x(2x-1)S^2 + (2x-1)S +1 = 0}}.

This quadratic equation has two solutions for ''S'', one of which is the algebraic power series {{tmath|G(x)}}. By applying methods from complex analysis to this equation, the number &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; of words of length ''n'' generated by ''G'' can be estimated, as ''n'' grows large. In this case, one obtains
&lt;math&gt;a_n \in O(2+\epsilon)^n&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a_n \notin O(2-\epsilon)^n&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. See {{harv|Gruber|Lee|Shallit|2012}} for a detailed exposition.

===Inherent ambiguity===

In classical formal language theory, the theorem can be used to prove that certain context-free languages are [[Ambiguous_grammar#Inherently_ambiguous_languages|inherently ambiguous]].
For example, the  ''Goldstine language'' &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt; over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the words
&lt;math&gt;a^{n_1}ba^{n_2}b\cdots a^{n_p}b&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;p\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1,2,\ldots,p\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_j \neq j&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;j \in \{1,2,\ldots,p\}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is comparably easy to show that the language &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt; is context-free {{harv|Berstel|Boasson|1990}}. The harder part is to show that there does not exist an unambiguous grammar that generates &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt;. This can be proved as follows:
If &lt;math&gt;g_k&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of words of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt;, then for the associated power series holds
&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k x^k = \frac{1-x}{1-2x}- \frac1x \sum_{k \ge 1} x^{k(k+1)/2-1} &lt;/math&gt;.
Using methods from [[complex analysis]], one can prove that this function is not algebraic over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. By the Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem, one can conclude that &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt; does not admit an unambiguous context-free grammar. See {{harv|Berstel|Boasson|1990}} for detailed account.

In [[graphic design]] and [[advertising]], a '''comprehensive layout''' or '''comprehensive,''' usually shortened to '''comp''', is the [[page layout]] of a proposed design as initially presented by the designer to a client, showing the relative positions of [[typography|text]] and [[illustration]]s before the final content of those elements has been decided upon. The comp thus serves as a draft of the final layout, and (if approved) is used as guide for further design changes and, ultimately, production.

Traditionally, the four stages of an illustration or other commercial art creation (e.g., advertisement) are:
* Sketch&amp;nbsp;— the initial idea roughly "sketched out" in order to quickly transfer the idea on to a physical substrate
* Layout&amp;nbsp;— the idea laid out in relative position for further development
* Comp&amp;nbsp;— the idea created in such a way as to closely mimic the final creation, usually as a step toward approval by decision-makers
* Finish&amp;nbsp;— the idea rendered in the appropriate medium for sale, display, or reproduction

For traditional media (such as paint), the division between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for [[computer-generated art]]. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) to see how it would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.

With computer-generated art, the distinction between layout and comp has become blurred. Since computer-generated art can evolve as one file over time, finely segmented milestones in the development process have less meaning. With computer-generated art, even the sketch stage is often skipped. This has led to a two-stage process; comp and finish. The definitions of each milestone are roughly the same as with traditional media.  Even in the age of rapid desktop publishing software, comps may be developed using hand-rendering techniques and materials to avoid investing too much time on the computer before client approval of the idea, depending on the complexity of the production task. If there is any three-dimensionality to the design (for example, the design is of a box or of a two sided piece) a "physical comp" is preferred to a computerized sketch because fundamental physical relationships (for example, position and show-through of die-cuts, or inadvertently designing Möbius strips) can be missed in a two-dimensional sketch. A hand-rendered comp may be useful in helping the client refrain from "[[Nitpicking (pastime)|nitpicking]]" the production quality and focus on the design idea.

In the overall creation process there is also a distinction between finish render and final render. Finish rendering refers to the process, and final rendering refers to the schedule. The first finish rendering may not be the final rendering; the first finish rendering could be the first of many renderings, with each subsequent finish rendering needing refinement before the final version is created.

The illustration element may incorporate [[stock photography]], [[clip art]], or other found material that gives an idea of what should be visually communicated, before entering any negotiations concerning the rights to use a specific image for the purpose. Picture agencies may encourage such use free of charge, in the hope that the comp image (sometimes referred to as a "positional" image) will end up being used in the final product. For this reason, it is sometimes mistakenly believed that "comp" is short for "complimentary," as it is in some other promotional contexts.

The word "comp" can also be used as a verb. For example, an artist may "comp something up"; that is, they will create a comp.  "Comp" may also stand for "composition" or "composite layout".

[[Image:PrinterDots.jpg|right|frame|A close-up of the dots produced by an [[inkjet printer]] at draft quality. Actual size is approximately 0.25 inch by 0.25 inch (0.403 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Individual colored droplets of ink are visible; this sample is about 150 DPI.]]
'''Dots per inch''' ('''DPI''', or '''dpi''')&lt;ref name="dpi"&gt;The acronym appears in sources as either "DPI" or lowercase "dpi". See: [http://www.office.xerox.com/latest/XOGFS-17 &lt;!-- --&gt; "Print Resolution Understanding 4-bit depth – Xerox"] (PDF). Xerox.com. September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of spatial [[printing]] or [[video]] or [[image scanner]] dot density, in particular the number of individual dots that can be placed in a line within the span of 1&amp;nbsp;inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm). Similarly, the more newly introduced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/ CSS3 media queries draft]&lt;/ref&gt; '''dots per centimeter''' ('''d/cm''' or '''dpcm''') refers to the number of individuel dots that can be placed within a line of 1 centimeter (≈&amp;nbsp;0.393&amp;nbsp;in).

Monitors do not have dots, but do have pixels; the closely related concept for monitors and images is [[pixels per inch]] or PPI. Many resources, including the Android developer guide, use the terms DPI and PPI interchangeably.

== DPI measurement in printing ==
DPI is used to describe the resolution number of dots per inch in a digital print and the printing resolution of a hard copy print dot gain, which is the increase in the size of the halftone dots during printing. This is caused by the spreading of ink on the surface of the media.

Up to a point, [[computer printer|printers]] with higher DPI produce clearer and more detailed output. A printer does not necessarily have a single DPI measurement; it is dependent on print mode, which is usually influenced by driver settings. The range of DPI supported by a printer is most dependent on the print head technology it uses. A [[dot matrix printer]], for example, applies ink via tiny rods striking an ink ribbon, and has a relatively low resolution, typically in the range of {{convert|60|to|90|dpi|abbr=on}}. An [[inkjet printer]] sprays ink through tiny nozzles, and is typically capable of 300–720 DPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoki.co.uk/encyclo/printertech/inkjet.asp |website=www.askoki.co.uk |title=OKI's Technology Guide to Inkjet Printing |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815080542/http://www.askoki.co.uk/encyclo/printertech/inkjet.asp |archive-date=2009-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[laser printer]] applies [[toner]] through a controlled electrostatic charge, and may be in the range of 600 to 2,400&amp;nbsp;DPI.

The DPI measurement of a printer often needs to be considerably higher than the [[pixels per inch]] (PPI) measurement of a video display in order to produce similar-quality output. This is due to the limited range of colors for each dot typically available on a printer. At each dot position, the simplest type of color printer can either print no dot, or print a dot consisting of a fixed volume of ink in each of four color channels (typically [[CMYK]] with [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]] and [[black]] ink) or 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16 colors on laser, wax and most inkjet printers, of which only 14 or 15 (or as few as 8 or 9) may be actually discernible depending on the strength of the black component, the strategy used for overlaying and combining it with the other colors, and whether it is in "color" mode.

Higher-end inkjet printers can offer 5, 6 or 7 ink colors giving 32, 64 or 128 possible tones per dot location (and again, it can be that not all combinations will produce a unique result). Contrast this to a standard [[sRGB]] monitor where each pixel produces 256 intensities of light in each of three channels ([[RGB]]).

While some color printers can produce variable drop volumes at each dot position, and may use additional ink-color channels, the number of colors is still typically less than on a monitor. Most printers must therefore produce additional colors through a [[halftone]] or [[dithering]] process, and rely on their base resolution being high enough to "fool" the human observer's eye into perceiving a patch of a single smooth color.

The exception to this rule is [[dye-sublimation printer]]s, which can apply a much more variable amount of dye—close to or exceeding the number of the 256 levels per channel available on a typical monitor—to each "pixel" on the page without dithering, but with other limitations:
* lower spatial resolution (typically 200 to 300 dpi), which can make text and lines look somewhat rough
* lower output speed (a single page requiring three or four complete passes, one for each dye color, each of which may take more than fifteen seconds—generally quicker, however, than most inkjet printers' "photo" modes)
* a wasteful (and, for confidential documents, insecure) dye-film roll cartridge system
* occasional color registration errors (mainly along the long axis of the page), which necessitate recalibrating the printer to account for slippage and drift in the paper feed system.

These disadvantages mean that, despite their marked superiority in producing good photographic and non-linear diagrammatic output, dye-sublimation printers remain niche products, and devices using higher resolution, lower color depth, and dither patterns remain the norm.

This dithered printing process could require a region of four to six dots (measured across each side) in order to faithfully reproduce the color in a single pixel. An image that is 100 pixels wide may need to be 400 to 600 dots in width in the printed output; if a 100×100-pixel image is to be printed in a one-inch square, the printer must be capable of 400 to 600 dots per inch to reproduce the image. Fittingly, 600 dpi (sometimes 720) is now the typical output resolution of entry-level laser printers and some utility inkjet printers, with 1200/1440 and 2400/2880 being common "high" resolutions. This contrasts with the 300/360 (or 240) dpi of early models, and the approximate 200 dpi of dot-matrix printers and fax machines, which gave faxed and computer-printed documents—especially those that made heavy use of graphics or colored block text—a characteristic "digitized" appearance, because of their coarse, obvious dither patterns, inaccurate colors, loss of clarity in photographs, and jagged ("aliased") edges on some text and line art.

[[Image:DPI and PPI.png|right|frame|A 10 × 10-pixel image on a computer display usually requires many more than 10 × 10 printer dots to accurately reproduce, due to limitations of available ink colors in the printer; here, a 60x60 grid is used, providing 36x the original density, compensating for the printer's lower color depth. The whole blue pixels making up the sphere are reproduced by the printer using different overlaid combinations of cyan, magenta, and black ink, and the light aqua by cyan and yellow with some "white" (ink-free) print pixels within the actual image pixel. When viewed at a more normal distance, the primary colored stippled dots appear to merge into a smoother, more richly colored image.]]

===DPI or PPI in digital image files===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
In printing, DPI (dots per inch) refers to the output resolution of a printer or imagesetter, and PPI (pixels per inch) refers to the input resolution of a photograph or image.
''DPI'' refers to the physical dot density of an image when it is reproduced as a real physical entity, for example printed onto paper. A digitally stored image has no inherent physical dimensions, measured in inches or centimeters. Some digital file formats record a DPI value, or more commonly a PPI ([[pixels per inch]]) value, which is to be used when printing the image. This number lets the printer or software know the intended size of the image, or in the case of [[scanned images]], the size of the original scanned object. For example, a [[bitmap]] image may measure 1,000 × 1,000 pixels, a resolution of 1 [[megapixels|megapixel]]. If it is labeled as 250&amp;nbsp;PPI, that is an instruction to the printer to print it at a size of 4 × 4&amp;nbsp;inches. Changing the PPI to 100 in an image editing program would tell the printer to print it at a size of 10 × 10&amp;nbsp;inches.  However, changing the PPI value would not change the size of the image in pixels which would still be 1,000 × 1,000. An image may also be resampled to change the number of pixels and therefore the size or resolution of the image, but this is quite different from simply setting a new PPI for the file.

For [[vector images]], there is no equivalent of resampling an image when it is resized, and there is no PPI in the file because it is resolution independent (prints equally well at all sizes). However, there is still a target printing size. Some image formats, such as Photoshop format, can contain both bitmap and vector data in the same file. Adjusting the PPI in a Photoshop file will change the intended printing size of the bitmap portion of the data and also change the intended printing size of the vector data to match. This way the vector and bitmap data maintain a consistent size relationship when the target printing size is changed. Text stored as outline fonts in bitmap image formats is handled in the same way. Other formats, such as PDF, are primarily vector formats which can contain images, potentially at a mixture of resolutions.  In these formats the target PPI of the bitmaps is adjusted to match when the target print size of the file is changed.  This is the converse of how it works in a primarily bitmap format like Photoshop, but has exactly the same result of maintaining the relationship between the vector and bitmap portions of the data.

==Computer monitor DPI standards==
Since the 1980s, the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system has set the default display "DPI" to 96 PPI, while [[Apple Inc|Apple]]/[[Macintosh]] computers have used a default of 72 PPI.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2005/11/08/490490.aspx
 |title=Where does 96 DPI come from in Windows?

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These default specifications arose out of the problems rendering standard fonts in the early display systems of the 1980s, including the [[IBM]]-based [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], [[VGA]] and [[8514]] displays as well as the [[Macintosh]] displays featured in the [[Macintosh 128K|128K]] computer and its successors. The choice of 72&amp;nbsp;PPI by Macintosh for their displays arose from the convenient fact that the official 72 ''points per inch'' mirrored the 72 ''pixels per inch'' that appeared on their display screens.  ([[Point (typography)|Points]] are a physical unit of measure in [[typography]], dating from the days of [[printing presses]], where 1 point by the [[Point (typography)#Current DTP point system|modern definition]] is 1/72 of the [[international inch]] (25.4&amp;nbsp;mm), which therefore makes 1 point approximately 0.0139&amp;nbsp;in or 352.8&amp;nbsp;µm). Thus, the 72 pixels per inch seen on the display had exactly the same physical dimensions as the 72 points per inch later seen on a printout, with 1&amp;nbsp;pt in printed text equal to 1&amp;nbsp;px on the display screen. As it is, the Macintosh 128K featured a screen measuring 512 pixels in width by 342 pixels in height, and this corresponded to the width of standard office paper (512&amp;nbsp;px ÷ 72&amp;nbsp;px/in ≈ 7.1&amp;nbsp;in, with a 0.7&amp;nbsp;in margin down each side when assuming [[Letter paper|8.5&amp;nbsp;in × 11&amp;nbsp;in North American paper size]] (in Europe, it's 21cm x 30cm - called "A4". B5 is 176 millimeters x 250 millimeters)).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A consequence of Apple's decision was that the widely used 10-point fonts from the typewriter era had to be allotted 10 display pixels in [[em (typography)|em]] height, and 5 display pixels in ''[[x-height]]''. This is technically described as 10 ''pixels per em'' (''PPEm''). This made 10-point fonts be rendered crudely and made them difficult to read on the display screen, particularly the lowercase characters. Furthermore, there was the consideration that computer screens are typically viewed (at a desk) at a distance 30% greater than printed materials, causing a mismatch between the perceived sizes seen on the computer screen and those on the printouts.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[Microsoft]] tried to solve both problems with a hack that has had long-term consequences for the understanding of what DPI and PPI mean.&lt;ref name="msdn-greg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2005/11/08/490490.aspx |title=Where does 96 DPI come from in Windows? |accessdate=2010-05-09 |first=Greg|last=Hitchcock|date=2005-09-08 |publisher=blogs.msdn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft began writing its software to treat the screen as though it provided a PPI characteristic that is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of what the screen actually displayed. Because most screens at the time provided around 72 PPI, Microsoft essentially wrote its software to assume that every screen provides 96 PPI (because &lt;math&gt;72 * (1+\tfrac{1}{3}) = 96&lt;/math&gt;). The short-term gain of this trickery was twofold:
* It would seem to the software that &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; more pixels were available for rendering an image, thereby allowing for bitmap fonts to be created with greater detail.
* On every screen that actually provided 72 PPI, each graphical element (such as a character of text) would be rendered at a size &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; larger than it "should" be, thereby allowing a person to sit a comfortable distance from the screen. However, larger graphical elements meant less screen space was available for programs to draw; indeed, although the default 720-pixel wide mode of a Hercules mono graphics adaptor (the one-time gold standard for high resolution PC graphics) – or a "tweaked" VGA adaptor – provided an apparent 7.5-inch page width at this resolution, the more common and color-capable display adaptors of the time all provided a 640-pixel wide image in their high resolution modes, enough for a bare 6.67 inches at 100% zoom (and barely any greater visible page ''height'' – a maximum of 5 inches, versus 4.75). Consequently, the default margins in Microsoft Word were set, ''and still remain'' at 1 full inch on all sides of the page, keeping the "text width" for standard size printer paper within visible limits; despite most computer monitors now being both larger and finer-pitched, and printer paper transports having become more sophisticated, the Mac-standard half-inch borders remain listed in Word 2010's page layout presets as the "narrow" option (versus the 1-inch default).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* Without using supplemental, software-provided zoom levels, the 1:1 relationship between display and print size was (deliberately) lost; the availability of different-sized, user-adjustable monitors and display adaptors with varying output resolutions exacerbated this, as it was not possible to rely on a properly-adjusted "standard" monitor and adaptor having a known PPI. For example, a 12" Hercules monitor and adaptor with a thick bezel and a little underscan may offer 90 "physical" PPI, with the displayed image appearing nearly identical to hardcopy (assuming the H-scan density was properly adjusted to give square pixels) but a thin-bezel 14" VGA monitor adjusted to give a borderless display may be closer to 60, with the same bitmap image thus appearing 50% larger; yet, someone with an 8514 ("XGA") adaptor and the same monitor could achieve 100 DPI using its 1024-pixel wide mode and adjusting the image to be underscanned. A user who wanted to directly compare on-screen elements against those on an existing printed page by holding it up against the monitor would therefore first need to determine the correct zoom level to use, largely by trial and error, and often not be able to obtain an exact match in programs that only allowed integer percent settings, or even fixed pre-programmed zoom levels. For the examples above, they may need to use respectively 94% (precisely, 93.75) – or 90/96, 63% (62.5) – or 60/96; and 104% (104.167) – or 100/96, with the more commonly accessible 110% actually being a less precise match.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Thus, for example, a 10-point font on a Macintosh (at 72&amp;nbsp;PPI) was represented with 10 pixels (i.e., 10&amp;nbsp;PPEm), whereas a 10-point font on a Windows platform (at 96&amp;nbsp;PPI) at the same zoom level&lt;!--"on the same screen" text removed because of both a) Mac and Windows monitors being mutually incompatible at the time, before Mac moved to using multisync VGA monitors re-engineered to use their proprietary socket standards, b) it doesn't actually matter what the screen is, in terms of physical size, or logical or physical resolution, because at the moment we're talking purely about the virtual display surface inside the computer itself, which can be of arbitrary resolution so long as it's big enough to show at least one text character--&gt; is represented with 13 pixels (i.e., Microsoft rounded 13.3333 to 13 pixels, or 13&amp;nbsp;PPEm) – and, on a typical consumer grade monitor, would have physically appeared around 15/72 to 16/72 of an inch high instead of 10/72. Likewise, a 12-point font was represented with 12 pixels on a Macintosh, and 16 pixels (or a physical display height of maybe 19/72 of an inch) on a Windows platform at the same zoom, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative consequence of this standard is that with 96 PPI displays, there is no longer a 1-to-1 relationship between the font size in pixels and the printout size in points. This difference is accentuated on more recent displays that feature higher [[pixel densities]]. This has been less of a problem with the advent of [[vector graphics]] and fonts being used in place of bitmap graphics and fonts. Moreover, many Windows software programs have been written since the 1980s which assume that the screen provides 96 PPI. Accordingly, these programs do not display properly at common alternative resolutions such as 72&amp;nbsp;PPI or 120&amp;nbsp;PPI. The solution has been to introduce two concepts:&lt;ref name="msdn-greg"/&gt;
* '''logical PPI''': The PPI that software claims a screen provides. This can be thought of as the PPI provided by a virtual screen created by the operating system.
* '''physical PPI''': The PPI that a physical screen actually provides.
Software programs render images to the virtual screen and then the operating system renders the virtual screen onto the physical screen. With a logical PPI of 96 PPI, older programs can still run properly regardless of the actual physical PPI of the display screen, although they may exhibit some visual distortion thanks to the effective 133.3% pixel zoom level (requiring either that every third pixel be doubled in width/height, or heavy-handed smoothing be employed).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===How Microsoft Windows handles DPI scaling===
[[File:Mixed-mode scaling.png|thumb|[[Microsoft Visual Studio]] when moved from 125% scaling to 100% scaling]]
[[File:Windows XP scaling at 200%.png|thumb|Windows XP scaling at 200%]]
[[File:Windows 2000 scaling at 200%.png|thumb|Windows 2000 scaling at 200%]]
Displays with high pixel densities were not common up to the Windows XP era. High DPI displays became mainstream around the time Windows 8 was released. Display scaling by entering a custom DPI irrespective of the display resolution has been a feature of Microsoft Windows since Windows 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=fbcontrb |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fontblog/archive/2005/11/08/490490.aspx |title=Where does 96 DPI come from in Windows? |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2005-11-08 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows XP introduced the GDI+ library which allows resolution-independent text scaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/307208 |title=Why text appears different when drawn with GDIPlus versus GDI |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2018-02-04 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Vista introduced support for programs to declare themselves to the OS that they are high-DPI aware via a manifest file or using an API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633543(VS.85).aspx |title=Win32 SetProcessDPIAware Function}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istartedsomething.com/20061211/vista-dpi-scaling/ |title=Windows Vista DPI scaling: my Vista is bigger than your Vista |date=December 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For programs that do not declare themselves as DPI-aware, Windows Vista supports a compatibility feature called DPI virtualization so system metrics and UI elements are presented to applications as if they are running at 96 DPI and the [[Desktop Window Manager]] then scales the resulting application window to match the DPI setting. Windows Vista retains the Windows XP style scaling option which when enabled turns off DPI virtualization for all applications globally. DPI virtualization is a compatibility option as application developers are all expected to update their apps to support high DPI without relying on DPI virtualization.

Windows Vista also introduces [[Windows Presentation Foundation]]. WPF .NET applications are vector-based, not pixel-based and are designed to be resolution-independent. Developers using the old GDI API and Windows Forms on .NET Framework runtime need to update their apps to be DPI aware and flag their applications as DPI-aware.

[[Windows 7]] adds the ability to change the DPI by doing only a log off, not a full reboot and makes it a per-user setting. Additionally, Windows 7 reads the monitor DPI from the [[Extended display identification data|EDID]] and automatically sets the system DPI value to match the monitor's physical pixel density, unless the effective resolution is less than 1024 x 768.

In [[Windows 8]], only the DPI scaling percentage is shown in the DPI changing dialog and the display of the raw DPI value has been removed.&lt;ref name="kynosarges"&gt;{{cite web|author=Christoph Nahr / |url=http://www.kynosarges.org/WindowsDpi.html |title=High DPI Settings in Windows |publisher=Kynosarges.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Windows 8.1]], the global setting to disable DPI virtualization (only use XP-style scaling) is removed and a per-app setting added for the user to disable DPI virtualization from the Compatibility tab.&lt;ref name="kynosarges"/&gt; When the DPI scaling setting is set to be higher than 120 PPI (125%), DPI virtualization is enabled for all applications unless the application opts out of it by specifying a DPI aware flag (manifest) as "true" inside the EXE. Windows 8.1 retains a per-application option to disable DPI virtualization of an app.&lt;ref name="kynosarges"/&gt; Windows 8.1 also adds the ability for different displays to use independent DPI scaling factors, although it calculates this automatically for each display and turns on DPI virtualization for all monitors at any scaling level.

Windows 10 adds manual control over DPI scaling for individual monitors.

==Proposed metrication==
There are some ongoing efforts to abandon the DPI [[Image resolution]] unit in favor of a [[metrication|metric unit]], giving the inter-dot spacing in [[dots per centimeter]] ( px/cm or dpcm), as used in [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS3]] media queries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/| title=Media Queries}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[micrometre]]s (µm) between dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/print/attribute/ResolutionSyntax.html|title=Class ResolutionSyntax|publisher=Sun Microsystems|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A resolution of 72&amp;nbsp;DPI, for example, equals a resolution of about 28&amp;nbsp;dpcm or an inter-dot spacing of about 350&amp;nbsp;µm. In [[BMP file format#Example 1|BMP images]] 2835 pixels per meter correspond to 72&amp;nbsp;DPI (rounded from 2834.6472).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.translatorscafe.com/cafe/EN/units-converter/digital-image-resolution/1-3/dot%2Fmeter-dot%2Finch/|title=Convert dot/meter [dot/m] &amp;lt;—&amp;gt; dot/inch [dpi]|publisher=TranslatorsCafé.com|accessdate=2015-01-27|author=Kateryna Yuri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These companies each defined their own variants of emoji using proprietary standards. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Kurita created the first 180 emoji based on the expressions that he observed people making and other things in the city.&lt;ref name="Why and how I created emoji"/&gt;

For NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, each emoji is drawn on a 12×12 [[pixel]] grid. When transmitted, emoji symbols are specified as a two-[[byte]] sequence, in the private-use range E63E through E757 in the [[Unicode]] character space, or F89F through F9FC for [[Shift JIS]]. The basic specification has 1706 symbols, with 76 more added in phones that support [[C-HTML]] 4.0.

Emoji pictograms by Japanese mobile phone brand [[Au (mobile phone company)|Au]] are specified using the [[HTML element#Images and objects|IMG tag]]. SoftBank Mobile emoji are wrapped between [[Shift Out and Shift In characters|SI/SO escape sequences]], and support colors and animation. DoCoMo's emoji are the most compact to transmit while Au's version is more flexible and based on open standards.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

From 2010 onwards, some emoji character sets have been incorporated into [[Unicode]], a standard system for indexing characters, which has allowed them to be used outside Japan and to be standardized across different operating systems.

Hundreds of emoji characters were encoded in the [[Unicode Standard]] in version 6.0 released in October 2010 (and in the related international standard [[ISO/IEC 10646]]). The additions, originally requested by [[Google]] (Kat Momoi, [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]], and Markus Scherer wrote the first draft for consideration by the Unicode Technical Committee in August 2007) and [[Apple Inc.]] (whose Yasuo Kida and Peter Edberg joined the first official UTC proposal for 607 characters as coauthors in January 2009), went through a long series of commenting by members of the [[Unicode Consortium]] and national standardization bodies of various countries participating in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2, especially the United States, Germany, Ireland (led by [[Michael Everson]]), and Japan; various new characters (especially symbols for maps and European signs) were added during the consensus-building process. Encoding in the Unicode standard has allowed emoji to become popular outside Japan. The core emoji set in Unicode 6.0 consisted of 722 characters, of which 114 characters map to sequences of one or more characters in the pre-6.0 Unicode standard, and the remaining 608 characters map to sequences of one or more characters introduced in Unicode 6.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html|title=FAQ – Emoji &amp; Dingbats|work=unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no block specifically set aside for emoji – the new symbols were encoded in seven different blocks (some newly created), and there exists a Unicode data file called EmojiSources.txt that includes mappings to and from the Japanese vendors' legacy character sets. "[[Regional Indicator Symbol]]s" were defined as part of this set of characters as an alternative to encoding separate characters for national flags.

The popularity of emoji has caused pressure from vendors and international markets to add additional designs into the Unicode standard to meet the demands of different cultures. Unicode 7.0 added approximately 250 emoji, many from the [[Webdings]] and [[Wingdings]] fonts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hexus.net/tech/news/software/71157-host-new-characters-emoji-introduced-unicode-70/| title=Host of New Characters and Emoji Introduced in Unicode 7.0| date=June 17, 2014| publisher=Hexus| access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some characters now defined as emoji are inherited from a variety of pre-Unicode messenger systems not only used in Japan, including [[Yahoo Messenger|Yahoo]] and [[MSN Messenger]].&lt;ref name="Emoji Additions: Animals, Compatibility, and More Popular Requests; Emoji tranche 5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emoji Additions: Animals, Compatibility, and More Popular Requests; Emoji tranche 5|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15054r4-emoji-tranche5.pdf|publisher=Unicode|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unicode 8.0 added another 41 emoji, including articles of sports equipment such as the cricket bat, food items such as the [[taco]], signs of the [[Zodiac]], new facial expressions, and symbols for places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicode 8.0.0|url=http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/|publisher=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate demand for emoji standardisation has placed pressures on the Unicode Consortium, with some members complaining that it had overtaken the group's traditional focus on standardising characters used for minority languages and transcribing historical records.&lt;ref name="Inside 'Emojigeddon'"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warzel|first1=Charlie|title=Inside 'Emojigeddon': The Fight Over The Future of the Unicode Consortium|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/inside-emojigeddon-the-fight-over-the-future-of-the-unicode|website=Buzzfeed|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emoji characters vary slightly between platforms within the limits in meaning defined by the Unicode specification, as companies have tried to provide artistic presentations of ideas and objects.&lt;ref name="Lost in translation: Android emoji vs iOS emoji"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allsopp |first1=Ashleigh |title=Lost in translation: Android emoji vs iOS emoji |url=http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/opinion/mobile-phone/lost-in-translation-android-emoji-vs-ios-emoji |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228093209/http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/opinion/mobile-phone/lost-in-translation-android-emoji-vs-ios-emoji/ |archive-date=December 28, 2014 |date=December 15, 2014 |website=Tech Advisor |accessdate=August 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, following an Apple tradition, the calendar emoji on Apple products always shows July 17, the date in 2002 Apple announced its [[iCal]] calendar application for [[macOS]]. This led some Apple product users to initially nickname July 17 "[[World Emoji Day]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Letting Our Emojis Get in the Way|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/nytnow/letting-our-emojis-get-in-the-way.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 17, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|first=Kathryn|last=Varn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other emoji fonts show different dates or do not show a specific one.&lt;ref name="Calendar emoji"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calendar emoji|url=http://emojipedia.org/calendar|website=[[Emojipedia]]|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Apple emoji are very similar to the SoftBank standard, since SoftBank was the first Japanese network the iPhone launched on. For example, {{unichar|1F483|DANCER|nlink=💃}} is female on Apple and SoftBank standards but male or gender-neutral on others.&lt;ref name="How Emoji Get Lost In Translation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bosker|first1=Bianca|title=How Emoji Get Lost in Translation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html|work=Huffington Post|date=June 27, 2014|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists have noted that the ambiguity of emoji has allowed them to take on culture-specific meanings not present in the original glyphs. For example, {{unichar|1F485|NAIL POLISH|nlink=💅}} has been described as being used in English-language communities to signify "non-caring fabulousness" and "anything from shutting [[wikt:hater|haters]] down to a sense of accomplishment".&lt;ref name="How to (pretend to) be young and down with the internet"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=How to (pretend to) be young and down with the internet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/how-to-be-young-internet-lol-facebook|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 12, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The 31 Most Nail Care Emoji Moments Of 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jewell|first1=Hannah|title=The 31 Most Nail Care Emoji Moments of 2014|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahjewell/the-most-nail-care-emoji-moments-of-2014|website=Buzzfeed|date=December 13, 2014|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Five Non-Negotiable Best Emojis in the Land"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander|last1=Abad-Santos|first2=Allie |last2=Jones|title=The Five Non-Negotiable Best Emojis in the Land|url=http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/03/the-only-five-emojis-you-need/359646/|website=The Atlantic Wire|date= March 26, 2014|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unicode manuals sometimes provide notes on auxiliary meanings of an object to guide designers on how emoji may be used, for example noting that some users may expect {{unichar|1F4BA|SEAT}} to stand for "a reserved or ticketed seat, as for an airplane, train, or theater".&lt;ref name="Unicode Consortium"&gt;{{cite web|title=Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/nameslist/n_1F300.html|website=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2017|July}} there were 2,666 emoji on the official Unicode Standard list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40612529| title=Emojis Honoured in World Celebration| date=July 17, 2017| publisher=BBC| access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some emoji are specific to Japanese culture, such as a [[Dogeza|bowing]] businessman ({{unichar|1F647}}), the [[shoshinsha mark]] used to indicate a beginner driver ({{unichar|1F530}}), a white flower ({{unichar|1F4AE}}) used to denote "brilliant homework",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emojipedia.org/white-flower|title=White Flower Emoji|publisher=Emojipedia.org|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a group of emoji representing popular foods: [[ramen]] noodles ({{unichar|1F35C}}), [[dango]] ({{unichar|1F361}}), [[onigiri]] ({{unichar|1F359}}), [[Japanese curry]] ({{unichar|1F35B}}), and [[sushi]] ({{unichar|1F363}}). [[Unicode Consortium]] founder [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] compared the use of emoji to a developing language, particularly mentioning the American use of eggplant ({{unichar|1F346}}) to represent a [[phallus]].&lt;ref name=Bromwich&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/technology/how-emojis-find-their-way-to-phones.html |title=How Emojis find their way to phones |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Bromwich, Jonah |date=October 20, 2015 |accessdate=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguists have classified emoji and [[emoticon]]s as [[discourse marker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/emoticons-and-symbols-arent-ruining-language-theyre-revolutionizing-it-38408|title=Emoticons and symbols aren't ruining language – they're revolutionizing it|last=Collister|first=Lauren|website=The Conversation|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, in what is believed to be the first large-scale study of emoji usage, researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] analysed over 1.2 billion messages input via the Kika Emoji Keyboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/24857-emojis-how-we-assign-meaning-to-these-ever-popular-symbols| title=Emojis: How We Assign Meaning to These Ever-Popular Symbols| date=May 19, 2017| publisher=University of Michigan| access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced that the Face With Tears of Joy was the most popular emoji. The Heart and the Heart eyes emoji stood second and third respectively. The study also found that the French heart emoji the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.futurity.org/emoji-countries-1328712-2/| title=People Around the World Use These Emojis The Most| date=January 3, 2017| publisher=Futurity| access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in countries like Australia, France and the Czech Republic used more happy emoji, while this was not so for people in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina, where people used more negative emoji in comparison to cultural hubs known for restraint and self-discipline, like Turkey, France and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/%E2%80%98Face-with-tears-of-joy%E2%80%99-is-the-most-popular-emoji-says-study/article17025261.ece|title='Face with tears of joy' is the most popular emoji, says study|website=[[The Hindu]]|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been discussion among legal experts on whether or not emoji could be admissible as evidence in court trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danesi|first1=Marcel|title=The Semiotics of Emoji|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/10/emoticons_and_emojis_as_evidence_in_court.html| title=Exhibit A: ;-)| date=October 16, 2015| publisher=Slate| access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as emoji continue to develop and grow as a "language" of symbols, there may also be the potential of the formation of emoji "dialects".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/fashion/emoji-have-won-the-battle-of-words.html|title=The Emoji Have Won the Battle of Words|last=Bennett|first=Jessica|date=July 25, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=February 28, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emoji are being used as more than just to show reactions and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/the-science-of-emoji/| title=The Emoji is the Birth of a New Type of Language (?

=={{anchor|Emoji communication problems}}Emoji communications problems==
Research has shown that emoji are often misunderstood. In some cases, this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer;&lt;ref name="DailyDotMisunderstandEmojis"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/debug/emoji-miscommunicate/|title=Emoji can lead to huge misunderstandings, research finds|work=Daily Dot|first=Selena|last=Larson|date=April 11, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases, the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side.&lt;ref name="GrouplensEmojiMiscommunication"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/blog/investigating-the-potential-for-miscommunication-using-emoji/|title=Investigating the Potential for Miscommunication Using Emoji|publisher=Grouplens|first=Hannah|last=Miller|date=April 5, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji. When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78kzn9/what-the-emoji-youre-sending-actually-look-like-to-your-friends| title=What the Emoji You're Sending Actually Look Like to Your Friends| date=November 12, 2015| publisher=Motherboard| access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Models of communication]].)

For example, people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively, so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising, mocking, and even obnoxious attitude, as the orbicularis oculi (the muscle near that upper eye corner) on the face of the emoji does not move, and the orbicularis oris (the one near the mouth) tightens, which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/944693/chinese-people-mean-something-very-different-when-they-send-you-a-smiley-emoji/ |title=Chinese people mean something very different when they send you a smiley emoji |website=Quartz|date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second problem relates to technology and branding. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way. Small changes to a character's look may completely alter its perceived meaning with the receiver.

===Controversial emoji===
Some emoji have been involved in controversy due to their perceived meanings. Multiple arrests and imprisonments have followed usage of gun ({{unichar|1F52B}}), knife ({{unichar|1F5E1}}), and bomb ({{unichar|1F4A3}}) emoji in ways that were deemed by authorities to constitute credible threats.&lt;ref name=AppleGun&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/01/technology/apple-pistol-emoji/index.html |title=Apple replaces the pistol emoji with a water gun |last=Kelly |first=Heather |website=[[CNN]] Tech |date=August 2, 2017 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-up to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], the Unicode Consortium considered proposals to add several Olympic-related emoji, including medals and events such as [[handball]] and [[water polo]].&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/new-emoji-candidates-be-voted-spring-2016-385196 |title=New Emoji Candidates to Be Voted On in Spring 2016 |last=Ziv |first=Stan |website=[[Newsweek]] |date=20 October 2015 |access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2015, these candidate emoji included "[[ISSF shooting events|rifle]]" ({{unichar|1F946}}) and "[[modern pentathlon]]" ({{unichar|1F93B}}).&lt;ref name=ep20151031&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-9.0/ |title=Unicode 9.0 Emoji List |date=31 October 2015 |work=Emojipedia |access-date=1 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031233229/https://emojipedia.org/unicode-9.0/ |archive-date=2015-10-31 |dead-url=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OlympicRifle" /&gt; However, in 2016, Apple and Microsoft opposed these two emoji, and the characters were added without emoji presentations, meaning that software is expected to render them in black-and-white rather than color, and emoji-specific software such as onscreen keyboards will generally not include them. In addition, while the original incarnations of the modern pentathlon emoji depicted its five events, including a man pointing a gun, the final glyph contains a person riding a horse, along with a laser pistol target in the corner.&lt;ref name=AppleGun /&gt;&lt;ref name="OlympicRifle"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/thanks-to-apples-influence-youre-not-getting-a-rifle-emoji |title=Thanks To Apple's Influence, You're Not Getting A Rifle Emoji |last=Warzel |first=Charlie |website=[[BuzzFeed]] |date=June 17, 2016 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AppleStops&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/rifle-emoji-dropped-unicode-9-0-update-apple-microsoft-1.3645884 |title=Apple stops Unicode from releasing a rifle emoji, gun advocates get mad |website=[[CBC News]] |date=June 22, 2016 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2016, Apple announced that in [[iOS 10]], the gun emoji ({{unichar|1F52B}}) would be changed from a realistic [[revolver]] to a [[water pistol]].&lt;ref name=AppleGun /&gt; Conversely, the following day, Microsoft pushed out an update to Windows 10 that changed its longstanding depiction of the gun emoji as a toy [[ray-gun]] to a real revolver.&lt;ref name=MicrosoftGun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/04/microsoft-new-real-gun-emoji/ |title=Microsoft just changed its toy gun emoji to a real pistol |last=Low |first=Cherlynn |website=[[Engadget]] |date=August 4, 2016 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft stated that the change was made to bring the glyph more in line with industry-standard designs and customer expectations.&lt;ref name=MicrosoftGun /&gt; By 2018, most major platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Facebook, and Twitter had transitioned their rendering of the pistol emoji to match Apple's water gun implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.emojipedia.org/all-major-vendors-commit-to-gun-redesign/|title=All Major Vendors Commit to Gun Redesign|date=April 27, 2018|work=Emojipedia|access-date=May 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[eggplant]] ({{lang-en-GB|aubergine|link=no}}) emoji ({{unichar|1F346}}) has also seen controversy due to its being used, almost solely in the United States, to represent a penis.&lt;ref name=AmericanDialect /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromwich /&gt;&lt;ref name=EggplantRising&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/04/eggplant_rising_how_the_purple_fruit_surpassed_the_banana_as_the_most_phallic.html |title=Eggplant rising: How the purple fruit surpassed the banana as the most phallic food |last=Hess |first=Amanda |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=April 3, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SordidHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=https://firstwefeast.com/features/2015/06/eggplant-emoji-history |title=The Complete (and Sometimes Sordid) History of the Eggplant Emoji |last=Hofmann |first=Regan |website=[[First We Feast]] |date=June 3, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in December 2014, the [[hashtag]] {{nobr|#EggplantFridays}} began to rise to popularity on [[Instagram]] for use in marking photos featuring clothed or unclothed penises.&lt;ref name=EggplantRising /&gt;&lt;ref name=SordidHistory /&gt; This became such a popular trend that beginning in April 2015, Instagram disabled the ability to search for not only the {{nobr|#EggplantFridays}} tag, but also other eggplant-containing hashtags, including simply {{nobr|#eggplant}} and {{nobr|#🍆}}.&lt;ref name=EggplantRising /&gt;&lt;ref name=SordidHistory /&gt;&lt;ref name=InstagramBlocks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/29/technology/eggplant-instagram-offensive/ |title=Instagram blocks 'offensive' eggplant emoji hashtag |last=Goldman |first=David |website=[[CNN]] Tech |date=April 29, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peach emoji ({{unichar|1F351}}) has likewise been used as a euphemistic icon for [[buttocks]], with a 2016 [[Emojipedia]] analysis revealing that only 7% of English language tweets with the peach emoji refer to the actual fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.emojipedia.org/how-we-really-use-the-peach|title=How We Really Use The Peach|first=Hamdan|last=Azhar|date=December 16, 2016|work=Emojipedia|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/12/what-does-peach-emoji-mean-its-a-butt.html|title=Very Official Study Finds Peach Emoji Most Often Paired With Eggplant|first=Madison|last=Kircher|date=December 16, 2016|work=Emojipedia|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/18/what-do-the-aubergine-and-peach-emoji-mean-7240646/|title=What do the aubergine and peach emoji mean?|first=Avinash|last=Bhunjun|date=January 18, 2018|work=Metro UK|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Apple attempted to redesign the emoji to less resemble a butt. This was met with fierce backlash in beta testing and Apple reversed its decision by the time it went live to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/16/everything-is-peachy-as-apple-restores-emojis-bum-features|title=Everything's peachy as Apple restores emoji's 'bum' features|first=Alex|last=Hern|date=November 16, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 a lawyer in [[Delhi]], India threatened to file suit against [[WhatsApp]] for allowing use of the [[The finger|middle finger]] emoji ({{unichar|1F595}}) on the basis that the company is "directly abetting the use of an offensive, lewd, obscene gesture" in violation of the [[Indian Penal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/12/27/lawyer-demands-whatsapp-gets-rid-lewd-middle-finger-emoji-7186571/|title=Lawyer demands WhatsApp gets rid of the 'lewd' middle finger emoji|date=December 27, 2017|work=Metro|access-date=December 28, 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emoji versus text presentation==
Unicode defines [[Variant form (Unicode)|variation sequences]] for many of its emoji to indicate their desired presentation.
{{quote |text=Emoji characters can have two main kinds of presentation:
* an ''emoji presentation'', with colorful and perhaps whimsical shapes, even animated
* a ''text presentation'', such as black &amp; white |source=Unicode Technical Report #51: Unicode Emoji&lt;ref name="UTR51"/&gt;}}

Specifying the desired presentation is done by following the base emoji with either U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (VS15) for text or U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (VS16) for emoji-style.&lt;ref name="UniStdVarTxt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/StandardizedVariants.txt|title=UCD: Standardized Variation Sequences|publisher=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skin color==
{{Main|Emoji modifiers}}

Five symbol modifier characters were added with Unicode 8.0 to provide a range of skin tones for human emoji. These modifiers are called EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-1-2, −3, −4, −5, and −6 (U+1F3FB–U+1F3FF): 🏻 🏼 🏽 🏾 🏿. They are based on the [[Fitzpatrick scale]] for classifying human skin color. Human emoji that are not followed by one of these five modifiers should be displayed in a generic, non-realistic skin tone, such as bright yellow (&lt;span style="color: #ffcc22;font-size:large;"&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;), blue (&lt;span style="color: #3399CC;font-size:large;"&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;), or gray (&lt;span style="color: #CCCCCC;font-size:large;"&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;ref name="UTR51"/&gt; Non-human emoji (like {{unichar|26FD|FUEL PUMP}}) are unaffected by the Fitzpatrick modifiers.
As of Unicode 11.0, Fitzpatrick modifiers can be used with 106 human emoji spread across six blocks: [[Dingbat#Skin tones|Dingbats]], [[Emoticons (Unicode block)#Skin tones|Emoticons]], [[Miscellaneous Symbols#Skin tones|Miscellaneous Symbols]], [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs#Skin tones|Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]], [[Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs#Skin tones|Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs]], and [[Transport and Map Symbols#Skin tones|Transport and Map Symbols]].&lt;ref name="EmojiData"/&gt;

The following table shows both the Unicode characters and the open-source "Twemoji" images, designed by [[Twitter]]:

==Joining==
Implementations may use [[Zero-width joiner|U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER]] (ZWJ) between emoji to make them behave like a single, unique emoji character.&lt;ref name="UTR51"/&gt;
(Systems that don't support this should ignore the ZWJ character.)

For example, the sequence U+1F468 MAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F467 GIRL (👨‍👩‍👧) could be displayed as a single emoji depicting a family with a man, a woman, and a girl if the implementation supports it. Systems that don't support it would ignore the ZWJs, showing the base emoji in the sequence: U+1F468 MAN, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+1F467 GIRL (👨👩👧).

Unicode previously maintained a catalog of emoji ZWJ sequences that are supported on at least one commonly available platform. The consortium has since switched to only document sequences that are ''recommended for general interchange'' (RGI).&lt;ref name="ZWJSequences"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-zwj-sequences.html|title=Emoji ZWJ Sequences Catalog|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicode blocks==
{{Main|Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|l1=Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (Unicode block)|Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs|l2=Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs (Unicode block)|Emoticons (Unicode block)|Transport and Map Symbols|l4=Transport and Map Symbols (Unicode block)|Miscellaneous Symbols|l5=Miscellaneous Symbols (Unicode block)|Dingbat#Dingbats Unicode block|l6=Dingbats (Unicode block)}}

Unicode 11.0 represents emoji using 1,250 characters spread across 22 blocks, of which 26 are [[Regional Indicator Symbol]]s that combine in pairs to form flag emoji, and 12 (#, * and 0–9) are base characters for [[keycap]] emoji sequences:&lt;ref name="EmojiData"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-data.txt|title=UCD: Emoji Data for UTR #51|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UTR51"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/|title=UTR #51: Unicode Emoji|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

637 of the 768 code points in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] block are considered emoji. 199 of the 213 code points in the [[Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs]] block are considered emoji. All of the 80 code points in the [[Emoticons]] block are considered emoji. 95 of the 108 code points in the [[Transport and Map Symbols]] block are considered emoji. 82 of the 256 code points in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block are considered emoji. 33 of the 192 code points in the [[Dingbat#Unicode|Dingbats]] block are considered emoji.

{{Emoji (Unicode block)}}

Additional emoji can be found in the following Unicode blocks: [[Arrows (Unicode block)|Arrows]] (8 code points considered emoji), [[Basic Latin (Unicode block)|Basic Latin]] (12), [[CJK Symbols and Punctuation]] (2), [[Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement]] (41), [[Enclosed Alphanumerics]] (1), [[Enclosed CJK Letters and Months]] (2), [[Enclosed Ideographic Supplement]] (15), [[General Punctuation]] (2), [[Geometric Shapes]] (8), [[Latin-1 Supplement (Unicode block)|Latin-1 Supplement]] (2), [[Letterlike Symbols]] (2), [[Mahjong Tiles (Unicode block)|Mahjong Tiles]] (1), [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows]] (7), [[Miscellaneous Technical]] (18), [[Playing cards in Unicode|Playing Cards]] (1), and [[Supplemental Arrows-B]] (2).

===Additions===
Some vendors, most notably Microsoft, Samsung and HTC, add emoji presentation to some other existing Unicode characters or coin their own ZWJ sequences.

Microsoft displays all [[Mahjong Tiles (Unicode block)|Mahjong tiles]] (U+1F000‥2B, not just {{unichar|1F004|MAHJONG TILE RED DRAGON}}) and alternative card suits ({{unichar|2661}}, {{unichar|2662}}, {{unichar|2664}}, {{unichar|2666}}) as emoji. They also support additional pencils ({{unichar|270E}}, {{unichar|2710}}) and a heart-shaped bullet ({{unichar|2765}}).

While only {{unichar|261D}} is officially an emoji, Microsoft and Samsung add the other three directions as well ({{unichar|261C}}, {{unichar|261E}}, {{unichar|261F}}).
Both vendors pair the standard checked ballot box emoji {{unichar|2611}} with its crossed variant {{unichar|2612}}, but only Samsung also has the empty ballot box {{unichar|2610}}.

Samsung almost completely covers the rest of the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block (U+2600‥FF) as emoji, which includes Chess pieces, game die faces, some traffic sign as well as genealogical and astronomical symbols for instance.

HTC supports most additional pictographs from the [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] (U+1F300‥5FF) and [[Transport and Map Symbols]] (U+1F680‥FF) blocks. Some of them are also shown as emoji on Samsung devices.

The open source projects Emojidex and Emojitwo are trying to cover all of these extensions established by major vendors.

==Implementation==
The exact appearance of emoji is not prescribed but varies between fonts, in the same way that normal typefaces can display letters differently. For example, the [[Apple Color Emoji]] typeface is proprietary to Apple, and can only be used on Apple devices (without additional [[Hacker culture#Programming|hacking]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[MOD] Apple Color Emoji system-wide for KitKat+ (updated with unicorns)|url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2563757|publisher=XDA Developers|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different computing companies have developed their own fonts to display emoji, some of which have been [[Open source software|open-sourced]] to permit their reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidson|first1=Mike|title=Open sourcing Twitter emoji for everyone|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2014/open-sourcing-twitter-emoji-for-everyone|website=Twitter developer blog|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emoji One: Open Source Emoji|url=http://www.emojione.com|publisher=Emoji One|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=El Khoury|first1=Rita|title=Woohoo!

===Android===
[[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices support emoji differently depending on the operating system version. Google added native emoji support to Android in July 2013 with Android 4.3,&lt;ref name="CNet_4.3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/products/google-android-4-3-jelly-bean/|title=Google Android 4.3 is here, and it tastes like Jelly Bean|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the Google Keyboard in November 2013 for devices running Android 4.4 and later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/124960-google-adds-sms-to-hangouts-android-app-emoji-to-kitkat-keyboard|title=Google adds SMS to Hangouts Android app, Emoji to KitKat keyboard|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android 7.0 Nougat added Unicode 9 emoji, skin tone modifiers, and a redesign of many existing emoji.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.emojipedia.org/android-7-0-emoji-changelog/|title=Android 7.0 Nougat Emoji Changelog|date=August 22, 2016|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emoji are also supported by the [[Google Hangouts]] application (independent of the keyboard in use), in both Hangouts and [[Text messaging|SMS]] modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk|title=Hangouts – Google Play|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several third-party messaging and keyboard applications (such as IQQI Keyboard) for Android devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://market.android.com/search?q=emoji&amp;c=apps|title=emoji – Google Play|publisher=Market.android.com|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide plugins that allow the use of emoji. Some apps, e.g. [[WhatsApp]], come with Apple emoji for internal use.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} With Android 8 (Oreo), Google added a compatibility library that, if included by app developers, makes the latest Noto emoji available on any platform since Android 4.3.&lt;ref name="EmojiCompat"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://blog.emojipedia.org/fewer-empty-boxes-ahead-for-android-users/ |title= Fewer Empty Boxes for Android Users | publisher = Emojipedia | author = Florence Ion | date= July 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2016, mobile phone vendors HTC and LG deployed variants of NotoColorEmoji.ttf with custom glyphs; Samsung still does. Some Japanese mobile carriers used to equip branded Android devices with emoji glyphs that were closer to the original ones, but apparently have stopped updating these circa 2015.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

===Apple===
Apple first introduced emoji to their desktop operating system with the release of [[macOS|OS X]] [[Mac OS X Lion|10.7 Lion]], in 2011. Users can view emoji characters sent through email and messaging applications, which are commonly shared by mobile users, as well as any other application. Users can create emoji symbols using the "Characters" special input panel from almost any native application by selecting the "Edit" menu and pulling down to "Special Characters", or by the key combination {{key press|Command|Option|T}}. The desktop OS uses the [[Apple Color Emoji]] font that was introduced earlier in [[iOS]].

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced that the [[Messages (software)|Messages]] app on the [[iPhone X]] would get "[[Animoji]]", which are versions of standard emoji that are custom-animated with the use of [[facial motion capture]] to reflect the sender's expressions. These Animoji can also utilize [[lip sync]] to appear to speak audio messages recorded by the sender. Apple had created 3D models of all standard emoji prior to its late-2016 OS updates from which the static default 2D graphics had been rendered. A select set of these models are being reused for creating still images and short animations dynamically.

Apple has revealed that the "face with tears of joy" is the most popular emoji among English speaking Americans. On second place is the "heart" emoji followed by the "Loudly Crying Face".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/03/face-with-tears-of-joy-most-popular-emoji/|title=Apple Says 'Face With Tears of Joy' is Most Popular Emoji in United States Among English Speakers|access-date=November 3, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emojipedia.org/people/|title=😃 Emoji People and Smileys Meanings|website=emojipedia.org|language=en|access-date=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chrome OS===
[[Chrome OS]], through its inclusion of the [[Noto fonts]], supports the emoji set introduced through Unicode 6.2. As of Chrome OS 41, Noto Color Emoji is the default font for most emoji.

===Microsoft Windows===
An update for the Segoe UI Symbol font in [[Windows 7]] and in Windows Server 2008 R2 brought a subset of the monochrome Unicode set to those operating systems.&lt;ref name="An update for the Segoe UI symbol font in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 is available"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2729094|title=An update for the Segoe UI symbol font in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 is available|publisher=Microsoft Support}}&lt;/ref&gt; The font update rebranded the font as ''Segoe UI Symbol''. The difference between the two fonts is that Segoe UI lacks any and all emoji characters, while Segoe UI Symbol and Segoe UI Emoji include them. [[Windows 8]] and higher supports the full Unicode emoji characters through Microsoft's [[Segoe UI]] family of fonts. Emoji characters are accessed through the onscreen keyboard's "smiley" key. As of [[Windows 8.1]] Preview, Segoe UI Emoji font supplies full-color pictographs. Differently from macOS and iOS, color glyphs are only supplied when the application supports Microsoft's [[DirectWrite]] API, and Segoe UI Emoji is explicitly declared, otherwise monochrome glyphs appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/globalization/mt791278| title=Script and Font Support in Windows| publisher=Microsoft| access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segoe UI Emoji and its full-color emoji set is not fully supported by all programs written for Windows; for example, among Web browsers, [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Google Chrome]] can use the font, but [[Firefox]] initially did not (that browser now supports full color emoji and includes the EmojiOne set in installation). [[Windows 10|Windows 10 Anniversary Update]] added Unicode 9 emoji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-anniversary-update-adds-over-52000-new-emoji| title=Windows 10 Anniversary Update Adds Over 52,000 New Emojis, Including NinjaCat| date=August 2, 2016| publisher=Windows Central| access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internationalized domain names===
{{Main|Emoji domain|Internationalized domain name}}

A limited number of [[top-level domain]]s allow registration of domain names containing emoji characters. Emoji-containing subdomains are also possible under any top-level domain.

===Social media===
[[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] replace all Unicode emoji used on their websites with their own custom graphics.

Facebook has different sets for the main site and for its Messenger service, where only the former provides complete coverage. [[Facebook reactions]] are only partially compatible with standard emoji.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Twitter has released [[Twemoji]], which is their emoji graphics together with a Javascript library to handle them, under the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license]] and the [[MIT License|MIT open-source license]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GitHub – twitter/twemoji: Twitter Emoji for Everyone |url=https://github.com/twitter/twemoji |website=[[GitHub]] |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their apps use emoji native to the platform they are running on.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

===General===
Any operating system that supports adding additional fonts to the system can add an emoji-supporting font.

[[EmojiOne]] version 2.3, an open-source font available under free license, supports the full emoji set in color through Unicode Emoji 3.0, i.e. Unicode 9.0. EmojiOne version 3.1, with a stricter license that disallows the redistribution of vector images, supports Unicode Emoji 5.0, hence characters added in Unicode 10.0. EmojiTwo, an open-source fork of EmojiOne 2.3, aims to add all emoji from 2017 and later.

Note, however, that not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so in these cases emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. [[OpenType]] version 1.8 standardizes four different formats for color fonts: one built upon standard glyphs and backed by Microsoft; one built upon [[SVG]] and backed by Mozilla, Adobe, and others; one based upon [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] chunks and backed by Google; and one supporting a variety of embedded image formats, but preferably PNG, backed by Apple. This means that color fonts need to come in several formats to be usable on multiple operating systems.

The font ''Symbola'' contains all emoji through version 10.0 as normal monochrome glyphs. Through version 10, Symbola was a [[Open-source Unicode typefaces|public domain font]]; beginning with version 11 in 2018, Symbola has been copyrighted with a ban on commercial use and derivative works. Other typefaces including a significant number of emoji characters include [[Noto fonts|Noto Emoji]], [[Adobe Source|Adobe Source Emoji]], and [[Quivira (typeface)|Quivira]].

An '''Esperantido''' is a [[constructed language]] derived from [[Esperanto]]. ''Esperantido'' originally referred to the language which is now known as [[Ido (language)|Ido]]. The word ''Esperantido'' is derived from ''Esperanto'' plus the affix ''-id-'' (''-ido''), which means a "child (''born to a parent''), young (''of an animal'') or offspring" (''ido''). Hence, ''Esperantido'' literally means an "offspring or descendant of Esperanto".

A number of Esperantidos have been created to address a number of perceived flaws or weaknesses in Esperanto, or in other Esperantidos, attempting to improve their [[Esperanto vocabulary|lexicon]], [[Esperanto grammar|grammar]], [[Esperanto phonology|pronunciation]], and [[Esperanto orthography|orthography]]. Others were created as language games or to add variety to [[Esperanto literature]].

==Language reforms==
These attempted improvements were intended to replace Esperanto. Limited suggestions for improvement within the framework of Esperanto, such as orthographic reforms and [[riism]], are not considered Esperantidos.{{refn|Some of the more common letter substitutions are:&lt;ref name="Pitt1987"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j5/lords.php#esp |title=The Spelling of Esperanto |work=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society |date=1987 |page=13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309185238/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j5/lords.php#esp |archive-date=9 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |first=Arnold D. N. |last=Pitt |volume=5 |issue=2 |issn=0950-9585 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The English and French values of ''ts'', ''w'', and ''y'' for ''c'', ''ŭ'', and ''j'', and either English ''zh'' and ''j'' or French ''j'' and ''dj'' for ''ĵ'' and ''ĝ''
*''X'' for ''ĥ'', reflecting its use in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]; other proposals [[Esperanto phonology#Loss of phonemic ĥ|follow common usage]] and eliminate the rare letter ''ĥ'' entirely, and use ''x'' for ''ks'' and ''kz''
*''Qu'' for ''kv''
*Single letters for the fricatives and digraphs for the affricates. Generally in such proposals ''j'' and ''dj'' stand in for ''ĵ'' and ''ĝ'' ({{IPAblink|ʒ}} and {{IPAblink|dʒ|}}). For ''ŝ'' and ''ĉ'' ({{IPAblink|ʃ}} and {{IPAblink|tʃ|}}), there are two principal approaches, either ''c'' or ''x'' for ''ŝ'' and therefore either ''tc'' or ''tx'' for ''ĉ.'' The ''c, tc'' approach is reminiscent of French ''ch, tch'' for the same values, while the ''x, tx'' approach is found in [[Basque language|Basque]] and to a lesser extent in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (with ''tx'' in native Brazilian names).}}

===Mundolinco===
{{Main|Mundolinco}}
''Mundolinco'' (1888) was the first Esperantido, created in 1888. Changes from Esperanto include combining the adjective and adverb under the suffix ''-e'', loss of the accusative and adjectival agreement, changes to the verb conjugations, eliminating the diacritics, and bringing the vocabulary  closer to Latin, for example with superlative ''-osim-'' to replace the Esperanto particle ''plej'' "most".

===Reformed Esperanto===
{{Main|Reformed Esperanto}}
Zamenhof himself proposed [[Reformed Esperanto|several changes in the language]] in 1894, which were rejected by the Esperanto community and subsequently abandoned by Zamenhof himself.

===Ido===
{{Ido sidebar |expanded=Related}}
{{Main|Ido language}}
[[Ido (language)|Ido]] (1907), the foremost of the Esperantidos, sought to bring Esperanto into closer alignment with Western European expectations of an ideal language, based on familiarity with [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Reforms included changing the spelling by removing non-[[Roman alphabet|Roman]] letters such as ''ĉ'' and re-introducing the [[k/q dichotomy]]; removing a couple of the more obscure phonemic contrasts (one of which, {{IPA|[x]}}, has been [[Esperanto phonology#Loss of phonemic ĥ|effectively removed]] from standard Esperanto); ending the infinitives in ''-r'' and the plurals in ''-i'' like Italian; eliminating adjectival agreement, and removing the need for the accusative case by setting up a fixed default word order; reducing the amount of inherent gender in the vocabulary, providing a masculine suffix and an [[epicene]] third-person singular pronoun; replacing the pronouns and correlatives with  forms more similar to the [[Romance languages]]; adding new roots where Esperanto uses the [[antonym]]ic prefix ''mal-''; replacing much of Esperanto's other regular derivation with separate roots, which are thought to be easier for Westerners to remember; and replacing much of the Germanic and Slavic vocabulary with Romance forms, such as ''navo'' for English-derived ''ŝipo''. See the [[#idopatronia|Ido ''Pater noster'' below]].

Ido spawned its own idos, the first being [[Adjuvilo]] (1908), which was created by an Esperantist to sow dissent in the Ido community.

===Saussure===
[[René de Saussure]] (brother of linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]) published numerous Esperantido proposals, starting with a response to Ido later called ''Antido 1'' ("Anti-Ido 1") in 1907, which increasingly diverged from Esperanto before finishing with a more conservative [[Esperanto II]] in 1937. Esperanto II replaced ''j'' with ''y'', ''kv'' with ''q'', ''kz'' with ''x'', and diacritic letters with ''j'' (''ĵ'' and ''ĝ''), ''w'' (''ŭ''), and digraphs ''sh'' (''ŝ''), ''ch'' (''ĉ''); replaced the passive in ''-iĝ-'' with ''-ev-'', the indefinite ending ''-aŭ'' with adverbial ''-e'', the accusative ''-on'' on nouns with ''-u'', and the plural on nouns with ''-n'' (so ''membrun'' for ''membrojn'' "members"); dropped adjectival agreement; broke up the table of concords, changed other small grammatical words such as ''ey'' for ''kaj'' "and", and treated pronouns more like nouns, so that the plural of ''li'' "he" is ''lin'' rather than ''ili'' "they", and the accusative of ''ĝi'' "it" is ''ju''.

===Romániço===
{{main|Romániço}}
Romániço (1991) is designed to be more intuitive for native speakers of English. It replaces vocabulary and some grammar with Romance constructions, allows a somewhat more irregular orthography, and eliminates some criticized points such as case, adjectival agreement, verbal inflection for tense and mood, and inherent gender, but retains the ''o, a, e'' suffixes for parts of speech and an agglutinative morphology. It is intended as a compromise between Esperanto and naturalistic conlangs such as Interlingua.

===Esperanto sen Fleksio===
''Esperanto sen Fleksio'' (Esperanto without inflexion),&lt;ref name="herezono"&gt;[http://www.herezono.com/esperanto_sen_fleksio.html Esperanto sen fleksio]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed under this name by Richard Harrison in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Kennaway, Richard; [http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.html Some Internet resources relating to constructed languages]; 7 January 2005; retrieved on 29 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allverbs.com/language.php?id=63213 Esperanto sen Fleksio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331043434/http://www.allverbs.com/language.php?id=63213 |date=2008-03-31 }}; Allverbs; retrieved on 29 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://languages.miensk.com/Lang_other/Artificial/Artificial1.htm МОВЫ СВЕТУ]; Languages of the world; retrieved on 29 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but based on long-term complaints from Asian Esperantists, is an experimental and unfinished proposal for a morphologically reduced variety of Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Daughters of Esperanto |first=Alan  |last=Libert |publisher=Lincom |year=2008 |isbn=978-3895867484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main changes are:&lt;ref name="Harrison2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rickharrison.com/language/esf.html |title=Esperanto sen Fleksio |work=Artificial Language Lab |date=2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230530/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/esf.html |archive-date=16 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |first=Rick |last=Harrison |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Desquilbet2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jerome.desquilbet.org/pages/256/ |title=Esperanto sen Fleksio |work= |date=25 November 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004180658/http://jerome.desquilbet.org/pages/256/ |archive-date=4 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |first=Jérôme |last=Desquilbet |language=fr |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Loss of the [[plural]] (the suffix ''-j),'' except in the new plural definite article ''laj'' (short for ''la jo'') and possibly in a plural accusative preposition ''naj''; singular number is marked by ''unu'' or ''la'', plural by the new words ''jo'' and ''laj'' (''la jo'') (and maybe ''naj'')
*Replacement of the [[accusative case]] (the suffix ''-n)'' with either subject–verb–object word order or with a new preposition ''na'' for other word orders
*Loss of [[verb tense]]: past, present, and future are all subsumed under the [[infinitive verb|infinitive]] ending ''-i'', though the imperative, conditional, and a single active and passive participle (''-anta'' and ''-ita'') remain
*Shift from copula-plus-adjective to verb, for example ''boni'' instead of ''esti bona''

In an earlier version, the letter ''ŭ'' was replaced with ''w'', but the more recent version uses the same alphabet as regular Esperanto.&lt;ref name="herezono" /&gt;

===Poliespo===
{{Main|Poliespo}}
While most Esperantidos aim to simplify Esperanto, ''[[Poliespo]]'' ("[[polysynthetic]] Esperanto", {{circa|1993}}) makes it considerably more complex. Besides the polysynthetic morphology, it incorporates much of the phonology and vocabulary of the [[Cherokee language]]. It has fourteen vowels, six of them [[nasal vowel|nasalized]], and three [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s.

==Esperantidos for amusement==
There are also extensions of Esperanto created primarily for amusement.

===Universal===
{{Main|Universal (Esperantido)}}
One of the more interesting Esperantidos, grammatically, is ''Universal'' (1923–1928).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~iad/univers.html Universal ]&lt;/ref&gt; It adds a [[schwa]] to break up consonant clusters, marks the accusative case with a nasal vowel, has [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive pronouns]], uses partial [[reduplication]] for the plural (''tablo'' "table", ''tatablo'' "tables"), and inversion for [[antonym]]s (''mega'' "big", ''gema'' "little"; ''donu'' "give", ''nodu'' "receive"; ''tela'' "far", ''leta'' "near"). Inversion can be seen in:
::''Al gefinu o fargu kaj la egnifu o grafu.''
::He finished reading [''&lt;abbr title="literally"&gt;lit&lt;/abbr&gt;''. 'to read'] and she started to write.

The antonyms are ''al'' "he" and ''la'' "she" (compare ''li'' "s/he"), the ''ge-'' (completive) and ''eg-'' (inchoative) [[aspect (linguistics)|aspects]], ''fin-'' "to finish" and ''nif-'' "to begin", and ''graf-'' "to write" and ''farg-'' "to read".

The ''Universal'' reduplicated plural and inverted antonyms are reminiscent of the musical language [[Solresol]].

===Esperant’===
''Esperant’'' ({{circa|1998}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeuw.org/esperant/esperant.html |title=Lernu je Esperant' |publisher=Meeuw.org |date=1999-05-17 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a style of speech that twists but does not quite violate the grammar of Esperanto.

The changes are morphological:
* The nominal suffix ''-o'' is removed, as in poetry. ''Knabo'' becomes ''knab’.''
* The plural ending ''-oj'' is replaced with the collective suffix ''-ar-.'' ''Knaboj'' becomes ''knabar’.''
* Adjectives lose their ''-a'' suffixes and combine with their head nouns. ''Bela knabino'' becomes ''belknabin’.''
* In direct objects, the accusative suffix ''-n'' is replaced with the preposition ''je.'' ''Knabon'' becomes ''je knab’.''
* Verbs become nouns, and their erstwhile tense and mood suffixes move elsewhere:
**This may be an adverb or [[prepositional phrase]]: ''donu hodiaŭ'' becomes ''hodiaŭu don’,'' and ''estas en la ĉielo'' becomes ''est’ ĉielas.''
**If the verb contains a [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] suffix, this may detach from the verb: ''fariĝu'' becomes ''iĝu far’.''
**If none of these options is available, ''jen'' may be used as a placeholder: ''amas'' becomes ''jenas am’.'' The choice of where the tense suffix ends up is largely a stylistic choice.
* Subjects of the erstwhile verb take the preposition ''de'' if nouns, or become possessives if pronouns: ''knabo amas'' becomes ''am’ de knab’,'' and ''kiu estas'' becomes ''kies est’.''
* The article ''la'' becomes ''l’'' whenever the preceding word ends in a vowel.

Example:
:Boys love the pretty girl.

:Esperanto: Knab&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;oj&lt;/span&gt; am&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; la bel&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; knabin&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;.

:''Esperant’:'' &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;Jen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; am&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;’ de&lt;/span&gt; knab&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;ar’ je&lt;/span&gt; l&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt; belknabin&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;.

Literally, "Behold (the) love of group of boys to the pretty-girl."

See the [[#esperantnipatr|Esperant’ ''Pater noster'' below]].

==Esperanto specializations==
There are various projects to adapt Esperanto to specialized uses. ''[[Esperanto de DLT]]'' (1983) is one; it was an adaptation of Esperanto as a [[pivot language]] for [[machine translation]].

==Esperantidos used in literature==
Esperanto has little in the way of the [[slang]], [[dialect]]ical variation, or [[archaism]]s found in natural languages. Several authors have felt a need for such variation, either for effect in original literature, or to translate such variation from national literature.

===Dialects ===
Occasionally, reform projects have been used by Esperanto authors to play the role of dialects, for example standard Esperanto and Ido to translate a play written in two dialects of Italian. 

=== La Sociolekta Triopo ===
Halvelik (1973) created ''[[:eo:Popido|Popido]]'' ("Popular Idiom") to play the role of a substandard [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of Esperanto that, among other things, does away with much of Esperanto's inflectional system. For example, standard Esperanto

:''[[Film Noir|Redonu al tiu viro lian pafilon]].''
:"Give that man back his gun."

is in Popido,

:''Redonu al tu vir la pistol.''
("la" is the Popido equivalent of "lia"; the article in Popido is "lo")

In 1969, he published part I of the Sociolekto Triopo, [[Arcaicam Esperantom|Arkaika Esperanto]] to serve as equivalent to [[Middle English]], [[Middle High German]] and the like.

A [[slang]] completes the trio, called '''[[:eo:Gavaro|Gavaro]]'''.

===Archaism and Arcaicam Esperantom===
[[Proto-Esperanto]] would theoretically fulfill the need for archaism, but too little survives for it to be used extensively. In 1931 [[Kalman Kalocsay]] published a translation&lt;ref name="Kalocsay"&gt;''[http://www.angelfire.com/mo2/bulteno/1199.html#4 Elektronika Bulteno de EASL]'' includes the short story ''La Mezepoka Esperanto'' from ''Lingvo Stilo Formo'', 2nd cheap edition, [[Kalman Kalocsay]], Budapest, [[Literatura Mondo]], 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]], the first Hungarian text (12th century), in which he created fictitious archaic forms as though Esperanto were a Romance language deriving from [[Vulgar Latin]].

[[Manuel Halvelik]] went further in 1969 with a book on ''[[Arcaicam Esperantom]],'' where he laid out the grammar of a fictitious ancestor of modern Esperanto. It echoes Proto-Esperanto in a more complex set of inflections, including [[dative case|dative]] and [[genitive case]]s ending in ''-d'' and ''-es'' and separate verbal inflections for person and number, as well as "retention" of [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s such as ''ph'' and ''tz,'' writing ''c'' for {{IPA|[k]}}, and the use of the letters ''q'', ''y'', ''w''.

==Comparison of Esperanto, Ido, ''Esperant''', and ''Arcaicam Esperantom''==
The Esperanto [[Lord's Prayer|Pater noster]] follows, compared to the Ido, ''Esperant’'' and ''Arcaicam Esperantom'' versions.

The '''European Second Language Association''' or simply EuroSLA is a society for researchers with an interest in [[second language]] and [[second language acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosla.org/|title=EuroSLA - European Second Language Association|date=31 August 2018|publisher=EuroSLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
EuroSLA was established in [[Colchester]], [[the United Kingdom]], in 1989 and the first meeting was held by [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]], who was also the first president of the society. The subsequent meeting was held in [[Ksiaz]], [[Poland]], in 1990, and the first annual conference took place in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], in 1991

The EUROSLA 26 was held at the [[University of Jyväskylä]], Finland in 2016. The keynote speakers were [[Søren Eskildsen]], [[Ofelia García]], [[Ari Huhta]], and [[Marjolijn Verspoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jyu.fi/en/congress/eurosla26|title=EuroSLA 26|date=31 August 2018|publisher=University of Jyväskylä}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President in 2018  is [[Danijela Trenkić]] of the [[University of York]]

An '''expletive''' is a word or phrase inserted into a sentence that is not needed to express the basic meaning of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt; Svenonius, Peter. ''Subjects, Expletives, and the EPP''.

In these examples ''In fact'' and ''indeed'' are expletives:

==Profanity==
The word "expletive" is also commonly defined as a [[profanity]] or curse word, apart from its grammatical function.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, E.S.C. editor.  Simpson, J. A. editor. "Expletive". ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press; Subsequent edition 1991. {{ISBN|978-0198612582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Do" as an expletive==
At the start of the modern English era the use of the word “do” as an expletive came into fashion with no fixed principle guiding it. It began to appear often in phrases such as "they do hunt" (rather than "they hunt"), and the practice was slow to fade from use. The lingering and indiscriminate use of the expletive “do” lent a point to [[Alexander Pope|Alexander Pope’s]] jibe (which contains an example of "do" as an expletive):&lt;ref&gt;Lounsbury, Thomas R.  "Expletives and Non Expletives". ''Harpers Monthly Magazine'', volume 115, 1907.  p. 710-716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Astley Cooper.

==Expletive negation==
Expletive negation is a term that originated in French language studies. It refers to a sentence construction that contains one or more negations that, from a modern perspective, seem superfluous. An example is the “double-negative” in: "Nobody never lifted a finger to help her."  Expletive negation is a standard usage in [[Old English]], and in [[Middle English]], as in this sentence, where, from a modern perspective, "not" and the negative marker "ne" seem to be not required:&lt;ref&gt;Lyeiri, Yoko.

=="Expletive deleted"==
{{Main|Expletive deleted}}
The popularity of the phrase "expletive deleted" derives from the [[Watergate hearings]] in the United States in the 1970s, where the phrase was used to replace profanity that occurred in the transcripts of conversations that were recorded in the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Bryan. ''Garner's Modern American Usage''. Oxford University Press, USA, 2009. p. 337 {{ISBN|9780195382754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word expletive for a profanity did not begin in the 1970s; an early example occurs in a sermon by [[Isaac Barrow]] published in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, E.S.C. editor.  Simpson, J. A. editor. "Expletive". ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press; Subsequent edition 1991. {{ISBN|978-0198612582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:" … his oaths are no more than waste and insignificant words, deprecating being taken for serious, or to be understood that he meaneth anything by them, but only that he useth them as expletive phrases … to plump his speech, and fill up sentences."

==Syntactic expletive==
{{Main|Syntactic expletive}}
A syntactic expletive is a term used in formal linguistic theories. It is a term for a pronoun that is used at the start of a sentence or clause when the referent is not immediately known, but an argument for the verb is syntactically required. The basic meaning of the clause is made explicit after the verb. Common forms of construction for sentences that contain a syntactic expletive begin with "it is", "here is", or "there is". The expletive serves as the grammatical subject of the independent clause that it begins. In a clause like “it is raining” the referent of the pronoun “it” is not obvious, and is the subject of discussion and alternate theories among linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, Mercedes Tubino. ''Causatives in Minimalism.'' John Benjamins Publishing, 2011. p. 103. {{ISBN|9789027255624}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author: The New York Times. ''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge: A Desk Reference for the Curious Mind''. Macmillan, 2004. p. 780. {{ISBN|9780312313678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Bryan.  ''Oxford Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage.'' Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 341. {{ISBN|9780195142365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactic expletives have great significance in the study of the history of languages and cross-cultural comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Vergnaud, J. R. &amp; Zubizarreta, M. L. 1992. "The definite determiner and the inalienable constructions in French and in English". ''Linguistic Inquiry''. 23(4). MIT Press.  pp. 595-652.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is distinct from the expletives of traditional grammar in that a syntactic expletive has a particular syntactical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Longobardi, Guiseppe. 1994. "Reference and proper names". ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 25. MIT Press. pp. 609-665.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple examples of syntactic expletives are the words ''it'' and ''there'':

:*It is a hammer that is needed.

:*There are hammers in the toolbox.

Expletive, pleonastic, or dummy subjects have been crucial to syntactic argumentation. Their lack of semantic content, and their staunch grammatical aspect provide a method to explore differences between syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt; Svenonius, Peter.

In [[filmmaking]], [[video production]], [[animation]], and related fields, a '''frame''' is one of the many still images which compose the complete ''moving picture''. The term is derived from the fact that, from the beginning of modern filmmaking toward the end of the 20th century, and in many places still up to the present, the single images have been recorded on a strip of [[photographic film]] that quickly increased in length, historically; each image on such a strip looks rather like a framed picture when examined individually.

The term may also be used more generally as a noun or verb to refer to the edges of the image as seen in a camera viewfinder or projected on a screen. Thus, the camera operator can be said to keep a car in frame by panning with it as it speeds past.

==Overview==
When the moving picture is displayed, each frame is flashed on a screen for a short time (nowadays, usually 1/24, 1/25 or 1/30 of a second) and then immediately replaced by the next one. [[Persistence of vision]] blends the frames together, producing the [[Optical illusions|illusion]] of a moving image. 

The frame is also sometimes used as a unit of time, so that a momentary event might be said to last six frames, the actual duration of which depends on the [[frame rate]] of the system, which varies according to the video or film standard in use. In North America and Japan, 30 frames per s:) (fps) is the broadcast standard, with 24 frames/s now common in production for high-definition video shot to look like film. In much of the rest of the world, 25 frames/s is standard. 

In systems historically based on [[NTSC]] standards, for reasons originally related to the Chromilog NTSC TV systems, the exact frame rate is actually (3579545 / 227.5) / 525 = 29.97002616 fps.{{efn|In actual practice, the master oscillator is 14.31818 MHz, which is divided by 4 to give the 3.579545 MHz color "burst" frequency, which is further divided by 455 to give the 31468.5275 KHz "equalizing pulse" frequency, this is further divided by 2 toorizontal line rate), the "equalizing pulse" frequency is divided by 525 to give the 59.9401 Hz "vertical drive" frequency, and this is further divided by 2 to give the 29.9700 vertical frame rate. "Equalizing pulses" perform two essential functions: 1) their use during the vertical retrace interval allows for the vertical synch to be more effectively separated from the horizontal synch, as these, along with the video itself, are an example of "in band" signaling, and 2) by alternately including or excluding one "equalizing pulse", the required half-line offset necessary for interlaced video may be accommodated.}} This leads to many synchronization problems which are unknown outside the NTSC world, and also brings about hacks such as [[drop-frame timecode]].

In film projection, 24 fps is the norm, except in some special venue systems, such as [[IMAX]], [[Showscan]] and [[Iwerks&amp;nbsp;70]], where 30, 48 or even 60 frame/s have been used. Silent films and [[8 mm film|8&amp;nbsp;mm]] amateur movies used 16 or 18 frame/s.

== Physical film frames ==

In a strip of movie film, individual frames are separated by [[frame line]]s. Normally, 24 frames are needed for one [[second]] of film. In ordinary filming, the frames are photographed automatically, one after the other, in a [[movie camera]]. In [[special effects]] or [[animation]] filming, the frames are often shot one at a time.

The size of a film frame varies, depending on the [[film format|still film format]] or the [[List of film formats|motion picture film format]]. In the smallest [[8 mm film|8 mm]] amateur format for motion pictures film, it is only about 4.8 by 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm, while an [[IMAX]] frame is as large as 69.6 by 48.5&amp;nbsp;mm. The larger the frame size is in relation to the size of the [[projection screen]], the sharper the image will appear.

The size of the film frame of [[List of film formats|motion picture film]] also depends on the location of the holes, the size of the holes, the shape of the holes. and the location and type of sound stripe.

The most common film format, [[35 mm]], has a frame size of 36 by 24&amp;nbsp;mm when used in a still 35&amp;nbsp;mm camera where the film moves horizontally, but the frame size varies when used for motion picture where the film moves vertically (with the exception of [[VistaVision]] and [[Technirama]] where the film moves horizontally). Using a [[4-perf pulldown]], there are exactly 16 frames in one foot of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, leading to film frames sometimes being counted in terms of "[[feet and frames]]". The maximum frame size is 18 by 24&amp;nbsp;mm, (silent/full aperture), but this is significantly reduced by the application of sound track(s). A system called [[KeyKode]] is often used to identify specific physical film frames in a production.

== Video frames ==
Historically, video frames were represented as [[analog waveform]]s in which varying voltages represented the intensity of light in an analog [[raster scan]] across the screen. Analog [[blanking interval]]s separated video frames in the same way that frame lines did in film. For historical reasons, most systems used an [[interlaced scan]] system in which the frame typically consisted of two [[video field]]s sampled over two slightly different periods of time. This meant that a single video frame was usually not a good still picture of the scene, unless the scene being shot was completely still.

With the dominance of digital technology, modern video systems now represent the video frame as a rectangular [[raster scan|raster]] of [[pixel]]s, either in an RGB color space or a color space such as YCbCr, and the analog waveform is typically found nowhere other than in legacy I/O devices.

Standards for the digital video frame raster include [[Rec. 601]] for [[standard-definition television]] and [[Rec. 709]] for [[high-definition television]].

Video frames are typically identified using [[SMPTE time code]].

===Line and resolution===
{{See|Video}}
The frame is composed of picture elements just like a chess board.  Each horizontal set of picture elements is known as a [[line (video)|line]]. The picture elements in a line are transmitted as [[sine wave|sine]] signals where a pair of dots, one dark and one light can be represented by a single sine. The product of the number of lines and the number of maximum sine signals per line is known as the total resolution of the frame. The higher the resolution the more faithful the displayed image is to the original image. But higher resolution introduces technical problems and extra cost. So a compromise should be reached in system designs both for satisfactory image quality and affordable price.

===Viewing distance===

The key parameter to determine the lowest resolution still satisfactory to viewers is the viewing distance, i.e. the distance between the eyes and the monitor. The total resolution is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. If '''d''' is the distance, '''r''' is the required minimum resolution and '''k''' is the proportionality constant which depends on the size of the monitor;

:&lt;math&gt; r = k^2 \cdot  \frac{1}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the number of lines is approximately proportional to the resolution per line, the above relation can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt; n = k \cdot  \frac{1}{d} &lt;/math&gt;
where '''n''' is the number of lines. That means that the required resolution is proportional to the height of the monitor and inversely proportional to the viewing distance.

===Moving picture===

In moving picture (TV) the number of frames scanned per second is known as the frame rate. The higher the frame rate, the better the sense of motion. But again, increasing the frame rate introduces technical difficulties. So the frame rate is fixed at 25 ([[CCIR System B|System B/G]]) or 29.97 ([[CCIR System M|System M]]). To increase the sense of motion it is customary to scan the very same frame in two consecutive phases. In each phase only half of the lines are scanned; only the lines with odd numbers in the first phase and only the lines with even numbers in the second phase. Each scan is known as a [[Field (video)|field]]. So the field rate is two times the frame rate.

===Example (System B)===
{{Main article|CCIR System B}}
In system B  the number of lines is 625 and the frame rate is 25. The maximum video bandwidth is 5&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;''Reference Data for Radio Engineers'', ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum number of sine signals the system is theorically capable of transmitting is given as follows:

The system is able to transmit 5 000 000 sine signals in a second. Since the frame rate is 25,  the maximum number of sine signals per frame is 200 000. Dividing this number by the number of lines gives the maximum number of sine signals in a line which is 320. (Actually about 19% of each line is devoted to auxiliary services. So the number of maximum useful sine signals is about 260.)

==Still frame==
[[File:Interview Wikivoyage ohne Abspann.webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|A badly chosen still can give a misleading impression.]]
[[File:Interview Wikivoyage ohne Abspann.webm|thumb|thumbtime=58|A better preview for the same video.]]
A '''still frame''' is a single static [[image]] taken from a [[film]] or [[video]], which are kinetic (moving) images. Still frames are also called '''freeze frame''', video prompt, preview or misleadingly [[thumbnail]], [[Key frame|keyframe]], poster frame,&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft: [//office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/add-a-poster-frame-to-your-video-HA010375851.aspx Add a poster frame to your video], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indezine: [http://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/multimedia/add-poster-frame-for-video-ppt2010.html Poster Frames for Videos in PowerPoint 2010 for Windows], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Screenshot|screen shot/grab/capture/dump]]. Freeze frames are widely used on [[Online video platform|video platforms]] and in video galleries, to show viewers a preview or a [[Teaser campaign|teaser]]. Many video platforms have a standard to display a frame from mid-time of the video. Some platforms offer the option to choose a different frame individually.&lt;ref&gt;Vimeo: [//vimeo.com/help/faq/managing-your-videos/video-settings#how-do-i-change-the-thumbnail-of-my-video How do I change the thumbnail of my video?], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MyVideo: [//www.myvideo.de/Community/Mein_Profil/Meine_Videos/Mein_Video_bearbeiten Editing my video], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Video and film artists sometimes use still frames within the video/film to achieve [[special effect]]s, like [[freeze-frame shot]]s or [[still motion]].&lt;ref&gt;Willie Witte: [//vimeo.com/64686559 SCREENGRAB], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investigations ===
For criminal investigations it has become a frequent use to publish still frames from [[surveillance]] videos in order to identify suspect persons and to find more witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Wistv: [http://www.wistv.com/story/19627198/two-weekend-assault-cases-in-five-points-under-investigation Assaults, shooting in Five Points under investigation], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Videos of the 9/11 attacks have been often discussed frame-by-frame for various interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Onebornfree: [http://www.onebornfrees911researchreview.blogspot.de/2012/11/total-911-video-fakery-versus-richard.html?_escaped_fragment_#! 9/11 Research Review], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; For medical diagnostics it is very useful to watch still frames of [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] videos.&lt;ref&gt;Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications: [http://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=2516443_umj7702-127-f3&amp;req=4 A classic diagnosis with a new ‘spin’], retrieved 29 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth wall usage==

Some humor in animation is based on the [[fourth wall]] aspect of the film frame itself, with some animation showing characters leaving what is assumed to be the edge of the film or the film malfunctioning. This latter one is used often in films as well.
This hearkens back to some early cartoons, where characters were aware that they were in a cartoon, specifically that they could look at the credits and be aware of something that isn't part of the story as presented. These jokes include:
* Split frames – Where the ''fourth wall'' is broken by two frames, the lower half of the previous frame and the upper part of the next frame, showing at once, usually showing [[frame line]]s, with jokes involving them including a character crossing the frame itself.
* ''Film break'' – A famous form of the joke, where the film either snaps or is deliberately broken, with often the ''fourth wall'' coming into play during this period when, rightfully, there should be nothing on screen.
* ''Gate hair'' – A famous form of joke where the animator intentionally places fake "gate hairs" within the frame, which one of the animated characters plucks and removes from the frame.
* Editorial marks – Where those marks which an editor would normally employ on a [[Workprint|"work print"]] to indicate the intended presence of a fade or a dissolve or a "wipe" to the SFX department are animated, and the film follows suit, or doesn't, depending upon the intended effect.
* Cue marks – Where those marks, usually circular for non-Technicolor titles and "serrated" for Technicolor titles to indicate a reel changeover are animated for a humorous effect. This could also be employed for the famous [[False_ending#Examples|"false ending"]] effect, employed even today in popular songs. For ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', the cue marks for the reel changes of the ''Nation's Pride'' pseudo-documentary employed exceptionally large scribed circles with a large "X" scribed within it—marks which would never be utilized in actual editorial practice (motor and changover cue marks are supposed to be clearly visible to the projectionist, but not obvious to the audience).
* Exiting the frame – This joke, an extension of the split frames joke, has characters depart from the sides of the frame, sometimes finding themselves falling out of the cartoon entirely.

It should not be confused with [[São Tomean Portuguese]], the non-creolised form of Portuguese spoken in São Tomé and Príncipe, also spoken by majority of São Toméans.

== History ==

São Tomé is an island of the Gulf of Guinea, discovered by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the 15th century. It was uninhabited at the time, but Portuguese settlers used the island as a center of the [[slavery|slave]] trade, and there was a need for slaves in the island. Since both parties needed to communicate, a [[pidgin]] was formed. The substrate languages were from the [[Bantu language|Bantu]] and [[Kwa language|Kwa]] groups. This pidgin then became fixed ([[creole language|creolized]]) as it became the mother language of children born from Portuguese men and African women slaves. Mixed marriages were then encouraged by the Portuguese Crown, for the sake of settlement.

Later because of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[France|French]] pressure to gain the island, many Portuguese settlers left. Children of Portuguese and black women were, eventually, not considered African or slaves; some were considered full right [[Portugal|Portuguese]] citizens. Those mixed-raced that did not have the status of Portuguese, those with darker skin, often gained a "forro" designation, because their Portuguese fathers did not want to enslave their children. The São Tomean Creole is mostly known as "Forro", the language of the freed slaves or Crioulo Santomense, not to be confused with [[São Tomean Portuguese]] (a variety and dialect of Portuguese in São Tomé and Príncipe). Portuguese is the main language for children until their early 20s, when they relearn Forro Creole. The rich São Tomean culture also preserves a unique mixture of Portuguese and African cultures.

== Classification and related languages ==

Forro is a [[creole language]] based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the [[superstrate]] language. The [[Substrate (linguistics)|substrate]] languages were from the [[Bantu language|Bantu]] and [[Kwa language|Kwa]] groups. It is most similar to [[Principense language|Principense Creole]], [[Angolar language|Angolar Creole]] and [[Annobonese language|Annobonese Creole]].

== Geographic distribution ==

Forro Creole is spoken mainly in [[São Tomé Island]] (most of it); there are some speakers in [[Principe Island]].

Due to their great similarity and historical derivation, Principe Island's [[Principense|Principense Creole]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]'s [[Annobonese language|Annobonese Creole]] may be regarded as dialects of Forro Creole. Forro's lexical similarity is 77% with Principense Creole, 62% with Fa d’Ambu Creole and 70% with Angolar Creole.

== Vocabulary ==

Although the São Tomean Creole had (and still has) a restricted contact with Portuguese (seen as a prestigious language), it did preserve a larger number of the substrate languages' elements, more than the creoles of Cape Verde. Roughly 93% of São Tomean Creole lexicon is from Portuguese and 7% of African origin. Most Forro Creole speakers also speak non-creolised Portuguese.

Although 95% of São Tomeans speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and it is the country's national language, Forro Creole is traditionally said to be spoken by 85% of the inhabitants of [[São Tomé Island]], or 81.7% of the country’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Jacques | last=Leclerc | title= São Tomé-et-Príncipe |date=23 November 2011 |url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/Sao-Tome-Principe.htm | work=L’aménagement linguistique dans le monde | language=French | accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, official census figures state that only 36.2%{{cn|date=September 2017}} of the population can speak Forro Creole, and the creole is now considered threatened.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

== Writing system ==

There is no standard [[orthography]].

== Examples ==

:Hello: ''Seja lovadu!'' (proposed: ''sejalovadu''); From [[Portuguese language|Port.]] {{lang|pt|seja louvado}}
:Good Morning: ''Bom dja ô'' (proposed: ''Bondja o''); From Port. {{lang|pt|bom dia}}
:Good Afternoon: ''Bos tadji ô'' (proposed: ''Boxtadji o''); From Port. {{lang|pt|boas tardes}} or {{lang|pt|boa tarde}}
:Good Evening: ''Boj notxi ô'' (proposed: ''Bojnotxi o''); From Port. {{lang|pt|boas noites}} or {{lang|pt|boa noite}}
:What's your name: ''Que nomi bo e?'' (proposed: ''Ke nomi bo e?''); possibly from Port. {{lang|pt|qual é o teu nome?}} or {{lang|pt|como te chamas?}} – compare with vernacular Brazilian Portuguese {{lang|pt|que nome você tem?}}
:My name's Pedro: ''Nomi mu sa Pedro''; possibly from Port. {{lang|pt|o meu nome é Pedro}}.

Not everything is from Portuguese:
:I live in Neves (São Tomean city): ''Nga-ta Tlaxa.'' (''-ta'' is from {{lang|pt|está}} and ''tlaxa'' is from {{lang|pt|praça}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10348">Since 2013, allegations have surfaced that the [[Garda Síochána]] (Ireland's national police force) has been involved in [[malpractice]], including allegations that members had inappropriately cancelled driving [[Point system (driving)|penalty points]], that the offices of the [[Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission]] (GSOC) had been bugged, revelations that telephone calls at Garda stations had been recorded for decades, the case of Jerry McGrath (who was convicted of murdering Sylvia Roche-Kelly in [[Limerick]] while on bail in 2007) and other allegations of serious Garda misconduct.

Garda Commissioner [[Martin Callinan]] resigned on the day news emerged that the potentially illegal phone recording had taken place at Garda stations for decades. He had been under pressure before then to withdraw remarks he had made an Oireactas (Parliamentary) committee that [[whistleblower]]s within the force, such as [[Maurice McCabe|Sergeant Maurice McCabe]] and [[John Wilson (Garda)|John Wilson]], were "disgusting".

Minister for Justice, [[Alan Shatter]], resigned after receipt of a report into the handling of Garda whistleblowers by the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána. A week previous to this, the [[Data Protection Commissioner]] found he had illegally revealed Garda information about a political opponent while debating the issue of cancelled penalty points live on national television.

Both men had been embroiled in a controversy at the beginning of 2014 regarding suspected bugging of GSOC.

A commission of investigation was set up into the recording of telephone calls at Garda stations. A report into allegations of misconduct raised by one of the whistleblowers substantially vindicated the whistleblowers position and was critical of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice.

A report into the suspected bugging of GSOC was dismissive two of the three anomalies discovered by GSOC. A third anomaly could not be explained but the report did not regard that as proof that bugging took place.

===Handling of Garda whistleblowers===
{{further|Garda whistleblower scandal}}

In September 2013, a report of the Irish [[Comptroller and Auditor General#Ireland|Comptroller and Auditor General]] said that significant revenue had been lost by the state owing to irregularities in the application of the [[Penalty points in Ireland|penalty points]] system for driving offences.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/timeline-martin-callinan-and-the-penalty-points-controversy-1.1737524 Timeline: Martin Callinan and the penalty points controversy], ''Irish Times'', 25 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Garda Commissioner, [[Martin Callinan]], appearing thefore the Public Accounts Committee of the [[Oireachtas]] (Irish legislature) on 23 January 2014, said there was no evidence that Gardaí had cancelled penalty points for relatives or friends.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Humphreys, [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/commissioner-says-no-evidence-of-garda%C3%AD-doing-favours-for-family-or-friends-1.1666159 Commissioner says no evidence of gardaí doing ‘favours’ for family or friends], ''Irish Times'', 24 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to two [[Whistleblower]]s, Garda [[Maurice McCabe]] and former Garda [[John Wilson (Garda)|John Wilson]], who had made allegations of widespread corruption with regard to penalty points, Callinan said, "Frankly, on a personal level, I think it’s quite disgusting.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/martin-callinan-evidence-to-the-pac-1278914-Jan2014/ ‘The facts as I know them’: 11 things we learned from Martin Callinan’s evidence to the PAC], ''The Journal'', 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; McCabe gave evidence in private to the Public Accounts Committee on 30 January.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0130/501040-pac-penalty-points/ Garda whistleblower gives evidence at PAC], RTÉ, 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A Garda Inspectorate report, published on 12 March 2014, said there were "consistent and widespread breaches of policy" in regard to penalty points.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Callinan came under increasing pressure to withdraw the "disgusting" remark, and resigned on 25 March 2014.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

An ''[[Irish Independent]]'' journalist, [[Gemma O'Doherty]], took an unfair dismissal claim against the newspaper, claiming she was sacked after visiting Callinan's home as part of her investigation into the penalty points controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Gartland, [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/former-independent-reporter-s-unfair-dismissal-case-adjourned-1.1790161 Former ‘Independent’ reporter’s unfair dismissal case adjourned], ''Irish Times'', 10 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice McCabe, in addition to his evidence on penalty points, made allegations of Garda misconduct on a number of other occasions. The government appointed a [[Senior Counsel]], Seán Guerin, to investigate these claims.&lt;ref&gt;Éanna Ó Caollaí and Fiach Kelly, [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/barrister-to-examine-whistleblower-s-claims-1.1704000 Barrister to examine whistleblower’s claims], ''Irish Times'', 25 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Guerin Report]], published on 9 May 2014, said that nine of the ten cases reported by McCabe merited investigation by a commission of enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Harry McGee, [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/guerin-report-exposes-shatter-s-shortcomings-1.1789938 Guerin report exposes Shatter’s shortcomings], ''Irish Times'', 9 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of GSOC surveillance===
{{further|2014 GSOC bugging scandal}}
On Sunday 9 February 2014, the Irish edition of ''The Sunday Times'' led with a story written by journalist John Mooney.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1373695.ece&lt;/ref&gt; In it he outlined how the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission had suspected that it was under surveillance. Mooney explained how GSOC had hired the services of a UK counter-surveillance firm, Verrimus, to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verrimus.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone recordings at Garda stations===

These were revealed in the wake of [[Martin Callinan]]'s resignation Tuesday 25 March 2014.

===Cavan-Monaghan allegations===
Eleven specific allegations of failure and malpractices in the Cavan-Monaghan Division of the Garda Síochána have been identified for investigation by Ireland's Minister for Justice. The most serious of these is to examine how a murderer was let out on bail after committing two other serious assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Harry|last=McGee|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/investigation-of-alleged-garda-malpractice-in-cavan-monaghan-1.2043765|title=Investigation of alleged Garda malpractice in Cavan-Monaghan|work=The Irish Times|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athlone allegations===
On 31 March 2015, [[Mick Wallace]] TD told the Dáil of “serious Garda malpractice’’ in the Athlone area. In 2012, a garda personally saw [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] in Castlebar and told him about malpractice "in relation to a certain superintendent". Wallace told the Taoiseach: "Later that same year you gave approval to the promotion of this superintendent to chief superintendent". This same chief superintendent was reported to be the subject of three different investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=O'Regan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/serious-garda-malpractice-in-athlone-claims-td-mick-wallace-1.2160333|title=‘Serious Garda malpractice’ in Athlone, claims TD Mick Wallace|work=The Irish Times|date=31 March 2015|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gopaldas Saxena 'Neeraj''' (popularly known as '''Niraj''' or '''Neeraj'''; 4 January 1925 – 19 July 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/yesterday-once-more/773695 | title=Yesterday Once More|date=9 April 2011 | newspaper=The Indian Express | accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Indian [[poet]] and [[author]] of [[Hindi literature]]. He was also a famous poet of Hindi [[Kavi sammelan]]. He was born in the village of Puravali near [[Mahewa]] of [[Etawah]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India on 4 January 1925. He wrote under the pen name "Neeraj". His style is easy to understand and considered to be high quality Hindi [[literature]]. He was awarded [[Padma Shri]] in 1991&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?233715|title=Padma Awards 2007|accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides writing, he earned his living teaching in a college and was a Professor of Hindi Literature in Dharma Samaj College, Aligarh.&lt;ref name="Gopal Das Indian Express"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lyricist and poet Gopal Das Saxena ‘Neeraj’ dies at 93 |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/lyricist-and-hindi-poet-gopal-das-saxena-neeraj-dies-at-93-5266798/ |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=indianexpress |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/gopaldas-neeraj-enters-his-nineties/article7231997.ece|title=Neeraj, once more|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his poems and songs have been used in Hindi movies and are considered famous. He wrote songs for several Hindi Movies and attained a unique position as a songwriter who wrote with equal facility in both [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].

In the television interview, Gopaldas Neeraj called himself an unlucky poet which led to his stopping himself from writing film songs and confining himself to just writing and getting his poems published. The reason for this mentioned by him was that at least two or three prominent Music Directors of the Hindi Film Industry for whom he wrote very successful and popular songs, had expired. He mentioned the death of Jaikishan of the music duo [[Shankar-Jaikishan]] as well as of [[S.D.Burman]] or Sachin Dev Burman, for both of whom he had written highly popular film songs. The deaths of these Music Directors when they as well as Gopaldas Neeraj were at the peak of their popularity, left him very depressed and he made a decision to quit the film industry. He used to perform in Hindi kavi sammelan until few days ago of his demise.&lt;ref name="Gopal Das Indian Express"/&gt;

As of 2012, Neeraj was the chancellor of [[Mangalayatan University]], Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2198289/Hindi-poets-SP-citadels-kick-row.html|title=Hindi poets from SP citadels kick up a row|accessdate=2013-03-01 | location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Piyush|last=Srivastava|date=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 2018 poet Gopaldas Neeraj died. He was 93 year old when he died.

'''Growth hacking''' is a process of rapid experimentation across marketing funnel, product development, sales segments, and other areas of the business to identify the most efficient ways to grow a business. A growth hacking team is made up of marketers, developers, engineers and product managers that specifically focus on building and engaging the user base of a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mltcreative.com/blog/b2b-marketing-buzzwords-growth-hacking-vs-inbound-marketing/|title=B2B Marketing Buzzwords: Growth Hacking Vs. Inbound Marketing - MLT Creative|website=MLT Creative|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth hackers often focus on low-cost alternatives to traditional marketing, e.g. using [[social media]], [[viral marketing]] or targeted advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://launchdfw.com/2015/01/05/do-you-have-a-personal-brand-or-a-house-of-cards/|title=Do You Have a Personal Brand, or a House of Cards?|last=Pelt|first=Mason|date=|website=LaunchDFW.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of buying advertising through more traditional [[media (communication)|media]] such as [[radio]], [[newspaper]], and [[television]].&lt;ref name="tnw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/05/05/the-actual-difference-between-growth-hacking-and-marketing-explained/ |title=Explained: The actual difference between growth hacking and marketing |author=Biyani, Gagan |publisher=The Next Web |date=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth hacking is particularly prevalent with [[Startup company|startups]], when the goal is rapid growth in the early-stages of launching a new product or service to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business2community.com/strategy/growth-hacking-not-01482607|title=Here is What Growth Hacking Is NOT|website=business2community.com|publisher=Business 2 Community|last1=Greetje|first1=den Holder|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth hacking may focus on lowering cost per customer acquisition, or it may focus on long-term sustainability as Mason Pelt points out in a 2015 article on SiliconANGLE.com "The goal of any marketing should be long-term sustainable growth, not just a short-term gain. Growth hacking is about optimization as well as lead generation. Imagine your business is a bucket and your leads are water. You don't want to pour water into a leaky bucket; it's a waste of money. That's why a true growth hacker would care about customer retention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/11/02/what-the-heck-is-growth-hacking/|title=What is growth hacking?|website=siliconangel.com|publisher=SiliconANGLE.com|last1=Pelt|first1=Mason|accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who specialize in growth hacking use various types of marketing and product iterations to rapidly test persuasive copy, email marketing, SEO and viral strategies, among other tools and techniques, with a goal of increasing conversion rates and achieving rapid growth of the user base. It can also involve online community management and social media outreach or highly personalized outreach to news outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.co/get-press-startup-2015-07|title=How to Get Press for Your Startup|last=Pelt|first=Mason|date=2015-07-01|website=tech.co|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve [[performance metric]]s such as driving customer acquisition and selling products.&lt;ref name="fastco1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3003888/everything-marketing-how-growth-hackers-redefine-game |title=Everything is Marketing: How Growth Hackers Redefine the Game |author=Holiday, Ryan |publisher=''Fast Company'' |date=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/02/defining-a-growth-hacker-three-common-characteristics/ |title=Defining a Growth Hacker: Three Common Characteristics |author=Ginn, Aaron |publisher=''TechCrunch'' |date=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some consider growth hacking a part of the online marketing ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aquo.in/what-is-growth-hacking/|title=What is Growth Hacking and Why it is Effective|last=|first=|date=2017-04-25|work=Digital Marketing for Start ups|access-date=2017-10-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Aquo Digital Agency|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as in many cases growth hackers are using techniques such as [[search engine optimization]], website analytics, [[content marketing]] and [[A/B testing]].

Product development is also heavily influenced by the growth hacker mindset. Instead of long development cycles followed by user testing.  Growth hackers start user testing with wireframes and sketches; validating ideas at every stage. A growth hacker in a product development role would start user testing in a coffee shop instead of a corporate [[usability lab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/22/stop-overthinking-ux-and-try-the-coffee-shop-test/|title=Stop overthinking UX and try the coffee shop test|last=Pelt|first=Mason|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Sean Ellis (entrepreneur)|Sean Ellis]] coined the term "''growth hacker''" in 2010.&lt;ref name=sellis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startup-marketing.com/where-are-all-the-growth-hackers/ |title=Find a Growth Hacker for Your Startup |author=Ellis, Sean |publisher=Startup-Marketing.com |date=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fastco2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3013859/the-secret-that-defines-marketing-now |title=The Secret That Defines Marketing Now |author=Holiday, Ryan |publisher=''Fast Company'' |date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[blog]] post, he defined a growth hacker as "''a person whose true north is growth.  Everything they do is scrutinized by its potential impact on scalable growth.''"&lt;ref name=sellis/&gt;  Andrew Chen introduced the term to a wider audience in a blog post titled, "Growth Hacker is the new VP Marketing" in which he defined the term and used the short term vacation rental platform Airbnb's integration of [[Craigslist]] as an example.&lt;ref name=tc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=chen1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/ |title=Growth Hacker is the new VP Marketing |author=Chen, Andrew |publisher=AndrewChen.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that growth hackers "''are a hybrid of marketer and coder, one who looks at the traditional question of 'How do I get customers for my product?' and answers with A/B tests, landing pages, viral factor, email deliverability, and Open Graph.''"&lt;ref name=fastco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=chen1/&gt; In 2012, [[Aaron Ginn]] defined a growth hacker on ''[[TechCrunch]]'' as a "mindset of data, creativity, and curiosity."&lt;ref name=tc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=aginnt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aginnt.com/growth-hacker/ |title=What is a growth hacker? |author=Ginn, Aaron |publisher=Aginnt.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book "Growth Hacking", Chad Riddersen and Raymond Fong define a Growth Hacker as "a highly resourceful and creative marketer singularly focused on high leverage growth" &lt;ref name=ghbook&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riddersen |first1=Chad |last2=Fong |first2=Raymond |date=1 January 2017 |title=Growth Hacking: Silicon Valley's Best Kept Secret |url= |location=USA |publisher=Lioncrest Publishing |page= |isbn=978-1619616004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second annual (2013) "Growth Hackers Conference" was held in [[San Francisco]] set up by [[Gagan Biyani]].&lt;ref name=vbcon&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/05/10/6-important-lessons-from-this-years-growth-hacker-conference/ |title=6 important lessons from this year's Growth Hacker Conference |author=Griggs, William |publisher=Venture Beat |date=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured growth hackers from LinkedIn, Twitter, and [[YouTube]] among others.&lt;ref name=vbcon/&gt;
In 2015, Sean Ellis and [[Everette Taylor]] created GrowthHackers - the largest website community dedicated to growth hacking and now host the annual GrowthHackers Conference.

==Methods==
To combat this lack of money and experience, growth hackers approach marketing with a focus on innovation, scalability, and user connectivity.&lt;ref name="tc3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/21/defining-a-growth-hacker-building-growth-into-your-team/ |title=Defining a Growth Hacker: Building Growth Into Your Team |author=Ginn, Aaron |publisher=''TechCrunch'' |date=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tnw2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2012/10/28/build-it-and-they-wont-come-how-and-why-growth-hacking-came-to-be/ |title=Build it and they won’t come: How and why growth hacking came to be |author=Ginn, Aaron |publisher=The Next Web |date=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth hacking does not, however, separate product design and product effectiveness from marketing.&lt;ref name="med"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/68b4a602def6 |title=Here's Some Marketing Advice: Your Product Is Terrible |author=Holiday, Ryan |publisher=Medium.com |date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/20/defining-a-growth-hacker-growth-is-not-a-marketing-strategy/ |title=Defining A Growth Hacker: Growth Is Not A Marketing Strategy |author=Ginn, Aaron |publisher=''TechCrunch'' |date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth hackers build the product's potential growth, including user acquisition, on-boarding, monetization, retention, and virality, into the product itself.&lt;ref name="chasejarvisint"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/2013/02/from-obscurity-to-internet-sensation-how-creatives-can-win-the-pr-game-interview-with-ryan-holiday/ |title=From Obscurity to Internet Sensation — How Creatives Can Win the PR Game with Ryan Holiday |author=Jarvis, Chase |publisher=ChaseJarvis.com |date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Fast Company'' used Twitter "''Suggested Users List''" as example: "This was Twitter's real secret: It built marketing into the product rather than building infrastructure to do a lot of marketing."&lt;ref name="fastco2" /&gt; However growth hacking isn't always free. [[TechCrunch]] shared several nearly free growth hacks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/04/three-nearly-free-growth-hacks/|title=3 Nearly Free Growth Hacks|last=Pelt|first=Mason|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that growth hacking is effective marketing and not mythical marketing pixie dust. As new tools(SaaS) come out specifically that focus on more advanced forms of Growth Hacking, more and more tools are being offered as free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wizardcreativelabs.com/25-growth-hacking-tools-that-pros-use/|title=Growth Hacking tools that the Pros use|last=Taylor-Smith|first=David|date=|website=www.wizardcreativelabs.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart of growth hacking is the relentless focus on growth as the only metric that truly matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Sean|title=Sean Ellis On Growth|url=https://medium.com/growth-hacker/sean-ellis-on-growth-7d620cf4875f|website=medium.com|publisher=Medium|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Zuckerberg had this mindset while growing Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kagan|first1=Noah|title=How My Blog Homepage Redesign Increased Email Signups By 300%|url=http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/homepage-redesign-increase-email-signups|website=blog.hubspot.com|publisher=Hubspot|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact methods vary from company to company and from one industry to the next, the common denominator is always growth. Companies that have successfully "growth hacked" usually have a viral loop naturally built into their onboarding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Andrew|title=What's Your Viral Loop? Understanding The Engine Of Adoption|url=http://andrewchen.co/2007/07/11/whats-your-viral-loop-understanding-the-engine-of-adoption/|website=andrewchen.co|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New customers typically hear about the product or service through their network and by using the product or service, share it with their connections in turn. This loop of awareness, use, and sharing can result in exponential growth for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Sean|title=Startup Growth Engines: Case Studies of How Today's Most Successful Startups Unlock Extraordinary Growth|date=June 24, 2014|publisher=Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown|url=https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Growth-Engines-Successful-Extraordinary-ebook/dp/B00LA95B68|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth hacking frames the user acquisition process through the "funnel" metaphor (in short, new users flow through a 5-stage funnel - acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, referral). Rapidly optimizing this process is a core goal of growth hacking, since making each stage of the funnel more efficient will increase the number of users in the most advantageous stages of the funnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mansoorkiarash.ir/what-is-growth-hacking/|title=what is growth hacking|last=Kiarash|first=Mansour|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Pinterest]], [[YouTube]], [[Groupon]], [[Udemy]], [[Instagram]] and [[Google]] are all companies that used and still use growth hacking techniques to build brands and improve profits.&lt;ref name=chen1/&gt;&lt;ref name=tc5&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/08/defining-a-growth-hacker-6-myths-about-growth-hackers/ |title=Defining A Growth Hacker: Debunking The 6 Most Common Myths About Growth Hacking |author=Ginn, Aaron |publisher=''TechCrunch'' |date=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=quora1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Growth-and-Traction/What-are-some-decisions-taken-by-the-Growth-team-at-Facebook-that-helped-Facebook-reach-500-million-users |title=Facebook Growth and Traction: What are some decisions taken by the "Growth team" at Facebook that helped Facebook reach 500 million users? |author=Johns, Andy |publisher=Quora |date=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=quora2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quora.com/What-is-Facebooks-User-Growth-team-responsible-for-and-what-have-they-launched |title=What is Facebook's User Growth team responsible for and what have they launched? |author=Johns, Andy |publisher=Quora |date=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
An early example of "''growth hacking''" was [[Hotmail]]'s inclusion of "''PS I Love You''" with a link for others to get the free online mail service.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|title=Don Draper Is Dead: Why Growth Hack Marketing Is Advertising’s Last Hope|url=http://betabeat.com/2013/09/don-draper-is-dead-why-growth-hack-marketing-is-advertisings-last-hope/|publisher=BetaBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the offer of more storage by Dropbox to users who referred their friends.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kehr|first1=Alex|title=Hacking Growth: The Modern Marketing Mindset to Create Fast Growing Companies|date=October 13, 2015|publisher=Wander Press|isbn=1515090019|pages=122|edition=First|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Marketing-Mindset-Companies/dp/1515090019/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online worldwide independent lodging company, [[Airbnb]], is an example of growth hacking by coupling technology and ingenuity. Airbnb realized they could essentially hack the Craiglist.org scale and tap both into their user base as well as their website by adding automated listing generators from Airbnb with the feature called "Post to Craigslist". The company's growth was a combination of clever thinking and technical know-how.&lt;ref name=AirBnB&gt;{{cite web|last=Needleman|first=Sarah|title=Growth Hacking' Helps Startups Boost Their Users|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/growth-hacking-helps-startups-boost-their-users-1401320789|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the easiest examples of "''growth hacking''" is to add "?sub_confirmation=1" at the end of your [[YouTube|Youtube]] channel URL. Everybody will see a [[Pop-up ad|popup]] "Confirm Channel Subscription" (works only on desktops). This growth hacking tactic increases [[YouTube]] subscribers by 400%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TOP 3 simple growth hacker marketing ideas on the internet, that you can put into practice right…|url = https://medium.com/@happyaladdin/top-3-simple-growth-hacker-marketing-ideas-on-the-internet-that-you-can-put-into-practice-right-7777a0901c6b|website = Medium|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noah Kagan's submission form had four fields: Name, Email, URL, Revenue. He decided to remove the "revenue" field altogether, leaving only three fields—Name, Email and URL. This small change meant an improvement in his conversion rate of 26%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = TOP 10 proven growth hacks for 2016 [examples, case studies]|url = https://medium.com/@happyaladdin/top-10-proven-growth-hacking-ideas-for-2016-bcd3c126de63|website = Medium|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Alberta|The University of Alberta]] increased email subscribers by 500% using a [[Pop-up ad|popup]] survey by [[Qualaroo]] that asked anyone who spent more than ''10 seconds'' on the site: “You seem interested in UAlberta news. Would you like to sign up for the Daily News email?”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''H shares''' ({{zh|c=H股}}) refer to the shares of companies incorporated in  [[mainland China]] that are traded on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. Many companies float their shares simultaneously on the Hong Kong market and one of the two mainland Chinese [[stock exchange]]s in Shanghai or Shenzhen, they are known as A+H companies.

H shares are also held by a [[Street name securities|nominee service]] company "HKSCC Nominees Limited", which was owned by [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]].

Price discrepancies between the H shares and the [[A share (mainland China)|A share]] counterparts of the same company are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A+H|url=http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/market/ah.aspx?sort=5&amp;order=1&amp;filter=3|website=AA Stocks|publisher=AASTOCKS.COM LIMITED (阿斯達克網絡信息有限公司)|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shares generally trade at a premium to H shares as the [[People's Republic of China]] government restricts mainland Chinese people from investing abroad and foreigners from investing in the A-share markets in mainland China.

==Index for H shares==

The index for H shares was called [[Hang Seng China Enterprises Index]]. ({{zh|t=恒生中國企業指數}}).

'''Haflong Hindi''' ({{lang-hi|हफ़लौंग हिन्दी}}) is the [[lingua franca]] of [[Dima Hasao district]] of [[Assam]] state of [[India]].&lt;ref name="Ved Prakash"&gt;Col Ved Prakash, "Encyclopaedia of North-east India, Vol# 2", Atlantic Publishers Distributors;Pg 575, {{ISBN|978-81-269-0704-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[pidgin]] that stemmed from [[Hindi]] and included vocabulary from several other languages, such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Dimasa language|Dimasa]] and the [[Zeme Naga]] dialect. It is named after [[Haflong]], which is the headquarters of Dima Hasao district.

== Example Phrases ==
The dialect is largely intelligible to Hindi speakers, and features simplified grammar with loanword infusions.&lt;ref name="Indexp"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/In-this-Assam-district,-Hindi-unites-11-tribes/215516/|title=In this Assam district, Hindi unites 11 tribes|accessdate=2008-09-17|publisher=Indian Express, September 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|hum tumko madat karne nhi sekega

|-
|tum kahaan jaaegaa
|Where (kahaan) you (tum) go-Fut (jaa-egaa)

In contrast to printed forms of Hindi, the Haflong variety lacks person and number agreement in the verb and [[ergative case|ergative]] marking of the subject when transitive clauses are in a preterite or perfect tense.

It is spoken in Arunachal Pradesh by an estimated 9,000 people of the Hill Miri tribe.&lt;ref name="Moseley2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moseley|first=Christopher|title=Encyclopedia of the world's endangered languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQt6XWloU10C&amp;pg=PA298|accessdate=1 April 2012|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1197-0|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to be a dialect of the [[Nishi language]].&lt;ref&gt;Post, Mark W.

==Description==
Hill Miri is a member of the [[Tani languages|Tani]] branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] and is considered a dialect of the [[Nishi language]]. It is spoken by 9,000 people in the northern regions of India by the [[Hill Miri people]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/10414&lt;/ref&gt; It is threatened because the younger generation is slowly breaking away from their people's tradition and language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingtongues.org/hotspots/hotspot.GSA.Apatani.HillMiri.Nishi.html Hill Miri Audio]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Hill Miri" is an exonym, as the Hill Miri people identify themselves simply as [[Nyishi (Tribe)|Nyishi]].&lt;ref&gt;Nabam Tadar Rikam, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Emerging_religious_identities_of_Arunach.html?id=jP1tAAAAMAAJ "Emerging religious Identities of Arunachal Pradesh"], ''Mittal Publications'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Many audiobooks of gospel narratives in the Hill Miri language have been collected.

==History of scholarship==
George Abraham Grierson, in his survey of India regarding its linguistics, researched the Nyishi language and published a record over a century ago.{{citation needed |date=May 2015}}

{{nihongo|'''Hiroyuki Morioka'''|森岡 浩之|Morioka Hiroyuki}} (born March 2, 1962, [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan) is a Japanese [[List of science fiction authors|science fiction novelist]].

== Biography ==
In 1992, his first novel ''Yume no Ki ga Tsugeta nara'' ("If Only the Dream Trees Could Touch") appeared in [[Hayakawa Shobo]] ([[Tokyo]])'s [[SF Magazine]]. His short story "Spice" won the [[Hayakawa Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animeondvd.com/conitem.php?item=192 Anime on DVD Interview at Anime Expo 2002 By Andrew Tei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165415/http://www.animeondvd.com/conitem.php?item=192 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993.

In 1996, he published his first long novel in three volumes, ''[[Seikai no Monshou]]'' (''Seikai no Monshō''/''Crest of the Stars''). In the next year 1997 Seikai no Monsho was awarded with
[[Seiun Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alamo-sf.org/lonestarcon2/newszine/stories/story29.html LoneStarCon2 The 55th World Science Fiction Convention Saturday, August 30, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Japan SF Convention]]. He released its sequel ''Seikai no Senki'' (''[[Banner of the Stars]]''), where he said that Seikai no Monsho was actually an overture to Seikai no Senki. Morioka had already suggested in Seikai no Monshou 2 that the entire series should narrate the life of Princess Lamhirh (aka Lafiel), from her birth to her eventual ascension to the imperial throne. Five volumes of Seikai no Senki are now available, with Morioka naming the first three the "Diahoc Trilogy", but the series itself has not yet finished.  An English translation of "Seikai no Monshō''/''Crest of the Stars" has been published by [[Tokyopop]], which came out from the fall of 2006 to May 2007.

Aside from the Seikai series, he published another ''Senki'' in 4 volumes, based on [[Japanese mythology]], as well as a two-volume series, ''[[Seikai no Danshō]]'' (''Fragments of the Stars''), a collection of stories set in the same universe as the other two series.

His characteristics as a writer include a deep interest for [[linguistics]] (especially for [[conlang]]s), [[artificial intelligence]], bitter humor, and well-designed world settings.

Longfellow]] to summarise the literature of the 15th century in the Catalan language.&lt;ref name="The Poets and Poetry of Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UQFGK4h4rYwC&amp;rdid=book-UQFGK4h4rYwC&amp;rdot=1 |title=The Poets and Poetry of Europa with Introductions and Biographical Notices - Books on Google Play |website=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaume Roig’s family was of [[Catalans|Catalan]] origins from the city of [[València]]. His great-grandfather moved to València from [[Mataró]] and became a ''jurat'', a member of the local government.&lt;ref name="escriptors" /&gt;

His grandfather was a [[notary]] and also involved in politics and medicine. Jaume Roig's father, also called Jaume Roig and often referred to as ''Jaume Roig lo vell'' (the old one), was a member of the local council and a doctor's examiner.&lt;ref name="escriptors" /&gt;

Jaume Roig "''lo jove''" (the young one) was born in [[València]] in the early [[15th century]]. He was a ''Mestre'' in Medicine and he probably studied at the [[University of Lleida]], created around 1300 by the King [[James II of Aragon|James II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udl.es/ca/udl/historia/ |title=Història i Tradició |website=Udl.es |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="escriptors" /&gt;

His family's position and reputation allowed him to work as the doctor of the Royal Family, the local government and the church. He was also the doctors' Academic Examiner for over a decade.&lt;ref name="escriptors" /&gt;

By 1441 Jaume Roig had married Isabel Pellicer. They had six children, all of which lived longer than Jaume Roig and three of whom joined the clergy.&lt;ref name="escriptors" /&gt;

The ''Espill'' is addressed to the fictitious nephew of the narrator and tries to convince him of the evil nature of women and how it is better to avoid their company by all means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Universitat de Barcelona Narpan |url=http://www.sciencia.cat/biblioteca/temes/roig.htm |title=Temes de Sciència.cat |website=Sciencia.cat |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, the narrator provides examples of mundane women trying to harm male pilgrims,&lt;ref name="Abject pilgrimage and healing in Jaume Roig’s Spill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Dynamis/article/viewFile/92868/118083 |format=PDF |title=Abject pilgrimage and healing in Jaume Roig's ''Spill'' |author=Jean Dangler |website=Raco.cat |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly his own (fictional) experiences after several marriages.&lt;ref name="Le Spill de Jaume Roig ou l’impossibilité du bon mariage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/17662752/Le_Spill_de_Jaume_Roig_ou_l_impossibilit%C3%A9_du_bon_mariage |title=Le Spill de Jaume Roig ou l’impossibilité du bon mariage &amp;#124; Alfons Gregori |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe the [[misogyny]] of the narrator should not be assumed to represent the views of the author.&lt;ref name="Retòrica sermonària, exempla i construcció textual de l'Espill de Jaume Roig"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/635932/Ret%C3%B2rica_sermon%C3%A0ria_exempla_i_construcci%C3%B3_textual_de_lEspill_de_Jaume_Roig |title=Retòrica sermonària, exempla i construcció textual de l'Espill de Jaume Roig &amp;#124; Josep-Antoni Ysern i Lagarda |website=Academia.edu |date=1997-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kujargé language''' is spoken in seven villages in [[Chad]] near [[Jebel Mirra]] ({{coord|11|45|N|22|15|E|}}) and in [[Sudan]] in villages scattered along the lower [[Wadi Salih]] and [[Wadi Azum]]. It is estimated to have about 1000 speakers ({{as of|1983|lc=on}}). The name is derived from [[Sudanese Arabic]] ''kujur'' "sorcerer", because of their reputation for [[witchcraft]]. The speakers mainly live by [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]].

==Classification==
Kujarge is unclassified. It is known only from a 200-word list. These include [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] words, but low numerals and pronouns look very un-Chadic.&lt;ref name=Hammar&gt;Harald Hammarström, 2010, 'The status of the least documented language families in the world'. In ''Language Documentation &amp; Conservation'', v 4, p 183 [http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4478/hammarstrom.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Blench (2008) notes that much of the basic vocabulary looks [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], and speculates that Kujarge could even be a conservative language transitional between Chadic and Cushitic.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, 2008. 'Links between Cushitic, Omotic, Chadic and the position of Kujarge'. (ms)[http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/Blench%20paper%20Cushitic%20symposium%20Paris%202008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The language had been classified as a member of the [[Mubi languages|Mubi]] subgroup of [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] by [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]]; however, [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] argued that its classification remained uncertain. There may have been a mix-up with [[Birgit language|Birgit]], a nearby Mubi language which is also called Kujarge; when Newman was shown the 200-word list in 2006, he would not commit to it being Chadic.&lt;ref name=Hammar/&gt;

In addition, there appears to be a large amount of vocabulary that has not been identified as Afro-Asiatic; there is a possibility that it is a language isolate that has been largely relexified by Chadic and Cushitic.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench and Mauro Tosco, 2010. [http://25images.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/player/player.php?id=72&amp;id_sequence=432 'Cushitic, Omotic, Chadic and the position of Kujarge'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331180916/http://25images.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/player/player.php?id=72&amp;id_sequence=432 |date=2012-03-31 }}, ''Workshop « Language Isolates in Africa »'', Lyons&lt;/ref&gt;

Blažek (2013) purports to show that Kujarge is an [[East Chadic language]].

==Sounds==
Judging by the one available wordlist, the [[consonant]]s appear to be:

{| class="IPA wikitable"
|-
! 
! [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]
! [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
! [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]
! [[Velar consonant|Velar]]
|-
! [[Plosive]]s
| b
| t d
| ɟ

|-
! [[Nasal stop|Nasals]]
| m
| n
| ɲ
| ŋ
|-
! [[Trill consonant|Trill]]s
|
| r
|
|
|}

Relatively few [[consonant cluster]]s are attested; they appear to all involve r+consonant or [[gemination]] (unless the prenasalized stops are to be seen as clusters.)

The [[vowel]]s used in transcribing the same wordlist are: {{IPA|a, e, i, o, u, ʌ, ɛ, ɔ}}. It is not clear whether all of these are [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct; {{IPA|[ʌ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, in particular, are rare.

==Grammar==
The [[pronoun]]s include ''annu'' "I", ''nigi'' "you (sg.)". Interrogative pronouns include ''ŋgayna'' "what?", ''ye'' "who?". [[Demonstrative]]s include ''agu'' "this".

The [[number]]s include:
#''kirre''
#''kurro''
#''ubo''

This article discusses the '''[[phonology|phonological]] system of [[Macedonian language|Standard Macedonian]]''' (unless otherwise noted) based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect|Prilep-Bitola]] [[dialect]].  For discussion of other dialects, see [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|Macedonian dialects]]. Macedonian possesses five [[vowels]], one [[semivowel]], three [[liquid consonants]], three [[nasal stops]], three pairs of [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s, two pairs of [[affricate]]s, a non-paired voiceless fricative, nine pairs of voiced and unvoiced consonants and four pairs of [[Stop consonant|stops]].

==Vowels==
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
|-
|+ Vowels&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Friedman|2001|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lunt|1952|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schwa===
The [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|ʌ}} or {{IPAblink|ɨ}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Friedman|2001|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|к’смет}}, {{angbr|с’нце}}, etc. When spelling aloud, each consonant is followed by the schwa. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|МПЦ]]}} ({{IPA|[mə.pə.t͡sə]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|СССР]]}} ({{IPA|[ɛs.ɛs.ɛs.ɛr]}}) and {{angbr|МТ}} ({{IPA|[ɛm.tɛ]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions.

===Vowel length===
[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penult can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|Велес}} {{IPA-mk|ˈvɛːlɛs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[aː]}}; e.g. {{angbr|саат}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[saːt]}} '''colloq.'' hour'.

|
|
| {{IPA|r}}{{ref|1|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}

|
|}

{{note|1|1}} The alveolar trill ({{IPA|/r/}}) is [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic]] between two consonants; for example, {{angbr|прст}} {{IPA|[ˈpr̩st]}} 'finger'. The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/ɫ/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|њутн}} {{IPA|[ˈɲutn̩]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]',  {{angbr|Попокатепетл}} {{IPA|[pɔpɔkaˈtɛpɛtɫ̩]}} '[[Popocatépetl]]', etc.

The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[ɱ]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|трамвај}} {{IPA|[ˈtraɱvaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} (e.g. {{angbr|англиски}} {{IPA|[ˈaŋɡliski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.

==Phonological processes==
At morpheme boundaries (represented in spelling) and at the end of a word (not represented in spelling), voicing opposition is [[Final-obstruent devoicing|neutralized]].

==Stress==
The [[word stress]] in Macedonian is [[wikt:antepenultimate|antepenultimate]], meaning it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source. The following rules apply:
* [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable.

For example, {{angbr|дете}} {{IPA|[ˈdɛtɛ]}} 'child', {{angbr|мајка}} {{IPA|[ˈmajka]}} 'mother' and {{angbr|татко}} {{IPA|[ˈtatkɔ]}} 'father'.
* [[Trisyllabic]] and [[polysyllabic]] words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable.

For example, {{angbr|планина}} {{IPA|[ˈpɫanina]}} 'mountain', {{angbr|планината}} {{IPA|[pɫaˈninata]}} 'the mountain' and {{angbr|планинарите}} {{IPA|[pɫaniˈnaritɛ]}} 'the mountaineers'.

Exceptions include:
* [[Participle|Verbal adverbs]] (i.e. words suffixed with {{angbr|-ќи}}): e.g. {{angbr|викајќи}} {{IPA|[viˈkajci]}} 'shouting', {{angbr|одејќи}} {{IPA|[ɔˈdɛjci]}} 'walking'.
* Foreign [[loanword]]s: e.g. {{angbr|клише}} {{IPA|[kliˈʃɛ]}} 'cliché', {{angbr|генеза}} {{IPA|[ɡɛˈnɛza]}} 'genesis', {{angbr|литература}} {{IPA|[litɛraˈtura]}} 'literature', {{angbr|Александар}} {{IPA|[alɛkˈsandar]}}, '[[Alexander]]' (Possibly based on hellenised variations of indigenous Bryges and/or Enchele naming conventions){{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, etc.

'''MeaningCloud''' is a [[Software as a service|Software as a Service]] product that enables users to embed [[text analytics]] and [[semantic processing]] in any application or system.

MeaningCloud extends the concept of semantic [[Api|API]] with a [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] framework that makes the integration of semantic processing into any system something close to a [[Plug and play|plug-and-play]] experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://altaplana.com/TA2014|title = Text Analytics 2014: User Perspectives on Solutions and Providers|last = |first = |date = 9 July 2014|work = Alta Plana|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; MeaningCloud is available both in [[Software as a service|SaaS]] mode and on-premises.

MeaningCloud was previously branded as Textalytics.

== Functionality ==
* [[Information extraction|Topic Extraction]]: identifies appearances of [[Named-entity recognition|named entities]] and abstract concepts in the text.
* [[Document classification|Text Classification]]: assigns a text to one or several categories in a predefined [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].
* [[Sentiment Analysis]]: assigns a [[Polarity item|polarity]] (positive, negative, neutral) to a document or to the individual topics or attributes appearing in a document (aspect-based sentiment).
* [[Document clustering|Text Clustering]]: discovers the underlying themes in a document collection and groups these documents according to their similarities and their adherence to those themes.

== Integration and customization ==
Advanced APIs provide a functionality optimized for diverse applications and ease of use. In addition, customization and integration capabilities offer a fast [[learning curve]] and a short time to obtain results.
* Customized resource management tools allow users to easily incorporate their own semantic resources (dictionaries, taxonomies, sentiment models) to adapt the operation of the system to their needs.
* [[Software development kit|SDKs]] and [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] increase the convenience and integrability of the APIs in the most common environments and platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-5-natural-language-processing-apis-stack/analysis/2014/07/28|title = How 5 Natural Language Processing APIs Stack Up|last = |first = |date = 28 July 2014|work = ProgrammableWeb|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; MeaningCloud provides '''SDKs '''for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Php|PHP]], and [[Visual Basic]], and '''plug-ins''' for [[Microsoft excel|Microsoft Excel]] and [[General Architecture for Text Engineering|GATE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://semanticweb.com/daedulus-takes-meaning-service-excel-gate-cms-systems_b43600|title = Daedalus Takes Meaning-As-A-Service To Excel, GATE And CMS Systems|last = |first = |date = 8 July 2014|work = Semanticweb.com|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14258">'''Mesirah''' (or '''mesira''', {{lang-he|to turn over|italic=yes}}) is the action in which one Jew reports the conduct of another Jew to a non-Rabbinic authority in a manner and under the circumstances forbidden by [[Rabbi]]nic Law.&lt;ref name=broyde-jlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/mesiralaw2.html|title=Informing on Others for Violating American Law: A Jewish Law View | author =  Rabbi [[Michael J. Broyde]] | accessdate = 19 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This may not necessarily apply to reporting legitimate crimes to responsible authority, but does apply to turning over a Jew to an abusive authority, or to a legitimate one who would punish the criminal in ways seen as excessive by Jewish community, though "excessive" punishment by non-Jews may be permissible if a precept of the [[Torah]] has been violated.&lt;ref name="Cohen1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred S. Cohen|title=Halacha and contemporary society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnFaZE-Q1JMC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=27 February 2011|year=1984|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-042-8|pages=100–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term for an individual who commits ''mesirah'' is ''moser'' (HE:מוסר) or ''mossur''.&lt;ref name="Cohen1984"/&gt; A person who repeatedly violates this law by informing on his fellow Jews is considered subject to "Din Moser" (law of the informer), which is analogous to "[[rodef|Din rodef]]" in that both prescribe death for the offender,&lt;ref name=broyde-jlaw/&gt; and according to some, in some circumstances he may be killed without warning.&lt;ref name="Informing on Others for Violating American Law: A Jewish Law View"&gt;{{cite web|title=Informing on Others for Violating American Law: A Jewish Law View|first=Rabbi Michael J. |last=Broyde|work= Jewish Law |url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/mesiralaw2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Source of the ban ==
The source of the ban comes from the Bava Kamma (HE:בבא קמא) section of the [[Babylonian Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Talmud|b|Bava Kamma||117a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Talmud|b|Bava Kamma||58a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= August 2009 |first= 
Rabbi Monique Susskind |last= Goldberg |title= Is it permitted to kill another Jew? |work= The Schechter Institutes |url= http://www.schechter.edu/AskTheRabbi.aspx?ID=497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the law was instigated to ease Jewish life under [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or [[Persia]]n rule. This law is discussed in Babylonian Talmud, by [[Rambam]] and in [[Shulchan Aruch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoshen Mishpat 388:9&lt;/ref&gt; Shulchan Aruch, however, states that in the cases that if Jews do not testify against other Jews in the gentile court, it will be obvious that Jews are covering up for each other, they should testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Halacha and Contemporary Society |first= Alfred S. |last= Cohen |publisher= KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |date= 1984 |page= 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Love Your Neighbor and Yourself: A Jewish Approach to Modern Personal Ethics |first= Elliot N. |last= Dorff |publisher= Jewish Publication Society |date= 2003 |page= 185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] states: {{quotation| Whoever adjudicates in a non-Jewish court ... is wicked and it is as though he has reviled, blasphemed and rebelled against the law of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Sins of Omission: The Jewish Community's Reaction to Domestic Violence |first= Carol |last= Goodman Kaufman |publisher= Basic Books |date= October 2, 2003 |page= 76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Maimonides]] further explains: "It is forbidden to hand over a Jew to the heathen, neither his person nor his goods, even if he is wicked and a sinner, even if he causes distress and pain to fellow-Jews. Whoever hands over a Jew to the heathen has no part in the next world. It is permitted to kill a moser (informant) wherever he is.

==Modern times==
According to [[Michael Broyde]], there are many different opinions among 20th-century rabbis as to the extent and circumstances ''mesirah'' is still valid in modern times.&lt;ref name="Informing on Others for Violating American Law: A Jewish Law View"/&gt;

According to ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' and a [[Channel 4]] investigation, the concept of mesirah was used by a Haredi leader to protect community members investigated for [[child molestation]] from police investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miriam Shaviv|title=UK Haredi chief caught telling alleged victim not to tell police about abuse|date= 24 January 2013 |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-haredi-chief-caught-telling-alleged-victim-not-to-tell-police-about-abuse/|work =The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents ignore child abuse at rabbi's advice |first1= Dr. Ruchama |date= 5 February 2009 |last1= Weiss |first2= Rabbi Levi |last2= Breckman |work= Jewish World |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3667308,00.html|agency=Ynet News }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The principle of mesirah has also been used to dissuade Jewish auditors from reporting other Jews to the IRS for tax fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joshua Hammerman|title=Sex-Abuse Cover Ups: The Mesirah Mess |work=The Jewish Week |date= 5 June 2012 |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/editorial_opinion/opinion/sex_abuse_cover_ups_mesirah_mess }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinic courts in Israel have been known to issue writs calling for social exclusion of Jews bringing legal issues to Israel's civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Many ultra-Orthodox rabbis view use of state courts, in Israel and in the Diaspora, as a violation of a principle of Jewish law |date= 22 May 2013 |work= The Jerusalem Post |url= http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Court-to-review-rabbinical-courts-social-exclusion-order-313935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Chaim Kanievsky]], a leading [[Israel]]i [[rabbi]] and ''[[posek]]'' in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] society ruled that reporting instances of sexual child abuse to the police is consistent with [[halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Leading haredi rabbi says sexual abuse should be reported to police |first= Sam |last= Sokol |date= 5 March 2015 |work= The Jerusalem Post |url= http://www.jpost.com/landedpages/printarticle.aspx?id=393109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rav Chaim Kanievsky on Molester: "Logically, He Should Be Reported to Police" |work= matzav.com |date= 26 February 2015

Other major Orthodox [[poskim]] in America, such as Rabbi [[Hershel Schachter|Hershel Shachter]] also concur that abuse cases should be reported in full to the civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.torahweb.org/torah/special/2007/rsch_mesirah.html|title=Regarding Mesirah - Rabbi Herschel Shachter|website=www.torahweb.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mesirah has also been cited as one of the main reasons for the gross underreporting in the [[Sexual abuse cases in Brooklyn's Haredi community]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/nyregion/ultra-orthodox-jews-shun-their-own-for-reporting-child-sexual-abuse.html?pagewanted=all|title=Ultra-Orthodox Shun Their Own for Reporting Child Sexual Abuse | work=The New York Times | first1=Sharon|last1=Otterman|first2=Ray|last2=Rivera|date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;Rachel Aviv, "[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/10/outcast-3 The Outcast]." After a Hasidic man exposed child abuse in his tight/knit Brooklyn community, he found himself the target of a criminal investigation. ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Nov. 10, 2014, pp. 44-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Australia ===

The ''mesirah'' doctrine came under intense public scrutiny in Australia in early 2015 as a result of evidence given to the [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] relating to an alleged long-running and systematic cover-up of child sexual abuse and the institutional protection of perpetrators at the exclusive Melbourne boys' school [[Yeshivah College, Australia|Yeshiva College]]. Fairfax Media on 28 January 2015 reported secret tape recordings and emails had been disclosed which revealed members of Australia's Orthodox Jewish community who assisted police investigations into alleged child sexual abuse were pressured to remain silent on the matter. Criminal barrister Alex Lewenberg was alleged to have been "disappointed", and to have berated a Jew who had been a victim of a Jewish sex offender and whom he subsequently regarded as a mossur for breaking with Mesirah tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Jewish sex abuse victims pressured not to assist police, secret tapes and emails reveal |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= 28 January 2015 |first1= Richard |last1= Baker |first2= Nick |last2= McKenzie |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/jewish-sex-abuse-victims-pressured-not-to-assist-police-secret-tapes-and-emails-reveal-20150127-12zcfa.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewenberg was subsequently found guilty of professional misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowie|first1=Tom|title=Criminal lawyer Alex Lewenberg guilty of professional misconduct after asking sex abuse victim not to dob in a 'fellow Yid'|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/criminal-lawyer-alex-lewenberg-guilty-of-professional-misconduct-after-asking-sex-abuse-victim-not-to-dob-in-a-fellow-yid-20160324-gnq4y1.html|accessdate=15 December 2017|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 Mr Zephaniah Waks, an adherent of the ultra-Orthodox Hasidic [[Chabad]] sect in Melbourne, Australia, testified to the Royal Commission that following his discovery that one of his sons had been sexually abused by Rabbi David Kramer, a teacher at their school, [[Yeshivah College, Australia|Yeshiva College]], he confronted the school's principal, Rabbi Abraham Glick and demanded that Kramer be sacked. Mr Waks told of his shock when he learned a few days later that Kramer was still working at the school, and that he again confronted Rabbi Glick, who then claimed that Kramer had admitted his guilt "because he wanted to be caught" but that the school could not dismiss Kramer because (Glick claimed) he was at risk of self-harm. Mr Waks also told the Commission that despite his anger, he felt constrained not to go to the authorities because of the doctrine of ''mesirah'':

:" I thought this was absolutely outrageous, however if I reported this to the police I would be in breach of the Jewish principle of mesirah."

:Waks said the concept of "mesirah" prevented members of the ultra-Orthodox Chabad sect of Judaism from going to secular authorities.

:"At the very least, the breach of mesirah almost certainly always leads to shunning and intimidation within the Jewish community and would almost certainly damage marriage prospects of your children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/03/rabbi-was-allowed-to-keep-teaching-after-admitting-abuse-of-children-inquiry-told |first= Melissa |last= Davey |title= Rabbi was allowed to keep teaching after admitting abuse of children, inquiry told |work= The Guardian |date= 3 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving evidence to the Commission on the day before his father, Mr Menachem (Manny) Waks, one of three children from the Waks family who were sexually abused by staff at Yeshiva College, testified that after breaking ''mesirah'' by going public about his abuse, he and his family had been ostracised by rabbinical leaders, shunned by his community and subjected to a sustained campaign of abuse, intimidation and threats, which eventually forced Mr Waks to leave Australia with his wife and children. He also testified about how members of the exclusive Chabad community had pressured him to abandon his advocacy:

:"I was in fact contacted by several considered community members, and they said to me that the anti-Semites are having a field day with my testimony and my publicity around this issue, and that if I cared about the community, I'd cease doing that straight away."

Counsel Assisting the commission then asked Mr Waks how he felt having been accused of being an informer:

:"I am appalled by it obviously, because the concept of 'Mesirah' really, you can become a death target. Taken at its literal meaning, you become potentially a target who is legitimate to be murdered, because you've gone and cooperated with the authorities. Now, I've never felt threatened for my life, but it does highlight the severity in which this concept is held."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2015/s4172658.htm |first= Samantha |last= Donovan |title= Royal Commission hears Jewish school failed to deal with serial child abuser |work= ABC Radio National |date= 2 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the Commission's final report included a recommendation to Jewish institutions:

:All Jewish institutions in Australia should ensure that their complaint handling policies explicitly state that the halachic concepts of ''mesirah'', ''moser'' and ''loshon horo'' do not apply to the communication and reporting of allegations of child sexual abuse to police and other civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/final-report|location=Recommendation 16.30|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mimi of Nachtigal''', or '''Mimi-N''', is a language of [[Chad]] that is attested only in a word list labelled "[[Mimi language (disambiguation)|Mimi]]" that was collected ca. 1870 by [[Gustav Nachtigal]]. Greenberg (1960) classified it as a [[Maban languages|Maban language]], though a distant one. Subsequent researchers have supported a remote relationship, though there is little data to go on.&lt;ref&gt;Starostin, George. [https://rggu.academia.edu/GeorgeStarostin/Papers/983014/On_Mimi On Mimi], Journal of Language Relationship, v. 6, 2011, pp. 115-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohitlal Majumdar''' ({{lang-bn|মোহিতলাল মজুমদার}}) (October 26, 1888 – July 26, 1952), a renowned [[Bengali people|Bengali]] author, was born at Kanchrapara village in [[Nadia district]], [[India]]. Mohitlal started as a poet, but later became better known as a literary critic.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahman |first=Bilkis |year=2012 |chapter=Majumder, Mohitlal |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Majumder,_Mohitlal |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Majumder, Mohitlal (1888-1952) poet, essayist and literary critic, was born in a [[Baidya]] family on 26 October 1888 in the village of Kanchrapara in Nadia district. He graduated in arts in 1908 from Ripon College (now [[Surendranath College]]), Kolkata. He began his career as a teacher at Calcutta High School in 1908 and continued in this profession until 1928. He also worked briefly as a kanungo (1914-1917) in the Settlement Department. He joined [[University of Dhaka]], now in [[Bangladesh]] as a lecturer in the Bengali and Sanskrit Department in 1928 and retired from there in 1944.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;
His present house is in a state of ruin at Chongarbon.

==Writing career==
Mohitlal Majumder made his literary debut through the journal "Manasi". Later, he contributed regularly to journals such as the Bharati and [[Shanibarer Chithi]]. His early poems, written in pleasing rhythms, reflect the aspirations and sorrows of a dreaming youth. Acquainted with Arabic and Persian, he used Arabic and Persian words in his poems. In pre-Nazrul era, he was the user of Arabic and Persian words. His poems are inspired by both aestheticism and spiritualism.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

Mohitlal early poems reveal the influence of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], but later, as a member of the [[Shanibarer Chithi]] group, he distanced himself from the older poet.

As a literary critic, Mohitlal attempted to set standards and reveal the problems of art and literature. His psychological and poet-like approach greatly elevated the status of criticism. In writing critiques he used a number of pseudonyms such as Krittivas Ojha, Sabyasachi and Sri Satyasundar Das.

His literary works were included in the curriculum of school level, secondary, higher secondary and graduation level [[Bengali Literature]] in [[Bangladesh]]. Swapan Pasari (1921), Smargaral (1936), Adhunik Bangla Sahitya (1936), Bangla Kavitar Chhanda (1945), Kavi Shri Madhusudan (1947), Sahitya Bichar (1947), Bangla O Bangali (1951), and Kavi Rabindra O Rabindrakavya (1st Vol. 1952, 2nd Vol. 1953).&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

[[File:Opening-statement-legalman-mock-trial-Dec-23-08.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[legalman]] making an opening statement for the prosecution to a jury during a [[mock trial]].]]
An '''opening statement''' is generally the first occasion that the [[trier of fact]] ([[jury]] or [[judge]]) has to hear from a lawyer in a [[trial (law)|trial]], aside possibly from questioning during [[voir dire]].  The opening statement is generally constructed to serve as a "road map" for the fact-finder.  This is especially essential, in many jury trials, since jurors (at least theoretically) know nothing at all about the case before the trial, (or if they do, they are strictly instructed by the judge to put preconceived notions aside).   Though such statements may be dramatic and vivid, they must be limited to the [[evidence]] reasonably expected to be presented during the trial.  Attorneys generally conclude opening statements with a reminder that at the conclusion of evidence, the attorney will return to ask the fact-finder to find in his or her client's favor.

Opening statements are, in theory, not allowed to be [[argumentative]], or suggest the inferences that fact-finders should draw from the evidence they will hear.  In actual practice, the line between statement and argument is often unclear and many attorneys will infuse at least a little argumentation into their opening (often prefacing borderline arguments with some variation on the phrase, "As we will show you...").  [[Objection (law)|Objections]], though permissible during opening statements, are very unusual, and by professional courtesy are usually reserved only for egregious conduct.

Generally, the [[prosecution]] in a criminal case and [[plaintiff]] in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil case]] is the first to offer an opening statement, and defendants go second.  Defendants are also allowed the option of delaying their opening statement until after the close of the prosecution or plaintiff's case.  Few take this option, however, so as not to allow the other party's argument to stand uncontradicted for so long.

The techniques of opening statements are taught in courses on [[trial advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven; ''Modern Trial Advocacy'', NITA, New York, NY 2004 pp. 415 et. seq., {{ISBN|1556818866}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening statement is integrated with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a line of effort.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S.; ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''; Conatus, Boston, MA, 2012 pp. 46–73, {{ISBN|0615676952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific tactics that can be incorporated in an opening statement are audio-visual elements, a clear overview of the coming presentation, and using deposition testimony to highlight key information they can expect of upcoming witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Tom (PhD) &amp; Schmid, Jill (PhD); Tsongas Litigation Consulting. [http://tsongas.com/article-posts/effective-opening-statements-and-closing-arguments/ Effective Opening Statements and Closing Arguments.]''King County Bar Bulletin.'' Dec. 2010.

====Obstruents====
*{{IPA|/p, b/}} are [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]], whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} are [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=239}}
*{{IPA|/ʒ/}} is restricted to word-initial position, and occurs only in loanwords from French. It tends to either devoice to {{IPAblink|ʃ}} or be affricated to {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
*{{IPA|/k, kʲ/}} are [[Velar consonant|velar]].{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=239}}
*The exact place of articulation of {{IPA|/x, ɣ/}} varies:
**[[Velar consonant|Velar]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|x}}, {{IPA link|ɣ}}]}} before and after back vowels and, in the case of {{IPA|/x/}}, also when it is preceded by a back vowel in an intervocalic position between stressed and unstressed syllable.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
**[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ç}}, {{IPA link|ʝ}}]}} before and after front vowels and, in the case of {{IPA|/x/}}, also after {{IPA|/ə/}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
*Word-initial {{IPA|/x/}} is restricted to the sequence {{IPA|/sx/}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
*{{IPA|/h/}} may be [[H-dropping|dropped]] by some speakers.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
*{{IPA|/p, t, tʲ, k, kʲ, v, z/}} may be affricated to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|p͡ɸ}}, {{IPA link|t͡s}}, t͡sʲ, {{IPA link|k͡x}}, k͡xʲ, {{IPA link|b͡v}}, {{IPA link|d͡z}}]}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Peters|2010}} does not specify the environment(s) in which the affrication of {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} takes place. In the case of stops, it occurs in pre-pausal position.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
*{{IPA|/v, z/}} are realized as voiceless {{IPA|[v̥, z̥]}} when they occur between vowels, and often also in word-initial position (in which the devoicing may be only partial). {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is devoiced in a similar manner.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}

====Sonorants====
*{{IPA|/m, β/}} are bilabial.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=239}}
*{{IPA|/n, l, r/}} are alveolar.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=239}}
**{{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} is pronounced as follows:
***{{IPAblink|n}}, if {{IPA|/k/}} belongs to another morpheme ({{IPA|[nʲ]}} before allomorphemic {{IPA|/kj/}});{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
***{{IPAblink|ŋ}}, if {{IPA|/k/}} belongs to the same morpheme.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
**Word-final {{IPA|[nʲ]}} appears only in loanwords from French.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
**{{IPA|/l/}} tends to be [[Velarization|velarized]], especially postvocalically.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
**{{IPA|/r/}} has a few possible realizations:
***Apical trill {{IPAblink|r}} or an apical fricative {{IPAblink|ɹ̝}} before a stressed vowel in word-initial syllables.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
***Intervocalically and in the onset after a consonant, it may be a tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
***Word-final {{IPA|/r/}} is highly variable; the most frequent variants are an apical trill fricative {{IPAblink|r̝}}, an apical fricative {{IPAblink|ɹ̝}} and an apical rhotic affricate {{IPA|[ɾ͡ɹ̝]}}. The last two variants tend to be voiceless ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɹ̝̊}}, {{IPA|ɾ̥͡θ̠}}]}}) in pre-pausal position.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}
***The sequence {{IPA|/ər/}} can be vocalized to {{IPAblink|ɐ}} or {{IPAblink|ə}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=245}}
*{{IPA|/ŋ/}} is velar, whereas {{IPA|/j/}} is palatal.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=239}}
*{{IPA|/β, j/}} appear only word-initially and intervocalically.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}

====Final devoicing and assimilation====
Just like Standard Dutch, Orsmaal-Gussenhoven dialect [[Final-obstruent devoicing|devoices]] all [[obstruent]]s at the ends of words.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}

Morpheme-final {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} may be voiced if a voiced plosive or a vowel follows.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=240}}

** {{IPA|/y/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} occur only in few loanwords from French.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=242}}
* {{IPA|/yː, uː, ɒː/}} before {{IPA|/t, d/}} within the same syllable may be realized as centering diphthongs {{IPA|[yə, uə, ɒə]}}, often with a labial glide before the schwa {{IPA|[ywə, uwə, ɒwə]}}. Alternatively, in place of the schwa an unrounded variant of the first vowel may appear: {{IPA|[yi, uɯ, ɒɑ]}}. In the same environment, {{IPA|/øː/}} can be realized as {{IPA|[øjə]}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=242}}
* {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ, ʊ/}} are phonetically [[Near-close vowel|near-close]]. {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is close to the canonical value of {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʏ}}}}, yet {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ/}} are more peripheral ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ̟}}, {{IPA link|ʊ̠}}]}}) than the canonical values of {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɪ, ʊ}}}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=241}}

* {{IPA|/ɔ, ɒ, ɒː/}} are closer ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɔ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɒ|ɒ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɒ|ɒ̝ː}}]}} than the canonical values of {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɔ, ɒ}}}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=241}}
* {{IPA|/ɔː/}} appears only before {{IPA|/t, d/}} and only as a phonetic centering diphthong {{IPA|[ɔə]}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=242}}
* {{IPA|/a, aː/}}, which are phonological back vowels, are central {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ä}}, {{IPA link|äː}}]}} phonetically.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=241}}
* When stressed, short vowels cannot occur in open syllables. Exceptions to this rule are high-frequency words like {{IPA|[βa]}} 'what', and loanwords from French, such as {{IPA|[dəˈpo]}} 'depot'.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=242}}

* The starting points of the centering diphthongs {{IPA|/iə, eə, ɛə/}} are close to the canonical values of the IPA symbols used to transcribe them ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|ɛ}}]}}), whereas their ending points are not fully central but centralized front; {{IPAblink|e|ë}} in the case of {{IPA|/iə/}}, {{IPAblink|e̞|ë̞}} in the case of {{IPA|/eə, ɛə/}}.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=241}}

===Prosody===
Stress location is largely the same as in Belgian Standard Dutch. In loanwords from French, the original word-final stress is often preserved, as in {{IPA|[kəˈdaʊ]}} 'cadeau'.{{sfnp|Peters|2010|p=242}}

A '''paramilitary''' is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional [[military]], but which is formally not part of a government's [[armed forces]].&lt;ref name=Reference-OED-paramilitary&gt;{{cite book| chapter=paramilitary| title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| edition=3rd| orig-year=online edition; original published in June 2005 |date= June 2011| chapter-url=http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&amp;q=paramilitary| accessdate=2011-09-13| quote=Designating, of, or relating to a force or unit whose function and organization are analogous or ancillary to those of a professional military force, but which is not regarded as having professional or legitimate status.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Under the [[law of war]], a state may incorporate a paramilitary organization or armed agency (such as a [[law enforcement agency|national police]], a private volunteer [[militia]]) into its [[combatant]] [[armed forces]]. The other parties to a conflict have to be notified thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule4_sectionb |title=Customary IHL - Section B. Incorporation of paramilitary or armed law enforcement agencies into armed forces |publisher=Icrc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a paramilitary is not a military force, it is usually equivalent to a military's [[light infantry]] force in terms of intensity, firepower, and organizational structure. A paramilitary may also commonly fall under the command of a military, even despite not being part of the military or play an assisting role for the military in times of war.

==Types==
Depending on the definition adopted, "paramilitaries" may include:

* [[Irregular military]] forces: militias, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s, [[insurgency|insurgent]]s, [[terrorist]]s, and so forth
* The auxiliary forces of a state's military: [[National Guard (disambiguation)|National Guard]], [[Presidential Guard (disambiguation)|Presidential Guard]], [[Republican Guard (disambiguation)|Republican Guard]], [[State defense force|State Guard]], [[Home Guard]], [[Royal Guard]], and [[Imperial Guard]]
* Some [[police forces]], such as police [[SWAT Team]]s, or [[auxiliary police]] and Indonesia's [[Mobile Brigade Corps (Brimob)]] 
* [[Gendarmerie]]s, such as Egyptian [[Central Security Forces]] and [[National Guard of Russia|Russia's National Guard]]
* [[Border guard]]s, such as Russia's [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Border Guard Service]], [[Australian Border Force]] and India's [[Border Security Force]]
* The United States' [[Federal Protective Forces]]
* Security forces of ambiguous military status: [[internal troops]], [[Railroad Guards (disambiguation)|railroad guards]] or [[railway troops]]
* Semi-militarized law enforcement personnel, such as [[SWAT|SWAT teams]] in the United States and a number of other countries
* [[Volunteer Defence Corps (disambiguation)|Volunteer Defence Corps]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, such as [[Volunteer Defense Corps (Thailand)|Volunteer Defence Corps]] in [[Thailand]], [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]] in [[Australia]], [[Shanghai Volunteer Corps]] and [[Royal Hong Kong Regiment]]

'''Pat Ahern''' is an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Roman Catholic]] priest, traditional musician, composer, and the founder, artistic director and producer (1974–1997)  of [[Siamsa Tíre]], the Irish National Folk Theatre which appeared throughout Ireland and on three continents.

==Life==
He was born in 1932 in Leitrim Middle, Moyvane (formerly Newtownsandes), north [[County Kerry|Kerry]] into a family immersed in [[Irish traditional music]]. His mother played traditional fiddle, as did his cousin Barney Enright of Moyvane. Pat's brother Seán is a singer and plays the uilleann pipes. Pat learnt the fiddle from his mother, and Irish step-dancing from the famous Kerry dance master Jeremiah Molyneaux.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Ahern, ''Kerryman'' North Edition, 19 09 2007, "Where did it start?" p. 115. See also Daithí Kearney, Ahern entry, Vallely, Fintan (ed.) ''Companion to Irish Traditional Music'', Cork University Press 2011, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Pat attended primary school in Moyvane (1938–1944), subsequently enrolling at St Michael's College, Listowel (1944–1948). He studied for the Catholic priesthood at [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]] National Seminary (1950–1957); while there he studied piano and organ under Charles O'Callaghan. He was ordained in 1957, and that year appointed curate in St. John's Parish [[Tralee]], County Kerry, with special responsibility for liturgical music. There he founded St. John's Gregorian Choir.

In 1959 he studied for the B.Mus. degree at [[University College, Cork]] under [[Aloys Fleischmann]], with [[Tilly Fleischmann]] as his piano teacher. He graduated in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;John O’Keeffe, Ahern entry, Harry White and Barra Boydell (eds.), ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', UCD Press, Vol. 1, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he was sent to the Catholic Communications Centre, Booterstown, Dublin, to study Radio and Television production and to set up and direct a Radio Production and Training Unit for clergy and religious. He produced a weekly religious radio programme for RTÉ radio, entitled ‘Network’. Recalled to Kerry in 1973, he was released from parish work by his bishop to devote himself to his work on folk theatre. In 1965 he had founded the group Siamsóirí na Ríochta [Entertainers of the Kingdom] out of which in 1972 developed Siamsa Tíre [Entertainment of the Land], the Folk Theatre of Ireland.

==Pageants==
In 1958, a year after taking up his duties as curate in the parish of Tralee, Pat Ahern devised and produced a pageant based on the story of [[Lourdes]] entitled ''Massabielle'', involving the parish choir, parish societies and theatre groups, in a celebration to mark the centenary of the Lourdes apparitions. It was presented in the Catholic Young Men's Hall, Tralee.
In 1959 he produced a second parish pageant: ''Bethlehem'', the story of Christmas. Then 1963 saw the production of a third parish pageant: ''Golgotha'', the story of the Passion of Christ, involving a cast of 120, in the style of the celebrated Passion Play at [[Oberammergau]] in [[Bavaria]]. In 1964 ''Massabielle'' was reproduced in Tralee.

Later pageants:
* 1988 – ''Massabielle'' presented in Knocknagoshel by the people of Knocknagoshel parish
* 1996 – dance performance in [[Killarney Cathedral]] during the ordination of Dr William Murphy as new bishop of Kerry commemorating the monastic tradition of the diocese
* 1999 – ''Dance of Life'', the story of salvation, to celebrate the new millennium in the diocese of Kerry; cast of 200, choir of 800 recruited from all the parishes of the diocese Music score by Aidan O’Carroll, 12,000 attended
* 2002 – ''Críost Liom'', a stage presentation of the life of Blessed [[Edmund Ignatius Rice]], to mark the bicentenary of the founding of the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] and [[Presentation Brothers]], at the RDS Concert Hall in Dublin
* 2005 – ''Song of the Living Stones'', the story of Christianity in Kerry, presented in Killarney Cathedral to commemorate the 150th anniversary of its consecration
* 2008 – Nov 15–25 ''Massabielle'' in Tralee to mark the 150th anniversary of the apparitions of Lourdes.

== Folk Theatre by Siamsóirí na Ríochta [The Entertainers of the Kingdom] of Kerry ==
In 1964 Ahern initiated a series of experiments in the promotion of traditional Irish folk culture with a small group of musicians, singers and dancers, drawn from the cast of ''Golgotha'', and using the medium of the theatre as a focus for the experiments. In1965 the Irish television producer, [[Liam Ó Murchú]] of [[RTÉ]], commissioned four 30-minute TV programmes by the group for the Irish Music TV series ''Aililiú''. Thenceforward the group was known as "Siamsóirí na Ríochta" – The Entertainers of the Kingdom (of Kerry).

In 1968 the first Folk Theatre production was presented by the group in Tralee, twice weekly through July and August. They called the new show, ''SIAMSA'', Irish for "a coming together for merrymaking".&lt;ref&gt;Pat Ahern, ''Kerryman'' North Edition, 19 09 2007, "Where did it start?" p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In January and May 1969 ''SIAMSA'' was presented at the Dublin Peacock Theatre and at the [[Abbey Theatre]], in 1970 in the Abbey Theatre and the same year in the [[Cork School of Music]], at the invitation of the [[Joan Denise Moriarty]]'s Cork Ballet Company, and then on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] 1971 at the [[Cork Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cork Examiner'', 4 Oct 1970, 18 March 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; At Christmas 1971 the Siamsa Tíre company presented a special Christmas show on RTE television: ''Coinnle na Nollag''.

In 1972, at the request of Éamonn Casey, Bishop of Kerry, and Brendan O'Regan, Chairman of [[Bórd Fáilte]], the Irish Tourist Board, a ten-year plan was drawn up by Ahern for the development of the Tralee folk theatre, now known nationally as ''Siamsa Tíre''. The first appearance of the newly constituted group took place in Galway, at the [[Taibhdhearc]] theatre, in April 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Phelan: ''Dance in Ireland – Steps, Stages and Stories'', Cambridge Scholars Press 2014, Ch. 7, pp.153–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Bishop Casey recalled Ahern from Dublin to Kerry, and released him from diocesan commitments to work full-time on the new folk theatre project in Tralee.&lt;ref&gt;Daithí Kearney, "Pat Ahern of North Kerry, Conference Review: The First International Conference on Irish Music and Musicians", ''Musicology Review 6'', 2010, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1974 Siamsa Tíre, The National Folk Theatre of Ireland==
In 1974 Siamsa Tíre was incorporated as a company, funded by Bord Fáilte, the Irish Tourist Board, and by Roinn na Gaeltachta (the government department for Irish-speaking districts); Pat Ahern was artistic director and Martin Whelan the manager until his death in 2002. Ahern's aim: "To provide through the medium of the theatre an attractive means of accessing our rich cultural heritage. … The Irish language enshrines a vast reservoir of story, poetry and song that is unique among the cultures of the world. Irish scholars, collectors and musicians have left a veritable library of Irish songs and dance tunes, many of which have never been sung or played to the living generations." Siamsa Tíre was to seek ways "of bringing these lost treasures to the ears of future audiences, in new and evocative settings, thus making them familiar again and musically interesting to the contemporary ear."&lt;ref&gt;Pat Ahern, cited in Dónal Nolan, "40th Anniversary of Siamsa Tíre National Folk Theatre", ''Kerryman'' North Edition, 14 05 2014, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of rural training centres was a key concept of Siamsa Tíre's Founding Document of 1972. The rural centre, Tithe Siamsa (Siamsa houses), was to serve as a meeting-place for the people of the district, to provide experience of and training in music, dance and story-telling, and a filter-point where the native talents and folk wealth of the district would be assembled and researched. The first house, "Teach Siamsa", opened in 1974 at Finuge, north Kerry; it focused on the north Kerry dance tradition. The second opened the following year at Carraig in the west Kerry Gaeltacht, with a focus on the Irish language tradition.&lt;ref&gt;See Sharon Phelan: ''Dance in Ireland – Steps, Stages and Stories'', Cambridge Scholars Press 2014, Ch. 7, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Siamsa Tíre moved into the refurbished Theatre Royal Cinema in Tralee. From 1982 Ahern began collaborations with artists from other folk traditions, among others with Argentinian, Bulgarian and Spanish dancers. Up to 1985 the members of the company had all been amateurs, employed on a part-time basis; now a core group of four professionals was established. An educational programme for school visits was devised. In 1991 the company moved into a specially built theatre in Tralee. It opened with a new production, ''Ding Dong Dedero – Forging the Dance'', which explored the process of acquiring one's tradition through the story of young Jerry Molyneaux, son of a north Kerry blacksmith, who became the most influential dance master in Munster, and whose dance has been preserved as a key ingredient of the Siamsa Tíre idiom of folk theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Ahern, interview of 2013 with Sharon Phelan, cited in ''Dance in Ireland – Steps, Stages and Stories'', Cambridge Scholars Press 2014, Ch. 7, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of Siamsa Tíre was summed up by the writer [[Frank Delaney]] in 1976 just before the company's first tour to the United States: 
:Somewhere in there when the dance is high and the music lively there's an echo of all times past, remembered and forgotten. Times that are getting more remote in a world that's intent on bringing news of the future at great speed to people of the present. But there's a need for the past, a need for roots. The search for truth, that great intellectual excursion, often gains its momentum in the search for identity. In a time when identity cards are plastic and processed, Siamsa is a banner of cloth, of an old weave, from a timeless loom. And at the same time it's a very enjoyable evening's theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Delaney, "Siamsa Tíre", ''Cara Magazine'', Aer Lingus Dublin, Oct/Dec 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polish Sign Language''' ("Polski Język Migowy", PJM) is the language of the [[Deaf community]] in [[Poland]]. Its [[lexicon]] and [[grammar]] are distinct from the [[Polish language]], although there is a [[Manually Coded Language|manually coded]] version of Polish known as ''[[Signed Polish|System Językowo-Migowy]]'' (SJM, or Signed Polish), which is often used by interpreters on television and by teachers in schools.

==Manual alphabet==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Alfabet palcowy2.jpg|thumb|right]] --&gt;
Polish Sign Language uses a [[Polish manual alphabet|one-handed manual alphabet]] based on the alphabet used in [[Old French Sign Language]]. However, the language itself derives from [[German Sign Language]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4904">A '''Post canonical system''', as created by [[Emil Post]], is a string-manipulation system that starts with finitely-many strings and repeatedly transforms them by applying a finite set j of specified rules of a certain form, thus generating a [[formal language]]. Today they are mainly of historical relevance because every Post canonical system can be reduced to a [[string rewriting system]] (semi-Thue system), which is a simpler formulation. Both formalisms are [[Turing complete]].

== Definition ==

A '''Post canonical system''' is a triplet ('''A''','''I''','''R'''), where

* '''A''' is a finite alphabet, and finite (possibly empty) strings on '''A''' are called ''words''.
* '''I''' is a finite set of ''initial words''.
* '''R''' is a finite set of string-transforming rules (called ''production rules''), each rule being of the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;

                   h_0 &amp; \$'_1 &amp; h_1 &amp; \$'_2 &amp; h_2 &amp; \dots &amp; \$'_n &amp; h_n \\
\end{matrix}
}
{
                                      \downarrow
}
}
&lt;/math&gt;

where each {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}} is a specified &lt;u&gt;fixed&lt;/u&gt; word, and each ''$'' and ''$' '' is a &lt;u&gt;variable&lt;/u&gt; standing for an arbitrary word.  The strings before and after the arrow in a production rule are called the rule's ''antecedents'' and ''consequent'', respectively. It is required that each ''$' '' in the consequent be one of the ''$''s in the antecedents of that rule, and that each antecedent and consequent contain at least one variable.

In many contexts, each production rule has only one antecedent, thus taking the simpler form

: &lt;math&gt;g_0 \ \$_1 \ g_1 \ \$_2 \ g_2 \ \dots \ \$_m \ g_m \ \rightarrow \ h_0 \ \$'_1 \ h_1 \ \$'_2 \ h_2 \ \dots \ \$'_n \ h_n &lt;/math&gt;

The [[formal language]] generated by a Post canonical system is the set whose elements are the initial words together with all words obtainable from them by repeated application of the production rules. Such sets are [[recursively enumerable]] languages and every recursively enumerable language is the restriction of some such set to a sub-alphabet of '''A'''.

=== Example (well-formed bracket expressions) ===

 Alphabet: {[, ]}
 Initial word: []
 Production rules: 
 (1)       ''$'' &amp;rarr; [''$'']
 (2)       ''$'' &amp;rarr; ''$$''
 (3)       ''$''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''$''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''$''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[]''$''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 
 Derivation of a few words in the language of well-formed bracket expressions:
 
        []             initial word
        [][]           by (2)
        [[][]]         by (1)
        [[][]][[][]]   by (2)
        [[][]][][[][]] by (3)
        ...

==Normal-form theorem==
A Post canonical system is said to be in ''normal form'' if it has only one initial word and every production rule is of the simple form

: &lt;math&gt; g\$ \ \rightarrow \ \$h &lt;/math&gt;

Post 1943 proved the remarkable '''Normal-form Theorem''', which applies to the most-general type of Post canonical system:  
:Given any Post canonical system on an alphabet '''A''', a Post canonical system in ''normal form'' can be constructed from it, possibly enlarging the alphabet, such that the set of words involving only letters of '''A''' that are generated by the normal-form system is exactly the set of words generated by the original system.

[[Tag system]]s, which comprise a universal computational model, are notable examples of Post normal-form system, being also ''monogenic''.  (A canonical system is said to be ''monogenic'' if, given any string, at most one new string can be produced from it in one step &amp;mdash; i.e., the system is deterministic.)

==String rewriting systems, Type-0 formal grammars==
A [[string rewriting system]] is a special type of Post canonical system with a single initial word, and the productions are each of the form

: &lt;math&gt; P_1 g P_2  \ \rightarrow \ P_1  h P_2 &lt;/math&gt;

That is, each production rule is a simple substitution rule, often written in the form ''g'' &amp;rarr; ''h''.  It has been proved that any Post canonical system is reducible to such a ''substitution system'', which, as a [[formal grammar]], is also called a ''phrase-structure grammar'', or a ''type-0 grammar'' in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

'''Postal history''' is the study of [[postal system]]s and how they operate and, or, the study of the use of [[postage stamp]]s and [[Cover (philately)|covers]] and associated postal artifacts illustrating historical episodes in the development of postal systems. The term is attributed to [[Robson Lowe]], a professional [[Philately|philatelist]], [[stamp dealer]] and stamp [[auctioneer]], who made the first organised study of the subject in the 1930s and described philatelists as ''"students of science"'', but postal historians as ''"students of humanity"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Vivien J. | last=Sussex | year=1988 | title=Introducing Postal History | chapter=1 | page=5| publisher=[[British Philatelic Trust]] in conjunction with The Postal History Society, London }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More precisely, philatelists describe postal history as the study of rates, routes, markings, and means (of transport).

==A collecting speciality==
Postal history has become a philatelic collecting speciality in its own right. Whereas traditional philately is concerned with the study of the stamps ''per se'', including the technical aspects of stamp production and distribution, philatelic postal history refers to stamps as historical documents; similarly re postmarks, [[postcard]]s, envelopes and the letters they contain. Postal history can include the study of postal rates, postal policy, postal administration, political effects on postal systems, postal surveillance and the consequences of politics, business, and culture on postal systems; basically anything to do with the function of the collection, transportation and delivery of [[mail]]. The specialized area of philatelic history defines postal history as the study of rates charged for postal services provided, routes followed and special handling of letters. Areas of special interest include disrupted or transitional periods, such as wars and military occupations, and mail to remote areas.

The philatelic-based definition of the term developed as the discipline developed. Philatelic students discovered that understanding and authentication of stamps depended on knowing why postal authorities issued particular stamps, where they were used and how. For instance, a stamp apparently used before any other stamp of its type could be proved a [[Philatelic fakes and forgeries|forgery]] if it was [[postmark]]ed at a location known not to have received any stamps until a later date.

Much information is still not known about the workings of postal systems, and millions of old covers have survived, constituting a rich field of "[[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s" for analysis.

==Possible areas of study==
In studying or collecting any postal history subject some overlap is inevitable because it is impossible to separate the different areas that affect the mail from one another; transportation, rates, geography and subject are all intertwined, but the emphasis remains different depending on the chosen topic. The postal history topics described below are some of the better known and popular topics.{{according to whom|date=February 2017}}

===Geographically based studies===
* '''Regional studies''' are typically based on a geographical area, such as countries of origin, native districts, cities, towns or villages, places associated with family roots, or workplaces. In the past collectors usually based their studies on "mail from," but "mail to" and "mail through" a place expand the postal service story because outgoing mail mainly shows marking associated with the areas of study while incoming mail tells a much broader story and are now more likely to be included. It is best to select a topic to study that is broad enough because narrow geographical boundaries will likely bring frustration due to the lack of material available. Examples are: ''Postal History of [[Brno|Brünn]] 1638-1875'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0003/index0003a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Private and Foreign Post Offices in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scc-online.org/MemberExhibits/StThomasPOs/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Postal routes''' are alternate geographical based study areas that provide great variety due to the many places and services available along a route. For instance; a study of the [[Thurn und Taxis]] route from [[Antwerp]] to [[Florence]] via [[Mantua]] would include much of the early postal history of Western Europe and the ''Postal History of the First Transcontinental Railroad''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Ephemera/Postal.html&lt;/ref&gt; can show a good range of stamps, [[postal stationery|stationery]], and associated marking across 3,000 miles that started in 1869.

The [[era]] for a geographical based study can add dimension depending on the services available or the changes that took place. The period should seek to tell a complete story and not limit the chosen topic.

===Transportation based studies===
[[File:Cover Bahamas 1929 front.jpg|thumb|145px|[[First flight cover]] for [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] airmail route in 1929]]
[[File:Zeppelin mail-1934 Xmas flight Gibraltar-Brazil.jpg|thumb|145px|'''[[Zeppelin mail]]''' from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil via Berlin on the Christmas flight (12th South American flight) of 1934]]
* '''[[Aerophilately]]''' specialises in the study of [[airmail]]. Philatelists observe the development of [[mail]] transport by air from its beginning, and most aspects of airmail service have been extensively studied and documented by specialists, some of which are individually listed. [[Crash cover]]s, [[Imperial Airways]] Empire route mail to [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]], CAM (Contract Air Mail) or FAM (Foreign Air Mail) routes to and from the [[United States]] are a few topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/airmails_20001030/refreshercourse.asp?uID= Linns.com ''Airmail collecting can take you anywhere''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422120850/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/airmails_20001030/refreshercourse.asp?uID= |date=April 22, 2007 }} (retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Balloon mail]]''' was employed during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/category_2029986.html ''Siege of Paris Mail''] (retrieved 24 February 2007) Smithsonian [[National Postal Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; to get mail out of the city during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. Balloons can be both manned and unmanned but balloon mail is not a common form of mail transport.
* '''[[Ship cover|Maritime mail]]''' is a theme that offers a wide variety of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/paquebot_20041213/refreshercourse.asp?uID= Linns.com ''Paquebot mail begins at sea, postmarked on land''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208201616/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/paquebot_20041213/refreshercourse.asp?uID= |date=December 8, 2004 }} (retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Study of a particular [[shipping line]] like, [[Cunard Line|Cunard]], [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P &amp; O]], [[Danube]] steamers, South American packets or American [[steamboat]] mail are a few options as are; Ship Letter marks, mail between a mother country and its [[colonies]] or mail between two countries separated by seas or oceans. Many ships applied their own [[wikt:endorsement|endorsement]]s so collecting examples of all ships of a particular shipping line can be aspired to. [[Maiden voyage]]s and [[Shipwreck|wreck cover]]s are very desirable. [[Ship transport|Maritime]] mail rates changed frequently and occasionally varied for different shipping lines over the same route that could be due to [[treaty]] changes or arguments between countries that involved retaliatory rates. [[Navy|Naval]] mail can also fall in the Military mail category and are also known to apply identifying endorsements or [[postmark]]s.
* '''[[Railway mail]]''' refers to mail carried partly, or fully, by [[rail transport]] from its inception in 1830 between Liverpool and Manchester in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] until its decline in the late 20th century that include [[Railway letter stamp]]ed mail, [[Travelling Post Office|TPO]] and [[Railway post office|RPO]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/railway_103006/refreshercourse.asp?uID= Linns.com ''Processing mail in transit: the Railway Mail Service and railway post offices''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014021638/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/railway_103006/refreshercourse.asp?uID= |date=October 14, 2007 }} (retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; handstamps, instructional handstamps or manuscript notations, or even the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] (also mentioned as a geographic study above).
* '''[[Rocket mail]]''' is the delivery of mail by [[rocket]] or [[missile]] and is a specialised collecting area of aerophilately called [[Astrophilately]]. One of the early famous rocketeers was [[Stephen Hector Taylor-Smith|Stephen Smith]], a Secretary of the Indian Airmail Society, who launched 270 rockets between 1934 and 1944 of which 80 contained mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philatel2.com/jubilee/id313.htm Stamps of King George V Silver Jubilee - Stephen Smith] (retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other topics for consideration are: [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] rocket mail from 1936 or 1959 launches, Russian submarine-launched rocket mail, or reusable launch vehicle mail.
* '''[[Zeppelin mail]]''' is a popular topic for the mail carried on the [[Germany|German]] [[Zeppelin]] [[airship]]s between 1908&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/category_2032883.html Zeppelin &amp; Airship Mail: Pioneer Period (1783-1918)] (retrieved 24 February 2007) Smithsonian National Postal Museum&lt;/ref&gt; and 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/category_2040240.html Zeppelin &amp; Airship Mail: Developmental Period (1919-1945)] (retrieved 24 February 2007) Smithsonian National Postal Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Much mail exists because up to 12 tons was carried on each flight. Mail from within Germany and from the several trans-Atlantic flights are extant however mail from the famous [[Hindenburg disaster]] are very scarce.

===Subject based studies===

[[Image:Altbrief.jpeg|thumb|right|145px|1834 '''pre-adhesive mail''' with [[Wittingen]] straight-line town handstamp to [[Ebsdorfergrund|Ebsdorf]]]]
* '''[[Express mail]]''' is an accelerated delivery service for which the customer pays a surcharge and receives faster delivery. ''Haste Poste Haste'' letters of the 17th century can be considered precursors of modern Express mail as was the [[Pony Express]] mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/category_2032344.html Pony Express Mail] (retrieved 24 February 2007) Smithsonian National Postal Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The service for domestic mail is governed by a country's own [[postal administration]] but since 1998 the international accelerated delivery services are governed by the EMS Cooperative of the [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU). Studies of domestic, or international express mail are possible as are studies of the Express mail rates.
* '''[[Marcophily]]''' is the study of [[postmark]]s, [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]] and [[postal markings]] applied by hand or machine. Though not strictly speaking a postal history topic can be collected as such. It offers vast areas to select a topic for study or collection as the marcopholist is more interested in the details, style and design of the markings than the reason why and where a letter was sent. Large cities that have many [[post office]]s offer great study opportunities due to the vast range of handstamps or machine cancellations in use over any time period.
* '''[[Military mail]]''' is mail associated with any of the [[armed services]] or [[History of United Nations Peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] forces, or formed around any particular [[military campaign]], like the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s, [[Spanish Civil War]], [[World War I]] and II, or even the recent conflicts in [[Afghanistan]] or [[Iraq]]. Covers mailed from navy vessels are also widely sought, the cover usually having a distinctive postmark bearing the ship's name and date of mailing, the date often being of particular historical significance and interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/militaryPH_20021014/refreshercourse.asp?uID= Linns.com ''Give modern military postal history a try''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501102849/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/militaryPH_20021014/refreshercourse.asp?uID= |date=May 1, 2007 }} (retrieved 21 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many older letters from these sources, when available, provide insight into the conditions of the people involved.
* '''[[Parcel post]]''' is perhaps the least collected, or studied, area of postal history due to the size of potential material much of which is never saved. From 1883 Special labels were applied to parcels in Great Britain. International parcels handling tend to gather [[Customs]] evidence making for attractive material.
* '''[[Postal censorship]]''', both [[Openness|overt]] and [[covert]], has been performed on mail long before the World Wars of the 20th century and can include both civil and military censorship. It has mainly taken place during times of conflict though has also been performed during other times like; periods of [[civil disorder]] or a [[state of emergency]]. An example of covert postal censorship is the [[Black room|Cabinet noir]].
* '''Postal rates''' are an extensive area of study that can be made by country, time period,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/rates_20010716/refreshercourse.asp?uID= Linns.com ''Short rate periods sometimes yield treasures''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422122152/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/rates_20010716/refreshercourse.asp?uID= |date=April 22, 2007 }} (retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; or even currency.  Postal rates were often set bilaterally, by postal conventions between nations, such as the 1817 and 1837 postal treaties between France and Prussia, and the 1847 and 1853 conventions between the United States and [[Bremen]] (a city-state at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Richard F. (2006). ''Understanding Transatlantic Mail,'' Volume 1. American Philatelic Society. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stamp collecting|Stamp collectors]] may study the rates in effect during the time of issue of the postage stamps they collect thereby augmenting their collections.
* '''[[Postal stationery]]''' are mailable products, issued by postal authorities, such as [[envelope]]s, [[letter sheet]]s, [[postcard]]s, [[lettercard]]s, [[aerogram]]s or [[Wrapper (philately)|wrappers]], on which the amount of postage has usually been pre-printed with an [[imprinted stamp]] or ''[[Indicia (philately)|indicium]]'', at the rate required for a particular postal service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/postalstationery_20020114/refreshercourse.asp?uID= Linns.com ''Postal stationery offers collecting variety''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420155051/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/postalstationery_20020114/refreshercourse.asp?uID= |date=April 20, 2007 }} (retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Postal stationery is generally sold at [[post office]]s. Each stationery type can be an area of study in its own right but can also be studied by country or by time period.  Studies of mint (unused) postal stationery are considered to be traditional philately, while studies of how postal stationery was used are considered to be postal history.
* '''[[Pre-adhesive mail]]''' also called '''pre-stamp mail''' is mail used before the issuance of the [[Penny Black]] and [[Two pence Blue]] stamps on 6 May 1840 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and in other countries, mail used prior to the postal authority adopting their own adhesive labels. The material can range from court and government letters before official public mail services to distinctive town-marks worldwide.
* '''Prisoner-of-war mail''' can be a subcategory of either, or both, Military mail or Postal censorship.
* '''[[Registered mail]]''' are often used to mail items, or documents, considered valuable and need a [[chain of custody]] that provides more control than regular mail. The letters have their details recorded in a register to enable their location to be tracked and offer many distinctive handstamps. Many countries have issued special [[postal stationery]] for Registered mail expanding the possible areas being studied beyond regular registered letters. Earlier similar services were known as ''[[Money Letter]]s''

'''Prodelision''' is a form of [[elision]] in which the latter word loses its first vowels.

Example:

"Namqu(e) etsi nullum memorabile nomen&lt;br&gt;
femina(e) in poena (e)st, habet haec victoria laudem,&lt;br&gt;
exstinxisse nefas." (Aeneid 2.583-585)

The "e" of "est" elides in the second line, rather than the "a" of "poena."  This is very common in Latin with forms of the verb "esse."

'''Proto-Norse''' (also called '''Proto-Scandinavian''', '''Proto-Nordic''', '''Ancient Scandinavian''', '''Proto-North Germanic''' and a variety of other names) was an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language spoken in [[Scandinavia]] that is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] in the first centuries CE. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] language, and the language [[attested language|attested]] in the oldest Scandinavian [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions, spoken from around the 2nd to the 8th centuries CE (corresponding to the late [[Roman Iron Age]] and the [[Germanic Iron Age]]). It evolved into the dialects of [[Old Norse]] at the beginning of the [[Viking Age]] around 800 CE, which later themselves evolved into the modern [[North Germanic languages]] ([[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the [[North Germanic languages#Language boundaries|three Continental Scandinavian languages]], and their dialects).

==Phonology==

Proto-Norse phonology probably did not differ substantially from that of Proto-Germanic. Although the phonetic realisation of several phonemes had probably changed over time (as with any language), the overall system of phonemes and their distribution remained largely unchanged.

# {{IPAslink|n}} assimilated to a following velar consonant. It was {{IPAblink|ŋ}} before a plain velar, and probably {{IPA|[ŋʷ]}} before a labial-velar consonant.
# Unlike its Proto-Germanic ancestor {{IPAslink|x}}, the phoneme {{IPAslink|h}} was probably no longer a fricative. It eventually disappeared except word-initially.
# {{IPAblink|β}}, {{IPAblink|ð}} and {{IPAblink|ɣ}} were allophones of {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, and occurred in most word-medial positions. Plosives appeared when the consonants were lengthened ([[geminate]]d), and also after a nasal consonant. Word-finally, {{IPAblink|b}}, {{IPAblink|d}} and {{IPAblink|ɡ}} were devoiced and merged with {{IPAslink|p}}, {{IPAslink|t}}, {{IPAslink|k}}.
# The exact realisation of the phoneme {{IPAslink|z}}, traditionally written as '''ʀ''' in transcriptions of runic Norse (not to be confused with the phonetic symbol {{IPAslink|ʀ}}), is unclear. While it was a simple alveolar sibilant in Proto-Germanic (as in Gothic), it eventually underwent [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacization]] and merged with {{IPAslink|r}} towards the end of the runic period. It may have been pronounced as {{IPAblink|ʒ}} or {{IPAblink|ʐ}}, tending towards a [[trill consonant|trill]] in the later period. The sound was still written with its own letter in runic Old East Norse around the end of the millennium.

===Vowels===
The system of vowels differed somewhat more from that of Proto-Germanic than the consonants. Earlier {{IPA|/ɛː/}} had been lowered to {{IPA|/ɑː/}}, and unstressed {{IPA|/ɑi/}} and {{IPA|/ɑu/}} had developed into {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. Shortening of word-final vowels had eliminated the Proto-Germanic overlong vowels.

# {{IPA|/o/}} had developed from {{IPA|/u/}} through [[a-mutation|''a''-mutation]]. It also occurred word-finally as a result of the shortening of Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/ɔː/}}.
# The long nasal vowels {{IPA|/ɑ̃ː/}}, {{IPA|/ĩː/}} and {{IPA|/ũː/}} occurred only before {{IPA|/h/}}. Their presence was noted in the 12th century [[First Grammatical Treatise]], and they survive in modern [[Elfdalian]].
# All other nasal vowels occurred only word-finally, although it is unclear whether they had retained their nasality in Proto-Norse or had already merged with the oral vowels. The vowels {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} were contrastive, however, as the former eventually developed into {{IPA|/u/}} (triggering ''u''-mutation) while the latter was lowered to {{IPA|/ɑ/}}.
# The back vowels probably had central or front allophones when {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} followed, as a result of [[i-mutation|''i''-mutation]]:
#* {{IPA|/ɑ/}} &gt; {{IPA|[æ]}}, {{IPA|/ɑː/}} &gt; {{IPA|[æː]}}
#* {{IPA|/u/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʉ]}}, {{IPA|/uː/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʉː]}} (later {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/yː/}})
#* {{IPA|/ɔː/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɞː]}} (later {{IPA|[œː]}} or {{IPA|[øː]}})
#* {{IPA|/o/}} did not originally occur before {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}, but it was later introduced by analogy (as can be seen on the Gallehus horns). Its allophone was probably {{IPA|[ɵ]}}, later {{IPA|[ø]}}.
# Towards the end of the Proto-Norse period, stressed {{IPA|/e/}} underwent [[Vowel breaking|breaking]], becoming a rising diphthong {{IPA|/jɑ/}}.
# Also towards the end of the Proto-Norse period, [[Old Norse#Umlaut|''u''-mutation]] began to take effect, which created rounded allophones of unrounded vowels.

===Diphthongs===

At least the following diphthongs were present: {{IPA|/æi/}}, {{IPA|/ɑu/}}, {{IPA|/eu/}}, {{IPA|/iu/}}.

# {{IPA|/ɑu/}} was later rounded to {{IPA|/ɒu/}} due to ''u''-mutation.
# {{IPA|/eu/}} eventually underwent breaking to become the triphthong {{IPA|/jɒu/}}. This was preserved in [[Old Gutnish]], but simplified to a long rising {{IPA|/joː/}} or {{IPA|/juː/}} in other areas.
# As {{IPA|/iu/}} occurred exclusively in environments with ''i''-mutation, its realisation was probably fronted {{IPA|[iʉ]}}. This then developed further into {{IPA|[iy]}}, which then became {{IPA|/yː/}}.

===Accent===

Old Norse had a [[stress accent]] which fell on the first syllable. Several scholars have proposed that Proto-Norse also had a separate [[pitch accent]], which was inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and has evolved into the [[tonal accent]]s of modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], which in turn have evolved into the [[stød]] of modern [[Danish language|Danish]].&lt;ref&gt;Kock, Axel, 1901: Die alt- und neuschwedische Akzentuierung.

S.29–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recently advanced theory is that each Proto-Norse long syllable and every other short syllable received stress, marked by pitch, eventually leading to the development of the Swedish and Norwegian tonal accent distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Riad, Tomas, 1998: The origin of Scandinavian tone accents. I: Diachronica XV(1). S.63–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, quite a number of linguists have assumed that even the first phonetic rudiments of the distinction did not appear until the [[Old Norse]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffersen, Gjert, 2004: The development of tonal dialects in the Scandinavian languages.

==Attestations==
===Runic inscriptions===
[[Image:Einangsteinen inscription2.jpg|thumb|350px|Composite photograph of the [[Einang stone]] inscription (ca. 400)]]
The surviving examples of Proto-Norse are all runic inscriptions in the [[Elder Futhark]]. There are about 260 surviving Elder Futhark inscriptions in Proto-Norse, the earliest dating to the 2nd century.

====Examples====
* [[Øvre Stabu spearhead]], Oppland, Norway. Second century ''raunijaz'', ON ''raun'' "tester", cf. [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''røyne'' "try, test". [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''utröna'' "find out". The word formation with a suffix ''ija'' is evidence of [[Sievers' law]].
* [[Golden Horns of Gallehus|Golden Horn of Gallehus]] 2, South Jutland, Denmark 400 CE, ''ek hlewagastiz holtijaz horna tawido'', "I, Hlewagastis of Holt, made the horn." Note again the ''ija'' suffix
* [[Tune stone]], Østfold, Norway, 400 CE. ''ek wiwaz after woduride witadahalaiban worahto. [me]z woduride staina þrijoz dohtriz dalidun arbija sijostez arbijano'', I Wiwaz, after Woduridaz bread-warden wrought. For me Woduridaz, the stone, three daughters prepared, the most noble of heirs.
* The [[Einang stone]], near Fagernes, Norway, is dated to the 4th century. It contains the message ''[ek go]dagastiz runo faihido'' ([I, Go]dguest drew the secret), in O-N ''ek goðgestr rún fáða''. The first four letters of the inscription have not survived and are conjectured, and the personal name could well have been Gudagasti or something similar.
* [[Kragehul I|Kragehul spear]], Denmark, c. 500 CE. ''ek erilaz asugisalas muha haite, gagaga ginuga, he...lija... hagala wijubi...'' possibly, "I, Eril of Asgisl, was named Muha, ga-ga-ga mighty-ga (ga being most likely an abbreviation of indeterminable reference), (incomplete) [[hail]] I consecrate."
* The [[Björketorp Runestone]], Blekinge, Sweden, is one of three [[menhir]]s, but is the only one of them where, in the 6th century, someone wrote a curse: ''haidz runo runu falh'k hedra ginnarunaz argiu hermalausz ... weladauþe saz þat brytz uþarba spa'' (Here, I have hidden the secret of powerful runes, strong runes. The one who breaks this memorial will be eternally tormented by anger. Treacherous death will hit him. I foresee perdition.)
* The [[Rö runestone]], in [[Bohuslän]], Sweden, was raised in the early 5th century and is the longest early inscription: ''Ek Hrazaz/Hraþaz satido [s]tain[a] ... Swabaharjaz s[a]irawidaz. ... Stainawarijaz fahido.'' "I, Hrazaz/Hraþaz raised the stone ... Swabaharjaz with wide wounds. ... Stainawarijaz (Stoneguardian's) carved."

===Loanwords===
Numerous early Germanic words have survived largely unchanged as borrowings in [[Finnic languages]]. Some of these may be of Proto-Germanic origin or older still, but others reflect developments specific to Norse. Some examples (with the reconstructed Proto-Norse form):
* Estonian/Finnish ''kuningas'' &lt; *''[[Germanic kingship|kuningaz]]'' "king" (Old Norse ''kunungr'', ''konungr'')
* Finnish ''ruhtinas'' "prince" &lt; *''druhtinaz'' "lord" (Old Norse ''dróttinn'')
* Finnish ''sairas'' "sick" &lt; *''sairaz'' "sore" (Old Norse ''sárr'')
* Estonian ''juust'', Finnish ''juusto'' "cheese" &lt; *''justaz'' (Old Norse ''ostr'')
* Estonian/Finnish ''lammas'' "sheep" &lt; *''lambaz'' "lamb" (Old Norse ''lamb'')
* Finnish ''hurskas'' "pious" &lt; *''hurskaz'' "prudent, wise, quick-minded" (Old Norse ''horskr'')
* Finnish ''runo'' "poem, rune" &lt; *''rūno'' "secret, mystery, rune" (Old Norse ''rún'')
* Finnish ''vaate'' "garment" &lt; *''wādiz'' (Old Norse ''váð'')
* Finnish ''viisas'' "wise" &lt; *''wīsaz'' (Old Norse ''víss'')

A very extensive Proto-Norse loanword layer also exists in the [[Sami languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theil|first1=Rolf|chapter=Urnordiske lån i samisk|chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/8439830/Urnordiske_l%C3%A5n_i_samisk|title=Germansk filologi og norske ord.

===Other===
Some Proto-Norse names are found in Latin works, like tribal names like ''Suiones'' (*''Sweoniz'', "[[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]]"). Others can be conjectured from manuscripts such as ''[[Beowulf]]''.

==Evolution== 
===Proto-Germanic to Proto-Norse===
The differences between attested Proto-Norse and unattested [[Proto-Germanic]] are rather small. Separating Proto-Norse from Northwest Germanic can be said to be a matter of convention, as sufficient evidence from the remaining parts of the Germanic-speaking area (Northern Germany and the Netherlands) is lacking in a degree to provide sufficient comparison. Inscriptions found in Scandinavia are considered to be in Proto-Norse. Several scholars argue about this subject matter. Wolfgang von Krause sees the language of the runic inscriptions of the Proto-Norse period as an immediate precursor to Old Norse, but Elmer Antonsen views them as Northwest Germanic,&lt;ref&gt;''Runeninschriften als Quellen interdisziplinärer Forschung'', "The linguistic status of the Early Runic Inscriptions", Hans Frede Nielsen, Walter de Gruyter GmBH &amp; Co. KG 1998, {{ISBN|3-11-015455-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his views on Runic Script and related subjects might be considered extreme.

One early difference shared by the West Germanic dialects is the monophthongization of unstressed diphthongs. Unstressed *''ai'' became ''ē'', as in ''haitē'' ([[Kragehul I]]) from Proto-Germanic *''haitai'', and unstressed *''au'' likewise became ''ō''. Characteristic is also the Proto-Norse lowering of Proto-Germanic stressed ''ē'' to ''ā'', which is demonstrated by the pair [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''mēna'' and Old Norse ''máni'' (English ''moon''). Proto-Norse thus differs from the early West Germanic dialects, as West Germanic ''ē'' was lowered to ''ā'' regardless of stress; in Old Norse, earlier unstressed ''ē'' surfaces as ''i''. For example, the weak third-person singular past tense ending ''-dē'' appears in Old High German as ''-t'''a''''', with a low vowel, but in Old Norse as ''-ð'''i''''', with a high vowel.

The time that *''z'', a voiced apical alveolar fricative, represented in runic writing by the [[algiz]] rune, changed to ''ʀ'', an apical post-alveolar approximant, is debated. If the general Proto-Norse principle of devoicing of consonants in final position is taken into account, *''z'', if retained, would have been devoiced to {{IPAblink|s}} and would be spelled as such in runes. There is, however, no trace of that in the Elder Futhark runic inscriptions, so it can be safely assumed that the quality of this consonant must have changed before the devoicing, or the phoneme would not have been marked with a rune different from the [[sowilō]] rune used for ''s''. The quality of the consonant can be conjectured, and the general opinion is that it was something between {{IPAblink|z}} and {{IPAblink|r}}, the Old Norse reflex of the sound. In Old Swedish, the phonemic distinction between ''r'' and ''ʀ'' was retained into the 11th century, as shown by the numerous runestones from Sweden from then.

===Proto-Norse to Old Norse===
From 500 to 800, two great changes occurred within Proto-Norse. [[Germanic umlaut|Umlauts]] appeared, which means that a vowel was influenced by the succeeding vowel or semivowel: Old Norse ''[[wikt:gestr|gestr]]'' (guest) came from P-N ''{{lang|non|gastiz}}'' (guest). Another sound change is known as [[vowel breaking]] in which the vowel changed into a [[diphthong]]: ''hjarta'' from *''hertō'' or ''fjǫrðr'' from ''*ferþuz''.

Umlauts resulted in the appearance of the new vowels ''y'' (like ''[[wikt:fylla|fylla]]'' from *''fullijaną'') and ''œ'' (like ''[[wikt:dœma|dœma]]'' from *''dōmijaną''). The umlauts are divided into three categories, A-umlaut, i-umlaut and u-umlaut; the last was still productive in Old Norse. The first, however, appeared very early, and its effect can be seen already around 500, on the [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Spurkland|first=Terje|title=Norwegian Runes and Runic Inscriptions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDKqY-NWvUC|year=2005|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-1-84383-186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variation caused by the umlauts was itself no great disruption in the language. It merely introduced new [[allophone]]s of [[back vowel]]s if certain vowels were in following syllables. However, the changes  brought forth by [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] made the umlaut-vowels a distinctive non-transparent feature of the morphology and phonology, phonemicising what were previously allophones.

Syncope shortened the long vowels of unstressed syllables; many shortened vowels were lost. Also, most short unstressed vowels were lost. As in P–N, the stress accent lay on the first syllable words as P–N *''katilōz'' became ON ''katlar'' (cauldrons), P–N ''horną'' was changed into Old Norse ''horn'' and P–N ''{{lang|non|gastiz}}'' resulted in ON ''gestr'' (guest). Some words underwent even more drastic changes, like *''habukaz'' which changed into ON ''haukr'' (hawk).

'''Sharaf al-Din Khan b. Shams al-Din b. Sharaf Beg Bedlisi''' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: شەرەفخانی بەدلیسی, ''Şerefxanê Bedlîsî''; {{lang-fa|شرف‌الدین خان بن شمس‌الدین بن شرف بیگ بدلیسی}}) (949-1012/1543-1603-04)&lt;ref name="Iranica89"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Glassen |first=Erika | title= BEDLĪSĪ, ŠARAF-AL-DĪN KHAN | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2015-03-31|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bedlisi-saraf-al-din-khan-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[medieval]] [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[emir]] and a politician from the [[Emirate of Bitlis]].

But he is more known as a historian, writer and poet. He wrote exclusively in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Born in the Garmrood village, in central Iran, between Arak and [[Qom]], at a young age he was sent to the Safavid's court and obtained his education there.

He is the author of one of the most important works on medieval [[Kurdish history]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=R.

He created a good picture of Kurdish life and [[List of Kurdish states and territories|Kurdish dynasties]] in the 16th century in his works. Outside [[Iran]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish-speaking countries]], Sharaf Khan Bidlisi has influenced [[Kurdish literature]] and societies through the translation of his works by other scholars.

He was also a gifted artist, and a well-educated man excelling as much in mathematics and [[military strategy]], as he did in history.

==Early life==
Sharaf Khan Bidlisi was born on February 25, 1543, in the Markazi province, Iran in the Garmrood village, during the exile of his father. The Rojaki dynasty, which had ruled intermittently as an independent emirate from their capital of [[Bitlis]] since at least the 9th century, and therefore, he never took up the common tribal title of "[[Khan (title)|Khan]]", preferring instead the royal title of [[emir]] or [[Mir (title)|mir]], "prince." He was most commonly known as, Mir Sharaf (Prince Sharaf). Later his family was taken under protection of the [[Safavid dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=NK |title=Encyclopaedic Historiography of the Muslim World|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDdGPxC1stIC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=Sharaf+Khan+Bitlisi+died&amp;hl=o&amp;ei=6BxPTvXAFouP4gS0xdHaBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=snippet&amp;q=Sharaf%20Khan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was schooled at [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasb]]'s court, and wrote in 1596:{{quotation|"When I turned nine (in 1551) I entered the private harem (haram-i khass)... for three years (1551–1554) I served the family (Silsila) of that refined (pakiza atvar) shah as a page at the inner palace."|Sharaf Khan Bidlisi}}

Bedlîsî speaks of his education entailing instruction in the [[Quran]], readings in on the principles of the ''shari'a'', a piety and purity. Due to Shah Tahmasb's religious disposition, Bidlisi was introduced to religious scholars, who warned him against evil people, and instead encouraged friendship with the virtuous. And once Bidlisi attained maturity, he was thought the martial arts (sipahigira), [[archery]], [[polo]], [[Horse racing|racing]], [[swordsmanship]], and the precepts of [[chivalry]] – humanism and generosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=R.

In 1576 [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasb]] of the [[Safavids]] gives him the title the ''[[Mir (title)|Mir]]'' of ''Mirs''; appoints him leader of all [[List of Iranian Kurds|Iranian Kurdish]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=R.

Between 1578 and 1588, Sharafkhan virtually led all the Ottoman wars against the [[Persian people|Persians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=N. S.

He becomes the ''Mir'' of the ''Batlisi province''. As he turned 53, Sharafkhan gave the authority of his dynasty to his son ''Shamsaddin Bag Abu Alma'ali''.

==Sharafnama==
{{main article|Sharafnama}}
He was thinking for a long time to write a book about [[Kurdish history]], and finally in 1597 Sharaf Khan Bidlisi started his composition of his epic, ''[[Sharafnama]]''.

The ''Sharafnama'' divides its history into four parts. The first one deals with the five Kurdish dynasties that have enjoyed status as royalty (''Saltant''): the [[Marwanids]] of [[Diyarbakır|Amed]], the [[Hasanwayhids]] of [[Dinavar]] and [[Sharazor|Sharizur]], the ''Fadluyids'' of the Great Lur, the princes of little Lur, and finally, [[Saladin|Saladin the Great]] and the [[Ayyubids]]. The second part lists dynasties that have had coin struck and the ''khutba'' recited in their names. (The ''Khutba'' is a religious invacation pronounced at the Friday day prayers meeting that mentions the [[Prophet Muhammad|Prophet]], the first four caliphs and the current rulers). The third part numbers the families of the hereditary governors, while the fourth details the history of the mirs of ''Bitilis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Gunter|first=Michael |title=The A to Z of the Kurds|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbmTlG4_QxAC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Sharafnama&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=XQ9PTuHKNK_U4QTJ0fW1Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sharafnama&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote his works in [[Persian language|Persian]], and it was not until 1879 that it was translated into [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] ([[Kurmanji]]) by the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[polymath]] [[Mahmud Bayazidi]] (1797–1859). Its hand-written version is preserved in the [[Russian National Library]], and was published for the first time in 1986. In 1972, the [[Sorani]] version of ''Sharafnama'' was written for the first time by the late Kurdish scholar [[Abdurrahman Sharafkandi]] (1920–1991), also known as ''Mamosta Hajar''. In 1873–1875, the French scholar François Charmoy translated Sharafnama from Persian into French and published it in [[Saint Petersburg]], in Russia. Among many other languages, Sharafname has been translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], English, [[Turkic languages]], Russian, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

==Death==
He died in his own principality ([[Emirate of Bitlis]]) in 1603 at the age of 60, and left thousands of writings.

==Legacy==
Being one of the oldest books ever written by a Kurd, the creation of ''Sharafnama'' is a turning point in the history of Kurds and their rich [[Kurdish culture|culture]]. The fact that a Kurd, for the first time, put Kurdish culture under a spotlight is of special importance in contrast to other studies that were done before ''Sharafnama''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Bidlisi has a unique place in [[Kurdish history]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} After his ''Sharafnama'', a number of copies and other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere on rich Kurdish history. In the text of the Sharafnama, the empires of the Kurds parallel those of the Arabs, Persians and Turks, some, according to Bitlisi, reaching back over 4,000 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Sharaf khan's ''Sharafnama'' is today safely kept in [[Oxford]].

The '''Tamangic languages''', '''TGTM languages''', or '''West Bodish languages''', are a family of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken in the Himalayas of [[Nepal]]. They are called West Bodish by Bradley (1997).

==Languages==
The languages are:
*[[Tamang language|Tamang]] (several divergent varieties, with a million speakers)
*[[Gurung language|Gurung]] (two varieties with low mutual intelligibility)
*[[Thakali language|Thakali]] (including the Seke dialect; ethnically Tamang)
*[[Manang language|Manang]] language cluster: the closely related [[Manang language|Manang]], [[Gyasumdo language|Gyasumdo]], [[Nar Phu language|Nar Phu]], and [[Nyeshangte language|Nyeshangte]] languages.
*[[Chantyal language|Chantyal]]
*[[Ghale languages]] ([[Ghale language|Ghale]] and [[Kutang language|Kutang]]): spoken by ethnic Tamang, perhaps related to Tamangic.
*[[Kaike language|Kaike]] (moribund): may be the most divergent.

==Classification==
Tamangic is united with the [[Bodish languages|Bodish]] and [[West Himalayish languages]] in Bradley's (1997) "Bodish" and Van Driem's (2001) [[Tibeto-Kanauri languages|Tibeto-Kanauri]].

==Reconstruction==
Proto-TGTM has been reconstructed in Mazaudon (1994). (Note: '''TGTM''', which is another name used to refers to the Tamangic branch, stands for [[Tamang language|'''T'''amang]]-[[Gurung language|'''G'''urung]]-[[Thakali language|'''T'''hakali]]-[[Manang language|'''M'''anang]].)

==History==
In 2002 the [[Esperantic Studies Foundation]] (ESF) started the project to support linguistic study of Esperanto. ESF hired [[Bertilo Wennergren]] to plan and create the first phase of the project, which finished at the end of April 2003. Wennergren was aided by [[Ilona Koutny]], [[Jouko Lindstedt]], [[Carlo Minnaja]], [[Christopher Gledhill]], and [[Mauro La Torre]].

In 2006 planning of the [[Parola tekstaro de Esperanto]] (''[[Speech corpus]] of Esperanto'') was started.

==Similarities with Confucian thoughts==
The Kural text (called ''Tirukkural'', meaning "Sacred Verses") and the [[Confucian thought|Confucian sayings]] recorded in the [[Analects|classic Analects of Chinese]] (called ''Lun Yu'', meaning "Sacred Sayings") resemble each other in many ways. Both [[Valluvar]] and [[Confucius]] focused on the behaviors and moral conducts of a common person. Similar to Valluvar, Confucius advocated [[legal justice]] embracing human principles, [[courtesy]], and [[filial piety]], besides the virtues of [[wiktionary:benevolence|benevolence]], [[righteousness]], [[loyalty]] and [[trustworthiness]] as foundations of life. Incidentally, Valluvar differed from Confucius in two respects. Firstly, unlike Confucius, Valluvar was also a poet. Secondly, Confucius did not deal with the subject of [[conjugal love]], for which Valluvar devoted an entire division in his work.&lt;ref name="GeoCities_Chinese"&gt;{{cite web

'''Tlgadintsi''' or '''Tlkatintsi''' ({{lang-hy|Թլկատինցի}}), '''Hovhannes Harutiunian''' ({{lang-hy|Հովհաննես Հարությունյան}}, 1860, Tlkatin village, [[Kharpert]], [[Western Armenia]] &amp;ndash; 1915) was an [[Armenia]]n writer and teacher noted for his leading role in rural literature.&lt;ref name="Armenian Literature 2005, pp. 497-498"&gt;The Heritage of Armenian Literature, By Agop J. Hacikyan, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, Wayne State University Press, 2005, pp. 497-498&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with giving the first authoritative response to a call from Constantinople's Armenian intelligentsia, issued in the early 1890s, for writing firmly rooted in the village life of historic Western Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Թլկատինցին եւ Իր Գործը [Tlgadintsin Yev Ir Kordzə] (Tlgadintsi And His Works), Baikar Press, Boston, 1927, p. 24 [ԻԴ] of foreword by Arshag Chobanian (Archag Tchobanian).&lt;/ref&gt; His unique realist works range from probing the darkest corners of village life to revisiting cherished moments of childhood. Through his esteem as a mentor and his power as a writer he opened the way for a new generation of important writers such as [[Rupen Zartarian]], Peniamin Noorigian, Vahé Haig, [[Vahan Totovents]], [[Hamasdegh]], and others.              
                                 
==Early life and education==
He was born in 1860 in the village of Tlgadin (present-day Kuyulu) ten miles south of Kharpert. His father was a farmer who died when Tlgandintsi was quite young, leaving him and his mother in poverty. Despite their misfortune his mother persevered and enrolled him in the parish school to begin his education. On finishing the parish school he continued his education at the Smpadian School in Kharpert, where his courses included classical Armenian, grammar, geography, and mathematics.

==Career and outlook==
By 1878 he had completed his studies at the Smpadian School and embarked on his dual career as village schoolmaster and journalist, this in the immediate aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 which had left the Armenian populace of the Ottoman Empire in widespread misery.&lt;ref&gt;Tlgadintsi, Գյուղին Կյանքը [Kyughin Gyankə] (Village Life), Yerevan, "Hayastan" Publishing, 1966, p. 4, in foreword by Լուսիկ Կարապետյան (Loosig Garabedian).&lt;/ref&gt; He found his first teaching position in the village of Chunkoush (Çüngüş), and he established himself as a writer with the reports he sent to the Constantinople newspapers "Arevelk" and "Masis" through the 1880s. In 1893, responding to the call of Constantinople's Armenian literati, he emerged as a distinctive new voice in fiction with the publication in the newspaper "Hairenik"  of ''Emily'', a satirical sketch about an American missionary and her activities in an Armenian village. This work, the first he signed with the name "Tlgadintsi", was welcomed by the critics and enthusiastically received by the readers.

Tlgadintsi spent his whole life in the immediate environs of Kharpert. His stories focus exclusively on the psychology, values and interpersonal relationships of completely ordinary villagers. In an era when thousands of his compatriots were abandoning their homeland for America, he stood staunchly opposed to the wave of emigration.  He also took a dim view of the famed revolutionary parties of his day and was never affiliated with any of them. At the same time, he was seriously concerned with the inroads that missionary Protestantism was making among Armenians, an issue at the core of  ''Just One Glass''. 
[[File:Tlgadintsi &amp; graduates of his school, 1910.jpg|280px|thumbnail|Tlgandintsi and the graduates of his school in 1910]]
In 1884 Tlgadintsi was appointed director of his alma mater and left his teaching duties to settle in Kharpert. In 1887 he founded the Central National School in Kharpert and in 1888 became its director, a post which he held continuously, with one exception [see below], until his death in 1915. The school stood in Kharpert's Upper Quarter next to St. Hagop church and was commonly known as the Central School or "Red College" because its exterior was painted red. It was also simply designated with Tlgadintsi's name. Its advanced level included courses in Armenian secular and church history, classical and modern Armenian, grammar and composition, English, English literature, French, French literature, Turkish and Turkish composition, mathematics, music, and physics.

In 1895, at the height of the [[Hamidian massacres]], the school was attacked by an anti-Armenian mob and totally burned to the ground. With the return of normalcy, Tlgadintsi and some colleagues managed to open a few classes in a building in the Lower Quarter of Kharpert, while work to rebuild the Central School at its original site was undertaken with the financial help of Kharpert educational associations in the United States. The move back to the original location took place in 1900. The rebuilt school continued to be called the "Red College" even though it was no longer painted red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houshamadyan.org/en/mapottomanempire/vilayetofmamuratulazizharput/harput-kaza/education-and-sport/schools-part-i.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925003914/http://www.houshamadyan.org/en/mapottomanempire/vilayetofmamuratulazizharput/harput-kaza/education-and-sport/schools-part-i.html |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1903, in the course of a crackdown on Armenian militants, Tlgadintsi was arrested and thrown in jail for nine months as a supposed subversive, along with his leading disciple, Rupen Zartarian. Upon his release he was allowed to resume his post as director of the Central School.

==Last moments==
When Turkish forces arrived in Kharpert in 1915 to destroy its Armenian community, Tlgadintsi found temporary hiding in the house of a childhood Muslim friend of his to whom he entrusted his large collection of unpublished works for safekeeping. Quite notably, the collection included his accounts of the infamous massacres of 1895. One day he was completely devastated to learn that in a moment of panic his friend had set fire to the entire collection and reduced it to ash.&lt;ref&gt;Թլկատինցին և Իր Գործը [Tlgandintsin Yev Ir Kordzə] (Tlgadintsi And His Works), Baikar Press, Boston 1927, pp. 59-60 [ՁԹ-Կ] of foreword by Arshag Chobanian (Archag Tchobanian).&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Tlgadintsi was found out and thrown into a jail crowded with other Armenian notables. At this point he learned that his wife, six daughters, and son had already been sent to their deaths on the deportation routes. Nevertheless, under those grim circumstances he still managed to show a few flashes of his characteristic wit to lift the spirits of his fellow prisoners. 

On June 20th 1915, he was murdered in a gorge near his birthplace in the course of the Armenian Genocide.
