The '''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000''' was a [[land reform]] enforced by an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] that was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 3 May 2000, and received Royal Assent on 9 June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2000/asp_20000005_en_1 Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721215510/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2000/asp_20000005_en_1 |date=July 21, 2009 }} www.opsi.gov.uk, accessed 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Item ==
The Act officially brought to an end  annual [[feu (land tenure)|feu]] duties, a vestige of [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[land tenure]], on 28 November 2004 (that is, [[St. Martin's Day|Martinmas]], as the Act required the "appointed day" to be one of the [[Scottish term days]]). [[Tommy Sheridan]] was one of a number of MSPs who drove this change through the Scottish Parliament.  After that date, the former [[vassal]] of an estate was the sole owner of the land, and the former [[Lord|superior]]'s rights were extinguished. For a further two years, the superior had the option of claiming compensation; this was fixed at a single payment of a size that, when invested at an annual rate of 2.5%, it would yield interest equal to the former feu duty. Because [[inflation]] had eroded the value of duties, which had been fixed many years before, this payment was in most cases extremely small compared with the current value of the land.

In consequence of this change in the legal basis of land-holding, the Act also reformulated the legal basis on which conditions on the use of land can be specified in the title to ownership of that land. Such title conditions (known variously as real burdens and real conditions in the prior law) were combined into "real burdens". Prior to the Act, a superior could choose to enforce title conditions, or grant a consent or waiver (usually for payment) allowing the land owner to disregard the condition even if otherwise neighbouring property owners might wish to enforce the condition. Existing conditions which were enforceable only by the superior were abolished, and only conditions enforceable by the owners of neighbouring property or by certain legal bodies on public policy grounds were retained. Transitional arrangements allowed superiors who were also neighbouring property owners to convert the old title conditions to benefit their land and hence themselves as owners of that land rather than themselves as feudal superior.

Following this change in the legal basis for title conditions, the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] was passed, reconstituting the mechanics of how new real burdens and servitudes could be created. These two Acts, together with a third Act (the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]), commenced on 28 November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm |title=Age-old Scots property rights end |date=28 November 2004 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Abraham M. George''' is an Indian-American businessman, academic, and philanthropist. He is the founder of  [[The George Foundation|The George Foundation (TGF)]], a non-profit organization based in [[Bangalore]], [[India]] dedicated to the welfare and empowerment of economically and socially disadvantaged populations in India. His foundation has initiated numerous projects in poverty alleviation, education, healthcare, lead poisoning prevention, women's empowerment, and press freedom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shantibhavanonline.org/our-mission/our-team/dr-abraham-m-george/|title=Dr. Abraham M.

Notable projects he has spearheaded include the creation of [[Shanti Bhavan]], a free K-12 boarding school of international standards for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the creation of the now prestigious [[Indian Institute of Journalism &amp; New Media]], a graduate school of journalism in Bangalore where he currently serves as the [[Dean (education)|dean]]. He also pioneered the successful effort to remove [[lead]] content from gasoline throughout India in April 2000 and was instrumental in the creation of the National Referral Centre for Lead Poisoning in India that undertook preventive initiatives against lead poisoning from paint, lead smelters and other sources. Baldev Medical &amp; Community Centre run by his foundation offers outpatient care to 17 villages near Shanti Bhavan, and has built free quality homes in 7 villages. He pioneered a major women's empowerment project that employed over 150 poor families in a banana farm on 200 plus acres -- one of the largest of its kind in South India. 

In addition to his philanthropic efforts, George is an Adjunct Professor at [[Stern School of Business]], [[New York University]].

He has also been recognized as one of the world's leading [[social entrepreneur]]s.&lt;ref name="The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century"&gt;{{cite book|

==Early years==
George was born and brought up in the seaside city of [[Trivandrum]], [[Kerala]], at the southwestern tip of [[India]].  He is the second son of Mathew and Aleyamma George, one of four children.

[[File:The George Foundation - Abraham George Army1.jpg|thumb|Dr. George during the army days|275px|left]]

At fourteen, George was admitted to the prestigious [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] in [[Khadakwasla]].  He subsequently went on to graduate as a Second-Lieutenant in a medium artillery regiment of the [[Indian Army]].  George's first posting in 1966 was to the Northeast Frontier that borders [[China]], following the [[Chinese invasion of 1962]]. He is credited with establishing a medium artillery gun position at an altitude of 14,000 ft. in Sela Pass in the North East Frontier of the Himalayas.

The assignment  in Se La in Northeast Frontier of India ended abruptly after only ten months when George was injured in a [[dynamite]] explosion. Upon his return from convalescence, he was assigned to the Indo-Pakistan border where he served for nearly two more years and rose to the rank of Captain.".&lt;ref name="India Untouched"&gt;{{cite book|title =India Untouched: The Forgotten Face of Rural Poverty|isbn =1-59411-122-7|year =2005|publisher =Writers' Collective|last=George|first=Abraham|location=Cranston, RI}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=May 2016}} "George has spoken of his time in the army as formative experience: "There is, I suppose, some stage in each one’s life that has a greater impact on his future than all others. For me, it was these army experiences that helped shape much of my outlook on life."&lt;ref name="India Untouched"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=May 2016}}

In 1968, the third year of George's service, he suffered a [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] disability that would plague him for the rest of his life.  At the time, [[physician|doctors]] in India were not trained to tackle his medical condition; it required specialized [[surgery]].  By this point, his mother was already in the [[United States]], teaching physics and working for [[NASA]] as a research scientist. His mother's position afforded him the opportunity to come to America where he could have his surgery and start a new life.

==Education and professional life==
George joined his mother in [[Alabama]] during the heyday of the [[segregationist]] governor, [[George Wallace]]. He found the transition to be overwhelming, later writing of it: "I felt I had gone to another world, not simply another country".&lt;ref name="India Untouched"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=May 2016}}

Soon after arriving in America, George attended [[New York University]]'s [[Stern School of Business]] as a graduate student.  During that time, he [[naturalization|became an American citizen]].&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Gross | first = Daniel | author-link = | title = Return of the Native Son | newspaper = STERNbusiness  | date = Fall–Winter 2006| url =http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/sternbusiness/fall_2006/nativeSon.html |  accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He specialized in developmental economics and international finance, and soon after completing his [[doctoral]] work he decided to enter the [[teaching]] profession.  Later, [[Chemical Bank]], now part of [[JP Morgan Chase]] Bank, offered George a job as an officer in the bank which he accepted.&lt;ref name="India Untouched"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=May 2016}}

George had worked for Chemical Bank for two years when he decided in 1976 to start his own company, [[Multinational Computer Models]], Inc (MCM), which would offer computerized systems to large multinational corporations to enable them to deal with their international financial risks. MCM subsequently formed a joint venture with the global investment bank [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] where George served as the Chief Consultant and [[Managing Director]] of its new operations.  In 1998, George sold MCM to [[SunGard Data Systems]], a Fortune 500 company, where he served as a Vice-Chairman for two years.&lt;ref name="India Untouched"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India Untouched|last=George|first=Abraham|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was on the boards of Vellore Christian Medical College &amp; Hospital, International Center for Journalists, and Human Rights Watch.

==The George Foundation and Shanti Bhavan Educational Trust==
{{main|The George Foundation}}

George returned to India in January 1995 after a long absence. His intent was to reduce the injustices and inequalities of which he had become aware and to this end he established The George Foundation, a non-profit charitable trust.&lt;ref name="India Untouched"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=May 2016}} One of his initial projects, Shanti Bhavan Residential School, offers world-class education and care to children from the poorest segment of India who are also from the dalit or "untouchable" castes. As of 2017, after 20 years of the school's operations, the first four batches have now graduated from college and are employed by global companies like Mercedes Benz, Goldman Sachs, Ernst &amp; Young and others -- an accomplishment that has no parallel in India's social history. The Shanti Bhavan story is told by the life-journey of five of its girls in a four-part NETFLIX documentary, Daughters of Destiny.

==Writing==

George was an expert in the international finance arena, authoring several books and articles on the topic:

*  ''International Finance Handbook'' (2 volumes), John Wiley &amp; Sons ({{ISBN|0-471-09861-2}})
*  ''Foreign exchange Management and the Multinational Corporation'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston ({{ISBN|0-03-046641-5}})
*  ''Protecting Shareholder Value: International Financial Risk Management'', Prentice Hall ({{ISBN|0-7863-0439-1}})

Since becoming a full-time [[philanthropist]], George has written several articles and has published two books:
*  ''India Untouched: The Forgotten Face of Rural Poverty'', Writer's Collective ({{ISBN|81-88661-18-X}}) - A description of Dr. George's initial 10 years of social work in rural India.
*  ''Lead Poisoning Prevention and Treatment: Implementing a National Program in Developing Countries'' --distributed by World Bank to governments of developing countries in 2001 for policy implementation.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

The '''Allied Control Council''' or '''Allied Control Authority''', known in the [[German language]] as the ''{{lang|de|Alliierter Kontrollrat}}'' and also referred to as the '''Four Powers''' ({{lang-de|Vier Mächte}}), was the governing body of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Allied-occupied Germany|Occupation Zones in Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] after the [[end of World War II in Europe]]. The members were the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]]. The organization was based in [[Schöneberg|Berlin-Schöneberg]]. The council was convened to determine several plans for postwar Europe, including how to change borders and transfer populations in Eastern Europe and Germany.  As the four Allied Powers had joined themselves into a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] asserting 'supreme' power in Germany, the Allied Control Council was constituted the sole legal sovereign authority for Germany as a whole, replacing the extinct civil government of [[Nazi Germany]].    

== Creation ==
Allied preparations for the postwar occupation of Germany began during the second half of 1944, after [[Battle of Aachen#Battle|Allied forces began entering Germany]] in September 1944. Most of the planning was carried out by the [[European Advisory Commission]] (EAC) established in early 1944. By 3 January 1944, the Working Security Committee in the EAC concluded that
{{quote|text=It is recognized that, in view of the chaotic conditions to be anticipated in Germany, whether a capitulation occurs before invasion or after invasion and consequent establishment of military government, an initial period of military government in Germany is inevitable and should be provided for.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum of the Working Security Committee, 3 January 1944, ''Foreign Relations of the United States 1944'', vol. I, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The EAC also recommended the creation of a tripartite US, Soviet, and British agency to conduct German affairs following the surrender of the Third Reich. The British representative at the EAC, [[William Strang, 1st Baron Strang|Sir William Strang]], was undecided on whether a partial occupation of Germany by Allied troops was the most desirable course of action. At the first EAC meeting on January 14, 1944, Strang proposed alternatives that favored the total occupation of Germany, similar to the situation following the [[First World War]] when Allied rule was established over the Rhineland. Strang believed that a full occupation would limit the reliance on former Nazis to maintain order within Germany.  He also believed that it would make the lessons of defeat more visible to the German population and would enable the Allied governments to carry out punitive policies in Germany, such as transferring territories to Poland. The main arguments against total occupation were that it would create an untold burden on Allied economies and prolong the suffering of the German population, possibly driving new revanchist ideologies. However, his final conclusion was that a total occupation would be most beneficial, at least during the initial phase.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States 1944, vol. I, pp. 141–144&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 1944, the US government established the United States Group to the Control Council for Germany, which served as a liaison group within the EAC for planning the future occupation of Germany. The chairman of this group was Brig. Gen. [[Cornelius Wendell Wickersham]].

As the German collapse approached, Strang became convinced that Germany was about to undergo a total collapse, in which case a total occupation and control would be inevitable. He even proposed a draft declaration to be issued by the Allied governments in case no political authority remained in Germany due to chaotic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum by Sir William Strang, 30 March 1945, ''Foreign Relations of the United States 1945'', vol. III, pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period, this prospect was feared by some Allied representatives.
 
After the [[death of Adolf Hitler]] on 30 April 1945, [[Karl Dönitz]] assumed the title of [[Reichspräsident|president of Germany]] in accordance with [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's last political testament]].  As such, he authorised the signing, of the unconditional surrender of all German armed forces, which took effect on 8 May 1945, and tried to establish a government under [[Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] in [[Flensburg Government|Flensburg]]. This government was not recognised by the Allies, and Dönitz and the other members were arrested on 23 May by British forces.

The [[German Instrument of Surrender]] signed in [[Berlin]] had been drafted by the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] and was modeled on the one used a few days previously for the surrender of the German forces in Italy.&lt;ref name="page_256"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/other/us-army_germany_1944-46_index.htm| title=The U.S. Army in the Occupation of Germany 1944–1946| first=Earl F.| last=Ziemke| publisher=Center of Military History United States Army| location=Washington, DC| year=1990| id=Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 75-619027| pages=256}} First Printed 1975-CMH Pub 30-6&lt;/ref&gt; They did not use the one which had been drafted for the surrender of Germany by the "[[European Advisory Commission]]" (EAC).  This created a legal problem for the Allies, because although the German military forces had surrendered unconditionally, no counterpart ''civilian'' German government had been included in the surrender.  This was considered a very important issue, inasmuch as Hitler had used the surrender of the civilian government, but ''not'' of the military, in 1918, to create the [[Stab in the back|"stab in the back" argument]].&lt;ref name="page_109"&gt;{{cite book| title=The U.S. Army in the Occupation of Germany 1944–1946| pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies understandably did not want to give any future hostile German regime any kind of legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.  Eventually, and determined not to accord any recognition to the Flensburg administration, they agreed to sign a four-power declaration of the terms of the German surrender instead.  On 5 June 1945, in [[Berlin]], the supreme commanders of the four occupying powers signed a common [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany]] (the so-called [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]] of 1945), which formally confirmed the total dissolution of the [[Third Reich]] at the death of [[Adolf Hitler]], and the consequent termination of  any German governance over the nation:
{{quote|text=The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority. The assumption, for the purposes stated above, of the said authority and powers does not effect the annexation of Germany.

[[Image:Allied control council.ogv|frame|right|250px|News broadcast from 1945 about the control council]]
This imposition was in line with Article 4 of the Instrument of Surrender that had been included so that the EAC document, or something similar, could be imposed on the Germans after the military surrender.  Article 4 stated that "This act of military surrender is without prejudice to, and will be superseded by any general instrument of surrender imposed by, or on behalf of the United Nations and applicable to GERMANY and the German armed forces as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Earl F. Ziemke [[#References|References]] [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/other/us-army_germany_1944-46_ch15.htm#b3 CHAPTER XV:The Victory Sealed] Page 258&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, of course, all German central civilian authority had ceased to exist with the death of Hitler and the fall of Berlin at the latest. These parts of the Berlin declaration, therefore, merely formalised the ''[[de facto]]'' status and placed the Allied military rule over Germany on a solid legal basis.

An additional agreement was signed on 20 September 1945 and further elaborated the powers of the Control Council.&lt;ref&gt;text in ''Department of State Bulletin'', October 7, 1945, pp. 515–521&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual exercise of power was carried out according to the model first laid out in the "Agreement on Control Machinery in Germany" that had been signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on 14 November 1944 in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box32/a298f04.html|title=Scanned original document at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library &amp; Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the work of the EAC. Germany was divided into four zones of occupation—American, French, British, and Soviet—each being ruled by the Commander-in-Chief of the respective occupation forces. "Matters that affect Germany as a whole," however, would have to be decided jointly by all four Commanders-in-Chief, who for this purpose would form a single organ of control. This authority was called the Control Council.

The purpose of the Allied Control Council in Germany, like the other [[Allied Commission|Allied Control Commissions and Councils]] which were established by the Allies over every defeated Axis power, was to deal with the central administration of the country (an idea that hardly materialised in the case of Germany, as that administration totally broke down with the end of the war) and to assure that the military administration was carried out with a certain uniformity throughout all of Germany.  The [[Potsdam Agreement]] of 2 August 1945 further specified the tasks of the Control Council.

== Operation ==
[[Image:Denazification-street.jpg|thumb|left|Removing an 'Adolf Hitler Street' sign, part of [[denazification]]]]On 30 August 1945, the Control Council constituted itself and issued its first proclamation, which informed the German people of the Council's existence and asserted that the commands and directives issued by the Commanders-in-Chief in their respective zones were not affected by the establishment of the Council.&lt;ref name=allied&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Allied Control Authority Germany |title=Enactment and Approved Papers of the Control Council and Coordinating Committee |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} The initial members of the Control Council were Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] for the Soviet Union, General of the Army [[Dwight Eisenhower]] for the United States, Field Marshal [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] for the United Kingdom, and General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] for France.

Subsequently, the Control Council issued a substantial number of laws, directives, orders, and proclamations. They dealt with the abolition of [[Nazism|Nazi]] laws and organisations, [[demilitarisation]], [[denazification]], but also with such comparatively pedestrian matters as telephone tariffs and the combat of venereal diseases. On many issues the council was unable to impose its resolutions, as real power lay in the hands of the separate Allied governments and their military governors, and the council issued recommendations that did not have the force of law. On 20 September 1945, the council issued Directive no. 10, which divided the various official acts of the Control Council into five categories:&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol 1, 95–96}}
* Proclamations – "to announce matters or acts of special importance to the occupying power or to the German people, or to both".
* Laws – "on matters of general application, unless they expressly provide otherwise".
* Orders – "when the Control Council has requirement to impose on Germany and when laws are not used".
* Directives – "to communicate policy or administrative decisions of the Control Council".
* Instructions – "when the Control Council wishes to impose requirements direct upon a particular authority".

Directive no. 11 of the same day made the work of the council more orderly by establishing English, French, Russian and German as the official languages of the council, and by establishing an official gazette to publish the council's official acts.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol 1, 97–98}}

Law no. 1 of the Control Council (also enacted on 20 September 1945) repealed some of the stricter Nazi laws enacted under the [[Third Reich]]. This established the legal basis for the council's work.

Directive no. 51 (29 April 1947), repealing Directive no. 10, simplified the council's legislative work by reducing the categories of legislative acts to Proclamations, Laws and Orders.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol 1, 27–29}}

===War criminals===
Directive no. 9 (30 August 1945) charged the legal division of the council with responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the London Agreement on the prosecution of German war criminals, signed in London on 8 August.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol 1, 45}}

Shortly after the commencement of the Nuremberg Trial, the council enacted Law no. 10 (20 December 1945), which authorized every occupying power to have its own legal system to try war criminals and to conduct such trials independently of the International Military Tribunal then sitting at Nuremberg.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol 1, 306–311}} Law no. 10 resulted from disagreements arising among the Allied governments regarding a common policy on war criminals and marked the beginning of the decline in inter-Allied cooperation to that effect. Following the conclusion of the Nuremberg Trial of Major War Criminals in October 1946, inter-Allied cooperation on war crimes totally collapsed.

On 12 October 1946, the council issued Directive no. 38, which, while trying to impose some common rules, allowed the four occupation governments discretion as to treatment of persons arrested by them for suspected war crimes, including the right to grant amnesty.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, pp. 12–48}}

===Dissolution of the German army and government agencies===
Order no. 1 of August 30, 1945 prohibited the wearing of uniform of the German Army, which now ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 47}}

An order dated September 10, ordered the recall of all German government agents and/or diplomatic representatives from the countries to which they were assigned.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 49}} Another order of the same day established procedure for disseminating information to the press on the council's work, ordering that a press release be issued following every meeting of the council.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 54–55}}

Directive no. 18 (November 12, 1945) provided for the dissolution of all German Army units, all within a time limit to be decided upon.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 188–190}} This directive reflects the policy taken by the western Allied governments of using German military units for their own logistical purposes, a move objected by the Soviet government. The complete dissolution of all German military units and military training was provided for in Law no. 8 (November 30, 1945), which became effective on December 1, 1945.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 223–224}}

===Restoration of order into German hands===
Law no. 4 (October 30, 1945) reestablished the German court system according to German legislation enacted prior to Hitler's rise to power.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 173–175}}

Directive no. 16 (November 6, 1945) provided for the equipment of the German police forces with light weapons to combat crime, while the carrying of automatic rifles was prohibited except with special Allied permission.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 182–183}}

Law no. 21 (March 30, 1946) provided for the establishment of labor courts to resolve labor disputes within the German population. These courts were to be run by German judges.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. III, 51–55}}

Gradually, the Allied governments relaxed their control over German political life, and on June 3, 1946, the Political Directorate of the Control Council recommended to hold municipal elections in the city of Berlin in October of the same year.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. III, 170}} On August 3, 1946, the council approved a new provisional constitution for Greater Berlin metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. IV, 32–47}} Another reform relating to Berlin took place on August 22, 1946, as the council approved a reform plan for the police of Greater Berlin, which assigned four assistants to the Berlin Chief of Police, each to oversee police work in each of the four occupation sectors in that metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. IV, 70–72}}

===Denazification and eradication of militarism===
Law no. 2 (October 10, 1945) provided for the total dissolution of the National Socialist Party, and its revival was totally prohibited.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. I, 131–132}} As part of the denazification policy, Directive no. 23 (December 17, 1945) prohibited any athletic activities that was being done as part of military or para-military training, prohibition to be effective as of January 1, 1946.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. IV, 304–305}}

Directive no. 24 (January 12, 1946) established a set of comprehensive criteria for the removal from public office those "who have been more than nominal participants in its (Nazi Party) activities" and provided for their removal from any civil service or work in civil organization, labor unions, industry, education or the press and any work other than simple labor. The category of persons to which the directive applied were those who held significant positions in the Nazi Party or those who joined prior to 1937, the time when membership became compulsory for German citizens.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. II, 16–44}}

In order to eradicate the influence of Nazi literature on the German population, Order no. 4 (May 13, 1946) prohibited the publication and dissemination of Nazi or militarist literature and demanded to hand over any existing such literature to the Allied authorities.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. III, 131–132}}

Law no. 31 (July 1, 1946) prohibited the German police authorities to conduct any surveillance of political activities by German citizens in the various occupation zones.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. IV, 1–2}}

Some reforms were symbolic in nature. Law no. 46 (February 25, 1947) proclaimed the [[abolition of Prussia]] as an administrative unit within Germany, citing past militarism associated with that name as the cause for the change. The Prussian government had already been abolished by Hitler in 1934. Part of the former territory of Prussia was no longer even populated by Germans, as it became part of Poland after most Germans had been forcibly relocated westward, while the rest of the territory of Prussia was divided among other German Länder.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. VI, 28–29}}

Law no. 57 (August 30, 1947) dissolved all German insurance companies that were connected with the [[German Labor Front]], established on May 1, 1933.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. VIII, 1–5}}

===Expulsion of German speaking minorities residing outside Germany===
One major issue dealt with by the Control Council was the decision made at the Potsdam Conference regarding the forced removal of German minorities from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland to Allied Occupied Germany. On November 20, 1945, the council approved a plan to that effect, to be completed by July 1946.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. I, 199–201}}  France, not having been a party to the Potsdam conference, reserved the right not to be bound by any agreements made there; and accordingly refused to accept German expellees into the French zone of occupation.

===Other issues===
On September 10, 1945 the council issued an appeal to the separate Allied military governors, requesting them to relax trade regulations between the four occupation zones, but this was only a recommendation, as each Allied government maintained the real power on such matters.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 56}}

On September 17, the council issued recommendations to the four occupying powers to establish tracing bureaus to assist displaced persons.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 57–61}}

On September 20, the council issued an order prohibiting fraternization between Allied military personnel and the German population, effective from October 1, except in cases of marriage or when a military governor decided to billet his soldiers with a German family.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 65}}

Law no. 5 (October 30, 1945) created the German External Property Commission, which was authorized to confiscate any German assets outside of Germany until the Control Council decided how to dispose of it in the interests of peace.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 176–180}} The composition of that commission was decided in Directive no. 21 (November 20, 1945).&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 198}}

Law no. 7 (November 30, 1945) regulated the distribution of electricity and gas in the various occupation zones.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 221–222}}

Law no. 9 (the same day) provided for the confiscation of all assets owned by the [[IG Farben]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]].&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 225–226}}

Law no. 32 (July 10, 1946) permitted the German local authorities to employ women in manual labor, this due to the shortage in manpower.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, vol IV, p. 9}} Supplement to Directive no. 14 (September 13, 1946) equalized the wages of female and minor workers with male workers.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. V, 98}}

Law no. 49 (March 20, 1947) abrogated the German law of 1933 which governed relations between the German government and the German Evangelical Church, while keeping the independence of that church in internal matters.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. VI, 58}} Law no. 62 (February 20, 1948) repealed all Nazi laws regulating the activities of churches in Germany.&lt;ref name=allied/&gt;{{rp|Vol. IX, 1–2}}

==Deterioration in inter-Allied cooperation within the council==

From the first, the French sought to exploit their position on the Control Council to obstruct aspects of Allied policy they saw as contrary to their national interest. De Gaulle had not been invited to the [[Potsdam Conference]], and accordingly the French did not accept any obligation to abide by the [[Potsdam Agreement]] in the proceedings of the Allied Control Council. In particular, they resisted all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole, and anything that they feared might lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government&lt;ref name="Ziemke 1990 114"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ziemke |first=Earl Frederick |title=The US Army and the Occupation of Germany 1944–1946 |publisher=[[Center of Military History, United States Army]] |date=1990 |pages=345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the Western Allies (especially the United States and the United Kingdom) and the Soviet Union subsequently deteriorated, and so did their cooperation in the administration of occupied Germany. Within each zone each power ran its own administration, such as the {{lang|fr|[[Gouvernement Militaire de la Zone Française d'Occupation en Allemagne]]}} (GMZFO) in [[Karlsruhe]], the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] ({{lang-ru|Советская военная администрация в Германии, СВАГ}}; {{lang|ru-Latn|Sovetskaia Voennaia Administratsia v Germanii}}, SVAG) in [[East Berlin]], the [[Control Commission for Germany - British Element]] (CCG/BE) in {{lang|de|[[Bad Oeynhausen]]|italic=no}}, and the [[Office of Military Government, United States]] (OMGUS) in [[West Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt]]. Already in September 1946, disagreement arose regarding the distribution of coal for industry in the four occupation zones, and the Soviet representative in the council withdrew his support of the plan agreed upon by the governments of the United States, Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;''Enactments and Approved Papers'', vol. IV, pp. 115–118&lt;/ref&gt; Against Soviet protests, the two English-speaking powers pushed for a heightened economic collaboration between the different zones, and on 1 January 1947 the British and American zones merged to form the [[Bizone]]. Over the course of 1947 and early 1948, they began to prepare the currency reform that would introduce the [[Deutsche Mark]], and ultimately the creation of an independent West German state. When the Soviets learned about this, they claimed that such plans were in violation of the Potsdam Agreement, that obviously the Western powers were not interested in further regular four-power control of Germany, and that under such circumstances the Control Council had no purpose any more. On 20 March 1948, Marshal [[Vasily Sokolovsky]], the Soviet representative, walked out of the meeting of the Council, never to return.

==After the breakdown==
As the Control Council could only act with the agreement of all four members, this move basically shut down the institution, while the [[Cold War]] reached an early high point during the [[Berlin Blockade|Soviet blockade of Berlin]]. The Allied Control Council was not formally dissolved, but ceased all activity except the operations of the [[Four-Power Authorities]], namely the management  of the [[Spandau Prison]] where persons convicted at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] were held until 1987, and the [[Berlin Air Safety Center]].

The Western powers instituted the [[Allied High Commission]] by September 1949 which remained in operation until 1955, and which approved the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. In Eastern Germany, the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet administration]] with its representative of the ACC was the highest authority, later this position was converted to a High Commissioner as well, until the [[German Democratic Republic]] gained sovereignty.

In establishing the Allied Control Council as the supreme authority for Germany and the sole legal repository of German national sovereignty, the Allied Powers of 1945 had envisaged that this sovereignty would eventually be passed on to a new German state, once a unified German government adequate for the purpose had been established.  So the breakdown of the Allied Control Council created a constitutional dilemma for both the nascent Federal Republic and GDR; as neither new state could claim formal approval of their constitutions from the full Control Council; and it was unclear how otherwise they might claim legitimate sovereignty over the parts of Germany under their control. 

The Allied Control Council met once again in 1971, leading to agreement on transit arrangements in Berlin. During the talks for unification of Germany in late 1989, it was decided to convene the ACC again as a forum for solving the issue of Allied rights and privileges in Germany.

Germany remained under nominal military occupation until 15 March 1991, when the final ratification of the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]] (signed on 12 September 1990) was lodged with the German Government.  This, as the final [[peace treaty]] signed by the four powers and the two German governments, formally restored full sovereignty to a [[German reunification|reunified Germany]]. It also meant the official end of the Allied Control Council.

The Council had held its final meeting on 2 October 1990, on the eve of the reunification of Germany, when it promulgated the formal documents – already agreed in advance – that authorized the inclusion of the city of Berlin in the German reunification. This was necessary because, until then, West Berlin was legally not a part of the Federal Republic of Germany, although it was administered by it. But with the allied Souveränitätserklärung (Sovereignty Declaration) agreed in the Council, the Federal Republic was allowed to assume legal control of Berlin at the moment of German reunification (although the withdrawal of the Allied military presence had to wait until 1994, in accordance with the timeframe provided by the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany).

== The Kammergericht building ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R98379, Berlin, Kammergericht.jpg|thumb|right|Kammergericht building in 1938 with its tower]]
[[Image:Berlin kammergericht.jpg|thumb|right|Kammergericht, seat of the court 1913–45 and since 1997]]During its short active life, the Allied Control Council was housed in and operated from the former building of the [[Kammergericht]], the supreme court of the state of [[Prussia]], which is situated in Berlin's [[Schöneberg]] borough in the American sector. 
The building itself had suffered some battle damage, losing a central tower, but had remained mostly usable. After the cessation of most council activity in 1948, all occupying powers quickly withdrew from the building to their respective sectors of the city, leaving the facility cold, empty and dark.

Only one [[four-power organization|four-power organisation]], the [[Berlin Air Safety Center]] (BASC), remained in the building from 1945 until December 31, 1990.  As a symbol of the BASC's continued presence, the four national flags of the occupying powers still flew over the large front doors every day. The only other signs of occupancy were the few, sparse office lights that emanated from a small corner room of the building—the BASC Operations Room—in the evenings.  Of the 550 rooms in the building, the BASC office complex and guards' quarters occupied fewer than forty.

Because of the BASC's presence, the building remained closely guarded by United States [[military]] guards, with access granted only to select members of the four powers.  This led to mysterious legends and ghost stories about the eerie, dark facility with its grand, granite statuary overlooking the beautiful park.

After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and the departure of Russian troops in August 1994 (a withdrawal that took place in accordance with article 4 of the [[Two Plus Four Treaty]]), the building was returned to the German government. In 1997, its erstwhile occupant, the [[Kammergericht]], moved in. It now functions as the supreme court of the state of [[Berlin]].

{{about||the New Zealand television show|Back Benches}}

In [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary systems]], a '''backbencher'''  is a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) or a legislator who holds no [[Minister (government)|governmental office]] and is not a [[Frontbencher|frontbench]] spokesperson in the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]], being instead simply a member of the "[[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]]".
The term dates from 1855.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/backbench Backbench]", Merriam-Webster Dictionary; accessed 2013.09.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the fact that they sit they sit physically behind the frontbench in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/a-b/81898.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Backbencher|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A backbencher may be a new parliamentary member yet to receive high office, a senior figure dropped from government, someone who for whatever reason is not chosen to sit either in the ministry or the opposition [[Shadow Ministry]], or someone who prefers to be a background influence, not in the spotlight. By extension, those who are not reliable supporters of all of their party's goals and policies and have resigned themselves or been forced to resign may be relegated to the back benches. For example, Clive Lewis becoming a backbencher after resigning from Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet over Brexit. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/08/clive-lewis-quits-shadow-cabinet-over-brexit-bill|title=Clive Lewis quits shadow cabinet as Brexit bill passes with huge majority|last=Stewart|first=Heather|last2=Asthana|first2=Anushka|date=2017-02-09|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parliamentary systems, backbenchers individually do not have much power to influence government policy. However, they play a role in providing services to their constituents, in relaying the opinions and concerns of their constituents, for example, asking the government for funding for a project in their constituency. Some backbenchers also sit on parliamentary [[committee]]s, where legislation is considered in more detail than there is time for on the floor of the House and, thereby, provide valuable input into the legislative process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Searing|first=Donald|date=July 1995|title=Backbench and Leadership Roles in The House of Commons|url=https://doi-org.ueaezproxy.uea.ac.uk:2443/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pa.a052543|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=Volume 48 Issue 3|pages=418-437|via=Oxford Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Wright Committee|The Wright Committee reforms]] introduction in the UK provided backbenchers with much more power in committees, giving Parliament greater control of its agenda, increasing backbench membership in committees vastly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heffernan|first=Richard|last2=Hay|first2=Colin|last3=Russell|first3=Meg|last4=Cowley|first4=Philip|date=2016|title=Developments in British Politics 10|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/978-1-137-49475-7|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-49475-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, since backbenchers generally form the vast majority of [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], collectively they can sometimes exercise considerable power especially in cases where the policies of the government are unpopular or when a governing party is internally split. Backbenchers carry a considerable amount of influence when the government majority is small, for example, [[Theresa May]]'s [[Second May ministry|government]] from 2017 on wards has been defeated sixteen times in the House of Commons, whereas, David Cameron's [[Second Cameron ministry|majority government]] was defeated three times in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=List of Government defeats in the House of Commons (1945–present)|date=2018-11-25|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Government_defeats_in_the_House_of_Commons_(1945%E2%80%93present)&amp;oldid=870595228|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some legislative assemblies, sitting at the back of the chamber is not necessarily associated with having a minor role. In [[Switzerland]], senior figures sit in the back rows in order to have a better overview and be closer to the doors for discussions outside the plenary. In [[Germany]], the party leaders sit in the front row, but there are no designated places for other senior figures. Originally, the importance of the front rows for the leaders had also to do with the fact that acoustics were often unsatisfactory before microphones were introduced.

The term "backbencher" has also been adopted outside parliamentary systems, such as the [[United States Congress]]. While [[legislative branch]]es in [[presidential system]]s do not share the firm front bench/back bench dichotomy of the Westminster system, the term has been used to denote junior legislators, or legislators who are not part of party leadership within a legislative body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnprogressiveproject.com/diary/4909/michele-bachmann-stop-gay-marriage-again-we-really-mean-it-this-time Minnesota Progressive Project]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] of Ohio ran against [[Nancy Pelosi]] of California for [[House Minority Leader]] in 2016, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that he "emerged from the backbench — he literally sits on the last bench in the chamber".&lt;ref name="wp20161130"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/30/nancy-pelosis-biggest-leadership-challenge-might-be-beating-expectations/?tid=pm_politics_pop |title=Nancy Pelosi beats back challenge, is chosen as House Democratic leader |last=Kane |first=Paul |date=2016-11-30 |last2=O'Keefe |first2=Ed |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conference of Ambassadors of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers''' was an inter-allied organization of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] in the period following the end of [[World War I]]. Formed in [[Paris]] in January 1920&lt;ref name=osman/&gt; it became a successor of the [[Supreme War Council]] and was later on ''[[de facto]]'' incorporated into the [[League of Nations]] as one of its governing bodies. It became less active after the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 and formally ceased to exist in 1931&lt;ref name=boyce/&gt; or 1935.&lt;ref name=osman/&gt;

The Conference consisted of ambassadors of Great Britain, Italy, and Japan accredited in Paris and French minister of foreign affairs. The ambassador of the United States attended as an observer because the United States was not an official party to the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=osman/&gt; French diplomat [[René Massigli]] was its secretary-general for its entire existence.&lt;ref name=boyce/&gt; It was chaired by foreign minister of [[France]] (among them [[Georges Clemenceau]], [[Raymond Poincaré]] and [[Aristide Briand]]).

It was formed to enforce peace treaties and to mediate various territorial disputes among European states.&lt;ref name="boyce" /&gt; Some of the disputed regions handled by the Conference included [[Cieszyn Silesia]] (between Poland and Czechoslovakia), the [[Vilnius Region]] (between Poland and Lithuania), the [[Klaipėda Region]] (between Germany and Lithuania) and the [[Corfu Incident]] (between Italy and Greece). One of its major territorial decisions was made on 15 March 1923, in recognizing the eastern borders of Poland created following the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 15, pp. 260-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference of Ambassadors of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers was appointed by the [[League of Nations]] to take charge of the Greek/Albanian border dispute that turned into the Corfu Incident of 1923.

Jules Laroche and Massigli were the first two Secretaries-General. The Conference of Ambassadors are contradicted by the existence of the general secretariat and a row of committees and commissions, who worked as permanent or sometimes ad hoc advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Conference of ambassadors (Paris 1920-1931) its history, the theoretical aspect of its work, and its place in international organization|last= Gerhard Paul Pink|first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1942|publisher= Geneva research centre|location= |isbn= |page= |pages= 18|url= https://books.google.it/books?ei=kg3nTvyKF6iP4gTm9umPCQ&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=it&amp;id=618DAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Conference+of+Ambassadors+Ren%C3%A9+Massigli&amp;q=+Ren%C3%A9+Massigli#search_anchor|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delegation of the European Union to Moldova''' ({{lang-ro|Delegația Uniunii Europene în Republica Moldova}}) was established to facilitate relations between [[Moldova and the European Union]]. It is located in [[Moldova]]'s capital, [[Chișinău]].

== History ==

The [[European Commission]] opened up a new office in Moldova on October 6, 2005 headed by [[Cesare de Montis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moldova.md/en/europa/ Moldova and EU on the official Moldova site]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[interim President of Moldova]], [[Mihai Ghimpu]], awarded the Honour Order to Cesare de Montis in October 2009 at the end of his mandate in Moldova. 

The Head of the European Union Delegation to Moldova has been Ambassador [[Dirk Steffen Schuebel]] since November 2009. Before, Dirk Schuebel was the Deputy Head of the Delegation of the European Commission to [[Ukraine]]. 

In April 2013, the appointment of Pirkka Tapiola as new Head of the EU Delegation to Moldova was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-302_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Delegation of the European Union to Moldova'' is located at 12 Kogălniceanu Street, in [[Central Chișinău]].

{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}
'''Demand management''' is a planning methodology used to [[forecasting|forecast]], plan for and manage the [[demand]] for products and services.  This can be at macro-levels as in economics and at micro-levels within individual organizations.  For example, at macro-levels, a government may influence [[interest rate]]s in order to regulate financial demand.  At the micro-level, a cellular service provider may provide free night and weekend use in order to reduce demand during peak hours.

Demand management has a defined set of processes, capabilities and recommended behaviors for companies that produce goods and services.  [[Consumer electronics]] and goods companies often lead in the application of demand management practices to their demand chains; demand management outcomes are a reflection of policies and programs to influence demand as well as competition and options available to users and consumers.  Effective demand management follows the concept of a "closed loop" where feedback from the results of the demand plans is fed back into the planning process to improve the predictability of outcomes.  Many practices reflect elements of [[systems dynamics]].  Volatility is being recognized as significant an issue as the focus on variance of demand to plans and forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamal|first1=John|url=http://www.sdcexec.com/article/11267412/research-shows-how-best-practice-demand-planning-contributes-to-the-challenge-of-accurate-forecasting-in-an-era-of-global-demand-uncertainty|title=Best Practice Demand Planning Meets Unprecedented Demand Volatility|website=Supply Demand Chain Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[macroeconomics]], ''demand management'' is the art or science of controlling [[aggregate demand]] to avoid a [[recession]].

Demand management at the macroeconomic level involves the use of [[discretionary policy]] and is inspired by [[Keynesian economics]], though today elements of it are part of the economic mainstream. The underlying idea is for the government to use tools like [[interest rate]]s, [[taxation]], and [[public expenditure]] to change key economic decisions like [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], [[investment]], the [[balance of trade]], and [[Government debt|public sector borrowing]] resulting in an 'evening out' of the [[business cycle]]. Demand management was widely adopted in the 1950s to 1970s, and was for a time successful. However, it did not prevent the [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]], which is considered to have been precipitated by the [[supply shock]] caused by the [[1973 oil crisis]].

Theoretical criticisms of demand management are that it relies on a long-run [[Phillips Curve]] for which there is no evidence, and that it produces [[dynamic inconsistency]] and can therefore be non-credible.

Today, most governments relatively limit interventions in demand management to tackling short-term crises, and rely on policies like [[central bank|independent central bank]]s and [[Golden Rule (fiscal policy)|fiscal policy rule]]s to prevent long-run economic disruption.

===Natural resources and environment===
In [[natural resources]] management and [[environmental policy]] more generally, demand management refers to policies to control consumer demand for environmentally sensitive or harmful goods such as water and energy. Within manufacturing firms the term is used to describe the activities of demand forecasting, planning, and order fulfillment. In the environmental context demand management is increasingly taken seriously to reduce the economy's throughput of scarce resources for which market pricing does not reflect true costs.  Examples include metering of municipal water, and carbon taxes on gasoline.

===Welfare economics===

Demand management in economics focuses on the optimal allocation resources to affect [[social welfare]].

[[Welfare economics]] uses the perspective and techniques of [[microeconomics]], but they can be aggregated to make macroeconomic conclusions. Because different "optimal" states may exist in an economy in terms of the allocation of resources, welfare economics seeks the state that will create the highest overall level of social welfare.

Some people object to the idea of wealth redistribution because it flies in the face of pure [[capitalist]] ideals, but economists suggest that greater states of overall social good might be achieved by redistributing incomes in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/welfare_economics.asp#ixzz3d5WLtJcf "Welfare Economics"], Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Because welfare economics follows the techniques of microeconomics, where demand planning is part of the process especially the redistribution of the funds through government taxes, fees and royalties to programs for societal good, such as roads, services, income support and agriculture support programs.

==Demand management as a business process==
Demand management is both a stand-alone process and one that is integrated into [[Sales and Operations Planning]] (S&amp;OP) or [[Integrated Business Planning]] (IBP).  The definition of the process and components covered in this section describe the current best practices encompassing the methods and competencies that have a track record of success with leading companies today.   Much effort is put into more esoteric financial or academic approaches; however their practical value is limited by the ability of business practitioners to use on a regular basis.  As those methods become more accessible and part of regular use they join the best practices, "predictive forecasting" covered in this section is a great example.

Demand management in its most effective form has a broad definition well beyond just developing a "forecast" based on history supplemented by "market" or customer intelligence, and often left to the supply chain organization to interpret.  Philip Kotler, a noted expert and professor of marketing management notes two key points:  1.  Demand management is the responsibility of the marketing organization (in his definition sales is subset of marketing); 2.  The demand "forecast" is the result of planned marketing efforts.  Those planned efforts, not only should focus on stimulating demand, more importantly influencing demand so that a company's [business'] objectives are achieved.

The components of effective demand management, identified by George Palmatier and Colleen Crum, are:  1.  Planning Demand; 2.  Communicating Demand; 3.  Influencing Demand and 4. Prioritizing Demand.&lt;ref&gt;pg. 11 {{cite book|last1=Crum|first1=Colleen|last2=Palmatier|first2=George|title=Demand Management Best Practices|date=2003|publisher=J Ross Publishing|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=1932159010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand Control ===
Demand Control is a principle of the overarching Demand Management process found in most manufacturing businesses. Demand Control focuses on alignment of supply and demand when there is a sudden, unexpected shift in the demand plan. The shifts can occur when near-term demand becomes greater than supply, or when actual orders are less than the established demand plan. The result can lead to reactive decisions, which can have a negative impact of workloads, costs, and customer satisfaction.

Demand Control creates synchronization across the sales, demand planning, and supply planning functions. Unlike typical monthly demand or supply planning reviews, Demand Control reviews occur at more frequent intervals - daily or weekly - which allows the organization to respond quickly and proactively to possible demand or supply imbalances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oliverwight-americas.com/landingpage/demand-control-white-paper|title=Demand Control: An Often Missing Link in a Demand Management Process|last=Holmes|first=David|last2=Ferguson|first2=Todd|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Reiher|first3=Timm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time Fences ====
[[File:Demand Control Time Fences.jpg|thumb]]
The Demand Control process requires that all functions agree on time fences within the [[planning horizon]], which should be no less than a rolling 24 months based on [[Integrated Business Planning]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transition from Sales and Operations Planning to Integrated Business Planning|last=Palmatier|first=George|last2=Crum|first2=Colleen|publisher=Dog Ear Publishing|year=2013|isbn=1457518252|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A time fence is a decision point within a manufacturer's planning horizon. Typically, three established time fences exist within a company:
* Future Planning Zone - Supply is managed to match demand
* Trading Zone - Demand is managed to match supply for production
* Firm Zone - Demand is managed to match supply for procurement

==== Demand Controller ====
A Demand Controller is established when a company implements a Demand Control process. Unlike a Demand Planner who focuses on long-term order management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supplychainbrain.com/content/blogs/think-tank/blog/article/what-it-takes-to-be-a-great-demand-planner/|title=What It Takes to Be a Great Demand Planner|last=Bowman|first=Robert|date=|website=SupplyChainBrain|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Demand Controller is responsible for short-term order management, focusing specifically when demand exceeds supply or demand appears to be less than planned, and engages sales management in both situations. The Demand Controller works across multiple functions involved in the supply and demand processes, including demand planning, supply planning, sales, and marketing.

==Elements==

Planning demand involves a full multiple-view process or work flow; including statistical forecast as a baseline from clean "demand history" [not shipments], using the most effective statistical models.  Kai Trepte developed the [[Microsoft Excel]] add-in "Forecast X" to provide practitioners with a workstation capability to assess the best matches between data and forecast models. Increasingly "predictive forecasts" have moved from a limited use to becoming best practice for more companies.  Predictive forecasts use simulation of potential future outcomes and their probabilities rather than history to form the basis for long range (5-10+ years) demand plans.  Baseline forecasts are typically developed by demand planners and analysts, who may be regional or centrally located.  They work under the guidance of the demand manager.  Baseline forecasts are communicated to members of the demand management team.  This usually includes regional sales leaders, market managers, and product managers.  The team may include customer service leads who manager orders under service agreements with customers and have direct insight into customer demand.  For major retailers this is often [[point of sale]] data provided to suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crum|first1=Colleen|last2=Palmatier|first2=George|title=Demand Management Best Practices|date=2003|publisher=J Ross Publishing|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=1932159010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trepte|first1=Kai|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kai-trepte/8/438/1b1|title=Kai Trepte|website=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In IT==

IT / IS demand managers seek to understand in advance how to best meet the needs and expectations of customers, clients, partners, and enablers. Thus, proper forecast and sizing of demand is required in order to deliver a stable and effective technology environment.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''E350''' is an [[European Union|EU]] recognised food additive. It comes in two forms,

:E350 (i) [[Monosodium malate]]
:E350 (ii) [[Disodium malate]]

[[Sodium malate]] is a [[salt|sodium salt]] of [[malic acid]] (E296), a natural acid present in fruit, its alate is used as a buffer and flavouring in [[soft drink]]s, [[confectionery]] and other foods.  The D,L - and D-[[isomers]] are not allowed for infants - who lack the enzymes to metabolise these compounds.

'''Ecological-evolutionary theory''' (EET) is a [[sociological theory]] of [[sociocultural evolution]] that attempts to explain the origin and changes of [[society]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=92"&gt;Elwell (2013), p.92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=91"/&gt; Key elements focus on the importance of [[natural environment]] and [[technological change]].&lt;ref name="VaughnDeLisi2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael G. Vaughn|author2=Matt DeLisi|author3=Holly C. Matto|title=Human Behavior: A Cell to Society Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRtrAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT313|date=12 August 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-41625-9|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; EET has been described as a theory of [[social stratification]], as it analyzes how stratification has changed through time across different societies.&lt;ref name="Sernau2010-23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Sernau|title=Social Inequality in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCMGKckZt9sC&amp;pg=PA23|date=28 April 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-7791-3|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has been viewed as a synthesis of the [[structural functionalism]] and [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref name="Sernau2010-23"/&gt; Proposed by [[Gerhard Lenski]], the theory perhaps is best articulated in his book, ''Ecological-Evolutionary Theory: Principles and Applications'' (2005).&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=91"&gt;Elwell (2013), p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weir2007"/&gt;
His major collaborators, Jean Lenski and Patrick Nolan, also are said to have contributed to EET.&lt;ref name="Weir2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Weir|title=Class in America: H-P|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YS69fMlIUX0C&amp;pg=PA452|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33721-5|pages=452=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michie2014"/&gt;

==Theory==

Lenski notes that society and culture evolve through symbols, which makes this process much more rapid, deliberative, and purposeful, compared to [[biological evolution]]. However, just like in the biological [[survival of the fittest]], in sociocultural evolution there is a process of intersocietal selection, where less fit sociocultural systems became extinct, replaced by more efficient ones.&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=91"/&gt; In another analogy to biological evolution, Lenski argues that the sociocultural systems that survive do so primarily on the virtue of their level of technological advancement, which otherwise is "blind and purposeless as the outcome of the biological process of natural selection and just as indifferent to humans beliefs and values". Thus, Lenski does not argue that societies that survive are morally superior to those that are defeated—simply that they were more efficient at [[technological progress]]. This, in turn, helps those societies survive and grow.&lt;ref name=hb&gt;{{cite book|editors=Turner, Stephen P.; and Mark W. Risjord|title=Philosophy of Anthropology and Sociology: A Volume in the Handbook of the Philosophy of Science Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_Z6MpAt53QC&amp;pg=PA272|date=2007|publisher=North Holland|isbn=978-0-08-046664-4|pages=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies can thus be compared to [[gene]]s of a society, providing it with new abilities, as new technologies allow it to do things that it could not have done before.&lt;ref name="Michie2014"/&gt;

Technology is a factor whose importance Lenski stresses above all others, and he differentiates societies by their technology level, into [[Hunter-gatherer |hunter gatherers]], simple and complex [[horticulture]], [[agrarian society|agrarian societies]] and [[industrial society|industrial societies]].&lt;ref name="Weir2007"/&gt; At the same time, characteristics of a society go beyond technology, into its demographic and genetic characteristics; culture, including material; social organization and institutions.&lt;ref name="Michie2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Michie|title=Reader's Guide to the Social Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ip_IAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1534|date=3 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-93226-8|page=1534}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural environment]] also plays a role, as does geographical location in general; as isolated societies have less chance to benefit from interaction with others.&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=99-100"/&gt;

Lenski's theory focus on material infrastructure of societies (growth in population and economic relations), and as such has been described as [[Historical materialism|materialist]].&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=100"&gt;Elwell (2013), p.100&lt;/ref&gt; It builds on classic theories of [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] in seeing society and culture a products of nature (human beings), thus subject to [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=94"&gt;Elwell (2013), p.94&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski argues that humans often act against the interests of the society, which he attributes to self-interest and individualism, themselves products of differing life experiences.&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=95"&gt;Elwell (2103), p.95&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that different societies survive thanks to their subsistence strategies, which allow them to draw resources (energy) from the environment; those strategies are determined by technologies possessed by those societies, itself significantly determined by demography (population and its growth) and economy systems ([[division of labor]]).&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=96"&gt;Elwell (2013), p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Technology, defined by him as "information about the ways in which resources in the environment may be used to satisfy human needs and desires," is the most important element of the sociocultural system.&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=97"&gt;Elwell (2013), p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenski further argues that sociocultural change is an effect of either interaction with a different society and culture, or a result of environment change (from natural ones, like ice ages, to man-made ones, like resource depletion).&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=96"/&gt; Humans primary way of dealing with changing environment is a self-reinforcing development of technology, through innovation is in general less common than copying solutions invented by others ([[cultural diffusion]]).&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=98"&gt;Elwell (2013), p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

All societies share two partially competing goals: maximization of production and minimizing of political change (maintenance of powers by the elites). The higher the [[social stratification]], the more dominant the second goal is.&lt;ref name="Scholz2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roland W. Scholz]]|title=Environmental Literacy in Science and Society: From Knowledge to Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrAmJJunQ7cC&amp;pg=PA225|date=21 July 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50390-7|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski theory can be thus used to analyze the changes of [[social inequality]].&lt;ref name="VaughnDeLisi2013"/&gt; Lenski notes that some level of social inequality is expected in all societies, as it is related to differences in abilities of individuals and the tasks they chose to perform for the society; but he also observes that inequality in all societies has always been higher than ideal, as elites usually try to preserve their dominant status.&lt;ref name="Sernau2010-23"/&gt; Lenski argues that inequality reached its peak levels in [[agrarian society|agrarian societies]] or [[industrial society|industrial ones]], and have been slowly declining since.&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=99-100"&gt;Elwell (2013), pp.99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenski observes that the forces of technological change (innovation) are in constant conflict with forces of continuity and stability, such as traditions, conservatism, opposition of vested interests to [[disruptive technologies]], and general tendency of humans to resist change.&lt;ref name="Michie2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=99-100"/&gt; He concludes, however, that usually technological progress overcomes any obstacles, forcing sociocultural systems to change.&lt;ref name="Michie2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michie2014"/&gt; Lenski also observes that [[accelerating change|technological change accelerates]] over time.&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=98"/&gt;

The theory has been praised as "a synthesis of key insights of the founders of sociology and of contemporary macrosociology and anthropology".&lt;ref name="Elwell2013=91"/&gt;

A photograph of the then-[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] eating a [[bacon sandwich]] was the source of sustained commentary in 2014 and 2015. Taken for the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' newspaper while Miliband was campaigning for local elections in May 2014, it was said by some to make him look awkward, error prone or incapable of performing simple tasks. It sparked several [[internet memes]], both supportive and mocking, and fuelled a debate about the lengths to which politicians attempt to control their public image. Miliband dismissed the debate, arguing it was unimportant, and others, including opponents, described the media focus on it as unfair or part of a wider negative personality-based media campaign. The photo was used in a mocking front page of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']]'', the UK's [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom by circulation|most widely read newspaper]], on the day before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]].

==Background==
[[Ed Miliband]] was [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|elected as Leader of the Labour Party in September 2010]] following Labour's defeat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] after [[New Labour|thirteen years in government]]. As Leader of the Opposition, he was tasked with holding the government to account until such time as he could contest the next general election, which was eventually held in [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|May 2015]]. Following the results of the election, Miliband resigned as Leader of the Labour Party after nearly five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/ed-miliband-to-resign-as-labour-leader|title=Ed Miliband resigns as Labour leader|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|date=2015-05-08|last2=Mason|first2=Rowena|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time since the [[Second World War]], the government formed in May 2010 was a coalition, led by the new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], with [[Nick Clegg]], leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], becoming [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

==Incident==
The photograph was taken on 21 May 2014 by Jeremy Selwyn in London for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' newspaper, during the first stop of Miliband's two-day campaign tour ahead of [[United Kingdom local elections, 2014|local]] and [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|European elections]]. Arriving at [[New Covent Garden Market]] at 6.30am for a planned visit to promote his policies for small businesses, Miliband visited a cafe where the bacon sandwich was consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Joe|title=Ed Miliband's battle with a bacon sandwich as he buys flowers for his wife at London market|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband-tucks-into-a-bacon-sandwich-on-a-morning-trip-to-buy-flowers-for-his-wife-9407561.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=selwyn&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Selwyn|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-30548050|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Standard'' published the photographs as part of a gallery of 13, titled "Ed Miliband's Bacon Sandwich", above a story by political editor Joe Murphy, headlined "Ed Miliband's battle with a bacon sandwich as he buys flowers for his wife at London market". Referencing the incident, Murphy's story began: 
{{quote|For a party leader anxious to avoid any more gaffes, what could go wrong buying flowers for the wife? Plenty, it turned out....First came the delicate issue of his bacon roll, a vital accessory when meeting the working classes at breakfast time. Mr Miliband’s battle to consume the greasy treat alarmed his media minders, who tried to stop photographers taking close-ups of butter oozing between his teeth. After a few bites, the Labour leader appeared defeated, and the snack was put into the custody of [[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Lord Wood]], a senior shadow cabinet member.&lt;ref name=selwyn/&gt;}}

Defending the photographs in December 2014, Selwyn said it was an unplanned shot, and that all politicians are "fair game" despite their press officers' strict controls on photography.&lt;ref name=selwyn/&gt;

==Initial reactions==
According to the tabloid newspaper ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' writing two days after the event, the photograph of Miliband "struggling" to eat the bacon sandwich had immediately generated mockery and claimed it had made him "look a fool".&lt;ref name=MirrorEdEats/&gt; In the ensuing week it became an [[Internet meme]], with online users transposing it onto well-known images from history and popular culture, such as the [[Last Supper]] and ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'', under the [[hashtag]] #EdEats.&lt;ref name=MirrorEdEats&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haworth|first1=Jessica|title=The Laughs Supper: Ed Miliband and bacon sandwich snap sparks hilarious photoshop Twitter trend|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/laughs-supper-ed-miliband-bacon-3593269|website=The Mirror|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegtaphEdEats&gt;{{cite news|title=#edeats: Ed Miliband's many bacon sarnie moments|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/virals/10848760/edeats-Ed-Milibands-many-bacon-sarnie-moments.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing a selection of the parodies, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' interpreted the incident as a backfired attempt by the Labour leader to look normal, claiming it was his awkward expression which sparked the parodies.&lt;ref name=TelegtaphEdEats/&gt;

On 19 May 2014, Deputy Prime Minister and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Nick Clegg]] was challenged by [[LBC]] host [[Nick Ferrari]] to eat a bacon sandwich live on air. Clegg expressed empathy with Miliband, saying:
{{quote|I think this is very unfair because I don't think anyone looks very elegant...I guarantee you, if you were to eat the rest of it and I was to take thousands of pictures while you were doing it, I could manage to produce an unflattering [photograph] or two of you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moodley|first1=Kiran|title=Nick Clegg sympathises with Ed Miliband as he tackles a bacon sandwich|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-clegg-sympathises-with-ed-miliband-as-he-tackles-a-bacon-sandwich-9452786.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=The Independent|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Independent]]'' wrote on 21 May 2014 that "despite extensive stage-managing and with a seemingly simple task at hand, the Labour leader still struggled in his bid to look normal and back in touch with the general public", linking it to slip-ups which he had made in recent interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=Ed Miliband fails to look normal while eating bacon sandwich ahead of campaign tour|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ed-miliband-fails-to-look-normal-while-eating-bacon-sandwich-ahead-of-whistlestop-campaign-tour-9409301.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent references==
Miliband reacted to the photograph on 25 July 2014 in a speech to party members, saying:
{{quote|You could probably even find people who look better eating a bacon sandwich. If you want the politician from central casting, it's just not me, it's the other guy. If you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don't vote for me.}}

In October 2014, [[UK Independence Party]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] made headlines for eating a bacon sandwich while campaigning before the [[Heywood and Middleton by-election, 2014|Heywood and Middleton by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruck|first1=Joanna|title=Nigel Farage shows Ed Miliband how to eat a bacon sandwich|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/02/nigel-farage-shows-ed-miliband-how-to-eat-a-bacon-sandwich|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, ''The Independent'' writer Boyd Tonkin attempted to link the media narrative around the photograph to [[antisemitism]], stating that "His clumsy aversion to pork products betrays him as an alien, a member of some foreign tribe" while the media reported that Farage ate his sandwich better because "Nige is authentically one of us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tonkin|first1=Boyd|title=Is criticism of Ed Miliband a coded form of anti-Semitism?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/is-the-criticism-of-ed-miliband-a-coded-form-of-antisemitism-9885745.html|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=The Independent|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ib 6 May 2015, [[Keith Kahn-Harris]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' "contemporary antisemitism is often strange and difficult to pin down, often disappearing into a miasma of claims and counter-claims. This is yet another example."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kahn-Harris|first1=Keith|title=Is the Sun’s ‘save our bacon’ election front page antisemitic?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/06/sun-front-page-antisemitic-save-our-bacon-ed-miliband|accessdate=1 June 2018|work=The Guardian|date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing on 13 March 2015 in ''The Guardian'', Labour activist [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] said the popularity of the photograph was part of a right-wing media campaign against Miliband, writing that "The media have a wider narrative about Ed Miliband: sad pathetic geeky loser who cannot even eat a bacon sandwich with any dignity. You can easily select photographs to make any politician look undignified, or generally reinforce whatever narrative you have selected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Owen|title=The most important political issue of the moment?

In April 2017, Miliband appeared on ''[[The Last Leg]]'' and was photographed with another bacon sandwich, while sitting on a motorbike in a leather jacket. The show's host, [[Adam Hills]], said that this was because they needed "to create an alternative photo of Ed with a bacon sandwich and we need to get it trending [on Twitter]".&lt;ref name="Martin Gibb 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Martin | first=Lara | last2=Gibb | first2=Jessica | title=Watch Ed Miliband recreate THAT bacon sandwich photo - with the help of a motorbike | website=The Mirror | date=8 April 2017 | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/watch-savage-ed-miliband-recreate-10181661 | access-date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Molloy 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Ed Mili-Band: Ed Miliband turns popstar in hilarious Channel 4 skit | website=The Telegraph | date=8 April 2017 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/08/ed-mili-band-ed-miliband-turns-popstar-hilarious-channel-4-skit/ | access-date=1 June 2017 | author=Molloy, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 general election campaign===

}}
Parliament dissolved on 30 March, marking the official start of the campaign period for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], with polling day being on 7 May.

On 7 April 2015, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] ate a [[hot dog]] with a knife and fork. Although members of the public deemed him "[[wikt:posh|posh]]" for doing this, ''The Independent'' offered the alternative suggestion that Cameron's campaign team were aiming for him to avoid looking like Miliband, which "may have been stage managed one step too far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|title=David Cameron eats hotdogs with a knife and fork|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-eats-hotdogs-with-a-knife-and-fork-10159107.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=The Independent|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day before polling day, the tabloid newspaper [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] used the full photo on its front page, partially super-imposed with the headline "Save Our Bacon", with bylines reading "This is the pig's ear Ed made of a helpless sarnie. In 48 hours, he could be doing the same to Britain" above, and "Don't swallow his porkies and keep him out". This was interpreted by ''The Independent'' as a front page "entirely dedicated to mocking the Labour leader over the infamous incident." It sparked another Twitter trend in a show of support for the Labour leader, with users sharing photos of themselves eating bacon sandwiches and other food in a deliberately messy fashion, with the hashtag #JeSuisEd, a reference to [[Je Suis Charlie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Victoria|title=#JeSuisEd: Twitter users continue to share awkward food photos in support of Ed Miliband|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/jesuised-twitter-users-continue-to-share-awkward-food-photos-in-support-of-ed-miliband-10231967.html|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Abi|title=People are eating sandwiches unattractively in solidarity with Ed Miliband|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/usvsth3m/people-eating-sandwiches-unattractively-solidarity-5645512|website=Mirror.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1535">An '''End-user certificate''', or '''EUC''', is a document used in international transfers, including sales and arms provided as aid, of [[weapons]] and [[ammunition]] to certify that the buyer is the final recipient of the materials, and is not planning on transferring the materials to another party.  EUCs are required by many governments to restrict the flow of the materials to undesired destinations, such as [[embargo]]ed states or rebel groups, governments with bad human rights records or states which are considered a threat by the original supplier of the arms.

There are several problems with EUCs as a means to prevent undesirable [[arms exports]]. EUCs can be [[forgery|forged]] or falsified; they can also be obtained from [[corrupt]] officials, therefore there is a need for EUCs that are difficult to forge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.sipri.org/files/insight/SIPRIInsight1003.pdf |title=End-User Certificates: Improving standards to prevent diversion |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is that an EUC does not guarantee that the arms recipient will actually live up to its promise not to re-transfer the weapons received. EUCs which are not backed up by proper end-use monitoring are weak. 

In 1936-1938, German arms were supplied to both sides in the [[Spanish Civil War]] via Greece using Greek then Mexican end-user certificates, see [[Pyrkal]].

'''Glycerol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|l|ɪ|s|ə|r|ɒ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/glycerol|title=glycerol - Definition of glycerol in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''glycerine''' or '''glycerin'''; see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) is a simple [[polyol]] compound. It is a colorless, odorless, [[viscous]] liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic. The glycerol backbone is found in all [[lipid]]s known as [[triglycerides]]. It is widely used in the food industry as a sweetener and [[humectant]] and in [[pharmaceutical formulation]]s. Glycerol has three [[hydroxyl group]]s that are responsible for its [[solubility]] in [[water]] and its [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] nature.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;

==Structure==
Although [[chirality|achiral]], glycerol is [[prochirality|prochiral]] with respect to reactions of one of the two primary alcohols. Thus, in substituted derivatives, the [[Glycerophospholipid#Nomenclature and stereochemistry|stereospecific numbering]] labels each carbon as either sn-1, sn-2, or sn-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirschmann|first=H.|date=1960-10-01|title=The Nature of Substrate Asymmetry in Stereoselective Reactions|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=235|issue=10|pages=2762–2767|pmid=13714619}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1967-09-01|title=IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN)|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry|volume=2|issue=2|pages=127–131|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1967.tb00116.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29301208"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Alfieri A, Imperlini E, Nigro E, Vitucci D, Orrù S, Daniele A, Buono P, Mancini A | title=Effects of Plant Oil Interesterified Triacylglycerols on Lipemia and Human Healthy | journal= [[International Journal of Molecular Sciences]] | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=E104 | year=2017 | url=http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/1/104| doi= 10.3390/ijms19010104 |  PMC =5796054 | PMID = 29301208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Glycerol is generally obtained from plant and animal sources where it occurs as [[triglyceride]]s. Triglycerides are [[ester]]s of glycerol with long-chain carboxylic acids. The hydrolysis, [[saponification]], or [[transesterification]] of these triglycerides produces glycerol as well as the fatty acid derivative:
&lt;div style="display: flex; max-width: 100%; overflow-x: auto"&gt;

{{Biochem reaction subunit|n=3|compound=soap|image=General sodium carboxylate.svg}}
{{Biochem reaction subunit|compound=glycerol|image=Glycerine Structural Formula V1.svg}}
&lt;/div&gt;
Triglycerides can be [[saponification|saponified]] with sodium hydroxide to give glycerol and fatty sodium salt or [[soap]].

Typical plant sources include [[soybeans]] or [[Arecaceae|palm]]. Animal-derived [[tallow]] is another source. Approximately 950,000 tons per year are produced in the United States and Europe; 350,000 tons of glycerol were produced per year in the United States alone from 2000 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= A Glycerin Factor |author= Nilles, Dave |url= http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=377 |publisher= Biodiesel Magazine |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport|EU directive 2003/30/EC]] set a requirement that 5.75% of petroleum fuels are to be replaced with [[biofuel]] sources across all [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] by 2010. It was projected in 2006 that by the year 2020, production would be six times more than demand, creating an excess of glycerol.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |last1= Christoph |first1= Ralf |last2= Schmidt |first2= Bernd |last3= Steinberner |first3= Udo |last4= Dilla |first4= Wolfgang |last5= Karinen |first5= Reetta |title= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year= 2006 |doi= 10.1002/14356007.a12_477.pub2 |chapter= Glycerol |isbn= 3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycerol from triglycerides is produced on a large scale, but the crude product is of variable quality, with a low selling price of as low as 2-5 U.S. cents per kilogram in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Pei San Kong, Mohamed Kheireddine Aroua, Wan Mohd Ashri Wan Daud, "Conversion of crude and pure glycerol into derivatives: A feasibility evaluation", Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2016, Volume 63, pp. 533-555. {{doi|10.1016/j.rser.2016.05.054}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be purified, but the process is expensive. Some glycerol is burned for energy, but its heat value is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/8137/clearing-the-way-for-byproduct-quality |work=Biodiesel Magazine |title= Clearing the way for byproduct quality: why quality for glycerin is just as important for biodiesel |author= Sims, Bryan |date= 25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crude glycerol from the hydrolysis of triglycerides can be purified by treatment with [[activated carbon]] to remove organic impurities, alkali to remove unreacted glycerol esters, and [[ion exchange]] to remove salts. High purity glycerol (&gt; 99.5%) is obtained by multi-step distillation; vacuum is helpful due to the high boiling point of glycerol (290&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Synthetic glycerol===
Although usually not cost-effective, glycerol can be produced by various routes from [[propylene]]. The [[epichlorohydrin]] process is the most important; it involves the chlorination of propylene to give [[allyl chloride]], which is oxidized with [[hypochlorite]] to dichlorohydrins, which reacts with a strong base to give epichlorohydrin. This epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol. Chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from [[acrolein]] and [[propylene oxide]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;
:[[File:Synthetic routes to glycerol.png|600px]]

Because of the large-scale production of [[biodiesel]] from fats, where glycerol is a waste product, the market for glycerol is depressed. Thus, synthetic processes are not economical. Owing to oversupply, efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors, such as [[acrolein]] and [[epichlorohydrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0033-1340636|title= Glycerol|last= Yu|first= Bin|date= |journal= Synlett|volume= 25|issue= 4|pages= 601–602|accessdate= |doi= 10.1055/s-0033-1340636|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See the [[#Chemical intermediate|Chemical intermediate]] section of this article.

==Applications==

===Food industry===
In food and beverages, glycerol serves as a [[humectant]], [[solvent]], and [[sweetener]], and may help [[Food preservative|preserve foods]]. It is also used as filler in commercially prepared [[low-fat]] foods (e.g., [[cookie]]s), and as a [[thickening agent]] in [[liqueur]]s. Glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://extension.umd.edu//sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/non_HGIC_FS/FS556.pdf |title= Preserving flowers and leaves |last= Gouin |first= Francis R.|year=1994 |journal=Maryland Cooperative Extension Fact Sheet |volume=556 |pages=1–6|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Preserving flowers and decorative foliages with glycerin and dye |author= Stevens, Alan |url= http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/library/hort2/mf2446.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; As a [[sugar substitute]], it has approximately 27 [[Food energy|kilocalories]] per [[teaspoon]] (sugar has 20) and is 60% as [[Sweetness|sweet]] as [[sucrose]]. It does not feed the [[bacteria]] that form [[dental plaque|plaque]]s and cause [[dental cavities]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} As a [[food additive]], glycerol is labeled as [[E number]] E422. It is added to icing (frosting) to prevent it from setting too hard.

As used in foods, glycerol is categorized by the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] as a [[carbohydrate]]. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric [[macronutrient]]s excluding protein and fat. Glycerol has a caloric density similar to table sugar, but a lower [[glycemic index]] and different [[metabolic pathway]] within the body, so some dietary advocates{{who|date=September 2014}} accept glycerol as a sweetener compatible with [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. 

It is also recommended as an additive when using polyol sweeteners such as [[erythritol]] and [[xylitol]] which have a cooling effect, due to its heating effect in the mouth, if the cooling effect is not wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Functional Food Design Rules |author= Nikolov, Ivan |url= http://www.ivannikolov.com/functional-food-design-rules-part-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, pharmaceutical and personal care applications===

[[File:Dollop of hair gel.jpg|thumb|Glycerol is an ingredient in products such as hair gel]]
[[File:Glycerin suppositories.jpg|thumb|right|Glycerol suppositories used as laxatives]]
Glycerol is used in [[medicine|medical]], [[pharmaceutical]] and [[personal care]] preparations, often as a means of improving smoothness, providing [[lubrication]], and as a [[humectant]]. [[Ichthyosis]] and [[xerosis]] have been relieved by the topical use glycerin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ichthyosis: New Insights for the Healthcare Professional|date=22 July 2013|publisher=[[ScholarlyEditions]]|language=English|isbn=9781481659666|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LebwohlHeymann2017"&gt;{{cite book|title=Treatment of Skin Disease E-Book: Comprehensive Therapeutic Strategies|date=19 September 2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|language=English|isbn=9780702069130|author=Mark G. Lebwohl, Warren R. Heymann, John Berth-Jones, Ian Coulson}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in allergen [[immunotherapies]], [[cough syrup]]s, [[elixir]]s and [[expectorant]]s, [[toothpaste]], [[mouthwash]]es, [[skin care]] products, shaving cream, [[hair care]] products, [[soap]]s, and water-based [[personal lubricant]]s. In solid dosage forms like tablets, glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent. For human consumption, glycerol is classified by the U.S. FDA among the [[sugar alcohol]]s as a caloric macronutrient. Glycerol is also used in [[blood banking]] to preserve [[red blood cell]]s prior to freezing.

Glycerol is a component of [[glycerin soap]].&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT try to enumerate the ingredients for glycerine soap. There are a million differing recipes, each with its own "purist" contingent that swears they are the one true glycerine soapmaker --&gt; [[Essential oil]]s are added for [[fragrance]]. This kind of soap is used by people with sensitive, easily irritated [[skin]] because it prevents skin dryness with its [[moisturizer|moisturizing]] properties. It draws moisture up through skin layers and slows or prevents excessive drying and evaporation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Glycerol can be used as a [[laxative]] when introduced into the rectum in [[suppository]] or small-volume (2–10&amp;nbsp;ml) [[enema]] form; it irritates the anal mucosa and induces a [[Osmotic laxative|hyperosmotic effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.drugs.com/cdi/glycerin-enema.html |title= Glycerin Enema |publisher= Drugs.com |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken orally (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste), glycerol can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in the [[Intraocular pressure|internal pressure of the eye]]. This can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR601713 |title= Glycerin (Oral Route) |publisher= Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate= 17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botanical extracts===
When utilized in "tincture" method extractions, specifically as a 10% solution, glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ([[tincture]]s). It is also used as an "alcohol-free" alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions. It is less extractive when utilized in a standard tincture methodology. Alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties. Such products are not "alcohol-free" in a scientific sense, as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups. [[Fluid extract]] manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make [[glycerite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3624347 |author=Long, Walter S. |title=The composition of commercial fruit extracts |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |volume=28 |date=14 January 1916 – 13 January 1917 |pages=157–161 |doi=10.2307/3624347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/NSN_backs/Apr_99/backtalk.cfm Does alcohol belong in herbal tinctures?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012040650/http://newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/NSN_backs/Apr_99/backtalk.cfm |date=12 October 2007 }} newhope.com&lt;/ref&gt;

When used as a primary "true" alcohol-free botanical extraction solvent in non-tincture based methodologies, glycerol has been shown to possess a high degree of extractive versatility for botanicals including removal of numerous constituents and complex compounds, with an extractive power that can rival that of alcohol and water–alcohol solutions.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} That glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic methodologies as opposed to standard passive "tincturing" methodologies that are better suited to alcohol. Glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical's constituents inert (as alcohols – i.e. ethyl (grain) alcohol, methyl (wood) alcohol, etc., do). Glycerol is a stable preserving agent for botanical extracts that, when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base, does not allow inverting or reduction-oxidation of a finished extract's constituents, even over several years.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Both glycerol and ethanol are viable preserving agents.

Glycerin, along with [[propylene glycol]], is a common component of [[e-liquid]], a solution used with electronic vaporizers ([[electronic cigarettes]]). This glycerol is heated with an [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizer]] (a heating coil often made of [[Kanthal (alloy)|Kanthal]] wire), producing the [[aerosol]] that delivers [[nicotine]] to the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Amitava|last2=Klein|first2=Kimberly|title=Antioxidants in Food, Vitamins and Supplements: Prevention and Treatment of Disease|date=2014|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780124059177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iiSAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=propylene%20glycol%20electronic%20cigarettes&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en|chapter=4.2.5 Are Electronic Cigarettes Safe?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antifreeze===
{{Main|Antifreeze}}
Like [[ethylene glycol]] and [[propylene glycol]], glycerol is a non-ionic [[kosmotropic|kosmotrope]] that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water [[hydrogen bonds]]. This interaction disrupts the formation of ice. The minimum freezing point temperature is about {{convert|−36|F|C}} corresponding to 70% glycerol in water.

Glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by [[ethylene glycol]], which has a lower freezing point. While the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture, glycerol is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hudgens |first1= R.

Astmnewsroom.org. Retrieved on 15 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, glycerol is a common component of solvents for [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[reagents]] stored at temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°C due to the [[Freezing-point depression|depression of the freezing temperature]]. It is also used as a [[cryoprotectant]] where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as [[bacteria]], [[nematode]]s, and mammalian embryos.

===Chemical intermediate===
Glycerol is used to produce [[nitroglycerin]], which is an essential ingredient of various explosives such as [[dynamite]], [[gelignite]], and propellants like [[cordite]]. Reliance on soap-making to supply co-product glycerol made it difficult to increase production to meet wartime demand. Hence, synthetic glycerol processes were national defense priorities in the days leading up to World War II. Nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is commonly used to relieve ''[[angina pectoris]]'', taken in the form of [[sub-lingual]] tablets, or as an [[aerosol]] spray.

An oxidation of glycerol affords [[mesoxalic acid]].&lt;ref name="ciri2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vibration damping===
Glycerol is used as fill for [[pressure gauge]]s to damp vibration. External vibrations, from compressors, engines, pumps, etc., produce [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] vibrations within [[Bourdon gauge]]s that can cause the needle to move excessively, giving inaccurate readings. The excessive swinging of the needle can also damage internal gears or other components, causing premature wear. Glycerol, when poured into a gauge to replace the air space, reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge.&lt;ref&gt;''Pneumatic Systems: Principles and Maintenance'' by S. R. Majumdar -- McGraw-Hill 2006 Page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===

====Film industry====
Glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/chemicals-in-film-20th-century-fox-orders-products/ Chemicals in Film]. reagent.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycerine is used—combined with water (around in a 1:99 proportion)—to create a smooth smoky environment. The solution is vaporized and pushed into the room with a ventilator.

====Ultrasonic couplant====
Glycerol can be sometimes used as replacement for [[water]] in [[ultrasonic testing]], as it has favourably higher [[acoustic impedance]] (2.42MRayl vs 1.483MRayl for [[water]]) while being relatively safe, non-toxic, non-corrosive and relatively low cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nde-ed.org/GeneralResources/MaterialProperties/UT/ut_matlprop_liquids.htm Acoustic Properties for Liquids]. nde-ed.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal combustion fuel===
Glycerol is also used to power diesel generators supplying electricity for the [[FIA]] [[Formula E]] series of electric race cars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150212152226/http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2014/september/formula-e-uses-pollution-free-glycerine-to-charge-cars.aspx Formula E uses pollution-free glycerine to charge cars]. fiaformulae.com. 13 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==
Glycerol is a precursor for synthesis of [[triacylglycerol]]s and of [[phospholipid]]s in the liver and [[adipose tissue]]. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and [[fatty acid]]s are released into the bloodstream. Circulating glycerol does not [[glycate]] proteins as do glucose or fructose, and does not lead to the formation of [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s (AGEs). In some{{which|date=November 2015}} organisms, the glycerol component can enter the glycolysis pathway directly and, thus, provide energy for cellular metabolism (or, potentially, be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis).

Before glycerol can enter the pathway of [[glycolysis]] or [[gluconeogenesis]] (depending on physiological conditions), it must be converted to their intermediate [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] in the following steps:

[[Image:Sceau de la République.jpg|thumb|Great Seal of the French Republic]]
[[File:Great Seal of France.svg|thumb|Great Seal of the Second French Republic, in 1848. The headdress of the [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] featured on the seal is similar to that of the [[Statue of Liberty]] (''Liberty Enlightening the World''), which would be offered by the French people to the U.S. people 40 years later. Both are strong [[Republicanism|republican symbols]].]]

The '''Great Seal of France''' ({{lang-fr|Grand Sceau de la République française}}) is the official [[seal (device)|seal]] of the [[French Republic]].

== Description ==
The Great Seal features [[liberty]] personified as a seated [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] wearing a crown with seven arches. She holds a [[fasces]] and is supported by a ship's [[tiller]] with a [[Rooster|cock]] carved or printed on it. At her feet is a vase with the letters "SU" ("''Suffrage Universel''", "Universal suffrage"). At her right, in the background, are symbols of the arts (painter's tools), architecture (Ionic order), education (burning lamp), agriculture (a sheaf of wheat) and industry (a cog wheel). The scene is surrounded by the legend "RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE, DÉMOCRATIQUE, UNE ET INDIVISIBLE" ("French Republic, democratic, one and indivisible") and "24 FEV.1848" (24 February 1848) at the bottom.

The reverse bears the words "AU NOM DU PEUPLE FRANÇAIS" ("in the name of the French people") surrounded by a crown of oak (symbol of perennity) and laurel (symbol of glory) leaves tied together with wheat and grapes (agriculture and wealth), with the circular national motto "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|LIBERTÉ, ÉGALITÉ, FRATERNITÉ]]".
== History ==
=== Pre-Revolution ===
The first seals were created by the [[Merovingian]] kings to authenticate their orders. Merely rings originally, later worn on a necklace, the royal seals grew bigger and bigger under the [[House of Capet]] to reach around {{conv|12|cm|abbr=on}}. These are the modern dimensions of the seal.

All the seals under the [[Ancien Régime]] featured the king sitting on this throne and giving justice, yet every king had his own personal seal, a unique item which passed with him. All edicts, orders, decrees and declarations were then sealed.
=== Revolutionary period ===
On August 13, 1792, representatives of the [[National Convention]] arrested [[King Louis XVI]]. He was imprisoned, and later executed on January 21, 1793. This act of regicide demonstrated that "the Convention had irreversibly ruled out any compromise with the Revolution's opponents."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution'' (Boston: Prentice Hall, 2010), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; With the absence of the king, the [[French Republic]] sought a new national symbol. It was from these tumultuous times that the French symbol of [[Marianne]] emerged. The [[French Revolution]] not only challenged the political authority of the [[Old Regime]] led by the monarchy; it also challenged the traditional symbols that had thus far defined the French people. Anthropologists have argued that every society needs a "center" which includes social and political mapping that gives the people a sense of their place. In the traditional model of authority, "the king was the sacred center and culture was firmly fixed in the longstanding notions of a catholic hierarchical order."&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; By de-centering this frame of traditional authority while overthrowing the monarchy, revolutionaries realized that the cultural framework of the past could not be carried into the future, and that the use of the king as the insignia of the seal had to be replaced with a new seal signifying the Republic. Revolutionaries began iconoclastically destroying tangible reminders of the Old Regime, such as breaking the seals of royalty, the scepter and the crown and melting them into republican coins.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition of royalty, however, led to questions about the importance of having a unified symbol. In the beginning, seals were only used to compensate for the imperfection of writing.&lt;ref name="Hunt 91"&gt;Hunt, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet as [[Henri Grégoire]] argued, civilized people found that "a sign, a type, was necessary to give character to authenticity" to all public acts.&lt;ref name="Hunt 91"/&gt; The nation would only be recognizable by its public symbolic representation, and hence it was agreed that a new seal of state would be created to give the new republic a sense of permanence. The seal was not only a representation of public authority, but it signified the new republican mold. As [[Lynn Hunt]] puts it, "new symbols could make new men."&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution stood for the notion that members of a society could invent culture and politics for themselves. As the National Convention worked to unify the Republic after the fall of the monarchy, the process to declare a national symbol became more urgent. In the end, "the choice of a new insignia seemed almost automatic."&lt;ref name="Hunt 93"&gt;Hunt, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to dispel all traces of monarchical influence, the members of the National Convention "proposed the choice of Liberty."&lt;ref name="Hunt 93" /&gt; The choice was a clear one and deputies of the Convention like Abbe Grégoire proposed that the Republic's image should be "Liberty, 'so that our emblem, circulating all over the globe, should present to all peoples the beloved image of Republican liberty and pride.'"&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Agulhon, ''Marianne into Battle: Republican Imagery and Symbolism in France, 1789-1880'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of Liberty is, in a sense, "the very essence of the Republic."&lt;ref&gt;Agulhon, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberty was officially represented by the female figure of Marianne, which adheres to traditional iconographic expectations. The [[Phrygian cap]] worn by this figure of liberty was representative of the inherent freedom of the French people and provided a sharp contrast to the crown of the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Hunt 93" /&gt; According to Maurice Agulhon, an expert on this particular symbol of the French Revolution, Marianne "represented both Liberty, an eternal value, and at the same time the newly constituted regime of the French Republic."&lt;ref&gt;Agulhon, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was depicted as "a woman holding a stave surmounted by a cap and trampling a yoke underfoot; this is the emblem that the ancients gave to Liberty won through valor."&lt;ref&gt;Agulhon, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine civic allegory of Marianne was distant from the controversial personalities of National Convention; therefore, Marianne's "abstraction and impersonality" allowed the symbol to endure the different phases of the Revolution. In addition, Marianne's close resemblance to the Catholic figure of Mary created unity between the rational revolutionaries and the devout peasantry.&lt;ref name="Hunt 93" /&gt; The emblem of Marianne was not only widely accepted, but also widely diffused in France.&lt;ref name="Hunt 94"&gt;Hunt, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the Revolution radicalized in 1793 with the rise of the Committee on Public Safety, the emblem of Marianne was replaced by a far more formidable symbol of the Revolution: [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s statue of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref name="Hunt 94" /&gt;

=== Post-Revolution ===
[[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoléon]], [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] all used monarchical seals like the Old Regime, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] used one showing only his bust.

The present seal dates back to the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], which briefly used the seals of the First Republic before having a new design made by the artist [[Jacques-Jean Barre]] on the 8 September 1848.

== Usage ==

Under the Second Republic, usage of the Great Seal of France tended to be reduced to sealing laws, decrees of the National Assembly and diplomatic treaties. The function of [[Keeper of the seals]] was officially linked to that of [[Minister of Justice]] at that time (the French Minister of Justice is popularly referred to "''{{lang|fr|Le Garde des Sceaux}}''").

After the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], the practice of applying seals to laws was gradually abandoned and restricted to constitutional acts and diplomatic treaties (for instance, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was sealed in this way).

Under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the only document to be sealed was the Constitution of October 27, 1946.

Since the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], after sealing the Constitution of October 4, 1958, it became common practice to seal some constitutional modifications. Used in 1946, and twice at the beginning of the Fifth Republic, the sealing ceremonies became much less common from 1963 to 1991 period when only two laws - ordinary, but of great symbolic importance - were sealed. Since 1992, the pace of ceremonies has increased again: the constitutional changes since then were often the subject of a seal.
 
The date of the ceremony was very close to the date of passage of the law until 1964. It was subsequently clearly separated from the vote and publication of the text. An extreme case consists in the Constitutional Law no. 99-569 of July 8, 1999 on equality between women and men, sealed March 8, 2002, two and a half years after the entry into force of the law.

Sealing ceremonies are always held at the ''{{lang|fr|Chancellerie}}'' where the [[Keeper of the Seals]], the [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]], holds a sealing press affixed to a best and the unique matrices of the Seal of the State. Since 2017, this role is carried out by [[Nicole Belloubet]].

== Sealing documents ==

=== Sealing wax ===

Originally, sealers used a [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] [[sealing wax]] which they shaped by hand into generally circular pieces which were definitely shaped by a press.

Nowadays, a liquid wax is fed directly into the inferior part of a shape made of a stamp and a mobile metallic ring; the shape is closed and the wax cools down until it becomes pasty before it is applied.

Usage of the Great Seal having become obsolete between 1920 and 1946, the recipe for the wax was lost. In 1946, trials had to be made by the [[Sigillography|Sigillographic]] service of the National Archives.

=== Color ===

The ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' used a green wax for important documents, and a yellow for less important ones.

The [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]], the [[July Monarchy]] and the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] kept the yellow wax, while the [[French First Republic|First Republic]], the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire|Empire]] used a red wax.

The Constitution of 1946 is sealed with red wax. The Constitution of 1958 and subsequent documents were sealed with yellow wax, until 2002 when green was again used.

=== Ribbons ===

The [[First French Empire|Empire]] sealed on wide yellow and blue silk ribbons; the Republic and the Consulate, on a tricolor braid.

The [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] used the same red and green ribbon as the Monarchy. Since 1946 (the [[Fourth French Republic|Fourth]] and [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]]s), a tricolor ribbon is in use.

It was established in 1977 by the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]] (BDA) and the Federation of German Industries (BDI).

The foundation is located in [[Cologne]], and awards the Friedwart Bruckhaus Prize&lt;!--Do NOT wikilink this prize, a redirect for it to this article has been created--&gt;, the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article115656298/Helmut-Schmidt-bekommt-Preis-der-Schleyer-Stiftung.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ehrung-fuer-helmut-schmidt-frieden-mit-der-geschichte-1.1659266&lt;/ref&gt; and the Universitas Prize for Science Journalism&lt;!--Do NOT wikilink this prize, a redirect for it to this article has been created--&gt;.

==Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize==
The foundation administers the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize (German: ''Hanns Martin Schleyer-Preis''), an award established by automobile manufacturer [[Daimler AG]] in 1982 in honor of [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]], a former business executive of the BDA and BDI.  Schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) in 1977 after being targeted by radical elements of the [[German student movement]] due to his role in those business organizations and his past activities as a former officer of the [[Schutzstaffel|Nazi SS]].&lt;ref name=Welt&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmid|first=Thomas|title=19:10:07German autumn Hanns Martin Schleyer, the unknown victims|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article1281029/Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-das-unbekannte-Opfer.html|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=Die Welt|date=Oct 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The abduction and murder were part of an RAF campaign known as the [[German Autumn]].&lt;ref name=Varon&gt;{{cite book|last=Varon|first=Jamie|title=Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|pages=197, 245, 252, 342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moncourt&gt;{{cite book|last=J Smith, André Moncourt|title=Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies|isbn=1604861797|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Die Welt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmid|first=Thomas|title=Hanns Martin Schleyer, das unbekannte Opfer|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article1281029/Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-das-unbekannte-Opfer.html|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=Die Welt|date=Oct 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to its administrator, the Prize is given annually for "outstanding contributions to consolidating and strengthening the foundations of a community based on the principle of individual freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schleyer-stiftung.de/preise/hms_preis/preise_schleyer_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225450/http://www.schleyer-stiftung.de/preise/hms_preis/preise_schleyer_e.html |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hawala scandal''', also called the '''Jain Diaries case''' or the '''hawala scam''' was an [[India]]n political and financial scandal involving payments allegedly sent by politicians (black money) through four [[hawala]] brokers, namely the Jain brothers.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vineet Narain &amp; Others vs Union Of India &amp; Another on 18 December, 1997 |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1203995/ |website=www.indiankanoon.org |publisher=Supreme court of India |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a US$18 million bribery scandal that implicated some of the country's leading politicians. It also led to a fixed tenure of minimum 2 years for CBI Directors, to prevent politicians from interfering with the Director's duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bhatnagar |first1=Gaurav |title=Why the Modi Government's Ouster of Alok Verma Is Likely to Face a Legal Challenge |url=https://thewire.in/government/cbi-alok-verma-rakesh-asthana |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=The Wire |date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The case==
In 1991, an arrest linked to militants in Kashmir led to a raid on [[hawala]] brokers, revealing evidence of large-scale payments to national politicians.&lt;ref name ="Narain"/&gt; On 25 March 1991, as per the court proceedings published by the Supreme court of India, Ashfak Hussain Lone, a person alleged to be an official of the terrorist organisation Hizbul Mujahideen, was arrested in Delhi. During his interrogation, the police learnt that his organisation was funded through hawala, using Surendra Kumar Jain and his family as a conduit. Based on this and further information received during Lone's interrogation, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted raids on the premises of Surrender Kumar Jain, his brothers, relations and businesses. During the raids, the CBI seized Indian and foreign currency, two diaries and two note books at the premises. These diaries contained detailed accounts of vast payments made to people identified only by initials. The initials corresponded to the initials of high ranking politicians, both in power and out of power, and of high ranking bureaucrats. At this stage, the investigation stopped at the CBI and neither the Jains, nor the contents of their diaries were investigated by the CBI. Meanwhile, officers of the CBI involved in the investigation were transferred out to other places by orders from ruling politicians. However, the case continued to make headlines in the newspapers media, as it was pursued by a few journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jain hawala case |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15082002/1508200258.htm |website=www.milligazette.com |publisher=Milligate archives |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 1993, writ petitions were filed at the Supreme court of India, in the public interest under Article 32 of the Constitution of the India. These contained allegations that Government agencies like the CBI and the revenue authorities had failed to perform their duties and legal obligations as they had "failed to investigate matters arising out of the seizure of the "Jan diaries"; that the apprehension of terrorists had led to the discovery of financial support to them by clandestine and illegal means using tainted funds obtained through `havala' transactions; that this had also disclosed a nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and criminals, who were recipients of money from unlawful sources, given for unlawful consideration that the CBI and other Government agencies had failed to investigate the matter, take it to its logical conclusion and prosecute all persons who were found to have committed and offence; that this was done with a view to protect the persons involved, who were very influential and powerful; that the matter disclosed a nexus between crime and corruption at high places in public life and it posed a serious threat to the integrity, security and economy of the nation; that probity in public life, the rule of law and the preservation of democracy required that the Government agencies the compelled to duly perform their legal obligations and to proceed in accordance with law against every person involved, irrespective of where he was placed in the political hierarchy." In India, the [[Hawala|Havala]] method is an illegal method of transacting in foreign currency. It is illegal and contentious due to two reasons. Firstly, it is highly secretive as it does not reveal the identity of people on either  side of the transaction, even to the havala operators. Secondly, it violates the FERA regulations of India as it does not use approved  channels of regular banks for foreign currency transactions. However, it is often used in India for two reasons. Firstly, to transfer legally earned salaries (example : by ordinary workers overseas in Saudi Arabia and UAE) to their hometowns, as hawala transaction costs are a fraction of banks, and havala operators can be found in the smallest villages of India. Secondly, by politicians, bureaucrats  and nefarious elements to transfer corruption money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Joshi |first1=G.P. |title=From hawala scam to coalgate, full circle for Supreme Court |url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/from-hawala-scam-to-coalgate-full-circle-for-supreme-court/article4677411.ece |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=The Hindu |date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of involvement of politicians in hawala==
Those accused included [[L. K. Advani]], [[V. C. Shukla]], [[P. Shiv Shankar]], [[Sharad Yadav]], [[Balram Jakhar]], and [[Madan Lal Khurana]].&lt;ref name = frontline/&gt; The entire list contained politicians from the [[BJP]], [[Congress]] and independent MLAs and MPs, with amounts varying between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 7.5 crore.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |title=WHO GOT WHAT AS PER JAIN DIARY |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15082002/1508200258.htm |website=www.milligazette.com |publisher=Milli gate archives |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution that followed was partly prompted by a public interest petition (see [[Vineet Narain]]), and yet the court cases of the Hawala scandal eventually all collapsed without convictions.  Many were acquitted in 1997 and 1998, partly because the hawala records (including diaries) were judged in court to be inadequate as the main evidence.&lt;ref name = frontline&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sudha Mahalingam|title=Jain Hawala Case: Diaries as evidence|journal=Frontline magazine|volume=15|number=6|date=21 Mar – 3 Apr 1998|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1506/15060270.htm|accessdate=2 Nov 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310210202/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1506/15060270.htm|archivedate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]'s role was criticised. In concluding the Vineet Narain case, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed that the [[Central Vigilance Commission]] should be given a supervisory role over the CBI.&lt;ref name="Narain"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vineet Narain Case, Directions of the Court |url=http://cbi.nic.in/Judgements/dsc.htm |date=2 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402221106/http://cbi.nic.in/Judgements/dsc.htm |archivedate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme court judgment==
The supreme court proceeding did not relate to the hawala case per se, but rather to the suspicious transfer of the CBI Director Joginder Singh and the rampant misuse of political power to curb the investigations of the CBI and Revenue department. In its judgment, delivered on 18 December 1997, the court, through judges S.P.Bharucha and S.C.Sen gave a ruling consisting of a 26 points list of pronouncements, the most important of which made it impossible for politicians in the government to remove the  Director of the CBI for 2 years, thus ensuring that the CBI and its officers would have freedom to carry out their work without political interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Supreme Court judges admit to pressure in hawala case |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/jul/14scourt.htm |accessdate=25 October 2018 |agency=UNI |publisher=Rediff on the net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8898">An '''ice famine''' was a scarcity of [[Ice#Production|commercial ice]], usually during the hot summer months, common before the widespread use of the [[refrigerator]]. It often resulted in the widespread [[Decomposition|spoilage]] of food and medicines, and in some instances in death from [[heat stroke]].&lt;ref name=famine&gt;{{cite news|title=Eleven Dead in Pittsburg.

==History==
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, ice was at a very high demand in America. A man named [[Frederic Tudor]], dubbed the Ice King, brought forth a whole industry for ice.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Donnell|first=Edward|title=America's Last Ice Age|url=http://inthepastlane.com/tag/ice-king/|work=In The Past Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice was a necessity for many businesses who sold food and homes who hoped to preserve their food because the [[refrigerator]] and freezer were not yet invented. The people’s only choices were commercial and residential ice boxes that needed to be replenished every time there was a drop in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice Famine: Gloomy Outlook for the Poor People of New York|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18900608.2.10.2#|newspaper=San Francisco Call|date=June 7, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor saw the importance and the possibly high demand for ice which he immediately capitalized on. He started his work in Massachusetts and expanded his market over time.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; Once his ice had chilled the drinks and preserved the food of many Americans, it quickly became a highly desired commodity, and this commodity was supplied by ice harvesting which was done on frozen over fields and bodies of water as well as ice factories. The former provided most of the ice for the industry while the latter produced a significantly lesser amount.

The ice market boomed and ice was being transported from anywhere possible to many cities in the United States. New York City and Chicago were major consumers of American ice because there were higher densities of people and businesses that heavily relied on ice.&lt;ref name="Ice Famine Imminent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice Famine Imminent|url=http://oldnews.aadl.org/node/121825|newspaper=Ann Arbor Argus|date=July 4, 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice Up to 40 Cents anda Famine in Sight|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/03/02/101710658.pdf|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 2, 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But many problems arose from the relatively new industry that did not have the best technology to ensure a sufficient supply and that wasted much of the ice during the transportation process. Since the demand for ice was so high in nearly all of the United States, any delay or shortage in supply threatened the people with an ice famine. Some of the main causes of ice famines were unreliable trains as modes of transport, ever increasing prices, and unfavorable weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Ice Famine Imminent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdnc.ucr.edu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice Famine Imminent in State's Interior|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19070806.2.26#|newspaper=San Francisco Call|date=August 5, 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, the people who controlled the ice supply in America could not control every variable that helped produce large quantities of ice, so it was never guaranteed that the American demand would be met.

One of the biggest issues in meeting the demand of ice was the lack of transportation. At this time in America, there was no such thing as refrigerated trucks that could make deliveries via highways. Instead, there was a rail system that ran ice from the mountains to different cities and towns that did not have ice factories, or had ones that could only meet some of the demand.&lt;ref name="Ice Famine Imminent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdnc.ucr.edu"/&gt; However, these rail systems were also the means of transportation for fruits and vegetables that were not local to a given area.&lt;ref name="cdnc.ucr.edu"/&gt; These three goods were all in high demand but train cars could not always be allocated in order to satisfy the demand of all three necessities.&lt;ref name="cdnc.ucr.edu"/&gt; When fruits and vegetables were priorities, ice companies would have complications getting an ample amount of ice out for shipment. The inadequate amount of train cars to meet demand was not the only issue with the rail system. The trains were just unreliable as a whole. On July 4, 1894, Ann Arbor Argus reported that Chicago had no more than a day’s worth of ice for the whole city. This normally would not be a problem with a shipment of ice on its way but the train carrying the ice was stuck outside of the city.&lt;ref name="Ice Famine Imminent"/&gt; This posed a problem for everyone in the city because they would not have any immediate means to keep their food or meat in Chicago’s meat packing district cold.

Another cause, or at least threat, of ice famine was [[World War One]]. During the war, the American government needed most of the country’s supply of ammonia.&lt;ref name="To Break the Ice Famine"&gt;{{cite news|title=To Break the Ice Famine|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/07/03/102716055.pdf|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 3, 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammonia]] was a chemical used in ice factories that helped make the ice and also refrigerated the ice until it was ready for consumption, but Americans' need for ice was considered insignificant when the American Government wanted to go to war. The government ultimately needed the ammonia to provide soldiers with sufficient ammunition to fight the war. Since a majority of the ammonia supply was fueling war efforts, ice factories could not generate nearly enough ice to meet demand. This caused the countryside and cities, especially New York City, to have small quantities of ice and no ice at all in some areas. In order to help the American people out of the ice famine, [[United States Department of Agriculture|The Department of Agriculture]] released plans to the public that described how to make, and effectively use, a homemade refrigeration unit.&lt;ref name="To Break the Ice Famine"/&gt;

Ice was not only a vital and competitive industry in the 19th and 20th centuries but it was also a controversial one in New York City. Towards the end of the 19th century, New Yorkers were unhappy with the way that the ice industry was being run. According to Historian Edward T. O’Donnell, skeptical customers accused ice companies of “price gouging and monopolistic practices”.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; The customers seemed to believe that the companies were purposely creating ice famines so that they could hike the prices. Higher prices left a lot of people without ice which made summer months very tough.  The controversy over unethical practices in the ice industry turned out to be true when New York ice companies formed into what was called the Consolidated Ice Company.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; The Consolidated Ice Company was, by definition, a monopoly that controlled everything about the ice industry in the city that consumed the most ice.   They could create an ice famine in whole communities by controlling supply and prices while against few, if any, competitors.  Shortly after Consolidated Ice Company became as powerful as it was, information surfaced about a corrupt politician helping the monopoly come to fruition.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt;
 
The worries of ice famines ended in the early 1900s. At this point in time, refrigerators and air conditioners were being introduced to the market. It did not take long for people to move away from ice-reliant storage of all kinds. In 1927, General Electric became the first company to mass-produce refrigerator units that did not need ice. This ultimately ended the ice famines and the lucrativeness of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3854|work=Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Timeline|publisher=National Academy of Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Ephraim Lovelock''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|CH|CBE|FRS}} (born 26 July 1919) is an [[independent scientist]], [[environmentalist]], and [[futurist]] who lives in [[Dorset]], England. He is best known for proposing the [[Gaia hypothesis]], which postulates that the Earth functions as a self-regulating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature.2014.15017| title = James Lovelock reflects on Gaia's legacy| journal = Nature| year = 2014| last1 = Ball | first1 = P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in medicine, he performed [[cryopreservation]] experiments on [[rodent]]s, including successfully thawing frozen specimens. His methods were influential in the theories of [[cryonics]] (the cryopreservation of humans). He invented the [[electron capture detector]], and using it, became the first to detect the widespread presence of [[chlorofluorocarbons|CFCs]] in the atmosphere. While designing scientific instruments for NASA, he developed the Gaia hypothesis. 

In the 2000s, he proposed a method of [[climate engineering]] to restore [[carbon dioxide]]-consuming [[algae]]. He has been an outspoken member of [[Environmentalists for Nuclear]], citing the effects of carbon dioxide as being more harmful to the environment, and warning of [[global warming]] due to the [[greenhouse effect]]. He has written several [[environmental science]] books based upon the Gaia hypothesis since the late 1970s.

== Biography ==
James Lovelock was born in [[Letchworth|Letchworth Garden City]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, to working class parents who were strong believers in education. Nell, his mother, started work at 13 in a pickle factory. His father, Tom, had served six months hard labour for poaching in his teens and was illiterate until attending technical college. The family moved to London, where Lovelock's dislike of authority made him, by his own account, an unhappy pupil at [[Strand School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jmhee5jrjEMC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=strand+school#PPA15,M1 |title='&amp;#39;Homage to Gaia'&amp;#39; |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-01|isbn=9780198604297 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock could not afford to go to university, something which he believes helped prevent him becoming overspecialised and aided the development of Gaia theory. He worked at a photography firm, attending [[Birkbeck College]] during the evenings, before being accepted to study chemistry at the [[University of Manchester]], where he was a student of the Nobel Prize laureate [[Alexander R.

In 1948, Lovelock received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in medicine at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]].&lt;ref name="lovephd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=James|last=Lovelock |title=The properties and use of aliphatic and hydroxy carboxylic acids in aerial disinfection |publisher=London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine |date=1947 |url=http://www.theses.com|authorlink=James Lovelock}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next two decades working at London's [[National Institute for Medical Research]].&lt;ref name=green/&gt; In the United States, he has conducted research at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Baylor College of Medicine]], and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="ecolo" /&gt;

== Career ==

In the mid-1950s, Lovelock experimented with the [[cryopreservation]] of rodents, determining that hamsters could be frozen with 60% of the water in the brain crystallized into ice with no adverse effects recorded. Other organs were shown to be susceptible to damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Cryobiological Case for Cryonics|magazine=Cryonics|page=27|date=March 1988|volume=9(3)|issue=92|publisher=[[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]]|url=https://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics8803.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were influential in the theories of [[cryonics]].

A lifelong inventor, Lovelock has created and developed many scientific instruments, some of which were designed for [[NASA]] in its planetary exploration program. It was while working as a consultant for NASA that Lovelock developed the [[Gaia hypothesis]], for which he is most widely known.

In early 1961, Lovelock was engaged by NASA to develop sensitive instruments for the analysis of extraterrestrial atmospheres and planetary surfaces. The [[Viking program]], which visited [[Mars]] in the late 1970s, was motivated in part to determine whether Mars supported life, and many of the sensors and experiments that were ultimately deployed aimed to resolve this issue. During work on a precursor of this program, Lovelock became interested in the composition of the [[Magnetosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]], reasoning that many life forms on Mars would be obliged to make use of it (and, thus, alter it). However, the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its [[chemical equilibrium]], with very little oxygen, methane, or hydrogen, but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide. To Lovelock, the stark contrast between the Martian atmosphere and chemically dynamic mixture of the Earth's biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of [[life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"/&gt; However, when they were finally launched to Mars, the [[Viking probes]] still searched (unsuccessfully) for [[extant taxon|extant]] life there.

Lovelock was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1974%2F16%27) |title=Library and Archive Catalogue EC/1974/16: Lovelock, James Ephraim |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=9 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OiVCfwZq?url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1974%2F16%27%29 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the president of the [[Marine Biological Association]] (MBA) from 1986 to 1990, and has been an Honorary Visiting Fellow of [[Green Templeton College, Oxford]] (formerly [[Green College, Oxford]]) since 1994.

As an [[independent scientist]], inventor, and author, Lovelock worked out of a barn-turned-laboratory he called his "experimental station" located in a wooded valley on the [[Devon]]/[[Cornwall]] border in the South West England.&lt;ref name="guardian_fracking"&gt;{{cite news |title=James Lovelock: The UK should be going mad for fracking |author=Hickman, Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-interview-gaia-theory |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] (UK) |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2012, he appeared on the [[Radio Four]] series ''[[The Life Scientific]]'', talking to [[Jim al-Khalili]] about the Gaia hypothesis. On the program, he mentioned how his ideas had been received by various people, including [[Jonathan Porritt]]. He also mentioned how he had a claim for inventing the [[microwave oven]]. He later explained this claim in an interview with ''[[The Manchester Magazine]]''. Lovelock said that he did create an instrument during his time studying causes of damage to living cells and tissue, which had, according to him, "almost everything you would expect in an ordinary microwave oven". He invented the instrument for the purpose of heating up frozen hamsters in a way that caused less suffering to the animals, as opposed to the traditional way which involved putting red hot spoons on the animals' chest to heat them up. He believes that at the time, nobody had gone that far and made an embodiment of an actual microwave oven.&lt;ref&gt;{{bbc programme|b01h666h|title=BBC Radio 4 - The Life Scientific: |description=James Lovelock}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he does not claim to have been the first person to have the idea of using microwaves for cooking.&lt;ref name="From Manchester to Mars"/&gt;

After the development of his [[electron capture detector]], in the late 1960s, Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=lovelock71 /&gt; He found a concentration of 60 [[parts per trillion]] of [[CFC-11]] over Ireland and, in a partially self-funded research expedition in 1972, went on to measure the concentration of CFC-11 from the northern hemisphere to the Antarctic aboard the [[research vessel]] [[RRS Shackleton|RRS ''Shackleton'']].&lt;ref name=lovelock73 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ages_gaia"&gt;Lovelock, J.E. (1989). ''The Ages of Gaia''. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. {{ISBN|0-19-286090-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He found the gas in each of the 50 air samples that he collected but, not realising that the breakdown of CFCs in the stratosphere would release [[chlorine]] that posed a threat to the [[ozone layer]], concluded that the level of CFCs constituted "no conceivable hazard".&lt;ref name="ages_gaia" /&gt; He has since stated that he meant "no conceivable toxic hazard".

However, the experiment did provide the first useful data on the ubiquitous presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused to the ozone layer by the [[photolysis]] of CFCs was later discovered by [[Frank Sherwood Rowland|Sherwood Rowland]] and [[Mario J. Molina|Mario Molina]]. After hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's results,&lt;ref name="Rowland_molina_lecture"&gt;{{cite web|title=CFC-Ozone Puzzle: Lecture |author=F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario J.

Crutzen|Paul Crutzen]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1995/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995] "for ... work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone", [[Nobel Foundation]].

=== Gaia ===
{{further|Gaia hypothesis}}
First formulated by Lovelock during the 1960s as a result of work for [[NASA]] concerned with detecting life on Mars,&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/207568a0| title = A Physical Basis for Life Detection Experiments| journal = Nature| volume = 207| issue = 4997| pages = 568–70| year = 1965| last1 = Lovelock | first1 = J.

While the [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia hypothesis]] was readily accepted by many in the [[environmentalist]] community, it has not been widely accepted within the [[scientific community]]. Among its most prominent critics are the evolutionary biologists [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Ford Doolittle]], and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], a convergence of opinion among a trio whose views on other scientific matters often diverge. These (and other) critics have questioned how [[natural selection]] operating on individual organisms can lead to the evolution of planetary-scale [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dawkins | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | title = [[The Extended Phenotype]] The Long Reach of the Gene | origyear = 1982 | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 0-19-288051-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this Lovelock, together with [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]], published the computer model [[Daisyworld]] in 1983, that postulated a hypothetical [[planet]] orbiting a star whose radiant energy is [[geologic time scale|slowly]] [[stellar evolution|increasing or decreasing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=A.J. |authorlink=Andrew Watson (scientist) |author2=J.E. Lovelock |title=Biological homeostasis of the global environment: the parable of Daisyworld |journal=[[Tellus B]] |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=286–9 |publisher=[[International Meteorological Institute]] |year=1983 |url = |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0889.1983.tb00031.x |bibcode=1983TellB..35..284W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-biological case, the temperature of this planet simply tracks the energy received from the star. However, in the biological case, ecological competition between "daisy" species with different albedo values produces a homeostatic effect on global temperature. When energy received from the star is low, black daisies proliferate since they absorb a greater fraction of the heat, but when energy input is high, white daisies predominate since they reflect excess heat. As the white and black daisies have contrary effects on the planet's overall albedo and temperature, changes in their relative populations stabilise the planet's climate and to keep temperature within an optimal range despite fluctuations in [[solar constant|energy from the star]]. Lovelock argued that Daisyworld, although a parable, illustrates how conventional natural selection operating on individual organisms can still produce planetary-scale homeostasis.

In Lovelock's 2006 book, ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'', he argues that the lack of respect humans have had for Gaia, through the damage done to [[rainforests]] and the reduction in planetary biodiversity, is testing Gaia's capacity to minimize the effects of the addition of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] in the atmosphere. This eliminates the planet's [[negative feedback]]s and increases the likelihood of [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[positive feedback]] potential associated with runaway [[global warming]]. Similarly the warming of the oceans is extending the oceanic [[thermocline]] layer of tropical oceans into the Arctic and Antarctic waters, preventing the rise of oceanic nutrients into the surface waters and eliminating the [[algal bloom]]s of [[phytoplankton]] on which oceanic [[food chain]]s depend. As phytoplankton and forests are the main ways in which Gaia draws down greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, taking it out of the atmosphere, the elimination of this environmental buffering will see, according to Lovelock, most of the earth becoming uninhabitable for humans and other life-forms by the middle of this century, with a massive extension of tropical deserts. (In 2012, Lovelock distanced himself from these conclusions, saying he had "gone too far" in describing the consequences of climate change over the next century in this book.&lt;ref name="MSNBC2012"/&gt;)

In his 2009 book, "''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''",&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, J (2009), "The Vanishing Face of Gaia" (Basic Books)&lt;/ref&gt; he rejects scientific modelling that disagrees with the scientific findings that sea levels are rising faster, and Arctic ice is melting faster, than the models predict and he suggests that we may already be beyond the tipping point of terrestrial climate resilience into a permanently hot state. Given these conditions, Lovelock expects human civilization will be hard pressed to [[end of civilization|survive]]. He expects the change to be similar to the [[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]] when [[Atmospheric carbon dioxide|atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] was 450 ppm. At that point the Arctic Ocean was 23&amp;nbsp;°C and had crocodiles in it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.04.001| title = The tipping point trend in climate change communication| journal = Global Environmental Change| volume = 19| issue = 3| pages = 336| year = 2009| last1 = Russill | first1 = C. | last2 = Nyssa | first2 = Z. }}

=== Nuclear power ===
Lovelock has become concerned about the threat of global warming from the [[greenhouse effect]]. In 2004 he caused a media sensation when he broke with many fellow environmentalists by pronouncing that "only nuclear power can now halt global warming". In his view, nuclear energy is the only realistic alternative to fossil fuels that has the capacity to both fulfill the large scale energy needs of humankind while also reducing greenhouse emissions. He is an open member of [[Environmentalists for Nuclear|Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy]].

In 2005, against the backdrop of renewed UK government interest in nuclear power, Lovelock again publicly announced his support for nuclear energy, stating, "I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/09/opinion/09kristof.html?hp Nukes Are Green], [[Nicholas Kristof]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 April 2005. Retrieved 4 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these interventions in the public debate on nuclear power are recent, his views on it are longstanding. In his 1988 book ''The Ages of Gaia'' he states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I have never regarded [[nuclear radiation]] or nuclear power as anything other than a normal and inevitable part of the environment. Our [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] forebears evolved on a planet-sized lump of [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from a star-sized nuclear explosion, a [[supernova]] that [[Nucleosynthesis|synthesised]] the [[Chemical element|elements]] that go to make our planet and ourselves."&lt;ref name="ages_gaia" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]''&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James (2006). ''The Revenge of Gaia''. Reprinted Penguin, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-14-102990-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006), where he puts forward the concept of [[sustainable retreat]], Lovelock writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A television interviewer once asked me, 'But what about nuclear waste? Will it not poison the whole biosphere and persist for millions of years?' I knew this to be a nightmare fantasy wholly without substance in the real world... One of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive nuclides is the richness of their wildlife. This is true of the land around [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], the bomb test sites of the Pacific, and areas near the United States' [[Savannah River]] nuclear weapons plant of the Second World War. Wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous, and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets... I find it sad, but all too human, that there are vast bureaucracies concerned about nuclear waste, huge organisations devoted to decommissioning power stations, but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste, carbon dioxide."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate change|Global warming}}
Writing in the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' in January 2006, Lovelock argued that, as a result of global warming, "billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable" by the end of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="jan06_lovelock"&gt;[http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article338830.ece The Earth is about to catch a morbid fever that may last as long as 100,000 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408121826/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article338830.ece |date=8 April 2006 }}, James Lovelock, ''[[The Independent]]'', 16 January 2006. Retrieved 4 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been quoted in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that 80% of humans will perish by 2100 AD, and this climate change will last 100,000 years. According to James Lovelock, by 2040, the world population of more than six billion will have been culled by floods, drought and famine. Indeed, "[t]he people of Southern Europe, as well as South-East Asia, will be fighting their way into countries such as Canada, Australia and Britain".&lt;ref name="dm20080322"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=541748&amp;in_page_id=1770 |title=Daily Mail – 22 March 2008 – We're all doomed ! 40 years from global catastrophe – says climate change expert |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2008-03-22 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"If you take the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] predictions, then by 2040 every summer in Europe will be [[2003 European heat wave|as hot as it was in 2003]] – between 110F and 120F. It is not the death of people that is the main problem, it is the fact that the plants can't grow&amp;nbsp;– there will be almost no food grown in Europe."&lt;ref name="dm20080322" /&gt;}}

{{quote|"We are about to take an evolutionary step and my hope is that the species will emerge stronger. It would be [[hubris]] to think humans as they now are God's chosen race."&lt;ref name="dm20080322" /&gt;}}

He further predicted, the average temperature in temperate regions would increase by as much as 8&amp;nbsp;°C and by up to 5&amp;nbsp;°C in the tropics, leaving much of the world's land uninhabitable and unsuitable for farming, with northerly migrations and new cities created in the Arctic. He predicted much of Europe will have become uninhabitable having turned to desert and Britain will have become Europe's "life-raft" due to its stable temperature caused by being surrounded by the ocean. He suggested that "we have to keep in mind the awesome pace of change and realise how little time is left to act, and then each community and nation must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation for as long as they can".&lt;ref name="jan06_lovelock" /&gt;

He partly retreated from this position in a September 2007 address to the [[World Nuclear Association]]'s Annual Symposium, suggesting that climate change would stabilise and prove survivable, and that the Earth itself is in "no danger" because it would stabilise in a new state. Life, however, might be forced to migrate ''en masse'' to remain in habitable climes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=13998&amp;LangType=2057&amp;terms=lovelock Lovelock: "Respect the Earth"], ''World Nuclear News'', 6 September 2007.

In a March 2010 interview with ''The Guardian'' newspaper, he said that democracy might have to be "put on hold" to prevent climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/29/james-lovelock-climate-change "James Lovelock: Humans are too stupid to prevent climate change"], 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He continued:

{{quote|"Even the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches, democracy must be put on hold for the time being. I have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while."}}

Statements from 2012 portray Lovelock as continuing his concern over global warming while at the same time criticizing extremism and suggesting alternatives to oil, coal and the green solutions he does not support.&lt;ref name="MSNBC2012"&gt;{{cite web|title='Gaia' scientist James Lovelock: I was 'alarmist' about climate change |url=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/23/11144098-gaia-scientist-james-lovelock-i-was-alarmist-about-climate-change?lite |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=12 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424004036/https://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/23/11144098-gaia-scientist-james-lovelock-i-was-alarmist-about-climate-change?lite |first=Ian |last=Johnston|archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2012 interview, aired on [[MSNBC]], Lovelock stated that he had been "alarmist", using the words "All right, I made a mistake," about the timing of climate change and noted the documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' and the book ''[[The Weather Makers]]'' as examples of the same kind of alarmism. Lovelock still believes the climate to be warming although the rate of change is not as he once thought, he admitted that he had been "extrapolating too far." He believes that climate change is still happening, but it will be felt farther in the future.&lt;ref name="MSNBC2012"/&gt; Of the claims "the science is settled" on global warming he states:&lt;ref name="drivel"/&gt;  {{quote |"One thing that being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything. You never know the truth. You can only approach it and hope to get a bit nearer to it each time. You iterate towards the truth. You don’t know it."&lt;ref name="drivel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Green ‘drivel’ exposed|author=Goldstein, Lorrie|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/22/green-drivel|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=23 June 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He criticizes environmentalists for treating global warming like a religion.&lt;ref name="drivel"/&gt; {{quote |"It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion," Lovelock observed}} {{quote | "I don't think people have noticed that, but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use … The greens use guilt. That just shows how religious greens are. You can’t win people round by saying they are guilty for putting (carbon dioxide) in the air."&lt;ref name="drivel"/&gt;}}
In the MSNBC article Lovelock is quoted as proclaiming:&lt;ref name="MSNBC2012"/&gt; {{quote |"The problem is we don't know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn't happened;" he continues}}  {{quote|"The climate is doing its usual tricks. There’s nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now," he said}} {{quote |The world has not warmed up very much since the millennium. Twelve years is a reasonable time ... it (the temperature) has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been rising - carbon dioxide is rising, no question about that", he added.&lt;ref name="MSNBC2012"/&gt;}}  In a follow up interview Lovelock stated his support for [[natural gas]]; he now favors  [[fracking]]  as a low-polluting alternative to coal.&lt;ref name="guardian_fracking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="drivel"/&gt; He opposes the concept of "sustainable development", where modern economies might be powered by wind turbines, calling it meaningless drivel.&lt;ref name="drivel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop_Hill_-_wind_turbines_letter"&gt;{{cite web

==== Geoengineering ====
In September 2007, Lovelock and [[Chris Rapley]] proposed the construction of ocean pumps to pump water up from below the [[thermocline]] to "fertilize algae in the surface waters and encourage them to bloom".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = E. | first2 = G. | title = Ocean pipes could help the Earth to cure itself| last2 = Rapley | journal = Nature | volume = 449 | issue = 7161 | pages = 403 | date=Sep 2007 | last1 = Lovelock | issn = 0028-0836 | pmid = 17898747 | doi = 10.1038/449403a|bibcode = 2007Natur.449..403L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea was to accelerate the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean by increasing [[primary production]] and enhancing the [[export production|export]] of organic carbon (as [[marine snow]]) to the deep ocean.  A scheme similar to that proposed by Lovelock and Rapley is already being independently developed by a commercial company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmocean.com/sequestration.htm Biological Ocean Sequestration of {{CO2}} Using Atmocean Upwelling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013153833/http://atmocean.com/sequestration.htm |date=13 October 2007 }}, Atmocean.

====Sustainable retreat====
Sustainable retreat is a concept developed by James Lovelock in order to define the necessary changes to human settlement and dwelling at the global scale with the purpose of adapting to global warming and preventing its expected negative consequences on humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James (2006). The Revenge of Gaia: Why the Earth Is Fighting Back - and How We Can Still Save Humanity. [[Santa Barbara, California]]: [[Allen Lane]]. {{ISBN|0-7139-9914-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock thinks the time is past for [[sustainable development]], and that we have come to a time when development is no longer [[sustainable]].  Therefore, we need to retreat. Lovelock states the following in order to explain the concept:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodell |first=Jeff |author-link=Jeff Goodell |date=November 1, 2007 |title=James Lovelock, the Prophet |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Retreat, in his view, means it's time to start talking about changing where we live and how we get our food; about making plans for the migration of millions of people from low-lying regions like [[Bangladesh]] into Europe; about admitting that [[New Orleans]] is a goner and moving the people to cities better positioned for the future. Most of all, he says, it's about everybody "absolutely doing their utmost to sustain civilization, so that it doesn't degenerate into Dark Ages, with warlords running things, which is a real danger. We could lose everything that way.}}

The concept of sustainable retreat emphasized a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs with lower levels and/or less environmentally harmful types of resources.

==Awards and honours==
Lovelock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974. His nomination reads: {{quote|Lovelock has made distinguished contributions to several diverse fields, including a study of the transmission of [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] infection, and methods of air [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilisation]]; the role of [[Calcium|Ca]] and other [[divalent]] [[ion]]s in [[Coagulation|blood clotting]]; damage to various living cells by freezing, thawing and [[thermal shock]] and its prevention by the presence of neutral [[solute]]s; methods of freezing and thawing small live animals; methods for preparing sperm for [[artificial insemination]], which have been of major economic importance.
He has invented a family of [[ionization|ionisation]] detectors for [[gas chromatography]]. His [[electron capture detector]]s are the most sensitive that have been made and are universally used on pollution problems for residual halogen compounds. He has many inventions, including a gas chromatograph, which will be used to investigate planetary atmospheres.
His chromatographic work has led to investigation of blood lipids in various animals, including [[arteriosclerotic]] humans. He has made a study of detecting life on other planets by analysis of their atmosphere and extended this to world pollution problems.
His work generally shows remarkable originality, simplicity and ingenuity.&lt;ref name="royal"/&gt;}}

Lovelock has been awarded a number of prestigious prizes including the Tswett Medal (1975), the [[American Chemical Society]] Award in Chromatography (1980), the [[World Meteorological Organization]] Norbert Gerbier–MUMM Award (1988), the [[Heineken Prizes|Dr A.H. Heineken Prize]] for Environmental Sciences (1990) and the [[Royal Geographical Society]] Discovery Lifetime award (2001).  In 2006 he received the [[Wollaston Medal]], the [[Geological Society of London]]'s highest award, whose previous recipients include Charles Darwin [http://www.jameslovelock.org/page7.html]. Lovelock was appointed a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for services to the study of the Science and Atmosphere in the [[1990 New Year Honours]] and a Member of the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] (CH) for services to Global Environment Science in the [[2003 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51981 |date=29 December 1989 |page=8 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=56797 |date=31 December 2002 |page=26 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portraits of Lovelock ==
In March 2012, the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]&lt;ref name="npg"&gt;{{NPG name | id=06519 |name=James Lovelock }}&lt;/ref&gt; unveiled a new portrait of Lovelock by British artist Michael Gaskell (2011). The collection also has two photographic portraits by [[Nick Sinclair]] (1993) and Paul Tozer (1994).&lt;ref name="npg"/&gt; The archive of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] has a 2009 image taken by [[Anne-Katrin Purkiss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The RSA The RSA+ Add Contact |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/the_rsa/3344496740/ |title=James Lovelock by Anne Purkiss &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock agreed to sit for sculptor [[Jon Edgar]] in Devon during 2007, as part of The [[Environment Triptych]] (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=authors|first=various|title=Responses – Carvings and Claywork – Jon Edgar Sculpture 2003-2008|year=2008|publisher=Hesworth Press|location=UK|isbn=978-0-9558675-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with heads of [[Mary Midgley]] and [[Richard Mabey]].

Morris is a creationist author and speaks at a variety of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.icr.org/pdf/af/af0707.pdf | format=PDF | title=Intelligent Design:Strengths, Weaknesses,and the Differences | publisher=[[Institute for Creation Research]] | date=7 July 2007 | first= | last= | accessdate=2006-12-11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713220301/http://www.icr.org/pdf/af/af0707.pdf | archivedate=13 July 2007 | df=dmy-all }} page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his presentations discuss the fossil record and its relation to evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people = John Morris |date = 2010 | title = The Fossil Record: A Problem for Evolution | url = http://vimeo.com/10259866 | medium = TV Broadcast| location = Waukesha, WI | publisher = [[VCY America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Morris has a B.S. in Civil Engineering from [[Virginia Tech]] (1969), an M.S., [[University of Oklahoma]] (1977), and a Ph.D., [[University of Oklahoma]] (1980) in Geological Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/326.asp | title=John D.

In 1984 he joined the Institute for Creation Research and in 1996 he became its president.

==Criticism==
{{undue weight|section|reason=There is no problem with having a criticism section, but having one so long in comparison with the rest of the article gives undue weight to it|date=March 2015}}
Critics have disputed some of Morris's claims. For instance, the following statement by Morris:

{{quote|From the neck down, certain clues suggested to [[Donald Johanson|Johanson]] that [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] walked a little more erect than today's chimps. This conclusion, based on his interpretation of the partial hip bone and a knee bone, has been hotly contested by many paleoanthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1994) quoted in [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_piths.html Creationist Arguments: Australopithecines], [[TalkOrigins Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

... elicited the following response from Jim Foley in [[TalkOrigins Archive]]:

{{quote|Almost everything in this quote is a distortion (Johanson's and Lucy's names are about the only exceptions). "Certain clues suggested" doesn't mention that the whole find screamed "bipedality" to every qualified scientist who looked at it. "A little more erect", when everyone believes that Lucy was fully erect. "The partial hip bone and a knee bone", when Lucy included almost a complete pelvis and leg (taking mirror imaging into account, and excluding the foot). "Has been hotly contested", when no reputable paleoanthropologist denies that Lucy was bipedal. The debates are about whether she was also arboreal, and about how similar the biomechanics of her locomotion was to that of humans. Given that we have most of Lucy's leg and pelvis, one has to wonder what sort of fossil evidence it would take to convince creationists of australopithecine bipedality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_piths.html Creationist Arguments: Australopithecines], Jim Foley, [[TalkOrigins Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony''' was an experiment in [[workers' control]] in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1926 during the [[New Economic Policy]]. It was based in [[Shcheglovsk]], [[Kuznetsk Basin|Kuzbass]], [[Siberia]].

Several [[linguistics|linguistic]] issues have arisen in relation to the spelling of the words '''''[[euro]]''''' and '''''cent''''' in the many languages of the member states of the [[European Union]], as well as in relation to [[grammar]] and the formation of [[plurals]].

&lt;!--Attention: The text of the recommendations in the EC style guides has changed since 2006. Note the access dates for the references. --&gt;
In official documents, the name "euro" must be used for the nominative singular in all languages, though different alphabets are taken into account and plural forms and [[declensions]] are accepted. In documents other than EU legal texts, including national legislation, other spellings are accepted according to the various grammatical rules of the respective language.&lt;ref name="eurorules"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/the_euro/notes_coins8958_en.htm | title = The euro: The euro 'rules' | accessdate = 12 January 2009 | author=European Commission | authorlink = European Commission | quote = The name of the single currency must be the same in all the official languages of the EU, taking into account the different alphabets. This is to ensure consistency and to avoid confusion in the single market. In all EU legal texts, the nominative singular spelling must be 'euro' in all languages ('ευρώ' in Greek alphabet; 'евро' in Cyrillic alphabet). Plural forms and declensions are accepted as long as they do not change the 'eur-' root. In documents other than EU legal texts, including national legislation, other spellings are accepted according to the various grammatical rules used in each language. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TrStyleGuide"&gt;{{cite book| url = https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf| title = English Style Guide: A handbook for authors and translators in the European Commission| accessdate = 12 January 2009|date=May 2008| format = PDF| work=| edition = Fifth edition (revised) | publisher=European Commission Directorate-General for Translation|quote=20.8 The euro.

:&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The language is not only an official language in a [[eurozone]] member state, but has also been accepted as an official language for use in [[EU institutions]], meaning there are official spellings in EU documents and on EU websites. Some languages may be official in their eurozone [[EU Member State|member state]] but have not been accepted as official in the EU. This is the case, for instance, with three of the four official languages of Spain, whose government itself has blocked the acceptance of the other three for official use in the EU.&lt;/small&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; English and Swedish are marked by the euro sign because they are official languages of eurozone member states and have been accepted as official languages of the EU for institutional use (English being an official language in [[Ireland]] and [[Malta]], and Swedish in [[Finland]]), despite the fact that neither [[Sweden]] nor the [[United Kingdom]] use the euro. Turkish is not marked by the euro sign because, although it is an official language in [[Cyprus]] and the euro is the official currency there, it has not been accepted as an official language in EU institutions.&lt;/small&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Partitive]] [[Grammatical number|singular]]. Most languages use a plural or immutable singular with numbers, but Estonian and Finnish use the [[partitive case]].&lt;/small&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Welsh follows numerals with the singular form of the noun.&lt;/small&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; In most Slavic languages numerals are sometimes followed by the genitive case instead of the nominative.&lt;/small&gt;

===Asturian===

In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], there has been a controversy about the spelling of the word. The official [[Academia de la Llingua Asturiana|academic]] dictionary uses the spelling ''euru'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academiadelallingua.com/diccionariu/index.php?cod=24154 |title=Academia de la Llingua Asturiana, '&amp;#39;Diccionariu de la Llingua Asturiana'&amp;#39; |publisher=Academiadelallingua.com |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; respecting the Asturian tendency to write nouns with a final ''-u''. However, considering that the international use is ''euro'' and that there is a tendency in Asturian to write some short forms with a final ''-o'' (like ''euro'' from ''Europa''), other linguists, like [[Ramón d'Andrés]], defend the spelling ''euro''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asturies.com/paxina.php?fpaxina=bilordios0218 Ramón d'Andrés, "Euru, euro"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226031106/http://www.asturies.com/paxina.php?fpaxina=bilordios0218 |date=26 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgarian===

[[File:EUR 10 obverse (2014 issue).png|thumb|[[10 euro note]] from the new Europa series written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (EURO) and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] (ΕΥΡΩ) alphabets, but also in the [[Bulgarian alphabet|Cyrillic]] (ЕВРО) alphabet, as a result of [[Bulgaria]] joining the European Union in 2007]]
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] uses [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. The current design of [[euro banknotes]], except for the "new" €5, €10, €20, €50, and upcoming €100 banknotes, has the word ''euro'' written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets. The [[Euro banknotes#Europa series|2013 design of the € 5 banknote]] introduced Cyrillic, adopting the spelling '''ЕВРО''', as described below.
When Bulgaria issues Euro coins, if the Greek model is followed, the alternative spelling will go on the national ([[obverse]]) side.

In popular Bulgarian usage the currency is referred to as евро {{IPA-mk|ˈɛvro|}} and, less often, {{IPA-mk|ɛvˈro|}} (from Bulgarian Европа {{IPA|[ɛvˈropa]}}, meaning ''Europe''); the plural varies in spoken language – евро, евра {{IPA|[ɛvˈra]}}, еврота {{IPA|[ˈɛvrota]}} – but the most widespread form is евро – without inflection in plural. The word for euro, though, has a normal form with the postpositive [[definite article]] – еврото (the euro).

The word for eurocent is евроцент {{IPA-mk|ˈɛvrotsɛnt|}} and most probably that, or only цент {{IPA|[ˈtsɛnt]}}, will be used in future when the European currency is accepted in Bulgaria. In contrast to euro, the word for "cent" has a full inflection both in the definite and the plural form: евроцент (basic form), евроцентът (full definite article – postpositive), евроцентове (plural), 2 евроцента (numerative form – after numerals). The word stotinki (стотинки), singular stotinka (стотинка), the name of the subunit of the current Bulgarian currency can be used in place of cent, as it has become a synonym of the word "coins" in colloquial Bulgarian; just like "cent" (from Latin centum), its [[etymology]] is from a word meaning hundred – "sto" (сто). Stotinki is used widely in the Bulgarian diaspora in Europe to refer to subunits of currencies other than the [[Bulgarian lev]].

Initially, the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and the [[European Commission]] insisted that Bulgaria change the name it uses for the currency from '''ЕВРО''' to '''ЕУРО''', claiming the currency should have an official and standard spelling across the EU. Bulgaria on the other hand stated that it wants to take into account the different alphabet and the principle of phonetic orthography in the Bulgarian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/to-the-editor-oyro-yuro-or-evro/id_18641/catid_27 |title=letter to the editor |publisher=The Sofia Echo |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue was decisively resolved in favour of Bulgaria at the [[2007 EU Summit]] in [[Lisbon]], allowing Bulgaria to use the Cyrillic spelling евро on all official EU documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSL1868684020071018 | title=Bulgaria wins victory in "evro" battle | date=18 October 2007 |agency=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elena Koinova |url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/evro-dispute-over--portuguese-foreign-minister/id_25576/catid_66 |title="Evro" dispute over – Portuguese foreign minister |publisher=The Sofia Echo |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 13 December 2007, all EU institutions – including the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] – use '''ЕВРО''' as the official Bulgarian transliteration of the single European currency.

Of other national Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet, [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] also use the spelling '''евро'''. [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] uses '''євро''' and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] uses '''еўра'''/'''эўра'''.

===Catalan===

In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the official plural is the same as its regular plural ''euros''. The standard pronunciation of "euro" is {{IPA-ca|ˈɛwɾu|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/template.PAGE/menuitem.0ee0bcc77434e6b0a2fd1210b0c0e1a0/?javax.portlet.tpst=a4e9697d75bfaa0dcc497c10d8c0e1a0&amp;javax.portlet.prp_a4e9697d75bfaa0dcc497c10d8c0e1a0=tipusCerca%3Dcerca.tot%26action%3DPrincipal%26databaseFilterName%3DFitxes%2Bde%2Bl%2527Optimot%26idHit%3D346043%26databases_avansada%3D%26categories_avansada%3D%26parameterFilter%3DFon%25C3%25A8tica%2Bi%2Bpros%25C3%25B2dia%26numeroResultat%3D10%26numPagina%3D1%26parameterField%3DFITXES_PUB%26input_cercar%3Dcatal%25C3%25A0%2Bd%2527Arag%25C3%25B3%26idFont%3D6678%26databaseFilter%3DFITXES_PUB%26database%3DFITXES_PUB%26method%3Ddetall%26tipusFont%3DFitxes%2Bde%2Bl%2527Optimot&amp;javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&amp;javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken | title = Consultes lingüístiques, pronunciació del mot euro | accessdate = 23 May 2010 | author=Generalitat de Catalunya | authorlink = Generalitat of Catalonia | quote = El mot euro es pronuncia diferent, segons la procedència de cada parlant: en català central i a Menorca i a les Pitiüses, la e d'aquest mot es pronuncia oberta i la vocal final es pronuncia u; a Mallorca, la e es pronuncia oberta i la o final es pronuncia tancada; en català occidental, tant en nord-occidental com en valencià, la e i la o es pronuncien tancades.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the cent, the word ''cèntim'' ({{IPA-ca|ˈsɛntim|pron}}, plural ''cèntims'') is used, since historically this term has been used as the hundredth part of a currency unit. The fraction of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] was also called ''cèntim'', but it was withdrawn from circulation decades ago.

===Cornish===

In the [[Cornish language]], euro is written ''ewro'' (like ''Ewrop'' 'Europe'), a masculine noun with its plural ''ewros''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Williams]], [http://www.evertype.com/books/english-cornish-dictionary.html English-Cornish Dictionary Gerlyver Sawsnek-Kernowek], Second edition, 2006. Redruth: Agan Tavas. {{ISBN|1-901409-09-0}}; {{ISBN|978-1-901409-09-3}}. Westport: Evertype. {{ISBN|1-904808-06-9}}; {{ISBN|978-1-904808-06-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For cent, ''cent'' is used, a masculine noun with the plural ''centys''.

===Croatian===

In [[Croatian language|Croatian]] the euro and cent are called ''euro'' and ''cent'' (occasionally the word ''eurocent'' is used instead of ''cent'' to distinguish the euro denomination versus its foreign counterparts).

Plural forms are, like in many Slavic languages, somewhat complex. The general plural form of euro is ''euri'', but the [[paucal]] or identically written (but not identically pronounced) genitive plural ''eura'' is used with all numbers, thus ''27 eura''. The numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 21 or 101) take the nominative singular, the exception being numbers ending in 11 (e.g. 11 or 111). The examples are: ''21 euro'', ''101 euro'', ''11 eura'', and ''111 eura'' respectively.

The general plural form of cent is ''centi'' and it is used with most numbers. The numbers ending in 1, except for those ending in 11, take the nominative singular ''cent'', while those ending in 2, 3 and 4 except 12, 13 or 14 take the paucal ''centa''. The examples are: ''1 cent'', ''4 centa'', ''7 centi'', ''10 centi'', ''11 centi'', ''12 centi'', ''22 centa'', ''27 centi'', ''31 cent'', ''101 cent'', ''102 centa'', ''111 centi''.

Both ''euro'' and ''cent'' in Croatian are of [[masculine gender]].

Pronunciation follows the rules of Croatian. ''Euro'' is pronounced {{IPA-sh|euro|}}, while ''cent'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈtsent]}}.

===Czech===

In [[Czech language|Czech]], the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' are spelt the same as in English and pronounced per Czech phonology {{IPA-cs|ˈɛuro|}}, {{IPA|[tsɛnt]}}. Occasionally the word ''eurocent'' is used instead of ''cent'' to distinguish the euro denomination versus its foreign counterparts. The spelling differs from the Czech word for Europe (''Evropa''); however "euro-" has become a standard prefix for all things relating to the EU (''Evropská unie'').

The [[Czech declension]] uses different form of [[plural]] for various numerals: for 2, 3 and 4, it is plain [[nominative]] ''eura'' and ''centy'', while for numbers above 5, [[genitive]] (a vestige of [[partitive]]) ''eur'' and ''centů'' is used.

For compound numerals, there are two variants: either genitive plural is used (''21 eur'', ''22 eur'') or the form is determined by the unit part of the numeral (''21 euro'', ''22 eura''). The partitive genitive is used only when the whole numeral phrase is in nominative or accusative phrases, otherwise the expected case is used: ''sedm eur'' (7 euros-genitive), but ''se sedmi eury'' (with seven-instrumental euro-instrumental). Moreover, these otherwise common declensions are often ignored and non-declined ''euro'' is used for every value (''22 euro''), even though this form is grammatically incorrect.

In Czech ''euro'' is of [[neuter gender]] and inflected as ''město'', while ''cent'' is masculine and inflected as ''hrad''.

===Danish===

The word ''euro'' is included in the 2002 version of ''[[Retskrivningsordbogen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=''euro'' entry in Retskrivningsorbogen 
 |publisher=[[Dansk Sprognævn]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authoritative source for the [[Danish language]] (according to Danish law). Two plurals are given, ''euro'' when referring to an amount, and ''euroer'' when referring to coins. Both ''cent'' and ''eurocent'' are mentioned; the plural and singular forms are identical.

Danish words of Greek origin containing the sequence ''eu'' are traditionally pronounced with [œʊ̯], e.g. ''Zeus, terapeut, eutanasi, Europa''. However, in the word ''Europa'', a newer pronunciation with [eʊ̯] has gained ground in recent years, but this has not influenced the way ''euro'' is commonly pronounced.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Dutch===

'''Plural:''' In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], most abstract [[units of measurement]] are not pluralised, including the former [[Dutch guilder]] (''gulden'' in Dutch) and [[Belgian franc]] (called ''frank'' in Dutch), and now the euro. An amount such as €5 is pronounced ''5 euro''. This coincides with EU legislation stating that ''euro'' and ''cent'' should be used as both singular and plural. In Dutch, the words are however pluralised as ''euro's'' and ''centen'' when referring to individual coins.

The euro is divided into 100 ''cent'', as was the guilder. The Belgian franc was divided into 100 ''centiemen''. The word ''eurocent'' is sometimes used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Mogen winkeliers betalingen afronden op 5 eurocent? | work=Postbus 51 | publisher=het ministerie van Algemene Zaken | url =http://www.postbus51.nl/nl/home/themas/consumentenzaken/financiele-dienstverlening-en-krediet/geld-en-betalen/euro/mogen-winkeliers-betalingen-afronden-op-vijf-eurocent.html | accessdate =5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Afronding eurocent | work=Eurobankbiljetten en munten | publisher=De Nederlandsche Bank | url =http://www.dnb.nl/betalingsverkeer/eurobankbiljetten-en-munten/afronding-eurocent/index.jsp | accessdate =5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from the cents of other currencies, such as the ''dollarcent'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Euro stijgt boven 85 dollarcent uit | date = 28 November 2000 | work=de Volkskrant | publisher=Persgroep Nederland | url =http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article868411.ece/Euro_stijgt_boven_85_dollarcent_uit | accessdate =5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but originally mainly to differentiate it from what used to be 0.01 guilder, also called "cent".

'''Pronunciation:''' The word ''euro'' is {{IPA|/ˈøːroː/}} phonemically. This can be pronounced the same phonetically, but commonly also as {{IPA|[ˈʏːroː]}}, {{IPA|[ˈʏːroʊ]}}, and others depending on the dialect and speaker (see [[Dutch phonology]]).

'''Slang terms:''' In the Netherlands, slang terms that were previously applied to guilder coinage and banknotes are sometimes applied to euro currency. Examples in the Netherlands include ''[[stuiver]]'' for 5 cents, ''[[dubbeltje]]'' for 10 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deweekkrant.nl/artikel/2007/november/27/drinkwater_dubbeltje_goedkoper/ |title=For instance in the headline of this 2007 local newspaper |publisher=Deweekkrant.nl |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word ''[[Twenty-five cent coin (Netherlands)|kwartje]]'' (quarter), previously used for a guilder coin worth ƒ0.25, did not survive the introduction of the euro, which lacks a coin worth €0.25. Another popular slang term is the plural form ''euri'' ({{IPA|/ˈøːri/}}) (or even the [[double plural]] ''euries'' ({{IPA|/ˈøːris/}})), a deliberate [[Hypercorrection|hypercorrect]] form referring to the plural of Dutch words of Latin or Italian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/euri |title=euri / euro's - Genootschap Onze Taal |publisher=Onzetaal.nl |date= |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium, some [[Flemings]] refer to the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins as ''koper'', which is the Dutch word for copper, the metal these coins are made of (compare [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]). Another nickname is "ros" ([[red hair|"redhead"]]) or "roskes" ("little redheads"), referring to the colour of the coins.

'''Syntax:''' In Dutch language print, the [[euro sign]] (€) is chiefly placed before the amount, from which it is often separated by a (thin) space.&lt;ref name=dutch_valuta&gt;[http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1178 Euro: valutateken voor of achter het bedrag?], Nederlandse Taalunie, retrieved 21 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the case with the [[florin sign]] (ƒ).

===English===

Official practice for [[English language|English-language]] EU legislation (not necessarily in national legislation&lt;ref name="eurorules"/&gt;) is to use the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' as both singular and plural.&lt;ref name="Spellings_in_Official_Languages"/&gt; This practice originally arose out of legislation intended to ensure that the banknotes were uncluttered with a string of plurals. Because the ''s''-less plurals had become "enshrined" in EU legislation, the Commission decided to retain those plurals in English in legislation even while allowing regular plurals in other languages.&lt;ref name="Michael Everson"&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Michael Everson]]

Prior to 2006, the inter-institutional style guide recommended use of ''euro'' and ''cent'' without the plural ''s'', and the translation style guide recommended use of invariant plurals (without ''s'') when amending or referring to original legislation but use of regular plurals in documents intended for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;The old text is quoted here:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp2.pdf | title = ECB Legal Working Paper Series No. 2: The Application of Multilingualism in the European Union Context | accessdate = 13 January 2009 | author=Phoebus Athanassiou |date=February 2006| format = PDF| publisher=[[European Central Bank]]| page = 27, footnote 111| quote = Translation style guide (20.7) "Guidelines on the use of the euro, issued via the Secretariat-General, state that the plurals of both 'euro' and 'cent' are to be written without 's' in English. Do this when amending or referring to legal texts that themselves observe this rule. However, in all other texts, especially documents intended for the general public, use the natural plurals 'euros' and 'cents'."&lt;br/&gt; Interinstitutional style guide (7.3.1): "In English, the terms euro and cent are invariable (no plural 's'), notwithstanding the acknowledgement in a footnote that 'The spelling without an "s" may be seen as departing from usual English practice for currencies'."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a limited development of the term "eurozoner", as a demonym for people in the [[eurozone]]. Although it began to appear at the turn of the 2000s, its usage is still rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0103/1230842381525.html |title=Irish Times |publisher=Irish Times |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Ireland====

As the euro was being adopted in Ireland the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]] decided to use the word ''euro'' as both the singular and plural forms of the currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = An open letter to the Minister for Finance | publisher=[[Michael Everson]], |date=22 March 2002 | url = http://www.evertype.com/standards/euro/open-letter.pdf | accessdate = 28 February 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evertype.com/standards/euro/mccreevy.html |title=Charlie McCreevy: Response to the Open Letter to the Minister, |publisher=Evertype.com |date= 17 April 2002 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with the general construction on plurals in Irish{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} and has precedent in English (the yen, [[South Korean won|won]], [[South African rand|rand]] and [[baht]]), thus meaning the same word could be used in the two official languages of the state, Irish and English. Because Irish broadcasters took their cue from the Department,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} the "legislative plurals" tend to also be used on the news and in much Irish advertising. This has had the effect of reinforcing the ''s''-less plurals. The print media also follows the popular usage of "euro" for both banknotes and amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1012/1224305643976.html |title=Another money scandal, another big payout |work=The Irish Times |date= 12 October 2011 | accessdate = 18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/chasing-the-hot-money-of-costa-del-tax-dodgers-1375570.html |title=Chasing the hot money of Costa Del tax dodgers |work=The Irish Independent |date= 15 May 2008 | accessdate = 18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kfgbsngbojgb/rss2/ |title=Dump clean-up delayed to mid-2012 |work=The Irish Examiner |date= 5 October 2008 | accessdate = 18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In English-speaking countries outside Europe====

The term '''euro-cent''' is sometimes used{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in countries (such as Australia, Canada, and the United States) which also have "cent" as a currency subdivision, to distinguish them from their local coin. This usage, though unofficial, is mirrored on the coins themselves, which have the words ''EURO'' and ''CENT'' displayed on the common side.

===Faroese===

In [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (and Icelandic&lt;!-- Iceland has not adopted the Euro, only part of [[European Economic Area]], thus no need for a section--&gt;) the euro is called '''evra''', a feminine noun derived from the Faroese name of Europe, ''Evropa''; this makes Faroese (with Icelandic&lt;!--Just wrong(?), see Maltese-section: "and Maltese"--&gt;) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: '''evrur'''. The cents are often called '''sent''' which is a neuter word and has the same form in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural.

===Finnish===

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] pronunciation for "euro" is {{IPA-fi|ˈeuro|}}. In Finnish, the form ''sentti'' {{IPA-fi|ˈsentːi|}} is used for the cent – the letter 'c' is generally not used in Finnish, and nativized Finnish words cannot end in consonant combinations like '-nt', therefore an extra vowel 'i' is added. ''euro'' and ''sentti'' are declined like many other existing words ending in ''-o'' and ''-i'', and ''sentti'' displays [[consonant gradation]] (genitive ''euron'', ''sen'''t'''in''). With numerals, the [[partitive case|partitive]] singulars ''euroa'' and ''senttiä'' are used, e.g., ''10 euroa''. This is abbreviated ''10 €'', where the ''€'' symbol takes the role of the word ''euroa'' (never *''€10'' or *''10€''). The colon notation (''€:a'') must not be used with the partitive of ''euro'' when the number is in the nominative. In general, colon notation should be avoided and, for example, one should write ''euron'' or ''euroa'' instead of ''€:n'' or ''€:a''.

Plurals (e.g., ''kymmenet eurot'' "tens of euros") exist, but they are not used with singular numbers (e.g., ''kymmenen euroa'' "ten euro").

''Sentti'' is problematic in that its primary meaning in colloquial language is "centimeter". Thus, the officially recommended abbreviation of ''sentti'' is ''snt'', although Finnish merchants generally use a decimal notation (for example ''0,35 €'').

'''Slang terms:''' In [[Helsinki slang]], a common nickname for euro is ''ege''. In [[Tampere]] slang ''Eero'', a common male name, may be used for euro.

===French===

In French, the singular is ''un euro'' (masculine). The official plural is the same as the regular plural ''euros''.
The [[Académie française]], which is regarded as an authority for the French language in France, stated this clearly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/questions.html#euro |title=Langue française-Questions de langue |publisher=Academie-francaise.fr |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131914/http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/questions.html#euro |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; following French legislation in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/cogeter/2-12-97-euro.htm |title=Commission générale de terminologie et de néologie |publisher=Culture.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the word ''[[centime]]'' is far more common than ''cent'' and is recommended by the Académie française.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.academie-francaise.fr/actualites/actu_2001.asp#centime | title = Communiqués de presse | accessdate = 22 March 2009 | author=Académie française | authorlink = Académie française | quote = L’Académie française à l’unanimité, dans sa séance du jeudi 13 décembre 2001, rappelle que la centième partie de l’euro doit se dire et s’écrire centime. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Centime'' used to be a hundredth of the [[French franc]] which is now called ''centime de franc''. The word ''cent'' (plural ''cents'', both pronounced {{IPA-fr|sɛnt|}} to avoid the confusion with ''cent'' (100) pronounced {{IPA-fr|sɑ̃|}}) is the official term to be used in the French-language version of community legislation.&lt;ref name="Spellings_in_Official_Languages"/&gt; Before its use in relation to the euro, the word "cent" (pronounced as in English, {{IPA|[sɛnt]}}) was best known to European Francophones as a hundredth of a dollar (U.S., Canadian, etc.)

French-speaking Belgians use ''cent'' more often than ''centime'' because{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} ''centime'' coins for the Belgian franc (worth, on 1 January 1999 about three U.S. cents) rarely circulated (only a 50 centime coin was still being issued) and because{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} of the influence of Dutch and English, which are more commonly used in Belgium than in France as a result of [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|Belgium's language diversity]].

===German===

'''Plural:''' In German, ''Euro'' and ''Cent'' are used as both singular and plural when following a numeral, as is the case with all units of measurement of masculine (e.g. ''Meter'', ''Dollar'') or neuter gender (e.g. ''Kilo[gramm]'', etc.). However, when talking about individual coins, the plurals ''Euros'' and ''Cents'' are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Babel | first =Ralph | title =Euro und Euros, Cent und Cents, Pence und Pennies | work=Singular und Plural | publisher=Faql.de | url =http://faql.de/numerus.html | accessdate =24 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Schäfer | first =Alexander | title ="Euro ist ein glücklich gewähler Name" – Interview with Norbert Fries| publisher=Berliner Zeitung | date =5 January 2002 | url =http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/linguistik/institut/syntax/docs/www_berlinonline_de_aktuelles_berliner_zeitung_berlin.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate =5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other marked case is the genitive singular, which is ''(des) Euros'' or, alternatively, ''des Euro.''

'''Pronunciation:''' The beginning of the word ''Euro'' is pronounced in German with the diphthong {{IPA-de|ɔʏ|}}, which sounds similar to the 'oi' in the English word "oil".&lt;ref name="Duden6"/&gt;

The spelling of the word ''Cent'' is not well adapted to German spelling conventions because these strive to avoid ambiguous letter-sound correspondences. Initial letter C is often used in [[loanword]]s and corresponds to various pronunciations depending on the language of origin (e.g. [s] in ''Centime'', {{IPA|[tʃ]}} in ''Cello'', {{IPA|[ts]}} in ''Celsius'' and [k] in ''Café''). Most of these words are therefore eventually spelt phonetically (e.g. ''Kaffee'', ''Tschechien'' ([[Czech Republic]]), ''Zentimeter'').

[[Latin]] words beginning with "ce" such as ''centum'' (hundred) traditionally represent {{IPA|[ts]}} in German, and German words derived from these have therefore long been spelt with a ''Z'', which represents {{IPA|[ts]}} (as in ''Zentrum'' (centre), ''Zentimeter'' (centimetre), etc.). Equivalently, some German speakers pronounce the beginning of the word "Cent" {{IPA|[ts]}}, but since they are familiar with the English pronunciation of the American unit ''cent'', most people pronounce it [s].

As these are nouns, both Euro and Cent are capitalised in German.

'''Slang terms:''' In Austria and Germany, the euro has also been called ''Teuro'', a play on the word ''teuer'', meaning 'expensive'. The [[Deutsche Mark]] was worth half as much as the euro (a ratio of approximately 2:1) and some grocers and restaurants were accused of taking advantage of the smaller numbers to increase their actual prices with the changeover.

In youth and Internet culture the fake plural ''Euronen'' is sometimes used; this form's origin is unknown but it bears resemblance to ''Dublonen'' ([[Dubloon]]s) and has a [[retro]] ring to it. Also, "Öre" is occasionally used, the name of the [[Öre|Swedish currency]]. Among some [[Punk subculture|punks]], the word "Oi", as in the punk rock subgenre of [[Oi!]], is used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Unlike the previous currencies (Mark and Schilling) which had well established nicknames for individual coins and notes, there are few widely used nicknames for Euros, but the two Euro coin is sometimes called ''Zwickel'' like the old two Mark piece and the 50 cent piece is sometimes ironically referred to as "a rapper" alluding to [[50 Cent]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In German [[Usenet]] culture, the name ''Fragezeichen'' (question mark) was occasionally used in reference to initial problems with display of the [[euro sign]], which was often rendered as a question mark. The term was most often written using the mock currency code FRZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FRZ als Synonym fuer EUR|url=http://de.etc.sprache.deutsch.narkive.com/TTXv2F4G/frz-als-synonym-fuer-eur|publisher=NARCHIVE: Newsgroup Archive|date=17 February 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012134239/http://de.etc.sprache.deutsch.narkive.com/TTXv2F4G/frz-als-synonym-fuer-eur|archivedate=12 October 2014|language=German|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technical trouble has diminished  and so has the usage of this term.

'''Abbreviations:''' EUR. TEUR for thousand Euros and MEUR for a million Euros are often used in financial documents. Numbers are given with a comma as decimal separator.

===Greek===

In the [[Greek language]] the indeclinable word {{lang|el|ευρώ}} ({{IPA-el|evˈro|}}) is used as the currency's name. It was decided to use [[omega]] (ω) rather than [[omicron]] (ο) as the last letter of the word, partly because a noun ending with omicron would encourage mutability, and partly to stress the origin of the euro in the Greek word {{lang|el|Ευρώπη}} (''Eurōpē'', Europe) which is also spelt with omega and it is actually written on the euro notes in Greek as {{lang|el|ΕΥΡΩ}}. Also, the spelling {{lang|el|ΕΥΡΟ}} (resulting in a plural {{lang|el|ΕΥΡΑ}}) on the notes could have confused other Europeans, who might read it as a string of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters: ''eypo''. A plural form ''evra'', as if from a regular declinable neuter noun in ''-o'', is sometimes used in a jocular way.

For the cent, the terms used in Greece are {{lang|el|λεπτό}}, plural {{lang|el|λεπτά}} (''[[Greek lepton|leptó]]'', plural ''leptá''), a name used for small denominations of various ancient and modern Greek currencies, including the [[greek drachma|drachma]] (which the euro replaced). The word means '[[minute]]' (literally "thin"), the same as the unit of measurement of time or of angle. The term {{lang|el|ευρωλεπτό}}, plural {{lang|el|ευρωλεπτά}} (''evroleptó'', plural ''evroleptá'') is sometimes used when a speaker wants to be completely specific that they are referring to money and not time.

Some colloquial names for currency are also in use for the euro. One and two euro coins are respectively called {{lang|el|φράγκο}} (''frago'') and {{lang|el|δίφραγκο}} (''difrago'') from the French ''franc''. A 5 euro banknote is also colloquially called {{lang|el|τάληρο}} (''taliro'') from the Germanic root ''thaler'' via the Italian ''talero''. A 10 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|δεκάρικο}} (''dekariko''), a 20 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|εικοσάρικο}} (''eikosariko'') or {{lang|el|εικοσάρι}} (''eikosari''), and a 50 euro banknote is called {{lang|el|πενηντάρικο}} (''penintariko''), derivatives of the words for ten, twenty and fifty.

10 lepta of a drachma were called {{lang|el|δεκάρα}} (''dekara''), but since lepta of the drachma were out of circulation long before the euro, this word is now considered too old-fashioned and only used in old expressions and thus it is not used for the 10 eurocent coin. Nevertheless, all Greeks understand the word to stand for 10 cents of any currency and thus use it for non-euro currencies like the dime of the US dollar. The same is true for the 5-cent coin which is not called {{lang|el|πεντάρα}} (''pentara'') like its drachma equivalent. These words come from the words for five and ten respectively.

In Cyprus, however, the cent is officially called ''cent'' ({{lang|el|σεντ}}) both in singular and plural. This is the name formerly used for {{frac|100}} of the [[Cypriot pound]] chosen for its neutrality to both official languages of the Republic ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Hungarian===

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] the currency is named ''euró'' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɛuroː|}}) and ''cent'' ({{IPA-hu|ˈt͡sɛnt|}}) without plural forms (as in Hungarian no plural is used after numerals), the former written with an accented ''ó'', as decided by the [[Magyar Tudományos Akadémia Nyelvtudományi Intézete|Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], since Hungarian words ending with either ''o'' or ''u'' have to be accented as ''ó'' and ''ú''. See these international words as examples: ''fotó, videó, sztereó''. The spelling is also in accordance with the word ''Európa'' ("Europe") in Hungarian.

Hungarian language does not use plural after numerals, as numerals already express plural; however, both ''euró'' and ''cent'' can take suffixes regarding to [[grammatical case]]s, just as:
* Accusative case: ''eurót''
* Dative case: ''eurónak''
* Instrumental case: ''euróval'' ("with euro")
* Causative case: ''euróért'' ("for euro")
* etc.

On introduction of the euro, Hungary—along with Lithuania, Latvia, and Slovenia—struggled for the euro to be written in its official documents according to its own usage and spelling, in contrast with Community law, which provides for a single name throughout the Union (in the nominative singular and taking account of different alphabets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Opinion of the European Central Bank of 16 December 2005 at the request of the Slovenian Ministry of Economic Affairs on the provisions of the draft Companies Act concerning redenomination resulting from the introduction of the euro (CON/2005/57)|url = http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2005_57_f_sign.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate = 5 April 2009| author=European Central Bank | authorlink = European Central Bank | date = 16 December 2005| work=| publisher=European Communities|quote= [. . .] Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro2 stipulates that ‘… the currency of the participating Member States shall be the euro’3.

Taken together, these two provisions make it clear that the name of the single currency is the ‘euro’ and that this name should be identical in all legal acts published in Community languages. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2005_57_f_sign.pdf| title= Opinion of the European Central Bank of 6 December 2006 at the request of the Hungarian Ministry of Finance on a draft law amending Law LVIII of 2001 on Magyar Nemzeti Bank and Law XI of 1987 on legislation (CON/2006/55) |format=PDF|accessdate = 5 April 2009| author=European Central Bank | authorlink = European Central Bank | date = 6 December 2006| work=| publisher=European Communities|quote= [. . .] To make the euro’s singleness apparent, Community law6 requires a single spelling of the word ‘euro’ in the nominative singular case in all Community and national legislative provisions. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]], signed in 2009, contains the following declaration from Hungary, Latvia and Malta:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/full_text/index_en.htm |title=EUROPA – Treaty of Lisbon – Full text of the Treaty |publisher=Europa.eu |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515003055/http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/full_text/index_en.htm |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
58. Declaration by the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Malta on the spelling of the name of the single currency in the Treaties&lt;br/&gt;
Without prejudice to the unified spelling of the name of the single currency of the European Union referred to in the Treaties as displayed on the banknotes and on the coins, Latvia, Hungary and Malta declare that the spelling of the name of the single currency, including its derivatives as applied throughout the Latvian, Hungarian and Maltese text of the Treaties, has no effect on the existing rules of the Latvian, Hungarian or Maltese languages.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Irish===

In [[Irish language|Irish]], the words ''euro'' and ''cent'' are used without change in [[spelling]] or [[pronunciation]], and immune to the regular rules of Irish [[initial consonant mutation|mutation]] after numbers; as such, they are [[gender (linguistics)|ungendered]], and the plural ''euronna'' is thus rarely encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.transparent.com/irish/ag-caint-faoin-euro-speaking-of-the-euro/|title=Ag Caint faoin Euro (Speaking of the Euro)|publisher=[[Transparent Language]]|website=Irish Language Blog|date=30 November 2010|access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''ceint'' ({{IPA-ga|ˈsˠɛnʲtʲ|}}, plural ''ceinteanna'' {{IPA-ga|ˈsˠɛnʲ.tʲə.n̪ˠə|}}) has been in the lexicon since at least 1959 and is attested in printed literature, but is very rarely encountered.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ie/books?id=FDUfDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=eorónna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-pPj2yufbAhXBmLQKHdgvBboQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ie/books?id=gHw9M_817nwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=eorónna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-pPj2yufbAhXBmLQKHdgvBboQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=eoronna&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculine noun ''eoró'' {{IPA-ga|ˈɔɾˠoː|}} (plural ''eorónna'' {{IPA-ga|ˈɔɾˠoːn̪ˠa|}}) has been coined from the word ''Eoraip'' ('Europe').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beo.ie/alt-tuilleadh-teannaidh-oraibh-a-deir-siad-leis-an-sao.aspx|title=‘Tuilleadh teannaidh oraibh’, a deir siad leis an Saor-Stát!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Michael Everson]] has suggested ''eora'' (plural ''eoraí'') as a more grammatically acceptable Irish term, and wrote "The [[European Council]] has no right to prescribe, or even to endorse, the [[orthography|orthographical]] or grammatical forms of ''any'' word in any language, whether official or not. This right belongs to the people of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evertype.com/standards/euro/euro-eora-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagehat.com/the-future-of-eu-english/|title=languagehat.com :   The Future of EU English.|website=languagehat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish also practices [[lenition]] after the numerals 2–6 (5 ''cheint'') and [[eclipsis]] after numerals 7–10 (9 ''gceint'', 8 ''n-eoró'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evertype.com/standards/euro/euronames.html|title=Evertype: The name of the euro|website=evertype.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as ''ceint'' is irregularly pronounced (no other Irish word has a [[soft c|soft ''c'']]), lenition and eclipsis are usually not applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=-2RsBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT245&amp;dq=ceinteanna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6triBy-fbAhUBbFAKHbLTA4AQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ceinteanna&amp;f=false|title=Colloquial Irish (eBook And MP3 Pack): The Complete Course for Beginners|first1=Thomas|last1=Ihde|first2=Maire Ni|last2=Neachtain|first3=Roslyn|last3=Blyn-LaDrew|first4=John|last4=Gillen|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian===

In [[Italian language|Italian]] the word ''euro'' is used, as both singular and plural. Its standard pronunciation is {{IPA-it|ˈɛuro|}}, although native northern Italians use {{IPA-it|ˈeuro|}} instead. The plural form ''euri'' is uncommon, but not incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Zanichelli dictionaries, [http://dizionaripiu.zanichelli.it/la-posta-del-professore/2004/04/07/euro-o-euri/ Euro o euri?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether the correct plural form would be ''euri'' or ''euro'' remained open for a long time, predating the actual introduction of the currency. The [[Accademia della Crusca]] assigned to Severina Parodi, lexicographer, and to [[Luca Serianni]], language historian, the task to give a response. They deliberated in favour of ''euri'' in 1999 with the motivation that "euro is a masculine noun". But the issue was then re-examined many times.
Finally, in 2001 the consensus of the Accademia coalesced in favour of invariability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.accademiadellacrusca.it/forum_8/interventi/3231.shtml Gli euro e le lingue], issue 23 (October 2001) of ''La Crusca per voi'' {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale was based on the fact that abbreviated words originating from a longer word (for example ''auto'' from ''automobile'' (car) or ''moto'' from ''motocicletta'' (motorbike)) do not have a plural form, as well as the fact that the word ''euro'' is considered an abbreviation of the word ''Eurovaluta'' (European currency) . In 2002 an amendment to the [[financial act]] was proposed to adopt ''euri'' as the plural form for public official deeds, but was quickly rejected by the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer?tipo=BGT&amp;id=48687 Amendment 62.5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010051627/http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer?tipo=BGT&amp;id=48687 |date=10 October 2007 }}, 306th session of the ''Senate of the Italian Republic'', 18 December 2002, {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''cent'' (pronounced {{IPA-it|tʃɛnt|}}) is in practical use always replaced by the word ''[[centesimo]]'' ({{IPA-it|tʃenˈtɛːzimo|}}), which simply means "hundredth" (also see ''[[centime]]'' in French); its plural form is ''centesimi''. ''Cent'' only appears on documents such as electricity and telephone bills; it is perceived by native speakers as an abbreviation of "centesimo" (and in fact often followed by a period) rather than as an autonomous proper name.

===Latvian===

[[File:Advertising on a Riga tram using the word ‘eiro’ for the euro.jpg|thumb|Advertising on a tram using the word 'eiro' for the euro]]
In [[Latvian language|Latvian]] the commonly used term is '''''eiro''''' (which somewhat resembles the West European ''euro'', but has also taken its sound from ''Eiropa'', the Latvian word for ''Europe'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4578806.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Latvia grapples with EU over euro |publisher=BBC News |date=3 January 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in 2004 it was proposed by Terminology Commission of the [[Latvian Academy of Sciences]] that standardized usage should be '''''eira''''' as ''eiro'' is [[Latvian declension|undeclinable in Latvian]]. The commission argued that a potentially frequently used term needs to fit especially well in the structure of [[Latvian grammar]]. They suggested that ''eiro'' is especially inconvenient to use in [[dative]] and [[locative]], which would necessitate addition of ''valūta'' ("currency") for clarification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=236&amp;id=792 |title=Valsts valoda - 2004 (9) |publisher=Vvk.lv |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this decision resulted in public outcry, which resulted in the commission amending its original ruling to state that usage of ''euro'' is inappropriate for Latvian, and that ''eiro'' is acceptable as a parallel form, but its use should be limited and it should be dropped over time. The reasoning was explained, that while they still insist on the use of ''eira'', they acknowledge that a half of users of the language are not content with such a form. They explained that the use of ''euro'' (and ''cent'' without [[nominative]] ending) is ill-suited to the language because an ''eu'' diphthong does not exist in Latvian, and orthographic rules discourage spellings that don't reflect pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ilze Sedliņa |author2=Zaida Kalniņa |author3=«Latvijas Vēstnesis» |url=http://www.apollo.lv/zinas/eira-eiro-vai-euro/292783 |title=Eira, eiro vai euro? &amp;#124; Apollo |publisher=Apollo.lv |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the ''eiro'' spelling is closer to ''Eiropa'', the Latvian word for ''Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://termini.lza.lv/article.php?id=113 |title=LZA Terminoloģijas komisija |publisher=Termini.lza.lv |date=19 October 2004 |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leonese===

In [[Leonese language|Leonese]], a language spoken in the Spanish provinces of [[Province of León|León]] and [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]], the word for "euro" is "euru", the plural being "euros".{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Lithuanian===

In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] the euro and cent are called ''euras'' ({{IPA-lt|ˈɛʊrɐs|}}) and ''centas'' ({{IPA-lt|ˈtsʲɛntɐs|}}) (in common language usually ''eurocentas'', to distinguish from the cents of the former Lithuanian currency, ''litas''), while plural forms are ''eurai'' and ''centai'' (''eurocentai''). The Lithuanian language routinely adapts foreign words by re-spelling them according to Lithuanian phonetic rules and adding standardised endings, resulting in words like ''[[computer|kompiuteris]]'' or ''[[Tony Blair|Tonis Bleiras]]''.

===Luxembourgish===

In Luxembourgish the Euro is officially called ''Euro'' (pronounced ''oi-ro''), both in singular and plural forms, although the correct plural according to linguistic rules would normally be  ''Euroën'' (pronounced ''oi-ro-en'').

The Cent is called ''Cent'' (pronounced ''tsennt''), plural ''Cents''.
In popular parlance the term ''Zantimm'' (pronounced ''tsunn-tim'') is also used, a word derived from the French ''Centime''.

===Maltese===

In [[Maltese language|Maltese]], the spelling is ''ewro'', as announced in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maltamedia.com/news/2005/eu/article_8364.shtml "Maltese to call the European currency-‘ewro’"], MaltaMedia News,
14 Dec 2005,&lt;/ref&gt; The currency name ''ewro'' is spelt with ''w'' (not with a ''u'') as derived from the Maltese word ''Ewropa'' (Europe), also written with ''w''. Furthermore, the vowels ''e'' and ''u'' are not written next to each other in Maltese, except when they are pronounced as two syllables, which is not the case here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunsilltalmalti.gov.mt/filebank/documents/reportonthenamesoftheeuropeancurrency.pdf |title=¥doc engl |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plural of the word remains unchanged, as the singular. The cent is known as ''ċenteżmu'', plural ''ċenteżmi'', both abbreviated to ''ċ''.

In Maltese, 'ewro' is written with a small letter ''e'' and is masculine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maltabankers.org/file.aspx?f=174&lt;/ref&gt; singular – as in "L-ewro huwa..." (The euro is...) and "Il-munita tal-ewro hija" (The euro coin is...).

===Mirandese===

[[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] (a regional language spoken in the northeastern Portuguese region of [[Miranda do Douro]]) uses the prefix ''ou'' already present in words like ''European'' (''Ouropeu''). The singular form is ''ouro'' ({{IPA|/ˈow.ɾu/}}) and the plural form is ''ouros'' ({{IPA|/ˈow.ɾuʃ/}}). ''Ouro'' is also the Mirandese word for 'gold', as in Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://terrademiranda.pt/dic/O.pdf |title=Mirandese-Portuguese Dictionary – Amadeu Ferreira and José Pedro Cardona Ferreira |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004170140/http://terrademiranda.pt/dic/O.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish===

In [[Polish language|Polish]], ''euro'' is both singular and plural, and pronounced {{IPA-pl|ˈɛwrɔ|}}. This noun belongs to a small group of nouns of foreign origin in Polish that, as an exception, remain non-declinable in any of the seven cases (other examples being ''zoo'', ''Waterloo'' and few others). It is however likely for the word ''euro'' to follow the pattern of other foreign words like ''kino'', ''studio'' and ''radio'' and eventually become fully declinable in a similar manner as a result of a full linguistic absorption of the word into Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://poradnia.pwn.pl/lista.php?id=2278 | title=Odmiana ''euro'' (Declination of ''Euro'') | publisher=PWN | accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cent'' is declinable, being ''eurocent'' or simply ''cent'' ({{IPA|[ɛurotsɛnt]}}) in singular nominative and ''eurocenty'' or ''centy'' ({{IPA|[ɛuroˈtsɛntɨ]}}) in plural nominative or ''eurocentów'' or ''centów'' ({{IPA|[ɛuroˈtsɛntuf]}}) in plural genitive.

===Portuguese===

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''euro'' has a Portuguese word-ending and thus is used in the singular, with ''euros'' the plural form. ''Cent'', which does not conform to Portuguese word-forming rules, is commonly converted to ''cêntimo'' (singular) and ''cêntimos'' (plural).

The term ''cêntimo'' might have been adopted to distinguish it from the fractional value of the ''[[Portuguese escudo]]'', which was called ''centavo''.

Pronunciation of ''euro'' in Portuguese is still not standardized: either {{IPA-pt|ˈewɾɔ|}} or {{IPA-pt|ˈewɾu|}}. The latter has the regular final unstressed -''o'' pronunciation, as {{IPA-pt|u|}}, and is more widespread in the north of the country, while the former is more common in the south. ''Euro'', ''cêntimo'' and ''centavo'' are masculine nouns in Portuguese, and as such, "the cents" are translated as ''os cêntimos'' and "those euros" as ''aqueles euros''.

In Brazil the pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|ˈewɾu|}} (generally {{IPA|[ˈeu̯ɾu]}} in Rio de Janeiro and further north, as in Portugal, and {{IPA|[ˈeʊ̯ɾʊ]}} in São Paulo and further south and west as well as the places [[Portuguese language#Brazil|where southern Brazilians settled]]) and fractional values are called ''centavos de euro''&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2010/07/euros-cunhados-pelo-vaticano-entram-em-circulacao.html "Euros cunhados pelo Vaticano entram em circulação na Europa"]. ''[[O Globo]]''. Retrieved 12 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; (cents of euro) to differentiate them from [[Brazilian real]] "centavos".

===Romanian===

In [[Romanian language|Romanian]] the euro and cent are called ''euro'' and ''cent'' {{IPA-ro|t͡ʃent|}} (plural ''{{lang|ro|cenți}}'' {{IPA-ro|t͡ʃent͡sʲ|}}). The official plural of ''euro'' is also ''euro'', and this official form was readily adopted by speakers. The "eu" construct is not a diphthong, thus the pronunciation is {{IPA-ro|ˈe.uro|}}.

When speaking in a familiar–vernacular setting, some speakers would make the informal plural "euroi" (not seen as academic, and not used officially; its stylistic value–connotation is less than "bucks" for US dollars or "quid" for GBP in English and ''much lower'' than the almost everyday use of "piasse" (piastre, with the cent called "sou") for CAD in Canadian French). The USD also has a nickname (the word "para"/"parai" of Turkish origin) with the same negative stylistic value. Not to be confused with general nicknames for money in general or unclear nicknames for foreign currencies (e.g."coco" – the specific currency is supposed to be inferred by the listener from previous info/conversation or from the country the speakers are in).

===Scottish Gaelic===

Due to the lack of a governing body, there is no consistent usage regarding the terms for euro and cent in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The various approaches include:

* use of English spellings (including the English plural form and pronunciation), treating the nouns as [[Uninflected word|indeclinable]]: ''an euro'' (genitive ''an euro''; plural ''na euro(s)''), ''an cent'' (genitive ''an cent'', plural ''na cent(s)'')

===Slovak===

In [[Slovak language|Slovak]] the euro and cent are called ''euro'' and ''cent'', the plural forms for amounts between 2 and 4 are ''2 eurá/centy'', and the plural forms for larger amounts are ''5 eur/centov''. ''Euro'' is spelt with a ''u'' because it is derived from the word ''Európa'' (Europe). The c in cent represents {{IPA|/ts/}}.

'''Slang terms:''' common nicknames for euro in Slovak includes: ''euráče'', ''evri'', ''juráše'', ''éčka'' (literally "e"-s or "letters ‘e’"). Cents are sometimes jokingly called ''šestáky'' (as a common term for coins with small value); ''meďáky'' or ''medenáky'' (literally "coppers" or "the copper ones") or ''haliere'' which is a reference to the small coins of the original Slovak currency.

===Slovene===

In [[Slovene language|Slovene]] the euro and cent are called ''evro'' and ''cent'' ({{IPA-sl|ˈeːwrɔ|}}, {{IPA-sl|tsɛnt|}}), the dual form is ''2 evra/centa'' ({{IPA-sl|ˈeːwra|}}, {{IPA-sl|ˈtseːnta|}} or {{IPA-sl|ˈtsɛːn-|}}) and the plural forms are ''3/4 evri/centi'' ({{IPA-sl|ˈeːwri|}}, {{IPA-sl|ˈtseːnti|}} or {{IPA-sl|ˈtsɛːn-|}}), ''5+ evrov/centov'' ({{IPA-sl|ˈeːwrɔw|}}, {{IPA-sl|ˈtseːntɔw|}} or {{IPA-sl|ˈtsɛːn-|}}), the same declension case being used for all higher numerals up to 100, then beginning again (''101 evro/cent'', ''102 evra/centa'', ''103 evri/centi'', ''104 evri/centi'', ''105 evrov/centov'' etc.). ''Evro'' is spelt with ''v'' according to standard [[Slovene orthography]], and matches the word ''Evropa'' (Europe).

In laws and regulations, though, the word ‘evro’ is replaced with the word ‘euro’ in all grammatical cases in accordance with an agreement between Slovenia and the [[European Union]]. In normative [[Slovene language]] usage ‘evro’ spelling should only be used, except as noted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2006_29_f_sign.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish===

In the Spanish language, the official plural is the same as its regular plural ''euros''. For the cent, the word ''[[céntimo]]'' (plural ''céntimos'') can be used. The fraction of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] was also called ''céntimo'', but no céntimo coins had been issued since 1980, and had since been demonetised. The word "euro" is pronounced {{IPA-es|ˈeuɾo|}} in Spanish, and "céntimo" {{IPA-es|ˈθentimo|}} or {{IPA-es|ˈsentimo|}}.

'''Slang terms''': the euro is often referred to as ''pavo'', meaning ''turkey'' in English (the usual translation for ''buck'' in dubbed films).

===Swedish===

In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] writing, euro is spelt ''euro'' (and cent is spelt ''cent'') both in singular and plural, or written EUR, or €. The € sign is common in Finland but rare in Sweden. The currency "the euro" is spelt ''euron'' following Swedish grammar rules.

In Sweden, the accepted pronunciations are {{IPA-sv|ˈɛv(ː)rʊ|}} (more common and similar to how ''eu'' is pronounced in modern Swedish in ''neuro-'') or {{IPA-sv|ˈɛɵrʊ|}} (similar to how ''eu'' is pronounced in modern Swedish in ''Europa'').&lt;ref name="Sprakradet"&gt;[http://www.spraknamnden.se/fragor/arkiv_sprakrad_02.htm#euro Swedish Language Council: "Veckans språkråd: Euro"] Linked 2012-04-29&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Swedes choose to pronounce it in a more English way {{IPA-sv|ˈjuːrʊ|}} (no ''s'' in plural). This pronunciation is rejected by official authorities, such as the [[Swedish Language Council]],&lt;ref name="Sprakradet"/&gt; and not used in television news. In Sweden there are no widespread slang terms since the euro is a foreign currency.

In Finland, the euro is the official currency, and Swedish is an official language alongside [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. The same spelling as in Sweden is used (officially [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish in Finland]] is spelt as in Sweden). The pronunciation, however, is {{IPA-all|ˈɛuɾo|}}, which has some similarities to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] pronunciation. The abbreviation is like 3,14 €, same as for Finnish. Among Swedish-speaking as well as Finnish-speaking people in [[Helsinki]], a common slang term is "ege".

===Welsh===

In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], euro and cent are called ''ewro'' {{IPA-cy|ˈɛurɔ|}} (masculine) and ''sent'' {{IPA-cy|sɛnt|}} (feminine). The plural forms are respectively ''ewros'' {{IPA-cy|ˈɛurɔs, ˈɛurɔz|}} and ''sentiau'' {{IPA-cy|ˈsɛntjaɨ, ˈsɛntjai|}}, although in the Welsh language, numerals are always followed by the singular form of nouns, thus: ''pum ewro'' (€5), ''deg sent'' (€0.10). Informally, the more Anglicised {{IPA-cy|ˈɪuro|}} may be used, written either the Welsh way, ''iwro'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/wales.cymraeg/MxybMcdO8OY|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletfever.org/forum/gwaharddiad-byrnenewyddion-eto_topic22994.html|title=Gwaharddiad Byrne..Newyddion eto ?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as in English, ''euro.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ygbmalmaen.blogspot.com/2012/06/this-is-jodi-my-blog-is-not-working.html|title=Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg yn yr Almaen|first=|last=HarrietElias|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these it should be noted the native word ''euro'' {{IPA-cy|ˈɛɨrɔ, ˈɛirɔ|}} ("to gild") already exists. Note too that in Welsh the abbreviation ''c'' stands for ''ceiniog'' (penny).

==Other languages==

===Albanian===

In [[Albanian language|Albanian]], the euro is referred to as "euro". This is the same for Albanian in Kosovo, Macedonia and rest of the Balkans. Some Kosovo Albanian speakers however, pronounce euro like Germans; 'oiro'/'oi', due to heavily migration. It is derived from the Albanian word for Europe, "Europa", "Europë" and also "Evropa"/"Evropë". All variants are official in Albanian, however Albania uses Euro, Europa or Europe whilst other Albanian dialects such as in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia often use Evrope or Evropa. However the currency euro is not ever pronounced as evro like their Slavic neighbours.

Note: depending on dialect, location, diaspora and ethnicity some [[Albanians]] vary their pronunciations based on standard Albanian, Italian, Greek, German or Slavic (such as those in Macedonia or Serbia).

===Arabic===

In Arabic, the euro is usually referred to as {{lang|ar|يورو}} {{IPA-ar|ˈjuːro, ˈjuːru|}}, which is an adaptation of the English pronunciation of the currency's name. Another naming is {{lang|ar|اورو}} {{IPA-ar|ˈʔoːro|}}, which is an approximation of the French pronunciation {{IPA-fr|øˈʁo|}}. In most cases this term is used both for the singular and the plural form, although the plurals {{lang|ar|يوروات}} {{IPA|/juːroˈwaːt/}} and {{lang|ar|يوروهات}} {{IPA|/juːroˈhaːt/}} are sometimes encountered. The name for Europe in Arabic is {{lang|ar|أوروبا}} {{IPA|/ʔo(ː)ˈrobba, -ˈroppa/}}. Because [[loanword]]s are not of [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] origin, they are pronounced in accordance with the spoken [[varieties of Arabic]] phonology. For example, {{lang|ar|أوروبا}} is pronounced {{IPA-arz|ʔoˈɾobbɑ, -ˈɾoppɑ|}} by [[Egyptian Arabic]] speakers, while {{IPA|[ʔoːˈrobba, -ˈroppa]}} by [[Levantine Arabic]] speakers.

Attempts to artificially arabize the pronunciation according to the [[Arabic phonology|standardized Arabic phonology]] would be more conforming to [[Arabic transliteration]]s such as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūrū / ʾŪrū, ʾŪrubbā}}'' which would be theoretically pronounced {{IPA|/ˈjuːruː, ˈʔuːruː, ʔuːˈrubbaː/}} for {{lang|ar|يورو,&amp;lrm; اورو,&amp;lrm; أوروبا}}, respectively.
See also [[List of diglossic regions#Arabic|Arabic diglossia]] to understand why the pronunciation differs from region to region.

===Armenian===

The [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word for euro is {{lang|hy|Եվրո}}, pronounced {{IPA-hy|jɛvˈɹɔ|}} in exactly the same way as the Greek, with an added initial ''y'' sound. It is derived from the Armenian word for Europe, {{lang|hy|Եվրոպա}}, which is pronounced {{IPA-hy|jɛvɹɔˈpa|}}, as stress in Armenian usually falls on the final syllable. Cent in Armenian is pronounced {{IPA-hy|ˈt͡sʰɛnt|}} ({{lang|hy|ցենտ}}).

The plural of euro, in accordance with the formation of plurals in Armenian, is {{lang|hy|Եվրոներ}} {{IPA-hy|ɛvɹɔˈnɛɹ|}}. The plural of cent, however, is {{lang|hy|ցենտի}}, pronounced {{IPA-hy|t͡sʰɛnˈti|}}.

===Azerbaijani===

The [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] name for Europe is ''Avropa'', similar to that of its sister language, Turkish, and the Azerbaijani word for euro, derived from that for Europe, is ''avro'', identical to Turkish.

===Chinese===

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the euro is known as 欧元 ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]]), 歐元 ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]]), ''ōuyuán'' ([[pinyin]]), from the Chinese word for Europe, 欧洲 / 歐洲, ''Ōuzhōu'', and the word 元 ''yuán'', meaning coin. This follows the same pattern as the word for the American dollar 美元, ''měiyuán''. For cents, the word 欧分 / 歐分 ''ōufén'', is used. However, in [[Hong Kong]] it is often referred to as 歐羅 ({{zh|j=au¹lo⁴}}) to distinguish it from the [[Australian dollar]] (澳元, {{zh|j=ou³jyun⁴}}), because in Cantonese 歐元 and 澳元 have similar pronunciations.

As the character 元 in 欧元, is a [[Classifier (linguistics)|counter word]] in Chinese, there is no need to put a measure word before the word. An example is: 五十欧元 ([[Chinese numerals|financial Chinese]]: 伍拾欧元) ''wǔshí ōuyuán'' for fifty euros.

===Esperanto===

In [[Esperanto]], the currency is called '''"eŭro"''',&lt;ref&gt;[[:eo:Eŭro]]&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the Esperanto word for the continent "Eŭropo." The ''o'' ending in euro conveniently accords with the standard ''-o'' noun ending in Esperanto, but rather than sound out ''e'' and ''u'' separately, Esperanto speakers use the [[diphthong]] ''eŭ'', which matches its etymology. Plurals are formed in accordance with Esperanto rules, '''''eŭroj''''' and '''''cendoj'''''. The words are also declined as any Esperanto noun (eŭro/eŭroj in the [[nominative]], eŭron/eŭrojn in the [[accusative]]).

A cent is '''''cendo''''', as is commonly used for subunits of all centimalized currency (cents, centimes, etc.). The alternatives are ''centimo'' from the French ''centime'' or a more technical ''centono'', literally, "one-hundredth part". (Esperanto speakers are unlikely to call a cent ''cento,'' since ''cento'' means a group of 100, rather than a hundredth.)

===Georgian===

In [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the euro is called {{lang|ka|ევრო}} (''evro'', pronounced {{IPA-ka|ˈɛvrɔ|}}), derived from the Georgian word for Europe, {{lang|ka|ევროპა}} {{IPA-ka|ˈɛvrɔpʼɑ|}}. Unlike in Greek and Armenian, the stress of the word ''evro'' falls on the first syllable, as is usual in Georgian. Cent is {{lang|ka|ცენტი}} {{IPA-ka|ˈtsʰɛntʼi|}}, as nativized Georgian words cannot end in a consonant, so an extra vowel 'i' is added. The respective plurals of euro and cent are {{lang|ka|ევროები}} {{IPA-ka|ˈɛvrɔɛbi|}} and {{lang|ka|ცენტები}} {{IPA-ka|ˈtsʰɛntʼɛbi|}}.

===Hebrew===

When euro coins and banknotes were introduced, the question of the spelling and pronunciation of the currency's name in Hebrew arose. The official name of the currency established by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and the [[Bank of Israel]] is {{nowrap|{{lang|he|אֵירוֹ}} {{IPA-he|ˈeʁo|}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrew-academy.org.il/2010/03/24/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95-%D7%90%D7%95-%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95/|title=אירו או יורו? - האקדמיה ללשון העברית|website=hebrew-academy.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} derived from {{nowrap|{{lang|he|אֵירוֹפָּה}} {{IPA-he|eˈʁopa|}} (Europe).}}

An unofficial spelling and pronunciation {{lang|he|יוּרוֹ}} {{IPA-he|ˈjuʁo|}}, derived from the English pronunciation of the currency's name, is also used.

Although in Hebrew currency names are usually declined for singular and plural, both forms of the Euro name are used for the singular and plural alike.

===Hindi===

In [[Hindi]], the euro is spelt as यूरो (Yūro), while cent is written as सेंट (seṇṭ). Both the words are not pluralised. Europe is known as यूरोप (Yūrop) in Hindi.

===Icelandic===

In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] the euro is called ''[[wikt:en:evra#Icelandic|evra]]'', a feminine noun derived from the Icelandic name of Europe, ''[[wikt:Evrópa#Icelandic|Evrópa]]''; this makes Icelandic (with Faroese&lt;!--Just wrong(?), see Maltese: "and Maltese"--&gt;) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: ''[[wikt:en:evrur#Icelandic|evrur]]''. The cents are often called '''sent''' which is a neuter word and has the same form in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural. However, a more common usage is to write, say, 20 cents as ''0,20 evrur''.

===Ido===
In [[Ido (language)|Ido]], there's a rule saying that "every word pertaining to a national or local custom will get imported to the language without change or adaption, both the singular and the plural forms alike" (known as ''vorti stranjera'' – foreign words). This gets especially applied to "currencies, weights and measurements that doesn't belong to the [[metric system]]" (according to KGD, Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza – Ido's grammar book). Thus the best word for "euro" would be just ''euro'', like ''dollar'' and ''pound'', with the plural probably kept the same: ''euro'', since most languages does that.

In common speech, though, many Idists commonly refer to the currency as ''euro'' and ''euri'' as if it got fully adopted to the language because of the common use of the currency.

Similarly, "cent" is ''cent'', with the plural imported from its source, English: ''cents''.

For both words, there are two other possibilities for pluralization. The native plural ''-i'' could be added to the ''vorto stranjera'' with the dash to mark that it's a foreign word: ''cent-i'' and ''euro-i'', or to add the plural definite article ''le'': ''le cent'' and ''le euro'', though that generally means "the cents" and "the euros".

===Japanese===

In Japanese the euro is called "yūro" (ユーロ) based on the English pronunciation, using the [[katakana]] syllabary employed for foreign words. However, the word for Europe in Japanese is "yōroppa" (ヨーロッパ), probably borrowed from the [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin|Portuguese]] ''Europa'' ({{IPA|ˈew.ɾɔpɐ}}) or from the [[Japanese words of Dutch origin|Dutch]] "Europa", not English. The cent uses the same word employed for all currencies using cents. This is rendered "sento" (or セント in the katakana script) and it is also based on the English pronunciation. In Japanese, like other East Asian languages, no plurals are used for units so both "yūro" and "sento" are used as the singular and plural.

===Korean===

In [[Korean language|Korean]] [[North–South differences in the Korean language|of South Korea]], the Euro is called "[[Revised Romanization of Korean|yuro]]" (유로) and Cent is called "[[Revised Romanization of Korean|senteu]]" (센트). The word for Europe in Korean is "[[Revised Romanization of Korean|Yureop]]" (유럽). They are all based on the English pronunciation.

===Latin===

[[Contemporary Latin|Living Latin]] enthusiasts use ''euro'' (indeclinable) or ''euro'', -''onis'' (pl. ''eurones''); sometimes also ''eurum'', ''-i'' (pl. ''eura''), ''euronummus'', ''-i'' (pl. ''euronummi'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/ColloquiaJuliana.pdf ''Colloquia Iuliana''] – Opus Fundatum Niccolò Canussio&lt;/ref&gt; or even ''euronus'', ''-i'' (pl. ''euroni'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanradio.org/tedesco/tedarchi/2007/NuntiiLatini/nuntii_latini2007.htm|title=Statio Radiphonica Vaticana – Nuntii latini|accessdate=25 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713160519/http://www.vaticanradio.org/tedesco/tedarchi/2007/NuntiiLatini/nuntii_latini2007.htm|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manx ===
The [[Manx language|Manx]] word for "euro" is either ''oarey'' (plural: ''oaraghyn''), based on ''Yn Oarpey'' ("Europe"), or ''euro'', from English. ''Cent'' is either ''kent'' (plural: ''kentyn'') or ''sent''.

===Norwegian===

In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] there could be a problem concerning the spelling, since euro is [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] and would normally take a plural '''-er''' ending in [[Bokmål]] and '''-ar''' in [[Nynorsk]]. But since words for foreign currencies (like ''dollar'' and ''yen'') normally do not have the endings '''-er''' or '''-ar''' in Norwegian the [[Norwegian Language Council]] reached a decision in 1996 that the proper declension of the word '''euro''' should be

in Bokmål:

:''en euro – euroen – euro – euroene''

in Nynorsk:

:''ein euro – euroen – euro – euroane''

The declensions are respectively: The two first in [[Grammatical number|Singular]], and the two last in [[Plural]], while the first of each category are [[Article (grammar)|indefinite]], the last of each category are [[Article (grammar)|definite]] nouns. The word '''cent''' is an old loan word in Norwegian – and it is declined the same way:

in Bokmål:

:''en cent – centen – cent – centene''

in Nynorsk:

:''ein cent – centen – cent – centane''

The pronunciation of the two words in Norwegian are {{IPA-sv|ˈæʉɾu|}} and {{IPA|[ˈsɛnt]}}.

===Romansh===

In [[Romansh language|Romansh]], the words are ''euro''&lt;ref name=EuroRomansh&gt;{{cite web |author=Gion-Andri Cantieni |url=http://www.pledarigrond.ch/simpel.php?pled=Euro&amp;lingua=2&amp;metoda=exact&amp;pagina=0 |title=Pledari Grond online |publisher=Pledarigrond.ch |date= |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001631/http://www.pledarigrond.ch/simpel.php?pled=Euro&amp;lingua=2&amp;metoda=exact&amp;pagina=0 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''cent'';&lt;ref name=EuroRomansh/&gt; these are regular masculine nouns forming their plurals with -s, as ''euros'' and ''cents'', respectively.

===Russian===

Russia currently borders four eurozone members, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. They supply much of the euro inflow in Russia in trade exchange and tourism. In Russian, just like in the [[Bulgarian language]], euro is spelt евро ("jevro", pronounced {{IPA-ru|ˈjevrə|}}) both in the singular and the plural, while ''cent'' is цент {{IPA-ru|tsɛnt|}} (sg.) and центы {{IPA-ru|ˈtsɛntɨ|}} (pl.), though there are many colloquial semi-ironic forms such as евры 'jevry' or еврики 'jevriki' (there's no plural form for ''euro'' in Russian), [[Ruble|копейки]] for cents and others. Just as in Italian, although евро could have been declined as a regular neuter noun, it was made indeclinable like many neutral loanwords ending in a vowel: бюро {{IPA-ru|bʲʊˈro|}} ''bureau, office, writing-desk'', пальто {{IPA-ru|pɐlʲˈto|}} ''overcoat'', кофе {{IPA-ru|ˈkofʲɪ|}} ''coffee'', бордо {{IPA-ru|bɐrˈdo|}} ''Bordeaux wine, claret'' etc.; the same form is used in the singular and the plural. Cents are sometimes transliterated as цент 'tsent' – singular, центы 'tsenty' – plural. Numerative form is цент for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 – e.g. 51 цент but 11 центов), центa, the genitive singular, for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 – e.g. 54 центa but 12 центoв) and центoв, genitive plural, for the rest – 88 центoв. Sometimes eвроцент (also romanized as 'jevrocent' or 'evrotsent') is used to distinguish euro-cents from the American cents. (If евро had been treated as a regular neuter noun instead of being indeclinable, it would have the forms *евра (regular plural or genitive singular) and *евр (genitive plural), but this treatment would have been unusual for a loanword.)

===Serbian===

In [[Serbian language|Serbian]] the euro and cent are called ''evro'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: евро) {{IPA-sh|eʋro|}} and ''cent'' (Cyrillic: цент) {{IPA-sh|tsent|}}. ''Evro'' is spelt with a ''v'' because it is derived from the name Европа/''Evropa'' (Europe).

Both ''evro'' and ''cent'' are masculine nouns. They are inflected according to regular rules of the language:

* When not accompanied by a number, plural quantities are in whatever grammatical case is appropriate to the context: the nominative plurals are ''evri'' (Cyrillic: еври) and ''centi'' (Cyrillic: центи).
* When accompanied by a number ending with the digit 1 (except the combination 11) the singular form is used: ''21 evro'' (Cyrillic: 21 евро), ''101 cent'' (Cyrillic: 101 цент).
* When accompanied by a "small number", i.e. one ending with the digit 2, 3 or 4 (except the combinations 12, 13, 14), the paucal form is used: ''22 evra'' (Cyrillic: 22 евра), ''102 centa'' (Cyrillic: 102 цента).
* When accompanied by a "large number", i.e. one ending with a digit outside the 1–4 range (or one ending with any of the combination 11, 12, 13, 14) the genitive plural is used: ''111 evra'' (Cyrillic: 111 евра), ''25 centi'' (Cyrillic: 25 центи) or rarely ''25 centa'' (Cyrillic: 25 цента).

The genitive plural ''centi'' is produced in an old-fashioned way that is today mostly reserved for measurement units. The alternative ''centa'' follows the vastly more common pattern of other masculine nouns but is very rarely heard in practice.

===Turkish===

Turkey and [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Northern Cyprus]] continue to use the [[Turkish lira]] as their official currency, but the euro is popularly used, particularly by individuals wanting to convert their savings into a more stable currency. ''Euro'' has colloquially been pronounced in the English fashion since its inception.

In response to criticism of the widespread English pronunciation of ''euro'', the [[Turkish Language Association]] officially introduced ''avro'' into [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ("av" being the first syllable of the Turkish word for Europe, ''Avrupa'') in 1998. A concerted campaign by the Turkish Language Association has begun to blossom in recent years, with most sections of the Turkish media now using the new word. It has yet to enter widespread colloquial use, however.

===Ukrainian===

The euro is becoming relatively widespread in [[Ukraine]] although the country did not border the eurozone until 1 January 2009. In standard literary Ukrainian the name is євро (pronounced {{IPA-uk|ˈjɛu̯rɔ|}}). The same form is used in singular and plural cases. Cents are translated as цент ({{IPA-uk|ˈtsɛnt|}}) in the singular and центи ({{IPA-uk|tsɛntɪ|}}){{fix|text=stress?|date=December 2017}} in the plural. In the Ukrainian language there is some variation in cases. Numerative form is цент for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 – e.g. 51 цент but 11 центів), центи for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 – e.g. 54 центи but 12 центів) and центів for the rest – 88 центів. Sometimes євроцент ({{IPA-uk|ˈjɛu̯rɔˌtsɛnt|}}) is used to distinguish eurocents from American cents.

'''Nagasaki Peace Park''' is a [[park]] located in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], commemorating the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]] of the city on August 9, 1945 during [[World War II]]. It is next to the [[Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum|Atomic Bomb Museum]] and near the [[Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims|Peace Memorial Hall]].

==History==
Established in 1955, and near to the [[hypocenter]] of the explosion, remnants of a concrete wall of [[Urakami Cathedral]] can still be seen. Urakami Cathedral was the grandest church in east Asia at the time. At the park's north end is the 10-meter-tall Peace Statue created by sculptor [[Seibo Kitamura]] of [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]. The statue's right hand points to the threat of nuclear weapons while the extended left hand symbolizes eternal peace. The mild face symbolizes [[divine grace]] and the gently closed eyes offer a prayer for the repose of the bomb victims' souls. The folded right leg and extended left leg signify both meditation and the initiative to stand up and rescue the people of the world. The statue represents a mixture of western and eastern art, religion, and ideology. Installed in front of the statue is a black marble vault containing the names of the atomic bomb victims and survivors who died in subsequent years.
A plaque by the Peace Statue is titled ''Words from the Sculptor'' and reads:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;After experiencing that nightmarish war,
that blood-curdling carnage,
that unendurable horror,
Who could walk away without praying for peace?
This statue was created as a signpost in the 
struggle for global harmony.
Standing ten meters tall, 
it conveys the profundity of knowledge and
the beauty of health and virility. 
The right hand points to the atomic bomb,
the left hand points to peace,
and the face prays deeply for the victims of war. 
Transcending the barriers of race 
and evoking the qualities of Buddha and God,
it is a symbol of the greatest determination
ever known in the history of Nagasaki 
and the highest hope of all mankind.&lt;/poem&gt;|source=Seibo Kitamura (Spring 1995)}}

==Plaque==
A plaque at the nearby hypocenter gives the following account and statistics of the damage caused that day.

{{quote|At 11:02 A.M., August 9, 1945 an atomic bomb exploded 500 meters above this spot. The black stone monolith marks the hypocenter.&lt;br /&gt;The fierce blast wind, heat rays reaching several thousand degrees and deadly radiation generated by the explosion crushed, burned, and killed everything in sight and reduced this entire area to a barren field of rubble.&lt;br /&gt;About one-third of Nagasaki City was destroyed and 150,000 people killed or injured and it was said at the time that this area would be devoid of vegetation for 75 years. Now, the hypocenter remains as an international peace park and a symbol of the aspiration for world harmony.}}

==Peace Memorial Ceremony==
[[File:Nagasaki Fountain of Peace.jpg|thumb|Fountain of Peace in Nagasaki Peace Park with Peace Statue in the background]]

Every year, on 9 August, the anniversary of the atomic bombing, a Peace Memorial Ceremony is held in front of the statue and the [[Mayor]] of Nagasaki delivers a Peace Declaration to the World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.at-nagasaki.jp/foreign/english/spot/002.html Nagasaki Places of Interest: Peace Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the south end of the park is a "Fountain of Peace". This was constructed in August, 1969, as a prayer for the repose of the souls of the many atomic bomb victims who died searching for water, and as a dedication to world peace. Lines from a poem by a girl named Sachiko Yamaguchi, who was nine at the time of the bombing, are carved on a black stone plaque in front of the fountain. It reads: "I was thirsty beyond endurance. There was something oily on the surface of the water, but I wanted water so badly that I drank it just as it was."

==Peace Symbols Zone==
In 1978 the city of Nagasaki established a "Peace Symbols Zone" on both sides of the park and invited donations of monuments from countries round the world. The following monuments can be seen in the park:

* "Relief of Friendship" from [[Porto]], Portugal (Nagasaki's [[sister city]]), 1978; the plaque reads: "Homage of the City of Porto to the Atomic Victims of the Sister city of Nagasaki--November 1978."
* "Joy of Life" from [[Czechoslovakia]], (donated to Nagasaki in 1980). The bronze statue 260&amp;nbsp;cm in height was made by Czech sculptor [[Jan Hána]] (1927–1994) in 1975; the plaque reads: "It shows a jubilant mother lifting up her baby in her arms."&lt;ref&gt;Joy of Life (1975) http://www.janhana.com/statues/joy-of-life/ accessed 28 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* "A Call" from [[Bulgaria]], 1980; the plaque reads:"The sculpture symbolizes the struggle of youth in search of peace and harmony, showing a woman with her arms stretched up."
* "Monument of People's Friendship" from the former [[German Democratic Republic]], 1981; the plaque reads: "The sculpture symbolizes the efforts for peace and a happy future of mankind, for the friendship among the peoples."
* "Protection of Our Future" from the city of [[Middelburg]], The Netherlands (Nagasaki's sister city), 1983; the plaque reads: "The statue shows a mother protecting her infant child from danger, representing that we must protect not only the present generation but also the coming generation as well so that the people of the world can live in peace together."
* "Statue of Peace" from the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], 1985; the plaque reads: "It shows a mother holding her infant child as an expression of love and peace."

* "Triumph of Peace over War" from [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires|San Isidro]], Argentina, 1996; the plaque reads: "The parts of the sculpture other than the red sphere symbolize the chaos and death of war, while the red sphere at the top signifies the ultimate triumph of life."
* "Cloak of Peace (Te Korowai Rangimarie)", by [[Kingsley Baird]] from [[New Zealand]], 2006.; the plaque reads: "The statue symbolizes consolation, protection, and solidarity. It also expresses ambivalence, reflecting conflicting interpretations of historical events."
*[[Monument to Commemorate Chinese Victims of the Atomic Bombing]]
*Monument for Korean Atomic Victims
The Monument for Korean Atomic Victims is located in Nagasaki Peace Park in Nagasaki, Japan.  At the time of the atomic bombing in Nagasaki, there were many people of nationalities other than Japanese that were living in the area.  There were an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 Koreans living in Nagasaki during the bombing.  It is believed that up to 2,000 of them died because of the atomic bomb. At the time, those Koreans were being used as forced labor as a part of the Japanese war effort. This monument commemorates the Korean victims and serves as a message asking for peace in the world, an abolition of nuclear weapons, and a peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.  The Monument for Korean Atomic Victims was unveiled on August 9, 1979.

The '''National Endowment for Democracy''' ('''NED''') is a U.S. non-profit [[soft power]] organization that was founded in 1983 with the stated goal of [[Democracy promotion|promoting democracy]] abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is funded primarily through an annual allocation from the [[U.S. Congress]] in the form of a grant awarded through the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA). It was created by The Democracy Program as a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation, and in turn acts as a grant-making foundation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowe|first=David|url=http://www.ned.org/about/history|title=Idea to Reality: NED at 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its grants program, NED also supports and houses the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', the [[World Movement for Democracy]], the [[International Forum for Democratic Studies]], the [[Reagan–Fascell Fellowship Program]], the [[Network of Democracy Research Institutes]], and the [[Center for International Media Assistance]].

==History==

===Founding===
A bill was introduced in April 1967 by Congressman Dante Fascell (D-Fla.) to create an institute of International Affairs. And although the bill did not pass it led to discussions on Capitol Hill to establish an institution in which democracy efforts abroad would benefit the U.S. as well as countries struggling for freedom and self- government.

In a 1982 speech at the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] proposed an initiative, before the British Parliament, "to foster the infrastructure of democracy—the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities." The U.S. government, through [[USAID]] (United States Agency for International Development), contracted [[The American Political Foundation]] to study democracy promotion, which became known as "The Democracy Program." The Program recommended the creation of a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation to be known as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). NED, though non-governmental, would be funded primarily through annual appropriations from the U.S. government and subject to congressional oversight.&lt;ref name="ned1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/about/nedhistory.html |title=History |publisher=National Endowment for Democracy |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426072447/http://www.ned.org/about/nedhistory.html |archivedate=April 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department and United States Information Agency (USIA) proposed the Endowment to encourage and facilitate exchanges between democratic institutions through private sectors; promote nongovernmental participation in democratic training programs; strengthening democratic electoral processes abroad in cooperation with indigenous democratic forces; fostering cooperation between American private sector groups and those abroad "dedicated to the cultural values, institutions, and organizations of democratic pluralism.", and encouraging democratic development consistent with the interests of both the U.S and the other groups receiving assistance.

In 1983, the House Foreign Affairs Committee proposed legislation to provide initial funding of $31.3 million for NED as part of the [[State Department Authorization Act]] (H.R. 2915), because NED was in its beginning stages of development the appropriation was set at $18 million.  Included in the legislation was $13.8 million for the [[Free Trade Union Institute]], an affiliate of the [[AFL-CIO]], $2.5 million for an affiliate of the [[National Chamber Foundation]], and $5 million each for two party institutes, which was later eliminated by a vote of 267–136. The conference report on H.R. 2915 was adopted by the House on November 17, 1983 and the Senate the following day. On November 18, 1983, articles of incorporation were filed in the District of Columbia to establish the National Endowment for Democracy as a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref name="ned1"/&gt;

===Later history===
Under the reauthorization of NED several factors were added to the organizations guidelines: the NED Act had to arrange the Board's prohibition on the use of funds for partisan political purposes, including funding for national party operations; mandate that NED consult with the State Department on any overseas programs it funds prior to the commencement of their activities; move the required date of reporting to Congress on all grants from December 31 to February 4, and lastly despite its non-governmental status, comply fully with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.

==Overview==
NED is a grant-making foundation, distributing funds to private non-governmental organizations for promoting democracy abroad. Half of NED's funding is allocated annually to four main U.S. organizations: the [[American Center for International Labor Solidarity]] (ACILS), the [[Center for International Private Enterprise]] (CIPE), the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (NDI), and the [[International Republican Institute]] (IRI), formerly known as the National Republican Institute for International Affairs. The other half of NED's funding is awarded annually to hundreds of non-governmental organizations based abroad which apply for support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ned.org/apply-for-grant/en/|title = Grants|publisher = National Endowment for Democracy|accessdate = November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Endowment has come a long way from opposition between both political parties in its earlier stages to widespread bipartisan endorsement on the Hill. Even though the American government has implemented its own democracy promoting capabilities through [[USAID]] (United States Agency for International Development), NED's independence plays a key factor in its relevance. The organization's independence lets it work in situations that official bodies may have to avoid,and its non-bureaucratic nature enables it to move quickly in rapidly changing situations. NED has influenced other nations to create their own institutions for the promotion of democracy. {{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Source of funding===
The NED receives an annual appropriation from the U.S. budget (it is included in the chapter of the Department of State budget destined for the U.S. Agency for International Development-USAID) and is subject to congressional oversight even as a non-governmental organization. In the financial year to the end of September 2009 NED had an income of $135.5 million, nearly all of which came from U.S Government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/docs/08annual/PDFs/AR_Financials08.pdf |title=2008 Independent Auditors’ Report |year=2008 |publisher=National Endowment for Democracy |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1984 to 1990 the NED received $15–18 million of congressional funding annually, and $25–$30m from 1991 to 1993. At the time the funding came via the [[United States Information Agency]]. In 1993 the NED nearly lost its congressional funding, after the House of Representatives initially voted to abolish its funding. The funding (of $35 million, a rise from $30 million the year before) was only retained after a vigorous campaign by NED supporters.&lt;ref name=Carothers&gt;[[Thomas Carothers]], "The NED at 10", ''Foreign Policy'', No. 95 (Summer, 1994), pp. 123–138. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1149427&lt;/ref&gt;

The NED has received funding from foundations, such as the [[Smith Richardson Foundation]], the [[John M. Olin Foundation]], and others.  The [[Bradley Foundation]] supported the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' with $1.5 million during 1990–2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientgrants.php?recipientID=251 |title=Recipient Grants: National Endowment for Democracy |publisher=[[Media Transparency]] |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804085509/http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientgrants.php?recipientID=251 |archivedate=August 4, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The NED supports programs only in countries outside the United States.

===Funding of election monitors and democratic advocacy===
NED does not directly fund any political party, as this is forbidden by law. According to NED, it funds election monitoring and also civic education about voting, such as student-led "get-out-the-vote" campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/grants/04programs/grants-eurasia04.html#Ukraine |title=Grants Program – 2004 |publisher=National Endowment for Democracy |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514182516/http://www.ned.org/grants/04programs/grants-eurasia04.html#Ukraine |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NED has also supported, provided training, and consulted with groups which approve of democracy, but criticize the United States, in countries such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Ukraine]].{{which|date=November 2012}} The NED says that it focuses funding on democracy-minded organizations rather than opposition groups; however it does not support groups that openly advocate communism, fundamentalism, or dictatorships. [[Michael McFaul]], in an article for the ''Washington Post'', argues that the NED is not an instrument of U.S. foreign policy. As an example of this, he states that the NED was willing to fund pro-democratic organizations even when the U.S. government was supportive of non-democratic governments in the region.{{which|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=16292&amp;prog=zru |title='Meddling' In Ukraine: Democracy is not an American plot|publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |first=Michael |last=McFaul  |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central America===
According to "London Progressive Journal", The [[International Republican Institute]] (IRI) received about $1.2 million from NED in 2009 in order to support [[think tanks]] and [[advocacy group]]s to "support initiatives to implement political positions during the campaigns in 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dominguez |first1=Francisco |year=2009 |title=US Support is Propping Up Honduran Military Coup |journal=London Progressive Journal |issue=79 |url=http://www.londonprogressivejournal.com/issue/show/79?article_id=483 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302012130/http://www.londonprogressivejournal.com/issue/show/79?article_id=483 |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

====Democracy and human rights advocacy====
Of the 28 Asian NGOs the NED funds, 18 are related to China. Most of these grants go to organizations promoting democracy and human rights. Democracy organizations funded by the NED that target China as a whole are [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]], the [[China Strategic Institute]], and the [[Laogai Research Foundation]].

The NGO 'Chinese Urgent Action Working Group'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cuawg.wikidot.com/about-us| title=Chinese Urgent Action Working Group| access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; run by Swedish man Peter Dahlin also received funding from the National Endowment for Democracy. Dahlin, a Swedish citizen, was detained and interrogated for 23 days by China's [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security]]. Interrogators showed him a document about the organization, complete with names of employees, associates and grant recipients. The internal report showed how the "Chinese Urgent Action Working Group" had received financing from NED for the last five years.

"I realized it must have come straight from N.E.D. itself somehow," Mr. Dahlin said in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', adding that he had never seen the document before. Dahlin said, "They appeared intent on gathering information about groups financed by the National Endowment for Democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Edward |date=2016-07-09 |title=Inside China's Secret 23-Day Detention of a Foreign Nonprofit Chief |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/world/asia/china-ned-ngo-peter-dahlin.html?&amp;moduleDetail=section-news-1&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Europe&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;version=WhatsNext&amp;contentID=WhatsNext&amp;pgtype=article |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2016-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
One criticism of the organization includes a lack of openness and public accountability in its stewardship of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer funds in the year 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Ben A. Franklin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/04/us/democracy-project-facing-new-criticisms.html "Democracy Project Facing New Criticisms,"] ''The New York Times'' (December 4, 1985). Retrieved 14 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian congressman [[Ron Paul]] also argued against NED funding in 2005 stating that NED has "very little to do with democracy. It is an organization that uses US tax money to actually subvert democracy, by showering funding on favored political parties or movements overseas. It underwrites color-coded 'people's revolutions' overseas that look more like pages out of Lenin's writings on stealing power than genuine indigenous democratic movements." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-07-20/pdf/CREC-2005-07-20-pt1-PgH6117-3.pdf#page=53&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative reporter and editor of ''Consortiumnews'' [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] has characterized NED as a "[[Neoconservatism|neocon]] slush fund," whose founding was the brainchild of Reagan Administration [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Director [[William J. Casey|William Casey]] and its leading propagandist Walter Raymond Jr., then on the staff of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. The idea was to set up an organization funded by the U.S. Congress to take over CIA programs that attempted to influence foreign elections by promoting the selection of candidates who supported U.S. policy and would "do what the U.S. government tells them to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Key Neocon Calls on US to Oust Putin|url = https://consortiumnews.com/2016/10/07/key-neocon-calls-on-us-to-oust-putin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The libertarian think tank [[Cato Institute]] criticized money spent in France in the 1980s saying that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;French democracy in the 1980s did not appear to be so fragile that it required financial assistance from American taxpayers to sustain itself. The government of [[François Mitterrand]] was duly elected within a democratic system nearly as old as America's. The AFL-CIO, however, determined that [[French Socialist Party|France's socialist]] government was permitting a dangerous rise of communist influence. According to the late [[Irving Brown]], Paris-based director of international relations for the AFL-CIO at the time of the incident: "France . . . is threatened by the Communist apparatus. . . . It is a clear and present danger if the present is thought of as 10 years from now." That mentality has resulted in AFL-CIO support for highly controversial causes. One of the French groups that received funding, the [[Union Nationale Inter-universitaire|National Inter-University Union]], was widely viewed as a cauldron of rightist extremism and xenophobia and rumored also to have ties to terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Loose Cannon: The National Endowment for Democracy|url = https://www.cato.org/publications/foreign-policy-briefing/loose-cannon-national-endowment-democracy|website = www.cato.org|accessdate = 2018-09-08|date = 1993-11-08|last = Conry|first = Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA)==

CIMA works to improve the development of [[independent media]] worldwide while working to strengthen the support for such development.&lt;ref name="CIMA Web site"&gt;[http://cima.ned.org/about About CIMA]&lt;/ref&gt; The center works to improve the effectiveness of existing [[Media Development|media development]] efforts by conducting research, building networks and bringing together a broad range of experts to share their experiences. CIMA's mission is based on the conviction that free and independent media play an indispensable role in developing sustainable [[democracy|democracies]] around the world.

In 2006, CIMA was founded as an initiative of the National Endowment for Democracy with encouragement from Congress and a grant from the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.&lt;ref name="National Endowment for Democracy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ned.org/docs/07annual/PDFs/AR_CIMA07.pdf/ |title=National Endowment for Democracy |access-date=August 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312165233/http://ned.org/docs/07annual/PDFs/AR_CIMA07.pdf |archive-date=March 12, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reports===

CIMA's reports provide a knowledge base on a variety of topics in media assistance. The goal of these reports is to provide policymakers, as well as donors and practitioners, with practical information on the importance of free media to the development of a society.

{{Nazism sidebar}}
The '''National Socialist Women's League''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Nationalsozialistische Frauenschaft'', abbreviated ''NS-Frauenschaft'') was the [[women's wing]] of the [[Nazi Party]]. It was founded in October 1931 as a fusion of several [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[National socialism|National Socialist]] women's associations.

The ''Frauenschaft'' was subordinated to the national party leadership (''Reichsleitung''); girls and young women were the purview of the ''[[Bund Deutscher Mädel]]'' (BDM). From February 1934 to the end of World War II in 1945, the ''NS-Frauenschaft'' was led by Reich's Women's Leader (''Reichsfrauenführerin'') [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]] (1902–1999).  It put out a biweekly magazine, the ''[[NS-Frauen-Warte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/Englisch/helios/digi/nsfrauenwarte.html NS-Frauenwarte: Paper of the National Socialist Women's League]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Its activities included instruction in the use of German-manufactured products, such as butter and rayon, in place of imported ones, as part of the self-sufficiency program, and classes for brides and schoolgirls.&lt;ref name="Grunberger258"&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''The 12-Year Reich'', p 258, {{ISBN|0-03-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During wartime, it also provided refreshments at train stations, collected scrap metal and other materials, ran cookery and other classes, and allocated [[OST-Arbeiter#Nannies|the domestic servants conscripted in the east]] to large families.&lt;ref name="Grunberger258"/&gt;  Propaganda organizations depended on it as the primary spreader of propaganda to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leila J. Rupp]], ''Mobilizing Women for War'', p 105, {{ISBN|0-691-04649-2}}, {{OCLC|3379930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''NS-Frauenschaft'' reached a total membership of 2 million by 1938, the equivalent of 40% of the total party membership.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. 1995 ''A History of Fascism 1914-1945'' University of Wisconsin Press, Madison p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

The German National Socialist Women's League Children's Group was known as ''"Kinderschar''".{{cn|date=June 2017}}

'''Option nationale''', registered as '''Option nationale – Pour l'indépendance du Québec''' (National Option – For the Independence of Quebec), was a [[centre-left]] and [[Left-wing nationalism|left-wing nationalist]] [[List of political parties in Quebec|political party in Quebec]], Canada&lt;ref name="AuziasLabourdette2013" /&gt;. It advocated for the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty of Quebec]] from Canada, and said a vote for Option nationale is an electoral mandate for full-fledged [[autonomy]] (''de facto'' sovereignty), before holding a [[referendum]] to adopt the constitution of Quebec as an independent state (''de jure'' sovereignty). It merged with [[Québec solidaire]] on January 1, 2018 to become a [[collective]] within the party.

== History ==
It was founded in 2011 by [[Jean-Martin Aussant]], a member of the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] (MNA) who had quit the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) earlier that year after being elected in [[Quebec general election, 2008|2008]].

The party had planned to use the name "Option Québec", as a nod to [[René Lévesque]]'s 1968 manifesto ''[[An Option for Quebec]]'', but it was already taken by another group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Former+files+papers+start+sovereignist+party/5425869/story.html Former PQ MNA files papers to start sovereignist party] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003160052/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Former+files+papers+start+sovereignist+party/5425869/story.html# |date=2011-10-03 }}. ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' {{Date missing}} {{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, before the party was founded, Aussant was courted by the [[Parti Indépendantiste]], with leader Eric Tremblay hoping to have his first member of the National Assembly. Aussant refused however, saying he disagreed with the party's position on reducing immigration, and with the view of the party that the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 referendum]] was lost because of "anglophone and ethnic votes". Aussant insists that economic fears propagated by federalists were responsible for the referendum defeat.&lt;ref name="Bussières"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bussières|first=Ian|title=Jean-Martin Aussant dit oui au pays, mais non-au Parti indépendantiste|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/politique/201108/07/01-4424167-jean-martin-aussant-dit-oui-au-pays-mais-non-au-parti-independantiste.php|publisher=''[[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]]''|date=August 8, 2011|access-date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the creation of Option nationale, [[Lisette Lapointe]], wife of former Quebec Premier [[Jacques Parizeau]], acquired a membership card from the party,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/national/archives/2011/11/20111117-135249.html "Lisette Lapointe rallie l'Option nationale"]. ''[[TVA (Canada)|TVA]]'', November 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to continue sitting as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] until the end of her term, and did not run for reelection in the [[Quebec general election, 2012|2012 provincial election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/politique-quebecoise/201203/05/01-4502476-lisette-lapointe-dit-non-a-option-nationale.php "Lisette Lapointe dit non à Option nationale"]. ''[[Le Nouvelliste (Quebec)|Le Nouvelliste]]'', March 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign of the [[Quebec general election, 2012|2012 general election]], columnist Dan Delmar of the ''[[National Post]]'' commented:

{{quotation|Although the party led by former Péquiste Jean-Martin Aussant is desperate {{sic|to breakaway}} from Canada, he is going about the project in a civilized manner. Aussant speaks near-perfect English, which is uncommon for post-Bernard Landry sovereignist leaders. And in a somewhat stunning development, he posted a YouTube video pitching sovereignty to Anglophones – in English! His brand of inclusive sovereignty is refreshing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/08/10/tout-le-quebec-en-parle-on-anglo-sovereignty-fighting-corruption-and-immigrants/ Tout le Quebec en parle: On anglo-sovereignty, fighting corruption and immigrants]. ''[[National Post]]'', August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On June 19, 2013, Jean-Martin Aussant resigned as leader of Option nationale, and Nathaly Dufour became interim leader. On October 26, 2013, [[Sol Zanetti]] became the new leader of Option nationale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sol Zanetti nouveau chef d'Option nationale|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Politique/2013/10/26/001-course-direction-option-nationale.shtml|publisher=Radio-Canada|date=October 26, 2013|access-date=October 27, 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It merged with Québec solidaire on January 1, 2018 to become a collective within the party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5542">'''Ordinarily resident status''' is a concept in the law of the United Kingdom which affects entitlement to the [[National Health Service]]. It formerly affected taxation, but the concept of ordinary residence was abolished for the purposes of tax years 2013/14 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When does someone become ordinarily resident?|url=http://www.taxguideforstudents.org.uk/types-of-student/international-students/residence-and-domicile/when-does-someone-become-ordinarily-resident|website=Tax guide for students|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Related concepts==

[[Indefinite leave to remain]] and [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|Right of abode]] are related concepts in immigration law. A person who is a [[British nationality law|British Citizen]] is not necessarily an ordinary resident in the UK.

==Guidance==

The official guidance issued to the NHS states:  ''A person is ordinarily resident if they are normally residing in the UK (apart from temporary or occasional absences), and their residence here has been adopted voluntarily and for settled purposes as part of the regular order of their life for the time being, whether for short or long duration.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordinary Residence Tool|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/430967/OR_Tool__1_.pdf|publisher=Department of health|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Guidance on implementing the overseas visitor hospital charging regulations 2015 extends to 131 pages, with a further 12 pages of guidance on  ''Ways in which people can be lawfully resident in the UK''.  It is intended to assist NHS bodies in carrying out their duties under the regulations to make and recover charges for NHS hospital treatment from chargeable overseas visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-overseas-visitors-hospital-charging-regulations|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-overseas-visitors-hospital-charging-regulations|accessdate=2 November 2016|publisher=Gov.uk|date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HM Revenue and Customs issued guidance (booklet HMRC 6) in respect of taxation which included reference to renting, leasing or buying property. This is not mentioned in the NHS guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When does someone become ordinarily resident?|url=http://www.taxguideforstudents.org.uk/types-of-student/international-students/residence-and-domicile/when-does-someone-become-ordinarily-resident|website=Tax guide for students|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is also embedded in the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Scotland) Regulations 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overseas Visitors|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Services/Overseas-visitors|website=Scottish Government|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

"Ordinarily resident" has not been defined by [[Act of Parliament]].  It has been developed in [[caselaw]].  The leading case is R V. Barnet London Borough Council, Ex parte Nilish Shah, which was decided by the House of Lords in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(1982) 81 LGR 305, 81 LGR 305, [1983] 2 WLR 16, [1982] UKHL 14, [1983] 2 AC 309, [1983] 1 All ER 226|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1982/14.html|accessdate=2 November 2016|work=United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions|publisher=Bailii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was concerned with the meaning of ‘ordinary residence’ as used in the Education Acts. The five appellants were all students who had come to the UK to study. None of them had the right of abode in the United Kingdom. It established these principles:

Ordinary residence is established if there is a regular habitual mode of life in a particular place "for the time being", "whether of short of short or long duration", the continuity of which has persisted apart from temporary or occasional absences. The residence must be voluntary and adopted for "a settled purpose".

A person can be ordinarily resident in more than one country at the same time. This is not the case in respect of [[Residency (domicile)|domicile]].

Ordinary residence is proven more by evidence of matters capable of objective proof than by evidence as to state of mind.

==Administration in the NHS==
In October 2016 it was reported that the government had set a target of recovering £500 million a year from overseas visitors treated in NHS hospitals in England, which had been "refined" to £346m for 2017-18, according to the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]].  £289m was collected in 2015-16 and £73m in 2012-13.  The NAO reported that only 58% of hospital doctors knew some people were chargeable for NHS healthcare at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS set to miss target on foreign patient costs|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37790852|accessdate=2 November 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Joseph Meirion Thomas, a former cancer specialist at the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]] failure to enforce the charging regulations is costing the British taxpayer £3 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cost of treating health tourists is killing the NHS, says Ross Clark|url=http://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/727339/NHS-cost-treatment-foreign-tourists-Bimbo-Ayelabola|accessdate=2 November 2016|publisher=Daily Express|date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2561">[[File:ParabolicMicrophone.jpg|thumb|right|Parabolic microphone used at an American college football game.]] 

A '''parabolic microphone''' is a [[microphone]] that uses a [[parabolic reflector]] to collect and focus [[sound]] waves onto a [[transducer]], in much the same way that a [[parabolic antenna]] (e.g., [[satellite dish]]) does with [[radio wave]]s.  Parabolic microphones have great sensitivity to sounds in one direction, along the axis of the dish, and can pick up distant sounds.   Typical uses of this microphone include nature [[sound recording]] such as recording [[bird call]]s, field audio for sports broadcasting, and [[eavesdropping]] on conversations, for example in [[espionage]] and law enforcement. Parabolic microphones were used in many parts of the world as early as World War II, especially by the Japanese.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Sony parabolic reflector.jpg|thumb|right|a Sony parabolic reflector, without a microphone. The microphone would face the reflector surface and sound captured by the reflector would bounce towards the microphone.]]

Parabolic microphones are generally not used for [[high fidelity]] applications because dishes small enough to be portable have poor low frequency response.  This is because, from the [[Rayleigh criterion]], parabolic dishes can only focus waves with a wavelength much smaller than the diameter of their aperture.  The wavelength of sound waves at the low end of human hearing  (20&amp;nbsp;Hz) is about {{convert|17|metres|feet}}; focusing them would require a dish much larger than this.  A typical parabolic microphone dish with a diameter of one metre has little directivity for sound waves longer than 30&amp;nbsp;cm, corresponding to frequencies below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. For higher frequencies, a gain of about 15&amp;nbsp;dB can be expected, however, when the wavelength of the sound becomes comparable with the diameter of the parabolic dish the response falls away.&lt;ref name=S&amp;R&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim|title=Sound and Recording|date=2009|publisher=Elsevler Ltd.|location=30 Corporate Drive, Sulte 400, Burlington, MA 01803, USA|isbn=978-0-240-52163-3|page=60|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[shotgun microphone]], or a [[phased array]] of microphones, may be used as an alternative for applications requiring directional selectivity with high fidelity.

The '''pluralism in economics''' movement is a campaign to change the teaching and research in economics towards more openness in its approaches, topics and standpoints it considers. The goal of the movement is to "...reinvigorate the discipline ... [and bring] economics back into the service of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isipe.net/open-letter/|title=Open Letter|website=International Student Initiative for Pluralism in Economics|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that economics had greater [[scientific pluralism]] in the past compared to the [[monism|monist]] approach that is prevalent today.&lt;ref name="dalen"&gt;

==History==
Critics of [[mainstream economics]] have called for a reform of the discipline in the past. The movement for pluralism can therefore be traced to wider movements for progressive change in the 1960s and 1970s, with economists like [[Frank_Stilwell_(economist)|Frank Stilwell]] and [[Steve Keen]] campaigning for pluralist and critical economics teaching at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Sydney"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Gavan |last2=Jones |first2=Evan |last3=Stilwell |first3=Frank |date=2009 |title=Political Economy Now!

McCloskey|Deirdre McCloskey]] was published as a paid advertisement in ''The American Economic Review''.&lt;ref name="1992 Plea"&gt;{{cite web|author = FEED|title=The 1992 Plea for a Pluralistic and Rigorous Economics | url = http://www.feed-charity.org/new-page-3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition described itself as a "plea for a pluralistic and rigorous economics" and was preceded by a commission of the [[American Economic Association]] entitled "Report by the Commission on Graduate Education".&lt;ref&gt;"A Plea for a Pluralistic and Rigorous Economics", ''American Economic Review'', 82(2): xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, A.O. Arrow, K.J. et al (1991). "Report of the commission on graduate education in economics", ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 29(3): 1035-1053.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, students at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] protested and announced the creation of the [[post-autistic economics]] movement.&lt;ref name="post-autistic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullbrook|first=Edward|title=The Crisis in Economics: The post - autistic economics movement: the first 600 days|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415308984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, students at the University of Cambridge and University of Missouri-Kansas City organised petitions in 2001 and in 2011 the Cambridge Society for Economic Pluralism was formed to promote pluralist thinking and pushing for curriculum reform within the university.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Foundation for European Economic Development]] (FEED) organised a plea for economic pluralism with over 2,000 signatures in the first month.&lt;ref name="FEED"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Sheffield Indymedia - 2011-02-23 Behind the witch-hunt of -WikiLeaks - 2 Questions and Answers.vorb.oga|thumb|Sheffield [[Indymedia]] spoke at a public meeting in [[Sheffield]] on February 23, 2011 about the persecution of [[WikiLeaks]], and in defense of [[Julian Assange]]]]

The [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]] has received praise as well as criticism.

== Response from governments ==

=== Australia ===
On 16 March 2009, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] added WikiLeaks to their proposed list of sites that will be blocked for all Australians if the [[Internet censorship in Australia|mandatory internet filtering scheme]] is implemented as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/home/technology/banned-hyperlinks-could-cost-you-11000-a-day/2009/03/17/1237054787635.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1&amp;page=-1/ |title=Banned hyperlinks could cost you $11,000 a day |work=The Age|place=Melbourne |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2009|first=Asher|last=Moses | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121106205253/http://www.theage.com.au/news/home/technology/banned-hyperlinks-could-cost-you-11000-a-day/2009/03/17/1237054787635.html?page=fullpage | archivedate = 2012-11-06| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/Australia_secretly_censors_Wikileaks_press_release_and_Danish_Internet_censorship_list%2C_16_Mar_2009/index.html |title=Australia secretly censors Wikileaks press release and Danish Internet censorship list, 16&amp;nbsp;Mar 2009 |publisher=Mirror.wikileaks.info |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=17 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415212707/http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/Australia_secretly_censors_Wikileaks_press_release_and_Danish_Internet_censorship_list%2C_16_Mar_2009/index.html# |archivedate=15 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blacklisting had been removed by 29 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Josh |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/wikileaks-removed-from-acma-blacklist-339307604.htm |title=Wikileaks removed from ACMA blacklist |work=ZDNet Australia |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101129235721/http://www.zdnet.com.au/wikileaks-removed-from-acma-blacklist-339307604.htm | archivedate = 2010-11-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2010, Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] made a statement that she 'absolutely condemns' WikiLeaks' actions and that the release of information on the site was 'grossly irresponsible' and 'illegal.'&lt;ref name="julia"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/gillard-condemns-wikileaks-20101202-18haq.html |title=Gillard condemns WikiLeaks |editor=Paul Ramadge |date=2 December 2010 |work=The Age |location=Australia |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is [[Australians|Australian]] and he responded two days later by accusing his prime minister of betraying him as an Australian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pm-has-betrayed-me-assange-20101204-18ks8.html|title=PM has betrayed me: Assange|last=Gordon |first=Josh |date=5 December 2010|work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=4 December 2010 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on 8 December 2010 – after WikiLeaks published U.S. diplomatic cables in which United States diplomats labelled him a "control freak", former Australian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister (now resigned) [[Kevin Rudd]] said the leak of the US secret cables raised questions about US security. Rudd said, "The core responsibility, and therefore legal liability, goes to those individuals responsible for that initial unauthorised release."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11945558|title=Wikileaks&lt;!-- sic! --&gt;: Australia FM blames US, not Julian Assange|date=8 December 2010|publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://us.mobile.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE6B713420101208|title=Australia says U.S, not WikiLeaks founder, responsible for leaks|date=8 December 2010|publisher=Reuters |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in [[The Australian]], Assange claimed, "The Australian attorney-general is doing everything he can to help a US investigation clearly directed at framing Australian citizens and shipping them to the US."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/wikileaks/dont-shoot-messenger-for-revealing-uncomfortable-truths/story-fn775xjq-1225967241332|title=Don&amp;#039;t shoot messenger for revealing uncomfortable truths|date=8 December 2010|work=The Australian |accessdate=9 December 2010|first=Julian|last=Assange}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Australian officials later said that Assange has done nothing illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kelly |first=Joe |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/wikileaks/law-not-broken-by-wikileaks-publication-of-us-cables-afp/story-fn775xjq-1225972735066 |title=Law not broken by WikiLeaks' publication of US cables: AFP |work=The Australian  |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, representatives of the Australian Federal Government and the major opposition including Craig Emerson the Minister for Trade have come out in support of WikiLeaks and against some violent rhetoric directed against them, stating; "We condemn absolutely the threats that have been made by some people in the United States against Julian Assange."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"&gt;{{Cite video|title=Q&amp;A Series 4: Episode 2|medium=TV, Online Streaming|publisher=abc|location=Australia|date=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] expressed his "solidarity" with Julian Assange following Assange's 2010 arrest in the United Kingdom. Lula went on to state – in reference to WikiLeaks disclosure of classified US diplomatic cables in November and December 2010 – WikiLeaks had "exposed a diplomacy that had appeared unreachable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/putin-leads-backlash-over-wikileaks-boss-detention-20101209-18rgi.html |title=Putin leads backlash over WikiLeaks boss detention |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 | first=Maria |last=Antonova |work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xAY7KkcUYk |title=President Lula Shows Support for Wikileaks (video available) |date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further criticised the arrest of Julian Assange as "an attack on [[freedom of expression]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11966193 |title=Wikileaks: Brazil President Lula backs Julian Assange |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010 | first= |last= |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
The WikiLeaks website claims that the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] has attempted to block all traffic to websites with "wikileaks" in the [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] since 2007, but that this can be bypassed by encrypted connections or by using one of WikiLeaks' many covert URLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Wikileaks blocked by the Chinese government? |url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About#Is_Wikileaks_blocked_by_the_Chinese_government.3F |publisher=WikiLeaks |year=2008 |accessdate=28 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216000537/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks%3AAbout |archivedate=16 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecuador ===
In late November 2010, a representative of the [[government of Ecuador]] made what was, apparently, an unsolicited public offer to Julian Assange to establish residency in Ecuador. Deputy Foreign Minister Kinto Lucas stated "we are going to invite him to come to Ecuador so he can freely present the information he possesses and all the documentation, not just on the Internet, but in various public forums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=197327 |title=Ecuador offers asylum to WikiLeaks founder |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas went on to state his praise for WikiLeaks and Assange calling them "[people] who are constantly investigating and trying to get light out of the dark corners of [state] information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/11/2010113033515743921.html |title=Ecuador rebuts Assange refuge offer |date=1 December 2010 |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, however, president [[Rafael Correa]] distanced his administration from the offer stating that Lucas had been speaking for himself and not on the government's behalf. Correa then criticised Assange for "breaking the laws of the United States and leaking this type of information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://us.mobile.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE6AT66820101201 |title=Ecuador backs off offer to WikiLeaks' Assange |publisher=Us.mobile.reuters.com |date=|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
The French Industry Minister [[Éric Besson]] said in a letter to the CGIET technology agency, WikiLeaks "violates the secret of diplomatic relations and puts people protected by diplomatic secret in danger." Therefore, it would be 'unacceptable' that the site was hosted on servers based in France.

=== Iceland ===
After the release of the [[12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike|2007 Baghdad airstrikes video]] and as they prepared to release film of the [[Granai airstrike]], Julian Assange has said that his group of volunteers came under intense surveillance. In an interview and Twitter posts he said that a restaurant in [[Reykjavík]] where his group of volunteers met came under surveillance in March; that there was "covert following and hidden photography" by police and foreign [[intelligence agency|intelligence services]]; that an apparent British intelligence agent made thinly veiled threats in a Luxembourg car park; and that one of the volunteers was detained by police for 21&amp;nbsp;hours. Another volunteer posted that computers were seized, saying "If anything happens to us, you know why... and you know who is responsible."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7094234.ece |title=Whistleblowers on US 'massacre' fear CIA stalkers |date=11 April 2010 |work=The Sunday Times |place=London |author=Campbell, Matthew | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110814061024/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7094234.ece | archivedate = 2011-08-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', "the Icelandic press took a look at Assange's charges of being surveilled in Iceland [...] and, at best, have found nothing to substantiate them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/thin_ice.php |title=Thin ice: The man behind WikiLeaks has some allegations |work=Columbia Journalism Review |place =New York |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |author=Hendler, Clint | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212024527/http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/thin_ice.php | archivedate = 2013-12-12| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, [[Kaupthing Bank]] secured a court order preventing Iceland's national broadcaster, [[RÚV]], from broadcasting a risk analysis report showing the bank's substantial exposure to debt default risk. This information had been leaked to WikiLeaks and remained available on the WikiLeaks website; faced with an injunction minutes before broadcast, the channel aired a screen-shot of the WikiLeaks site instead of the scheduled piece on the bank. Citizens of Iceland were reported to be outraged that RÚV was prevented from broadcasting news of relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work =The San Diego Union-Tribune |author =Sigurgrimsdottir, Herdis |title=Iceland court lifts gag order after public outrage |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2009/aug/04/eu-iceland-bank-outrage-080409/ |agency=Associated Press |date=4 August 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, WikiLeaks has been credited with inspiring the [[Icelandic Modern Media Initiative]], a bill meant to reclaim Iceland's 2007 ''[[Reporters Without Borders]] (Reporters sans frontières)'' ranking as first in the world for free speech.

=== India ===
In identical statements to both Houses of [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]] on 18 March 2011, then Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] rejected all allegations against his government revealed by the [[Contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak (India)|United States diplomatic cables leak]], including [[Cash-for-votes scandal|allegations of bribery]] during the [[2008 Lok Sabha vote of confidence]]. Singh told Parliament, "The [[Government of India]] cannot confirm the veracity, contents or even the existence of such communications. I may point out that many of the persons referred to in those reports have stoutly denied the veracity of the contents. An issue was raised that the offence of bribery was committed in India. Government rejects that allegation absolutely and firmly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/03/18/transcript-indian-prime-minister-manmohan-singh-on-wikileaks/|title=Transcript: India PM on WikiLeaks|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-03-19/news/29146288_1_trust-vote-confidence-vote-upa-government|title=Wikileaks India: PM says no one from Cong, govt bought votes|work=timesofindia-economictimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-manmohan-singh-rejects-wikileakss-charges-of-bribery-1521439&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Times Now]], Julian Assange labelled the Indian government's response as "one of the worst in the world" and a "clear attempt to mislead the nation on what the cables were". Assange stated, "The response by the government left a lot to be desired. Before it was clear to me that Prime Minister Mr. Singh was deliberately attempting to mislead the Indian people on what type of material this was. People tell me that he is not personally corrupt, I do not know myself as I don't have information on that. But, his reaction left a lot to be desired. It wasn't to fully and frankly investigate what was going on and then provide finding to the parliament. Rather, it was attempt to spin the issue and I suspect that has come from experience in dealing with similar scandals in the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesnow.tv/Indian-govt-response-to-WikiLeaks-the-worst/videoshow/4371497.cms|title='Indian govt response to WikiLeaks the worst'-News-Exclusives-TIMESNOW.tv - Latest Breaking News, Big News Stories, News Videos|work=timesnow.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
The President of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], also criticised WikiLeaks following the release of United States diplomatic cables. Ahmadinejad claimed that the release of cables purporting to show concern with Iran by Arab states was a planned leak by the United States to discredit his government, though he did not indicate whether he believed WikiLeaks was in collusion with the United States or was simply an unwitting facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-claims-psychological-warfare-ahmadinejad |title=WikiLeaks claims are 'psychological warfare' says Ahmadinejad &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2010 |first1=Ian |last1=Black |first2=Harriet |last2=Sherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
In December 2010, the office of the Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] issued a statement calling on non-governmental organisations to consider "nominating [Julian] Assange as a Nobel Prize laureate." The announcement followed commentary by Russian ambassador to [[NATO]] Dmitry Rogozin who stated that Julian Assange's earlier arrest on Swedish charges demonstrated that there was "no media freedom" in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/09/julian-assange-nobel-peace-prize |title=Julian Assange should be awarded Nobel peace prize, suggests Russia |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 | first=Luke |last=Harding |location=London |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations ===
In December 2010 United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression [[Frank LaRue]] stated he agreed with the idea that Julian Assange was a "martyr for free speech." LaRue went on to say Assange or other WikiLeaks staff should not face legal accountability for any information they disseminated, noting that, "if there is a responsibility by leaking information it is of, exclusively of the person that made the leak and not of the media that publish it. And this is the way that transparency works and that corruption has been confronted in many cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s3089025.htm |title=UN rapporteur says Assange shouldn't be prosecuted |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |first=Eleanor |last=Hall |work=abc.net.au |publisher=[[ABC Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, subsequently voiced concern at the revelation that private companies were being pressured by states to sever their relationships with WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6B81RO20101209 |title=UN rights boss concerned at targeting of WikiLeaks |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |work=reutres |publisher=Reuters |first=Stephanie |last=Nebehay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response from media ==

=== People's Republic of China ===
Chinese journalist [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]] was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, in 2005 after publicising an email from Chinese officials about the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square massacre]].&lt;ref name="NewScientist1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Marks, Paul |title=How to leak a secret and not get caught |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/tech/mg19325865.500-how-to-leak-a-secret-and-not-get-caught.html |work=[[New Scientist]] |place =London |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=28 February 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140203090134/http://www.huliq.com/5711/how-to-leak-a-secret-and-not-get-caught | archivedate = 2014-02-03| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said:

{{Quote|text=One of the WikiLeaks activists owned a server that was being used as a node for the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network]]. Millions of secret transmissions passed through it. The activist noticed that hackers from China were using the network to gather foreign governments' information, and began to record this traffic. Only a small fraction has ever been posted on WikiLeaks, but the initial tranche served as the site's foundation, and Assange was able to say, "[w]e have received over one million documents from thirteen countries."&lt;ref name="Khatchdourian"&gt;{{cite news |first=Raffi |last=Khatchadourian |date=7 June 2010 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian?printable=true |title=No Secrets: Julian Assange's Mission for total transparency |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=8 June 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827012725/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian?printable=true | archivedate = 2011-08-27| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=''[[The New Yorker]]''|sign=Raffi Khatchadourian}}

Assange responded to the suggestion that eavesdropping on Chinese hackers played a crucial part in the early days of WikiLeaks by saying "the imputation is incorrect. The facts concern a 2006 investigation into Chinese espionage one of our contacts was involved in. Somewhere between none and handful of those documents were ever released on WikiLeaks. Non-government targets of the Chinese espionage, such as Tibetan associations were informed (by us)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/02/wikileaks_tor_snooping_denial/ |title=Wikileaks denies Tor hacker eavesdropping gave site its start |author=Leyden, John |work=[[The Register]] |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=10 July 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827012722/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/02/wikileaks_tor_snooping_denial/ | archivedate = 2011-08-27| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian investigative reporter [[Andrei Soldatov]] has criticised WikiLeaks for disclosing documents "without checking of the facts, without putting them in context, and without analysing them." Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is "filling the gap" left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/91880/ |title=Kyiv Post.

On 7 December 2010, ''The Guardian'' stated that people could donate to WikiLeaks via [[Commerzbank]] in Kassel, Germany, or [[Landsbanki]] in Iceland, or by post to a post office box at the [[University of Melbourne]] or at the wikileaks.ch domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= WikiLeaks under attack: the definitive timeline |last=Arthur |first=Charles |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-under-attack-definitive-timeline?intcmp=239 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |place=London | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110626231338/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-under-attack-definitive-timeline?intcmp=239 | archivedate = 2011-06-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2011, WikiLeaks and DataCell ehf. of Iceland filed a complaint against the international card companies, VISA Europe and MasterCard Europe, for infringement of the antitrust rules of the EU, in response to their withdrawal of financial services to the organisation. In a joint press release, the organisations stated: "The closure by VISA Europe and MasterCard of Datcell's access to the payment card networks in order to stop donations to WikiLeaks violates the competition rules of the European Community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/Banking-Blockade.html |title=Press release, 14 July 2011 |publisher=Wikileaks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715204502/https://wikileaks.org/Banking-Blockade.html | archivedate = 2011-07-15| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; DataCell filed a complaint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fink.org/FILES/DataCell_Complaint.pdf |title=Complaint to the EU commission |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the European Commission on 14 July 2011.

=== Response from the financial industry ===
Since the publications of CableGate, WikiLeaks has experienced an unprecedented global financial blockade by major finance companies including MasterCard, Visa and PayPal although there has been no legal accusation of any wrongdoing.

In October 2010, it was reported that the organization [[Moneybookers]], which collected donations for WikiLeaks, had ended its relationship with the website. Moneybookers stated that its decision had been made "to comply with money laundering or other investigations conducted by government authorities, agencies or commissions."&lt;ref name="moneybookers"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks says funding has been blocked after government blacklisting |author=Leigh, David |author2=Evans, Rob |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/14/wikileaks-says-funding-is-blocked |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |place=London | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110626231230/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/14/wikileaks-says-funding-is-blocked | archivedate = 2011-06-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2010, [[Bank of America]] announced it would "not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for Wikileaks," citing "Wikileaks might be engaged in activities... inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments". WikiLeaks responded in a tweet by encouraging their sympathizers who were BoA customers to close their accounts. Bank of America has long been believed to be the target of WikiLeaks' next major release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bank of America stops handling Wikileaks payments |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12028084 |work=BBC News |date=18 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719061238/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12028084 | archivedate = 2011-07-19| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 2010, Bank of America communicated with the law company [[Hunton &amp; Williams]] to stop WikiLeaks. Hunton &amp; Williams assembled a group of security specialists, [[HBGary Federal]], [[Palantir Technologies]], and [[Berico Technologies]].

During 5 and 6 February 2011, the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hacked HBGary's website, copied tens of thousands of documents from HBGary, posted tens of thousands of company emails online, and usurped Barr's Twitter account in [[revenge]]. Some of the documents taken by Anonymous show HBGary Federal was working on behalf of [[Bank of America]] to respond to WikiLeaks' planned release of the bank's internal documents. Emails detailed a supposed business proposal by HBGary to assist Bank of America's law company, [[Hunton &amp; Williams]], and revealed that the companies were willing to violate the law to damage WikiLeaks and Anonymous.

{{Quote|text=CEO Aaron Barr thought he'd uncovered the hackers' identities and like rats, they'd scurry for cover. If he could nail them, he could cover up the crimes H&amp;W, HBGary, and BoA planned, bring down WikiLeaks, [[Decapitation#metaphoric|decapitate]] Anonymous, and place his opponents in prison while collecting a cool fee.

In October 2011, Julian Assange said the financial blockade had destroyed 95% of WikiLeaks' revenues and announced that it was suspending publishing operations in order to concentrate on fighting the blockade and raising new funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/24/wikileaks-suspends-publishing |title=WikiLeaks suspends publishing to fight financial blockade |location=London |work=The Guardian |first1=Esther |last1=Addley |first2=Jason |last2=Deans |date=24 October 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111027005338/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/24/wikileaks-suspends-publishing | archivedate = 2011-10-27| deadurl=no}}, Esther Addley and Jason Deans, ''The Guardian'', 24 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2012, WikiLeaks, shunned by the financial industry and almost insolvent, announced that it had found a new method to accept donations. Accordingly, the [[Fund for the Defense of Net Neutrality]] (FDNN) had agreed to channel contributions via [[Carte Bleue]], and WikiLeaks claimed that contractual obligation would prevent Visa and MasterCard blocking participation with such transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WikiLeaks Reopens Channel For Credit Card Donations, Dares Visa And MasterCard To Block Them Again |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/18/wikileaks-reopens-channel-for-credit-card-donations-dares-visa-and-mastercard-to-block-it-again/ |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Ifjwdhi?url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/18/wikileaks-reopens-channel-for-credit-card-donations-dares-visa-and-mastercard-to-block-it-again/ |archivedate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2014, WikiLeaks announced via [[Twitter]] that the majority of its donations came from (the [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]]) [[Litecoin]] and [[Bitcoin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pete Rizzo (@pete_rizzo_) |url=http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-litecoin-source-wikileaks-donations/ |title=Bitcoin and Litecoin Top Sources of WikiLeaks Donations |publisher=Coindesk.com |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2014-03-02| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140209161435/http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-litecoin-source-wikileaks-donations/ | archivedate = 2014-02-09| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks massive returns from early investment into Bitcoin cryptocurrency has helped the organisation to survive various legal and financial hardships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/wikileaks-google-assange-bitcoin-8000-percent/|title=Massive returns on early Bitcoin investment helped WikiLeaks survive |last=O'Neill P.H.|date=30 July 2014|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, after five years of processing donations on behalf of WikiLeaks, [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]'s board unanimously found that the financial blockade of WikiLeaks by major payment processors was no longer in effect, and severed ties with WikiLeaks as of January 8, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Blake|title=Free press group votes unanimously to stop funding WikiLeaks, citing end of banking blockade|date=December 20, 2017|accessdate=January 4, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/20/wikileaks-set-lose-support-freedom-press-found/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedom.press/news/beyond-blockade/|title=Beyond the blockade|publisher=Freedom of the Press Foundation|date=December 20, 2017|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentary filmmaker [[John Pilger]] wrote an August 2010 editorial in the Australian publication ''[[Green Left Weekly|Green Left]]'' titled "Wikileaks must be defended." In it, Pilger said WikiLeaks represented the interests of "public accountability" and a new form of journalism at odds with "the dominant section ... devoted merely to taking down what cynical and malign power tells it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/45225 |title=John Pilger: Wikileaks must be defended &amp;#124; Green Left Weekly |publisher=Greenleft.org.au |date=29 August 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Ellsberg]], the man who released the [[Pentagon Papers]] in 1971, has been a frequent defender of WikiLeaks. Following the November 2010 release of U.S. [[diplomatic cable]]s, Ellsberg rejected criticism that the site was endangering the lives of U.S. military personnel and intelligence assets stating "not one single soldier or informant has been in danger from any of the WikiLeaks releases.

Australia's most senior and high-profile media professionals expressed their support for WikiLeaks in a letter to Australian Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Statement from Australian Newspaper Editors, Television and Radio Directors |url=http://www.alliance.org.au/documents/101213_letter_wikiLeaks_support.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222021235/http://www.alliance.org.au/documents/101213_letter_wikiLeaks_support.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 December 2010 |work=Alliance Online |publisher=Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance |accessdate=18 December 2010 |date=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was initiated by the Walkley Foundation, who present the yearly [[Walkley Awards]] for Excellence in Journalism. The letter was signed by "the ten members of the Walkley Advisory Board as well as editors of major Australian newspapers and news websites and the news directors of the country's three commercial TV networks and two public broadcasters."  Their position (an extract from the letter) is summarised as follows:

{{quote|In essence, WikiLeaks, an organisation that aims to expose official secrets, is doing what the media have always done: bringing to light material that governments would prefer to keep secret.

It is the media's duty to responsibly report such material if it comes into their possession. To aggressively attempt to shut WikiLeaks down, to threaten to prosecute those who publish official leaks, and to pressure companies to cease doing commercial business with WikiLeaks, is a serious threat to democracy, which relies on a free and fearless press."&lt;ref&gt;Walkeys [http://www.walkleys.com/news/1076/ "Australian Media's Finest Defend Wikileaks" 13 December 2010] The Walkey Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the November 2010 leak of United States diplomatic cables ''[[The Atlantic]]'', in a staff editorial, opined "Wikileaks is a powerful new way for reporters and human rights advocates to leverage global information technology systems to break the heavy veil of government and corporate secrecy that is slowly suffocating the American press." Calling legal and physical threats against WikiLeaks volunteers "shameful" the magazine went on to state, "Not since President Richard Nixon directed his minions to go after Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg and ''New York Times'' reporter Neil Sheehan ... has a working journalist and his source been subjected to the kind of official intimidation and threats that have been directed at Assange and Manning by high-ranking members of the Obama Administration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/12/the-shameful-attacks-on-julian-assange/67440/ |title=The Shameful Attacks on Julian Assange|last=Samuels |first=David |publisher=The Atlantic |date=3 December 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2010, [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned the "blocking, cyber-attacks and political pressure" being directed at WikiLeaks. The organisation is also concerned by some of the extreme comments made by American authorities concerning WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wikileaks hounded? |first= |last= |newspaper=CBS News |date=4 December 2010 |url=http://en.rsf.org/wikileaks-hounded-04-12-2010,38958.html |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December the organisation announced it will host a mirror website for the leaked US diplomatic cables being published by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/reporters-without-borders-to-host-mirror-site-for-wikileaks/s2/a542061/ |title=Reporters Without Borders to host mirror site for WikiLeaks |date=21 December 2010 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article titled "Only WikiLeaks can save US policy" published on the online foreign affairs magazine ''[[The Diplomat]]'', former long-time CIA counter-terrorism expert [[Michael Scheuer]] said the source of interest in WikiLeaks revelations was in the inherent dishonesty of recent U.S. administrations. "In recent years, the US public has had to hear its leaders repeatedly tell Americans that black was white," Scheuer wrote, referencing the presidencies of [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]] and Barack Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-diplomat.com/2010/12/06/only-wikileaks-can-save-obama-policy |title=When WikiLeaks Meets US Policy |publisher=The Diplomat |date=|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evan Hughes, editor-in-chief of [[wired.com]] published his support for WikiLeaks in an online editorial titled "Why WikiLeaks is Good for America." Despite an often contentious relationship between ''Wired'' and WikiLeaks, with the former having been accused by the latter of complicity in the identification and arrest of [[Chelsea Manning]], Hughes argued that "WikiLeaks stands to improve our democracy, not weaken it." He went on to note that "The greatest threat we face right now from WikiLeaks is not the information it has spilled and may spill in the future, but the reactionary response to it that's building in the United States that promises to repudiate the rule of law and our free speech traditions, if left unchecked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/wikileaks-editorial/ |title=Why WikiLeaks Is Good for America &amp;#124; Threat Level |publisher=Wired.com |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2010 |first=Evan |last=Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times reported that over 200 WikiLeaks [[mirror website|mirror sites]] sprang up after some hosting companies cut their services to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/12/06/More-than-200-sites-copy-WikiLeaks-content/UPI-97061291643698/ |title=More than 200 sites copy WikiLeaks content |publisher=UPI.com |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, a group of activists and hackers known as "[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]" called upon supporters to attack sites of companies that oppose WikiLeaks as part of ''[[Operation Avenge Assange]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/latest-updates-on-leak-of-u-s-cables-day-9/#operation-payback-plans-attacks-on-paypal |title=Latest Updates on Leak of U.S. Cables, Day 9 |work=The New York Times |first=Robert |last=Mackey |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; PayPal has been targeted following their decision to stop processing donations for WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/06/anonymous_launches_pro_wikileaks_campaign/ |title=Anonymous attacks PayPal in 'Operation Avenge Assange' |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2010 |first=John |last=Leyden |publisher=The Register |work=theregister.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Operation Avenge Assange manifesto |url=https://uloadr.com/u/4.png |accessdate=7 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213031528/https://uloadr.com/u/4.png |archivedate=13 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg Housh, who previously worked on other projects with Anonymous, said that he had noticed an organised attempt taking place to attack companies that have not supported WikiLeaks.

By then over 1,200 mirror sites had been set up for hosting content no longer accessible at WikiLeaks.com. Anonymous also issued a fresh statement; "While we don't have much of an affiliation with WikiLeaks, we fight for the same reasons. We want transparency, and we counter censorship&amp;nbsp;... This is why we intend to utilise our resources to raise awareness, attack those against, and support those who are helping lead our world to freedom and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.ca.news.yahoo.com/visa-mastercard-targeted-wikileaks-allies.html |title=Visa, MasterCard targeted by WikiLeaks allies |publisher=Beta.ca.news.yahoo.com |date=|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the [[Internet Society]] stated that despite the international concern about the content released by WikiLeaks, "we nevertheless believe it must be subject to the same laws and policies of availability as all Internet sites" and that "free expression should not be restricted by governmental or private controls over computer hardware or software, telecommunications infrastructure, or other essential components of the Internet". ISOC also called for appropriate action to "pursue and prosecute entities (if any) that acted maliciously to take it [WikiLeaks] off the air" because suppressing communication would merely serve to "undermine the integrity of the global Internet and its operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/isoc-wikileaks-attacks-threaten-free-expression-15294 |title=ISOC: WikiLeaks Attacks Threaten Free Expression |first=Sophie |last=Curtis |work= |publisher=Eweek Europe |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729115352/http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/isoc-wikileaks-attacks-threaten-free-expression-15294 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2010 a petition was launched on [[Avaaz]] in support of WikiLeaks, which was signed by over 250 thousand people within the first few hours, the total number went up to 600 thousand by 15 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fr-online.de/politik/spezials/wikileaks---die-enthuellungsplattform/kaempfer-fuer-wikileaks/-/4882932/4910614/-/index.html |title=Kämpfer für Wikileaks |first=Andreas |last=Kraft |work=|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau |language=German |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/assange-granted-bail-in-london-but-not-yet-free-20101215-18x1y.html |title=Assange granted bail in London but not yet free |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=15 December 2010|accessdate=17 December 2010 |first1=Alice |last1=Ritchie |first2=Danny |last2=Kemp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2010, [[Noam Chomsky]] offered his support to protesters across Australia planning to take to the streets in defence of WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/46378|title=Noam Chomsky backs Wikileaks protests in Australia |date=10 December 2010 |work=|publisher=[[Green Left Weekly]] |accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Chomsky criticized the government response, saying, "perhaps the most dramatic revelation ... is the bitter hatred of democracy that is revealed both by the U.S. Government – Hillary Clinton, others – and also by the diplomatic service."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20101130.htm |title=WikiLeaks Cables Reveal "Profound Hatred for Democracy on the Part of Our Political Leadership" |publisher=Noam Chomsky website |accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Randy Credico]] made news for being handcuffed and thrown out of the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner for supporting Assange.&lt;ref&gt;https://sputniknews.com/us/201805011064045655-randy-credico-thrown-out-white-house-press-dinner/&lt;/ref&gt; Randy appeared in an interview with [[Jimmy Dore]] after and described the experience, "I'm really feeling guilty about Julian Assange, being in that room, and everybody here about to be celebrated, CNN... and so I walked into the middle of the room[...] and I went up there before the program actually started. I just couldnt hold back because I didn't want to interrupt the comedian. So i started yelling out to the stage, 'We
should be celebrating and supporting Julian Assange. He's the greatest journalist, god bless..." and so i went to 
about three different spots, as loud as I possibly could bellow out those words, 'We, CNN, all of the news organisations, should be celebrating, and we should be commending Julian Assange. 100% accuracy! he's sacrificing his liberty!'&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180502060506/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaB0WM96NN4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{Criticism section|date=November 2014}}

WikiLeaks has attracted criticism from a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/WikiLeaks-Website-Behind-US-Cable-Leaks-Goes-From-Humble-Start-To-Enemy-Of-Governments-Worldwide/Article/201011415837564?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15837564_WikiLeaks%3A_Website_Behind_US_Cable_Leaks_Goes_From_Humble_Start_To_Enemy_Of_Governments_Worldwide|title=WikiLeaks Revelations Get Global Prominence|date=28 November 2010|first=Richard |last=Williams|publisher=Sky News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 John Young, operator of [[Cryptome]], left his position on the WikiLeaks Board of Directors accusing the group of being a "CIA conduit". Young subsequently retreated from his assertion but has continued to be critical of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2009/10/start/exposed-wikileaks-secrets |title=Exposed: Wikileaks' secrets (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview with [[CNET.com]] Young accused the group of a lack of transparency regarding their fundraising and financial management. He went on to state his belief that WikiLeaks could not guarantee whistleblowers the anonymity or confidentiality they claimed and that he "would not trust them with information if it had any value, or if it put me at risk or anyone that I cared about at risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McCullagh |first=Declan |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20011106-281.html |title=Wikileaks' estranged co-founder becomes a critic (Q&amp;A) &amp;#124; Privacy Inc. – CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked to join their initial advisory board, [[Steven Aftergood]] declined and told TIME that "they have a very idealistic view of the nature of leaking and its impact. They seem to think that most leakers are crusading do-gooders who are single-handedly battling one evil empire or another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1581189,00.html|title=A Wiki for Whistle-Blowers|last=Schmidt|first=Tracy Samantha|date=2007-01-22|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the leaking of the sorority rituals of [[Alpha Sigma Tau]], Steven Aftergood has opined that WikiLeaks "does not respect the rule of law nor does it honor the rights of individuals." Aftergood went on to state that WikiLeaks engages in unrestrained disclosure of non-governmental secrets without compelling public policy reasons and that many anti-corruption activists were opposed to the site's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Aftergood|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Aftergood|title=Wikileaks Fails "Due Diligence" Review|url=https://fas.org/blog/secrecy/2010/06/wikileaks_review.html|work=Secrecy News |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|accessdate=18 December 2010|date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Amnesty International joined several other human rights groups in strongly requesting that WikiLeaks redact the names of Afghan civilians working as U.S. military informants from files they had released, in order to protect them from repercussions. Julian Assange responded by offering Amnesty International the opportunity to assist in the tedious document vetting process. When Amnesty International appeared to express reservations in accepting the offer, Assange stated that he had "no time to deal with people who prefer to do nothing but cover their asses." Other groups that joined Amnesty International in criticising WikiLeaks subsequently noted that, despite their displeasure over the issue of civilian name redaction, they generally appreciated WikiLeaks' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Whalen |first=Jeanne |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703428604575419580947722558 |title=Human Rights Groups Press WikiLeaks Over Data - WSJ.com |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=9 August 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2010 open letter, the non-governmental organisation Reporters Without Borders praised WikiLeaks' past usefulness in exposing "serious violations of human rights and civil liberties" but criticised the group over a perceived absence of editorial control, stating "indiscriminately publishing 92,000 classified reports reflects a real problem of methodology and, therefore, of credibility. Journalistic work involves the selection of information. The argument with which you defend yourself, namely that WikiLeaks is not made up of journalists, is not convincing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/united-states-open-letter-to-wikileaks-founder-12-08-2010,38130.html |title=Reporters Sans Frontières – Open letter to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange: ''A bad precedent for the Internet's future'' |publisher=En.rsf.org |date=|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group subsequently clarified their statement as a criticism of WikiLeaks release procedure and not the organisation itself, stating "we reaffirm our support for Wikileaks, its work and its founding principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/united-states-criticism-of-wikileaks-is-not-a-17-08-2010,38169.html |title=Reporters Sans Frontières – "Criticism of Wikileaks is not a call for censorship or support for the war" |publisher=En.rsf.org |date=|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2010, former Canadian government adviser [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]], while appearing on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] television program "Power &amp; Politics", called for Julian Assange to be killed. "I think Assange should be assassinated," Flanagan stated, before noting to host Evan Solomon, "I'm feeling pretty manly today." Flanagan subsequently retracted his call for the death of Assange while reiterating his opposition to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/12/01/flanagan-wikileaks-assange.html |title=Flanagan regrets WikiLeaks assassination remark |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203052447/http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/12/01/flanagan-wikileaks-assange.html |archivedate=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimitri Soudas]], spokesman to Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], decried Flanagan's comments and said the former Tory strategist's remarks are "simply not acceptable." [[Ralph Goodale]], Deputy Leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in the House of Commons, called Flanagan's remarks "clearly contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/WikiLeaks+founder+professor+Flanagan+comments+criminal/3926597/story.html |title=WikiLeaks founder: U of C professor Flanagan's comments criminal |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207120808/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/WikiLeaks+founder+professor+Flanagan+comments+criminal/3926597/story.html |archivedate=7 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
*{{flag|Australia}}: A [[UMR Research]] December 2010 poll showed that the majority of Australians are against the official government position on WikiLeaks. The findings which were done on 1,000 individuals show 59% support WikiLeaks' action in making the cables public and 25% oppose it. This was asked a few weeks after the initial release of the cables. The poll also looked at issues in relation to Julian Assange, with the results showing a positive opinion on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Strong support for WikiLeaks among Australians |first=Tim |last=Lester |work=The Age |location=Australia | date=6 January 2011 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/strong-support-for-wikileaks-among-australians-20110105-19g8z.html |accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Flag|Germany}}: According to a telephone survey of 1,004 German residents age 18 and older, which was conducted end of November for the German public broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], a majority of 53% disapprove of WikiLeaks, while 43% are generally in favour of the platform. Asked about the specific release of US diplomatic cables, almost two Thirds (65%) believe that these documents should not be published, compared to 31% that agree that they are being released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ARD Deutschland Trend |publisher=[[Infratest dimap]] | pages=5–6 | format=PDF | date=December 2010 |url=http://www.infratest-dimap.de/uploads/media/dt1012_bericht.pdf |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Pakistan}}: A December 2010 a [[Gallup poll]] found that 52% of Pakistanis believe that "America herself has published the documents on purpose to create unrest," while 24% believe that this is not the case and 24% did not respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/wikileaks-cables-deliberately-published-by/730328/ |title=WikiLeaks cables 'deliberately published' by US: Pak survey | date = 28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|United Kingdom}}: A [[CNN International|CNN]] poll of 2,010 British adults conducted in December 2010 revealed that more people agree than disagree that WikiLeaks was right to release the cables, by 42% to 33%. The remaining 25% did not have a position. According to the same poll 41% of Britons believe that Assange should not be prosecuted for releasing the secret diplomatic cables, while 30% do want him prosecuted. Almost half of the respondents (44%) also believe that the sex charges against Assange are "an excuse" to keep him in custody so that the U.S. government can prosecute him for releasing secret diplomatic cables, while only 13% disagree. Nevertheless, almost half of Britons stated that their government should send Assange to Sweden for questioning. Older people were significantly more likely to oppose WikiLeaks. While 42% of persons 65 and older say Assange should be prosecuted for releasing the secret diplomatic cables, this view is only held by 21% of those between 25 and 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Poll: Almost half of Britons feel WikiLeaks sex charges are "excuse" |first=Michael |last=Martinez |publisher=CNN | date=14 December 2010 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/12/13/uk.poll.wikileaks/?hpt=Sbin |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Flag|United States}}: According to a telephone survey of 1,029 US residents age 18 and older, conducted by the [[Marist Institute for Public Opinion]] in December 2010, 70% of American respondents – particularly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and older people – think the leaks are doing more harm than good by allowing enemies of the United States government to see confidential and secret information about U.S. foreign policy. Approximately 22% – especially young [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] – think the leaks are doing more good than harm by making the U.S. government more transparent and accountable. A majority of 59% also want to see the people behind WikiLeaks prosecuted, while 31% said the publication of secrets is protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantee of a free press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=McClatchy-Marist Poll National Survey December 2010 |publisher=[[Marist Institute for Public Opinion]] | pages=21–24 | format=PDF | date=10 December 2010 |url=http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/usapolls/US101202/McClatchy/McClatchy_Marist%20Poll_National%20Survey_December%2010,%202010.pdf |accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rendition''''' is a 2007 work of [[interactive fiction]] by "nespresso", written using [[Inform 7]] and published in [[Z-machine|z-code]] format, in which the player performs an interrogation of a suspected [[terrorist]]. The game describes itself as a "political art experiment in text adventure form". It was submitted to the 2007 [[Interactive Fiction Art Show]] in the "[[Portrait]]" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iffydoemain.org/iffyart/ |title=2007 IF Art Show |date= |website=iffydoemain.org |publisher= |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the seven judges at the art show reported enjoying the game, and many criticised its gameplay, though certain aspects of the game were praised. [[Jon Ingold]] stated that he stopped playing the game shortly after starting it, as he disliked the level of violence, though stated "I think this is all very powerful ... As a demonstration of the power - the impact - that a 'silly little text-game' can have, it works very well."  Another judge stopped playing the game on the same grounds, though commented "in many ways this was a clever idea, a portrait of me and what I am willing to do." Another stated that whilst the game was "painful to explore, the concept [wa]s particularly well-suited to interactive fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iffydoemain.org/iffyart/reviews7.htm |title=Judges' 2007 Reviews |website=iffydoemain.org |publisher= |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was subsequently chosen as game-of-the-day by [[playthisthing]], where it was described by [[Emily Short]] thus:
{{quote|It presents in a single atomic example the emotive power of complicity in gaming and interactive story-telling. When the player reaches the point of questioning his own involvement in a story, that story takes on a new significance, one which is not possible in non-interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Short, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305134441/http://playthisthing.com/rendition Rendition: Quit This Thing], March 4, 2008, PlayThisThing.com as archived by archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She subsequently used the game, along  with ''[[Photopia]]'', as an example of an "approach to tragedy in interactive fiction" at the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s Hypertext 2007 conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/Emily-Short-Tragedy.pdf Interactive Tragedy: Observations from Interactive Fiction] (see slides 10-11, "Complicity") from Emily Short, Hypertext '07 Panel on Hypertext Tragedy with J. Nathan Matias, N. J. Lowe, and Dave Millard.&lt;/ref&gt; It was further discussed in a lecture at [[Cambridge University]] by Jorge Nathan Matias on 5 November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Tragedy &amp; Electronic Literature, web notes and archived audio of lecture at Cambridge University by Jorge Nathan Matias [http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/ full notes in hypertext style] [http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/TragPresentation.html lecture notes in presentation slide style][http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/note.php?id=3273474353&amp;parent=3273474342 Rendition-specific note]&lt;/ref&gt; and was mentioned in a conference paper by Alex Mitchell and [[Nick Montfort]] for the 2009 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nickm.com/if/mitchell_montfort_dac_2009.pdf Shaping Stories and Building Worlds on Interactive Fiction Platforms], Alex Mitchell and [[Nick Montfort]] at the 2009 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32376">The right of expatriates to vote in elections in their country of origin varies depending on the legislation of an expatriate’s country of origin. Some countries (such as [[France]]) grant their expatriate citizens unlimited voting rights, identical to those of citizens living in their home country. Other countries allow expatriate citizens to vote only for a certain number of years after leaving the country, after which they are no longer eligible to vote (e.g. 15 years for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and 25 years for [[Germany]]). Other countries reserve the right vote solely to citizens living in that country, thereby stripping expatriate citizens of their voting rights once they leave their home country (such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], with extremely limited exceptions).

Expatriates' voting rights in local elections sometimes vary within individual countries, usually those with federal systems, such as [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]]. For example, Swiss expatriates originally hailing from certain [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] may vote in elections at cantonal level, while those from other cantons may not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The issue has been raised by [[European Union]] institutions, particularly in relation to citizens of one EU state resident in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/564379/EPRS_IDA(2015)564379_EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=Disenfranchisement of EU citizens resident abroad; Situation in national and European elections in EU Member States |publisher=European Parliamentary Research Service |first=Eva-Maria |last=Poptcheva |date=June 2015 |isbn=978-92-823-7548-8 |doi=10.2861/115885 |issue=PE 564.379 |accessdate=24 April 2018 |id=PE 564.379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, 93 countries allowed their expatriate citizens to vote: 21 [[Africa]]n countries, 13 countries in the [[Americas]], 15 [[Asia]]n countries, 6 [[Oceania|Pacific]] countries and 36 [[Europe]]an countries.&lt;ref name="globalirish"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalirish.ie/issues/emigrant-voting/|title=External voting: a GlobalIrish.ie factsheet {{!}} globalirish.ie – about Irish emigration and the diaspora|website=www.globalirish.ie|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an extensive and thorough research published in 2007 out of researched 214 countries and territories 115 had provisions for external voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/va/onePage|title=Voting from Abroad —|website=aceproject.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voting-from-abroad-the-international-idea-handbook.pdf|title=Voting from Abroad - The International IDEA Handbook|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Country-by-country breakdown ==

=== Australia ===
Australian citizens living abroad may vote if they register to vote within three years of leaving ''and'' intend to return to Australia within six years of leaving. Australians who were under 18 when they left Australia may vote if they intend to return to Australia within six years of their 18th birthday. Voting may be done by post or at an Australian embassy, consulate or high commission. Unlike for Australians living in Australia, voting is not [[Elections in Australia|compulsory]] for expatriate Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/enrolling_to_vote/overseas/|title=Living or going overseas|last=26|first=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street, Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===
Austrian citizens living abroad may vote by post in Austrian presidential and parliamentary [[Elections in Austria|elections]], as well as referendums, with no expiry date. They must enrol on a dedicated foreign voters' register and must renew their registration every ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/content/32/Seite.320510.html|title=Stimmabgabe im Ausland|last=Österreich|first=Republik|website=HELP.gv.at|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
As of 2017, Belgian citizens living abroad can register to vote for elections to the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and the [[European Parliament]]. Once registered in a consular post (which is optional), the person is subject to [[compulsory voting]]. Expatriates cannot vote in regional or local elections.

Originally, the law of 18 December 1998 first gave Belgians living abroad the right to vote in federal elections (i.e. for the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber]] and [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]]). However, the law was inadequate{{clarify|date=August 2018}} and not generally applied.

The law of 7 March 2002 improved the procedure. Belgians abroad could register in a [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipality]] of their choice, determining the constituency in which their vote would be cast. In practice, most votes were cast in the linguistically sensitive [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] constituency.

The [[sixth Belgian state reform]] (ca. 2012), which also abolished the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde constituency and direct Senate elections, replaced the free choice by an objectively defined municipality (where the person last lived, or else further criteria apply).

The law of 17 November 2016 slightly changed the procedure, and also extended the right to vote for [[Elections to the European Parliament|European Parliament elections]] to Belgians living in a non-EU member state. Belgians living in another EU member state already had the right to vote on Belgian lists in European Parliament elections.

On 26 August 2016, the [[Michel Government|cabinet]] also approved the right to vote in regional elections; however, this change is subject to approval by [[Special law|special majority]] in parliament, causing the measure to stall.

=== Brazil ===
[[Brazil]]ian citizens living abroad aged between 18 and 70 must vote, as Brazil's policy of [[compulsory voting]] includes expatriate Brazilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tse.jus.br/eleitor/eleitor-no-exterior/votacao-no-exterior|title=Eleitor no exterior|website=www.tse.jus.br|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting is possible, but not mandatory, for Brazilian expatriates aged over 70 or under 18 (Brazil's minimum [[voting age]] is 16).

=== Canada ===
Canadian citizens living abroad can vote by post if they have lived outside Canada for less than five consecutive years. Only Canadians working for the Canadian government, a Canadian company or an international organisation in which Canada is involved are exempt from this expiry date.

Canadian citizens living abroad who are not eligible to vote by post may still vote regardless of how long they have lived abroad, but only if they return to Canada to vote in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=vote&amp;dir=abro&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e|title=Voting from abroad|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
Chilean expatriates have the right to vote in [[Elections in Chile|presidential elections]] (primaries, first and second round) and national referenda in the consulate where they registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voto de chilenos en el exterior|url=https://www.servel.cl/voto-de-chilenos-en-el-exterior-2/|website=SERVEL|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guía legal sobre: Voto de chilenos en el extranjero|url=http://www.bcn.cl/leyfacil/recurso/voto-de-chilenos-en-el-extranjero|website=Ley Fácil|publisher=Library of the Chilean National Congress|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allowing expatriate Chilean citizens the right to vote was presented by President [[Michelle Bachelet]] and approved by [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]] in August 2016. The [[Chilean presidential primaries, 2017|primaries]] for the [[Chilean general election, 2017|2017 presidential election]] were the first time that expatriates were allowed to vote.

=== Colombia ===

Regardless of their time living abroad, [[Colombia]]n expatriates enjoy full voting rights in national referendums, presidential and parliamentary elections. One member of the [[House of Representatives (Colombia)|House of Representatives]] comes from the international constituency and is elected exclusively by citizens living abroad. In order to vote, Colombian citizens have to register in their respective consulate or embassy in the established periods before the election dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los colombianos residentes en el exterior ya pueden acercarse a la embajada o consulado más cercano y realizar la inscripción de la cédula para participar en las Elecciones de 2018 |url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/newsroom/news/colombianos-residentes-exterior-ya-pueden-acercarse-embajada-o-consulado-cercano|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costa Rica===

Costa Rican citizens can vote for president and national referendums regardless of their time living abroad since Electoral Code's reform of 2010. They can't, however, vote in local elections which includes deputies and municipal authorities. The first time this was implemented was in the [[Costa Rican general election, 2014]]. Costa Ricans vote in the respective consulate or embassy and have to register their location a year before the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arias|first1=L|title=Ticos living abroad can now register online to vote in 2018|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/11/04/ticos-abroad-vote|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=The Tico Times|date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarado|first1=Laura|title=Costa Rican Embassy in the United States Explains How to Vote in the 2018 Elections|url=https://news.co.cr/costa-rica-embassy-united-states-regarding-2018-presidential-elections/70208/|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=The Costa Rica Star|date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[France|French]] citizens living abroad enjoy full voting rights in presidential and parliamentary [[Elections in France|elections]], regardless of how long they have lived abroad.

France has a dedicated [[Assembly of French Citizens Abroad]], the president of which is the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Foreign Minister]]. France also has a system of 11 [[constituencies for French residents overseas]], each of which are represented by a deputy who sits in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].

=== Germany ===
Article 12(2)(1) of the Federal Voting Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bwahlg/__12.html|title=BWahlG - Einzelnorm|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that [[Germany|German]] citizens who live abroad and have no residence in Germany may vote in German [[Elections in Germany|parliamentary elections]] and European Parliament elections if:

a)     they have resided in Germany for an uninterrupted period of at least three months since their 14th birthday and within the last 25 years; or

b)     they have a close personal and direct relationship with German politics and are personally affected by political developments in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.konsularinfo.diplo.de/wahlen|title=Auswärtiges Amt Berlin - Allgemeine Informationen zur Wahlteilnahme aus dem Ausland|website=www.konsularinfo.diplo.de|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Expatriate [[India]]n citizens have been allowed to vote in all [[Elections in India|Indian elections]] since 2010, provided that they have not acquired the citizenship of another country (India does not permit [[Multiple citizenship|dual nationality]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/nri/FAQ.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=Electoral Commission of India|first=|date=|website=|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===

At most [[elections in the Republic of Ireland]] the [[electoral register]] is based on residential address, and the only nonresident voters are those serving abroad on government business; this includes  [[Irish diplomatic missions|Irish diplomats]] and their spouses, and [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] and [[Garda Síochána]] personnel but not their spouses.&lt;ref name="globalirish" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oireachtas All-party committee on the Constitution|title=Seventh Progress Report: Parliament |url=https://www.constitution.ie/Documents/Oireachtas%207th-Report-Parliament%202002.pdf#pages=40|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020173339/https://www.constitution.ie/Documents/Oireachtas%207th-Report-Parliament%202002.pdf#pages=40|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-10-20|format=PDF|year=2002|pages=40–59 : 55 |chapter=Chapter 4: Northern Ireland and emigrant participation in national political life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/registering_to_vote.html|title=Registering to vote|date=29 March 2018|pages=Overseas voters |nopp=Y|accessdate=23 April 2018 |publisher=Citizens Information Board |location=Dublin }}; {{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/23/enacted/en/print#sec7|title=Electoral Act, 1992|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|nopp=Y|pages=ss.7–14|accessdate=23 April 2018}}; {{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/military-spouses-living-abroad-are-denied-vote-26290967.html|title=Military spouses living abroad are denied vote|last=Brady|first=Tom|date=16 May 2007|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=23 April 2018}}; {{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2004032500013|title=Other Questions [9344/04] — Postal Voting|date=25 March 2004|work=Dáil Éireann Debates|publisher=Oireachtas|nopp=Y|pages=Vol.582 No.5 p.13 cc.1343–1344|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is in elections to the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] (upper house) for which graduates voting in the [[university constituency|university constituencies]] ([[National University of Ireland (constituency)|National University of Ireland]] and [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]]) may be nonresident.&lt;ref name="globalirish" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Work_Of_The_Department/Protocol/Working_Group_on_Seanad_Reform/FINAL_Seanad_Reform_web_version.pdf#page=45 |format=PDF|title=Report|author=Working Group On Seanad Reform|year=2015|page=44|quote=non-resident graduates can register to vote in the university members elections at present |accessdate=23 April 2018}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1937/act/30/enacted/en/print#sec7|title=Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act, 1937|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|nopp=Y|pages=ss 7, 20|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expatriates intending to return to Ireland within eighteen months may retain their Irish address for electoral purposes, but must be present to vote in person.&lt;ref&gt;Oireachtas All-party committee on the Constitution p.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hometovote_ireland"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hickey|first1=Shane|title=The vote: returning emigrants warned of 18-month rule|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/the-vote-returning-emigrants-warned-of-18-month-rule-1.3505885|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=The Irish Times|date=24 May 2018}}; {{cite news|last1=Kenny|first1=Ciara|title=Illegal emigrant voting: How #HometoVote could backfire|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/illegal-emigrant-voting-how-hometovote-could-backfire-1.3385321|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=The Irish Times|date=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1990s there have been proposals to allow emigrants to vote in elections to the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] (lower house) or Seanad, generally via a dedicated ([[single transferable vote]] multi-seat) [[constituency]].&lt;ref name="Honohan2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Honohan|first=Iseult|year=2011|title=Should Irish Emigrants have Votes?

=== Italy ===
{{Main|Overseas constituencies of Italian Parliament}}
[[Italy|Italian]] citizens living abroad retain the right to vote in Italian [[Elections in Italy|parliamentary elections]]. They may vote either by post or at an Italian consulate or embassy. However, for Italian citizens who live in a country which has no Italian diplomatic representation, the only way to vote is to travel to Italy to vote in person. Citizens who choose to do so are reimbursed by the Italian government for 75% of their travel costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conslondra.esteri.it/Consolato_Londra/Menu/I_Servizi/Per_i_cittadini/Servizi_elettorali/Elezioni_politiche/|title=Consolato Generale d'Italia in Londra|website=www.conslondra.esteri.it|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
[[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizens living abroad may vote, with no expiry date, in [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] for the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] (lower house of parliament) and in federal referendums, provided that they register with the relevant Swiss representation abroad.

=== Tunisia ===
[[Tunisia]]n expatriates have been granted the right to vote in presidential elections since 1988, and additionally in parliamentary elections since the [[Tunisian Revolution]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40878-016-0034-y|title=Thibaut Jaulin, Geographies of external voting: the Tunisian elections abroad since the 2011 Uprising, Comparative Migration Studies, Springer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[United Kingdom|British]] citizens living abroad may vote in [[Elections in the United Kingdom|UK general elections]], [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|referendums]] and [[Elections to the European Parliament|European Parliament elections]] for up to 15 years after leaving the UK. However, they may only do so if they were [[Electoral registration in the United Kingdom|registered to vote]] in the UK while living there. British expatriates who were under 18 at the time of leaving the UK may vote as long as their parent or guardian was registered to vote in the UK.

British expatriates are not allowed to vote in local elections or in elections for the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] or [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh]] or [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Irish Assemblies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register-to-vote/british-citizens-living-abroad|title=Overseas voters|last=Commission|first=The Electoral|website=www.aboutmyvote.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the Overseas Electors Bill was presented to Parliament, with a view to abolishing the 15-year limit and the requirement to have registered to vote before leaving the UK. This would grant all British expatriates the unlimited right to vote, as long as they have lived in the UK at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-delivering-on-pledge-to-give-back-british-expats-the-right-to-vote|title=Government delivering on pledge to give back British expats the right to vote - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chloe-smith-writes-about-votes-for-life-for-british-expats|title=Chloe Smith writes about votes for life for British expats - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue became a hotly debated topic among British expatriates who have lived in other EU Member States for more than 15 years and were thus barred from voting in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on European Union membership]], despite arguably being more affected by the result than British people living in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20180209/uk-again-vows-to-give-brits-in-france-votes-for-life-but-is-it-too-late|title=UK again vows to give Brits in France 'votes for life' but is it all too late?|date=2018-02-09|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Reese''' (10 March 1921 – 25 October 1990) was an [[African Americans|African American]]-Norwegian singer, writer and civil rights activist. She was one of the first prominent black singers in Norway and was actively involved in the international fight against racism. Over several decades, she contributed significantly to the understanding of African American history and music in Norway.&lt;ref name=kk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/norway/varden/20130920/282986807628587|title=Kristin arvet både kunnskap og Noter av Ruth Reese|publisher=''Varden''|date=20 September 2013|accessdate=8 March 2018 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ruth Reese was born on 10 March 1921 in [[Hayneville, Alabama]] to Sarah (née Hunter) and William Reese.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|''The Anniston Star''|1990|p=8}} In her childhood, the family moved to [[Chicago]], where Reese attended school and sang in the church choir. Without adequate funds to pursue music studies, she worked as a domestic after school to pay for music lessons. After completing her secondary studies,{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}} Reese attended [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] earning a bachelor's degree in music.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}

==Career==
After her graduation, Reese first worked as a physical training instructor and choir director at Madden Park,{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1940a|p=40}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1940b|p=6}} before being hired as a substitute teacher{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1948|p=19}} Throughout the 1940s, Reese performed in the Chicago area, entering musical contests, winning several local awards,{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1946|p=2}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1948|p=19}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1949|p=185}} and earning promising reviews.{{sfn|Cassidy|1947|p=13}}  In 1949, she appeared in the role of ''Mougali'' in the premiere performance of the opera ''Ouanga'' by [[Clarence Cameron White]].{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}}{{sfn|Cheatham|2004}} Earning acclaim and a scholarship for her performance, Reese moved to New York City, to continue her voice training with [[Léon Rothier]] and [[Lawrence Benjamin Brown|Lawrence Brown]].{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}}

After her concert debut in 1952, Reese moved to England and studied [[Amanda Aldridge]]. Her European debut was at the [[Gaveau#Salle Gaveau|Salle Gaveau]] in Paris in 1953.{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}} Though classically-trained, she gained her reputation from performing [[Spiritual (music)|Spirituals]], [[Gospel music]] and the [[Blues]] with their roots in African-American tradition.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|''The Anniston Star''|1990|p=8}} Touring Europe, she performed both on stage and on the airwaves in Czechoslovakia, England, France, Israel, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and throughout Scandinavia.{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}} In 1956, she first came in Norway and drew attention for the color of her skin, often billed as a ''negersangerinne'' (black singer). At the time in Norway, the society viewed itself as [[homogeneous]]ly white and had not recognized its indigenous or national minority populations. Reese found similar situations to those she had experienced in the United States, when she was denied lodging numerous times. She persevered, making a name for herself and fell in love.{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 1960, she permanently settled in [[Oslo]], Norway and two years later married he bookstore owner Paul Shetelig.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}

Reese began publishing about racial issues in newspapers like the ''[[Dagbladet]]''. In a piece published in 1959, ''Vår hud er sort'' (Our Skin is Black), she addressed the Norwegian indifference to [[Racism|racist policies]] in the United States or South Africa, such as the selling of South African fruits and wines, and began to draw awareness of the problems Africans and black people faced. Public debate on race began for the first time, the University sponsored a series of talks ''Racism and Democracy'', and in 1960, the national trade union proposed a boycott on South African goods. Reese actively took part in the movement to raise awareness, giving a lecture ''De amerikanske negrenes musikkhistorie gjennom 360 år'' (The American Negro's Music History Through 360 Years) throughout the country,{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} in which she explained the difference between Spirituals and Classical music. She felt that to be properly performed, Spirituals could not be sung by white interpreters because "[t]he tones are created in tears. One must feel this pain in the soul to make it sound right".{{sfn|Larsen|2009}} In 1963, to show solidarity with President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights|Civil Rights Agenda]] and the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], Reese collected signatures on a petition and led supporters in a march to the Oslo home of the American ambassador.{{sfn|Kelley|Tuck|2015|p=24}}

In addition to her activism, Reese continued to perform throughout Norway and had wide popularity. She was one of the first black artists to become established in Norway and was a major contributor to the spread of African music in the country. In 1972, a collection of her writings was published in Norwegian, ''Lang svart vei'' (Long Black Road) and in 1979, she released an album ''Motherless Child'' in 1979.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 1985, she published her autobiography, ''Min vei'' (My Way), in which she acknowledged that her activism had impacted her career, but was unapologetic for speaking for those who could not "express their despair".{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 1990, she produced the short film ''Pride of Black Dreams'' which presented a brief history of African American through song and dance. It was shown widely in schools and on [[NRK]] Television.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|1990}}

==Death and legacy==
Reese died on 25 October 1990 while giving an address against racism to the organization SOS Rasisme at a gathering being held in Oslo in her honor.{{sfn|''The Anniston Star''|1990|p=8}} Reese's archives were left to her student [[Kristin Asbjørnsen]], who has made recordings in honor of her teacher.{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 2013, Asbjørnsen explained that it had taken her many years to absorb the underlying messages from the lengthy notes and old recordings she had received. Only then was she ready to release albums inspired by Reese's approach.&lt;ref name=kk/&gt;

School feeding programs have been defined by the World Bank as "targeted social safety nets that provide both educational and health benefits to the most vulnerable children, thereby increasing enrollment rates, reducing absenteeism, and improving [[food security]] at the household level".&lt;ref name="scaling" /&gt; Beyond improvements in access to food, school feeding programs also have a positive impact on nutritional status, gender equity, and educational status, each of which contributes to improving overall levels of country and human development. 

While [[school meals]] are provided by the governments of most high and middle-income countries around the globe, the children who may benefit most from school feeding programs are in low-income countries that do not have government-provided school meals. School feeding in low-income countries often starts through funding by international organizations such as the [[United Nations World Food Programme]] or the [[World Bank]] or national governments through programs such as the [[McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program]]. However, some governments have first started school-feeding programs and then requested the help of these organizations and programs. Additionally, many countries have "graduated" from their dependency on foreign assistance by reshaping their school feeding programs to be country-led and self-supported.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web|last=Bundy|first=Donald|title=Rethinking School Feeding|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099080042112/DID_School_Feeding.pdf|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are school feeding programs in a number of countries, each program varies widely from country to country in design, implementation, and evaluation. Thus, literature reviews and studies often focus on a small number of countries, as school feeding is not a uniform unit of intervention and cannot be compared or assessed on an international scale.

==Need for school feeding programs==

According to the United Nations World Food Programme, 66 million primary school age children go hungry every day, with 23 million hungry children in [[Africa]] alone.&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|year=2009|title=School Meals|url=http://www.wfp.org/school-meals|publisher= World Food Programme.|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 80% of these 66 million children are concentrated within just 20 countries. Additionally, 75 million school-age children (55% of them girls) do not attend school, with 47% of them living in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="web.worldbank"&gt;{{cite web|year=2013|title=Education|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/0,,contentMDK:23262014~pagePK:51123644~piPK:329829~theSitePK:29708,00.html|publisher=The World Bank.|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the need to reduce hunger while increasing school enrollment in these children is evident, and school feeding programs have been developed to target this multifaceted problem. 

Schools have become a natural and convenient setting for the implementation of health and education interventions. School feeding is just one facet of school health initiatives, as other programs may include de-worming, [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention and education, and life and health skills education. Overall, school feeding programs have been shown to directly increase the educational and nutritional status of recipient children, and indirectly impact the economic and social lives of themselves and their family.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Additionally, school feeding directly addresses the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) of reducing hunger by one-half, achieving universal primary education, and achieving gender parity in education by 2015.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web|year=2013|title=Millennium Development Goals|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|publisher=The United Nations.|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of school feeding programs==

There are two main ways to distribute food through school feeding programs: on-site meals and take-home rations.&lt;ref name="wfp" /&gt; On-site meals are foods that are distributed to children while at school during morning and afternoon meal and snack times, which may include a bowl of porridge or nutrient-fortified crackers. Take-home rations are a collection of basic food items, such as a bag of rice and a bottle of cooking oil, which may be sent home and transferred to the families of children who regularly attend school.&lt;ref name="wfp" /&gt;

While the food items needed for school feeding programs may be imported into the country from anywhere throughout the world, an increasing number of countries and organizations are looking to expand what is called "home-grown school feeding," which requires that provided food is produced and purchased within a country to the greatest extent possible. These programs provide an opportunity for children to receive improved nutrition and educational opportunities while also allowing smallholder farmers to benefit from access to a market with stable, structured, and predictable demand.&lt;ref name="hg1"&gt;{{cite web|year=2013|title=Global Home Grown School Feeding|url=http://hgsf-global.org|publisher=The Partnership for Child Development|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hg2"&gt;{{cite web|title=WFP Home Grown School Feeding|url=http://www.wfp.org/content/home-grown-school-feeding|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) guided governments in Sub-Saharan Africa to include home-grown school feeding as a critical intervention for the food security facet of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). Several countries, including Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali and Nigeria are currently taking part in home-grown school feeding programs.&lt;ref name="trialsjournal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masset|first=Edoardo and Aulo Gelli.|year=2013|title=Improving community development by linking agriculture, nutrition and education: design of a randomised trial of "home-grown" school feeding in Mali|url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/55|publisher=Trials|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to school feeding==

===Country involvement in school feeding programs===
[[File:Vrindavan SMS-518.jpg|thumb|School feeding program in India]]

According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, there are five stages of school feeding. The first stage includes school feeding programs that rely mostly on external funding and implementation, while the last stage includes school feeding programs that rely mostly on internal government funding and implementation.&lt;ref name=IFP&gt;{{cite web|last=Bundy|first=Donald|title=Rethinking School Feeding - Directions in Development Paper|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/DBundyppt.pdf|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|year=2009|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that are within the first stage include Afghanistan and Sudan, where country governments are unable to lead school feeding programs. Countries that are within the fifth stage include Chile and India, which have functional, country-led school feeding programs. For example, the Government of Chile has provided a school feeding program for over 40 years through the La Junta Nacional de Auxilio Escolar y Becas (National Board of School Assistance and Scholarships) through a public-private partnership.&lt;ref name="winch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Winch|first=Rachel.|year=2011|title=International Approaches to School Feeding|url=http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Rachel_Winch_International_Approaches_to_School_Feeding.pdf|publisher=US Food Aid and Security|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program involves technology that allows food to be centrally mass-produced and then distributed across the country.  Additionally, the Government of India has supported school feeding programs since 2001, when the country recognized Indians' Constitutional Right to Food.&lt;ref name="winch"/&gt; Countries that are in the middle of the stages, such as Kenya and Ecuador may have some but not all of the governmental policies, financial capacities, or institutional capacities to operate school feeding programs without external funding or implementation.

===Involvement of the World Food Programme===

In terms of external funding and implementation, the [[United Nations World Food Programme]] (WFP) is the world's leading provider of school feeding program financial contributions and program development. WFP currently provides school feeding resources to an average of 22 million children in school, about half of whom are girls, across 70 countries. The total financial contribution for these programs is almost USD$500 million per year.&lt;ref name="wfp" /&gt; Many governments work alongside WFP in school-feeding programs, though in countries where the government is non-functional or corrupt, WFP may work on its own or with other [[non-governmental organizations]]. The World Food Programme has estimated that US$3.2 billion is needed each year to feed the 66 million school-age children around the globe, an amount of US$50 per child.&lt;ref name="wfp"/&gt; 

WFP has been working with governments around the world for over 45 years, but is shifting from a food aid organization to food assistance organization, working to move away from "individual, isolated projects to more strategic and comprehensive approaches".&lt;ref name=standards&gt;{{cite web|title=New Approach and Quality Standards|url=http://www.wfp.org/our-work/preventing-hunger/school-meals/new-approach-quality-standards|publisher=World Food Programme|accessdate=8 April 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To foster government ownership of school meals, WFP has implemented eight quality standards that guide the design and implementation of sustainable school meal programs:
* A strategy for sustainability, 
* A national policy framework
* Stable funding and budgeting
* Needs-based, cost-effective quality programme design
* Strong institutional arrangements for implementation, monitoring, and accountability
* Strategy for local production and sourcing
* Strong partnerships
* Inter-sector coordination, and community participation and ownership.&lt;ref name="standards"/&gt;

==Benefits of school feeding==

===Nutrition and food security===
School meals have been shown to increase the nutritional status of school-age children in a variety of ways. For example, there is a notable reduction in malnutrition via diet diversification and an increased absorption of micronutrients. Overall, the amount of kilocalories in a child's diet is expanded when they are given nutritional resources that they would otherwise have little to no access to. By increasing the amount of nutrition a child receives at school, that child's family's nutrition status also increases as their familial demand and requirement for food is decreased.&lt;ref name=lawson&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Ty M.|title=Impact of School Feeding Programs on Educational, Nutritional, and Agricultural Development Goals|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/142466/2/2012LawsonPlanB.pdf|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=18 March 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeted take-home rations therefore increase the nutrition of the family as a whole, and not just the members of a given family that are of primary-school age. However, criticisms of school meals' impacts on nutrition stem from the idea that increased nutrition through school meals is only a temporary fix and does not target the underlying causes of malnutrition, such as high food prices and poor food distribution systems that prevent [[food security]].&lt;ref name="tomlin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tomlinson|first=Mark|year=2007|title=School Feeding in East and Southern Africa: Improving Food Sovereignty or Photo Opportunity?|url=http://www.equinetafrica.org/bibl/docs/DIS46nutTOMLINSON.pdf|publisher=Regional Network for Equity in Health in Southern Africa|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Feeding Program (Mabalacat Resettlement Elementary School July 14, 2014).jpg|thumb|School feeding program in Mabalacat Resettlement Elementary School]]
Education is a key component in school feeding programs and global development because overall, a more educated person has an increased amount of opportunities in life, earns more money, and has a higher standard of living than an uneducated individual.&lt;ref name="SFworldbank"&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|title=Do School Feeding Programs Help Children?|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/10418/665440BRI0Scho00Box365769B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; School meals greatly impact recipient children's education status by increasing school enrollment and attendance, decreasing drop-out rates, and improving cognitive abilities and learning achievements.&lt;ref name="trialsjournal" /&gt; Generally, sending children to a school in which school-meals are served offsets the financial and opportunity costs of schooling, and thus families are incentivized to send their children to school.&lt;ref name="lawson"/&gt; Additionally, school feeding programs may serve as an incentive for students to go to school to receive food rather than missing out on food by staying home.&lt;ref name=pak&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Touseef|title=Food for Education Improves Girls' Education: The Pakistan Girls' Education Programme|url=http://www.schoolsandhealth.org/sites/ffe/Key%20Information/Food%20for%20Education%20Improves%20Girls%E2%80%99%20Education__The%20Pakistan%20Girls%E2%80%99%20Education%20Programme.pdf|publisher=Schools and Health|accessdate=18 March 2013|year=2007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increased nutrition status of children, as a result of school feeding programs, also enhances students' cognitive abilities and performance in school.

===Gender equity===
School feeding programs have the capacity to increase gender equity in access to education, which allows for gender equity across all spheres of social and economic life. There are a variety of reasons that girls' education is impacted by factors on both the supply and demand side of schooling. These include gender-stereotyped curriculum and teaching practices, increased risks for girls' safety outside of the house, socio-cultural practices that cause girls' education to hold a very low value, and school infrastructure that is not suitable for girls.&lt;ref name="pak"/&gt; Due to the combination of such barriers, girls are disproportionately affected by the direct and [[opportunity cost]] of schooling, which prevents girls from very poor households from attending school.&lt;ref name="pak"/&gt; Opportunity costs for girls' education include lost time that would otherwise be spent doing household chores and [[care work]]. School feeding programs reduce the costs of sending girls to school and allow for an increased number of girls to be sent to school by their families. Furthermore, improvements in female literacy that come from increased education have been linked to declining rates of fertility, increased economic opportunities, and other markers of female empowerment.

==Drawbacks and challenges to school feeding==

While school feeding programs have a variety of positive impacts, there are some possible negative impacts these programs can cause. For example, school feeding programs can increase the cost of schooling by requiring that communities provide fire-wood for cooking as well as other items such as fresh-fruit, vegetables, and condiments. Additionally, communities are also expected to provide people who can cook these meals and maintain stores of all of the required food products, as well as kitchens and other fundamentals of meal provision.&lt;ref name="trialsjournal" /&gt; By causing a variety of needs and requirements to increase in a given community, the net benefit to a community from school feeding programs may be reduced. 

School feeding programs are very context-specific, and each community's program must be altered based on the demographics, geography, and other patterns within and outside of schools. For this reason, there are a variety of challenges that emerge in the creation and implementation of school feeding programs. A successful program requires that countries:
* Determine if school feeding is the most effective program to target needy children
* Define program goals and outcomes
* Select the type of food to serve
* Determine a food procurement method
* Plan for management, implementation, and monitoring within schools—and a variety of other concerns&lt;ref name="scaling"&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|title=Scaling Up School Feeding|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/0,,contentMDK:22705274~menuPK:282424~pagePK:64020865~piPK:149114~theSitePK:282386,00.html|publisher=The World Bank and World Food Programme|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because school feeding programs are community-specific and require a great deal of planning, the sustainability of school feeding programs is a main point of concern for many countries. Countries are very limited on the demands placed on the staff, resources, and infrastructure required for school-feeding programs, and often have to rely on outside financial and personnel help to continue programs for a significant amount of time.

==Results of school feeding programs in low-income countries==

Though school feeding produces a variety of anticipated impacts, as mentioned above, much research and evaluation is being done to determine the results of school feeding programs in low-income countries. School feeding program results are often context-specific, but lessons from a variety of communities can help evaluate school feeding program effectiveness. Researchers at the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] have critically assessed evidence from developing countries to define preliminary results of these programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelman|first=Sarah|title=How Effective Are Food for Education Programs? A Critical Assessment of the  Evidence from Developing Countries|year=2008|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/pubs/fpreview/pv09/pv09.pdf|author2=Daniel Gilligan|author3=Kim Lehrer|accessdate=13 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514024942/http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/pubs/fpreview/pv09/pv09.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These assessments found that the timing of meals is not a critical factor in the positive effects on learning and cognition, and thus take-home rations can perform as well as in-school meals, and that in-school meals may even disrupt learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilligan|first=Daniel|title=How Effective Are School Feeding Programs?|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/DGilliganppt.pdf|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|accessdate=13 April 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some settings, take-home rations are more cost-effective than in-school meals, and the study argued that some country programs may be optimized by focusing resources on take-home rations. Additionally, it was found that in the study setting, school attendance improved learning more significantly than nutrition status improvements, but that school feeding programs encouraged attendance and still have a positive net result on education levels. In a study done by Patrick J. McEwan, it was shown that there is no evidence that higher-calorie meals positively impact school enrollment and attendance, first-grade enrollment age and grade repetition, and fourth-grade test scores over average-calorie school feeding meals in Chile's national program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McEwan|first=Patrick|title=The impact of Chile's school feeding program on education outcomes|journal=Economics of Education Review|date=February 2013|volume=32|pages=122–139|url=http://academics.wellesley.edu/Economics/mcewan/PDF/meals.pdf|accessdate=13 April 2013|doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2012.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, McEwan's study suggested that Chilean policy, to produce significant positive results, should focus more on the nutritional composition of school meals, rather than caloric content alone.

==Federal SoSP Effort==
The [[federal government of the United States]] has long been a supporter of SoSP. In 2006, in response to [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] Director Dr. [[John H. Marburger]]’s challenge for a new "science of science policy," the [[National Science and Technology Council]]'s Subcommittee on Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) established an Interagency Task Group on Science of Science Policy (ITG) to serve as part of the internal deliberative process of the Subcommittee. In 2008, the SoSP ITG developed and published The Science of Science Policy: A Federal Research Roadmap, which outlined the Federal efforts necessary for the long-term development of a science of science policy, and presented this Roadmap to the SoSP Community. The ITG’s subsequent work has been guided by the questions outlined in the Roadmap and the action steps developed at the workshop. Furthermore, since 2007, the [[National Science Foundation]], in support of academic research to advance the field, has awarded grants from the [http://1.usa.gov/scisipsol Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP)] program. The SciSIP research supports and complements the Federal SoSP efforts by providing new tools with immediate relevance to policymakers.

==Science of Science and Innovation Policy program==
The Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program was established at the National Science Foundation in 2005 in response to a call from [[John Marburger]] for a "specialist scholarly community" to study the science of science policy. The program has three major goals: advancing [[Evidence-based policy|evidence-based]] science and [[innovation]] policy decision making; building a scientific community to study science and innovation policy; and leveraging the experience of other countries. 

Between 2007 and 2011, [http://1.usa.gov/scisip over one hundred and thirty awards] were made in five rounds of funding. The awardees include [[economist]]s, [[sociologist]]s, [[political scientist]]s, and [[psychologist]]s. Some of these awards are already showing results in the form of papers, presentations, software, and data development.

The '''Scottish Land Commission''' ({{lang-gd|Coimisean Fearainn na h-Alba}}) was established by the [[Scottish Government]] following the passage of the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016]] by the [[Scottish Parliament]]; the Commission also incorporates the work of the '''Tenant Farming Commissioner'''. The Lands Commissioners, who constitute the Commission, have functions relating to land in Scotland, so that they address issues which relate to [[Land tenure|ownership of land]], [[Land law|land rights]], [[Land management|management of land]], and [[Land use|use of land]]. The Tenant Farming Commissioner has the aim of improving the relationship between [[tenant farmer]]s and [[land owner]]s, and can create codes of practice, provide practical guidance, and must consult on such matters. The Tenant Farming Commissioner cannot be an agricultural landlord or agricultural tenant, and will develop codes of practice which are in addition to the law and the jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Land Court]].

The Scottish Land Commission is a body concerned with looking at the concentration of land ownership, land taxation, and effective use of land for the common good. The Commission will also provide some scrutiny of those laws and policies that relate to land within Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/roseanna-cunningham-land-commission-will-mean-end-“stop-start-nature-land-reform” |title=Roseanna Cunningham: Land Commission will mean an end to the “stop-start nature of land reform” |first=Liam |last=Kirkaldy |work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood]] |date=23 September 2016 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2013 [[Richard Lochhead]] {{postnominals|GBR|MSP}}, then [[Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy and Connectivity|Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment]], announced the launch of the Agricultural Holdings Review, which would examine the situation of land ownership and use, tenant-owner relationships, and all of the relevant legislation. The Review published its final report in January 2015, and the recommendations were put out to consultation.
&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite report | author      =  | author-link = | authors     = | date        = January 2015 | title       = Review of Agricultural Holdings Legislation Final Report | url         = http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0046/00468852.pdf | publisher   = Scottish Government | format      = PDF | location    = Edinburgh | access-date = 25 April 2017 | quote =&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final report Richard Lochead noted the importance of the relationships between landowners and tenants for the future of agriculture in Scotland, stating,
{{Quote|What we heard confirms to us that the future of the sector depends on productive relationships between tenants and landlords based on mutual trust, respect and confidence in the sector.|Ministerial Forward|Review of Agricultural Holdings Legislation Final Report&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;{{rp|3}}}}

Following the responses to the consultation the [[Scottish Government]] presented the ''Land Reform (Scotland) Bill'' to the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 22 June 2015. The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 16 March 2016, and received Royal Assent on 22 March 2016 becoming [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/90675.aspx|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Bill|date=18 June 2015|website=www.parliament.scot|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was criticised during its passage by the [[Committees of the Scottish Parliament|Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee]] of the Scottish Parliament on the basis that it granted a significant power to [[Scottish Ministers|Scottish Minister]] to implement much of the details of the Act through [[Scottish Statutory Instrument|secondary legislation]] and delegated powers. Turcan Connell identified concerns around the implementation of the Act and the amount of scrutiny the detailed law would receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.turcanconnell.com/media/constitutional-issues/scottish-land-reform/articles/2016/04/land-reform-update-april-2016/|title=Land Reform Update - April 2016|publisher=Turcan Connell|website=Turcan Connell|language=en|date=27 April 2016|access-date=25 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426055558/https://www.turcanconnell.com/media/constitutional-issues/scottish-land-reform/articles/2016/04/land-reform-update-april-2016/|archive-date=26 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2016 concerns were also raised by Scottish Land and Estates about the passage of the Land Reform Bill, the body that represents Scotland's rural landowners, who felt that the good that landowners did was ignored in favour of "being radical". Scottish Land and Estates, further asserted that how land is used is as important as who owns that land. [[Aileen McLeod]] {{postnominals|GBR|MSP}}, as [[Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform|Minister for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform]] addressed the members of Scottish Land and Estates, who recognised the expertise of land owners in managing land, affirming that the intention is bring about balance in the tenant/land owner relationship, and to ensure everyone who has stake in land ownership and management is involved. She stated the Bill was about spreading good practice around Scotland,
{{Quote|There are many good examples of communities and landowners working together for mutual benefit, and a key aim of the Bill will be to encourage wider adoption of good practice. ... I recognise the expertise and role of land owners in managing land, and the contribution that many landowners make to our economy at both a local and national level.|Aileen McLeod|Speech to Scottish Land and Estates&lt;ref name="mcleod-speed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://countryside-alliance.org/scot/ca-scotland-news/dr-aileen-mcleod-address-to-scottish-land-owners|title=Dr Aileen McLeod address to Scottish Land Owners - Scottish Countryside Alliance|website=countryside-alliance.org|language=en|date=1 March 2016|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Libby Brooks, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper on 17 March 2016, reported dissatisfaction with the new law from the [[Scottish Green Party]] for not being radical enough. [[Andy Wightman]] {{postnominals|GBR|MSP}}, land reform spokesperson for the Scottish Green Party, was disappointed that the Land Reform (Scotland) Act did not outlaw the ownership of Scottish land by [[Offshore company|offshore companies]] in [[tax haven]]s. Brooks also reported dissatisfaction that the Act does not restrict the amount of land that can be owned by any one individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/scotland-blog/2016/mar/17/a-new-dawn-for-land-reform-in-scotland|title=A new dawn for land reform in Scotland?|last=Brooks|first=Libby|date=17 March 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was established by the Scottish Government on 1 April 2017 by ''The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016 (Commencement&amp;nbsp;&lt;abbr&gt;No.&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;nbsp;4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Regulations 2016'' made under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016.&lt;ref name="establishment"&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=ssi|year=2016|number=372|ssi=The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Regulations 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Headquarters==
It is headquartered at Longman House in [[Inverness]]. There is a staff of around twenty: five Land Commissioners, the Tenant Farming Commissioner and support staff. The interim chief executive officer was announced as Hilary Pearce, a civil servant in the Scottish government seconded to the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-37652824 |title=Inverness headquarters for Scottish Land Commission |work=[[BBC News]] |date=14 October 2016 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioners==
===Nomination===
The first commissioners were proposed in November 2016: Andrew Thin, Professor David Adams, Lorne MacLeod, Sally Reynolds, Megan MacInnes and Bob McIntosh as the Tenant Farming Commissioner.&lt;ref name="proposed"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/9846/will-they-deliver-six-commissioners-proposed-advance-land-reform |title=Will they deliver? The six commissioners proposed to advance land reform |work=[[CommonSpace]] |date=11 November 2016 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nominated Commissioners were considered by the [[Committees of the Scottish Parliament|Environment, Climate Change, and Land Reform Committee]] of [[Scottish Parliament]], which reported on 8 December 2016, recommending that the Scottish Parliament approve the appointment of the Commissioners. Nonetheless, the Committee did recommend that Bob McIntosh, proposed Tenant Farming Commissioner, should resign from membership of the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] to maintain the perception of impartiality; the Committee believed McIntosh was in good a position for building relationships with both landowners and tenants. The Committee also recommended that Lorne MacLeod stand down as Chairman of [[Community Land Scotland]] and as a director of community owned land on [[Eriskay]], and asked the Scottish Government to provide a date for when appointments to the Commission would be regulated by the [[Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland]].&lt;ref name="committeeapproval"&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://www.parliament.scot/S5_Environment/Reports/ECCLRS052016R04.pdf|title=4th Report 2016 (Session 5): Appointment of the Scottish Land Commissioners and the Tenant Farming Commissioner|date=8 December 2016|website=parliament.scot|publisher=Scottish Parliament|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Report of the Environment, Climate Change, and Land Reform Committee was noted by the Scottish Parliament on 13 December 2016, and approved the appointment of the Land Commissioners (including the Tenant Farming Commissioner).&lt;ref name="parliamentapproval"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/28877.aspx?SearchType=Advance&amp;ReferenceNumbers=S5M-03099| title=Motion S5M-03099: Appointment of Scottish Land Commissioners and the Tenant Farming Commissioner |series = Motions, Questions and Answers |department = Chamber Office|publisher=Scottish Parliament|date=15 December 2016|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chairman===
The first chairman, Andrew Thin, was previously the Scottish Government's Independent Advisor on Tenant Farming, and was involved in the establishment of the [[Cairngorms National Park|Cairngorms National Park Authority]] and had previously worked for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]].&lt;ref name="thin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Gordon|title=Scotland's first Land Commission appointed|url=http://www.thescottishfarmer.co.uk/news/14911953.Scotland_s_first_Land_Commission_appointed/|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=The Scottish Farmer|publisher=Newsquest Herald and Times Group Ltd|date=18 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenant Farming Commissioner===
The Tenant Farming Commissioner cannot be an agricultural landlord or agricultural tenant, and will develop codes of practice which are in addition to the law and the jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Land Court]]. The Tenant Farming Commissioner has the power to investigate breaches of the codes of practice.&lt;ref name="gillespie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland - April 2016|last=Blair|first=Mike|date=April 2016|website=gillespiemacandrew.co.uk|publisher=Gillespie MacAndrew and Hunters Residential|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306131212/http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=25 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported in ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' newspaper on 11 August 2016, Christopher Nicholson of the Scottish Tenant Farming Association stated that the creation of a Tenant Farming Commissioner had the support of both landowners and tenants.&lt;ref name="news-settingup"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/business/14674579.Process_of_setting_up_a_Scottish_Land_Commission_under_way/ |title=Process of setting up a Scottish Land Commission under way |first=Rog |last=Wood |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=11 August 2016 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculture Holdings Review had identified examples of dysfunctional relationships between landlords and tenants, with Bob McIntosh stating,
{{Quote|The Agriculture Holdings Review identified examples of dysfunctional landlord/tenant relationships based on a ‘them and us’ culture, so a culture change towards a more mutually beneficial partnership approach would represent success.|Bob McIntosh|Interview in ''The Scotsman'' - ''Co-operation is key for farm tenancy relationships''|&lt;ref name="news-coop"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/farming/co-operation-is-key-for-farm-tenancy-relationships-1-4330606 |title=Co-operation is key for farm tenancy relationships |first=Brian |last=Henderson |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=3 January 2017 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|Press and Journal]]'' newspaper, reported on 8 April 2017 that Bob McIntosh, the first Tenant Farming Commissioner, was hoping that the Codes of Practice he would develop would help tenants and landowners to resolve disputes without recourse to the [[Scottish Land Court]]. He stated that he would be able to investigate instances where a landlord or tenant had not complied with the Codes of Practice, following the lodging of a formal complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-press-and-journal-aberdeen/20170407/282183650905725|title=Rural Relationships in Focus|last=|first=|date=7 April 2017|website=www.pressreader.com|publisher=''[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|Press and Journal]]'' newspaper|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11314">{{Roman government}}
The '''Senate of the Roman Kingdom''' was a political institution in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]]. The word ''[[senate]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''[[senex]]'', which means "old man". Therefore, ''senate'' literally means "board of old men" and translates as "Council of Elders". The prehistoric [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] who settled Rome in the centuries before the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC&lt;ref name="Abbott, 3"&gt;Abbott, 3&lt;/ref&gt; were structured into tribal communities.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 1"&gt;Abbott, 1&lt;/ref&gt; These tribal communities often included an aristocratic board of tribal elders, who were vested with supreme authority over their tribe.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 12"&gt;Abbott, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The early tribes that had settled along the banks of the [[Tiber]] eventually aggregated into a loose confederation, and later formed an alliance for protection against invaders.

The early Romans were deeply patriarchal. The early Roman family was called a ''[[gens]]'' or "[[clan]]".&lt;ref name="Abbott, 1"&gt;Abbott, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Each clan was an aggregation of families under a common living male patriarch, called a ''[[Pater familias|pater]]'' (the Latin word for "father"). The ''pater'' was the undisputed master of his clan.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 6"&gt;Abbott, 6&lt;/ref&gt; He had the absolute power to resolve any disputes, and to make any decisions for the collective ''gens''. When the early Roman ''gens'' were aggregating to form a common community, the ''patres'' from the leading clans were selected&lt;ref name="Abbott, 16"&gt;Abbott, 16&lt;/ref&gt; for the confederated board of elders (what would become the [[Roman Senate]]).&lt;ref name="Abbott, 6"&gt;Abbott, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Legend states that the senate grew to a membership of 300 after three blocks of 100 senators were added at fixed points in time. What likely happened, however, was a gradual aggregation of ''patres'' over time, as more clans achieved high status.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 16"&gt;Abbott, 16&lt;/ref&gt; The early senate derived its ultimate sovereignty from the fact that it was composed of the patriarchal heads of the leading families. As the individual ''patres'' led their families, the board of ''patres'' led the confederation of those families. In time, the ''patres'' came to recognize the need for a single leader. Therefore, they elected a [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Kingdom#The King of Rome|king]] (''rex''),&lt;ref name="Abbott, 6"&gt;Abbott, 6&lt;/ref&gt; and vested in him their sovereign power.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 42"&gt;Byrd, 42&lt;/ref&gt; The king presided over the senate, appointed individuals to the senate (for life), and expelled individuals from the senate. When the king died, his sovereign power naturally reverted to the ''patres''.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 6"&gt;Abbott, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and Development==

According to [[Livy]], The senate was created by Rome's first king, [[Romulus]] and consisted of 100 men.  The descendants of those 100 men subsequently became the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] class.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8&lt;/ref&gt;

100 more were added to the Senate by Rome's fifth king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], from amongst the minor leading families.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers of the senate==
The senate of the [[Roman Kingdom]] could only be convened by the king, and usually met in either a ''templum'', or in some other location that had been consecrated by a religious official (an [[augur]]).&lt;ref name="Abbott, 17"&gt;Abbott, 17&lt;/ref&gt; While the senate could pass "laws", it would be incorrect to view the "laws" passed during the time of the kingdom as legislation. In effect, these "laws" were actually the decrees of the king. The king had the absolute power to make any law. However, he often involved both the senate and the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom#Curiate Assembly|popular assembly]] (the "Curiate Assembly") in the process. The primary role of the senate in this process was to either assist the king, or to provide additional legitimacy to a decree of the king by declaring its support. Sometimes this involved debate in the senate over the proposed law or an actual vote on the law. However, the king was free to ignore any ruling that the senate ultimately passed.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 17"&gt;Abbott, 17&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during the days of the kingdom, the senate's limited prestige made it an accepted practice for the king to ignore advice handed down by the senate. The senate did, however, become an influential advisory council to the king. This tradition was maintained throughout the life of the Roman Republic, although in practice, the republican magistrates rarely acted against the wishes of the senate.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 17"&gt;Abbott, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres 019.jpg|thumb|left|Romulus, Victor over Acron, hauls the rich booty to the temple of Jupiter, by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]]] 
The ''[[patres]]'' that filled the ranks of the early senate held a position of absolute dominance over their respective families.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 6"&gt;Abbott, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the senate was filled with the ''patres'' of the leading families, their individual dominance over their individual families was consolidated into collective dominance over the collective families of the early Roman community. These were the original [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] families.

While the king was technically elected by the people, it was actually the senate who chose each new king. Since the consolidated authority of the ''patres'' of the senate chose the king, the king became the embodiment of that authority. Since the authority of each ''patre'' over his family was absolute,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 6"&gt;Abbott, 6&lt;/ref&gt; the king was vested with the absolute authority over those families (and thus over the entire state). Since the king derived his authority from the ''patres'', he (theoretically) could not pass that power on to an heir upon his death. Thus, the authority reverted to the senate when the king died.

The period between the death of one king, and the election of a new king, was called the [[interregnum]].&lt;ref name="Livy 1:17"&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:17&lt;/ref&gt; The interregnum was the only period during which the senate exercised its sovereign power. During the first interregnum after the death of Romulus, the senate, comprised at that time of 100 men, arranged itself into ten [[decury|decuries]], and each [[decurio]] governed Rome for five days as [[interrex]].  The decurios continued to rotate the government amongst themselves for a year until the senate elected [[Numa Pompilius]] as king.&lt;ref name="Livy 1:17"/&gt;

The practice eventually evolved that, when a king died, it was a member of the senate (the Interrex) who nominated a candidate to replace the king.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 14"&gt;Abbott, 14&lt;/ref&gt; If the senate gave its approval, then in practice, the people were unlikely to reject the nominee.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 20"&gt;Byrd, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The formal election of the king by the people, however, did serve to confirm to the senate that the people (many of whom fought in the [[Roman army|armies]] that were commanded by the king) found their new potential [[commander-in-chief]] to be acceptable.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 14"&gt;Abbott, 14&lt;/ref&gt; After the senate gave its final approval, the Interrex declared the individual king, and then returned to the ranks of the senate.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 14"&gt;Abbott, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the senate chose the king, the people ratified that choice, and the senate finalized the decision.

In [[voting]], a [[ballot]] is considered '''spoilt''', '''spoiled''', '''void''', '''null''', '''informal''', '''invalid''' or '''stray''' if a law declares or an [[election]] authority determines that it is invalid and thus not included in the [[Vote counting system|vote count]]. This may occur accidentally or deliberately. The total number of spoilt votes in a United States election has been called the '''residual vote'''.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, ''Residual Votes Attributable to Technology: An Assessment of the Reliability of Existing Voting Equipment'', version 2, 3 Mar. 2001, http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~voting/Caltech_MIT_Report_Version2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, such votes are generally referred to as informal votes, and in Canada they are referred to as rejected votes.

In some jurisdictions, spoilt votes are counted and reported.

==Types of spoilt vote ==
[[File:Испорченная бюллетень.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Spoiled ballot paper from the [[Kazakh legislative election, 2016]]]]
A ballot may be spoilt in a number of ways, including:
{|
|
* Failing to mark the ballot at all ([[blank vote]]), or otherwise defacing the ballot instead of attempting to vote.
* Filling out the ballot in a manner that is incompatible with the voting system being used, e.g.:
** Marking more choices than permitted ([[overvote|overvoting]]), or fewer than necessary ([[undervote|undervoting]]).
** Filling a [[Ranked voting systems|preference ballot]] out of sequence (also known as a [[donkey vote]]), e.g. 1-2-2-3-4 or 1-2-4-5-6. In most cases, only the first two choices in these examples would be counted as valid.
** Adding a [[write-in candidate]] when such an option is not permitted. The vote for this candidate would be discarded.
* Filling the ballot in a manner that makes the voter's decision unclear.
* Physically deforming ballots, especially those counted by machine.
* Making marks on the ballot other than those necessary to complete it, where the voter's identity can be ascertained, compromising the [[secrecy of the ballot]].
|}

As an example, UK law specifically precludes ballots "on which votes are given for more candidates than the voter is entitled to vote for", "on which anything is written or marked by which the voter can be identified" or "which [are] unmarked or void for uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE, ENGLAND AND WALES The Local Elections (Principal Areas) (England and Wales) Rules 2006|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3304/pdfs/uksi_20063304_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement ballots==
If a voter makes a mistake while completing a ballot, it may be possible to cancel it and start the voting process again. [[Elections in the United States|In the United States]], cancelled physical ballots may be called "spoiled ballots",&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/117-00/385.PDF Kentucky Revised Statutes 117.385], effective July 15, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; as distinct from an "invalid vote" which has been cast. 

[[Elections in Canada|In Canada]], a ''spoiled ballot'' is one that has been handled by an elector in such a manner that it is ruined beyond use, or that the deputy returning officer finds soiled or improperly printed. The spoilt ballot is not placed in the ballot box, but rather is marked as spoilt by the deputy returning officer and set aside. The elector is given another ballot. A 'rejected ballot' is one which cannot be counted due to improper marking by the voter. Examples of this are ballots which have more than one mark, the intent of the voter cannot be ascertained, or the voter can be identified by their mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=loi/jud&amp;document=jud_p3&amp;lang=e Elections Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, if multiple elections or referenda are held simultaneously, then there may be separate physical ballots for each, which may be printed on different-colored paper and posted into separate ballot boxes. In the United States, a single physical ballot is often used to record multiple separate votes. In such cases one can distinguish an "invalid ballot", where all votes on the ballot are rendered invalid,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.michigan.gov/documents/OptScan_Validity_165397_7.pdf Determining the Validity of Optical Scan Ballot Markings], Michigan Bureau of Elections, May 27, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; from a "partially valid" ballot, with some votes are valid and others invalid.

==Intentional spoiling==
A voter may deliberately spoil a vote, for example as a [[protest vote]], especially in [[compulsory voting]] jurisdictions, to show disapproval of the candidates standing whilst still taking part in the electoral process. Intentionally spoiling someone else's ballot before or during tabulation is an [[electoral fraud]].

The validity of an election may be questioned if there is an unusually high proportion of spoilt votes.{{cn|date=December 2014}} In multiple-vote U.S. ballots, "voter roll-off" is calculated by subtracting the number of votes cast for a "down-ballot" office, such as mayor, from the number of votes cast for a "top-of-the-ballot" office, such as president. When the election jurisdiction does not report voter turnout, roll-off can be used as a proxy for residual votes. Some voters may only be interested in voting for the major offices, and not bother filling in the lower positions, resulting in a partially valid ballot. Roll-off can also be known as undervoting. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

While it is not illegal to advocate informal voting in [[Australian federal election]]s, it is illegal to advise voters to fill out their ballots in an invalid manner.&lt;ref name="aec1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/australian_electoral_system/files/jscem/1996_election/sub77.pdf.|title=ADVOCACY OF OPTIONAL PREFERENTIAL VOTING |author=Australian Electoral Commission |date=30 August 1996|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Langer]] was jailed for violating an [[injunction]] not to advocate incomplete preference voting for the [[Australian federal election, 1996]].&lt;ref name="aec1996"/&gt;

==Unintentional spoiling==
Voter instructions are usually intended to minimize the accidental spoiling of votes. [[Ballot design]] can aid or inhibit clarity in an election, resulting in less or more accidental spoiling. Some election officials have discretion to include ballots where the strict criteria for acceptability are not met but the voter's intention is clear. More complicated [[electoral system]]s may be more prone to errors. [[Group voting ticket]]s were introduced in Australia owing to the high number of informal votes cast in [[single transferable vote]] (STV) elections. When multiple [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|Irish STV elections]] are simultaneous (as for [[Local Elections in Ireland|local]] and [[:Category:European Parliament elections in the Republic of Ireland|European]] elections) some voters have marked, say, 1-2-3 on one ballot paper and 4-5-6 on the other; some returning officers consequently allowed 4-5-6 ballots to be counted, until a [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] case in 2015 ruled they were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/1217/754697-votes/|title=Supreme Court orders recount of votes in Listowel|date=17 December 2015|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Election Assistance Commission]]'s survey of the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]] reported undervoting rate of 0.1% in US Senate elections and 1.6% in US House elections; overvotes were much rarer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2006 Election Administration and Voting Survey |url=http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/2006%20EAVS%20Appendix%20B.pdf#page=25 |pages=52–55|chapter=Appendix B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some paper-based voting systems and most [[DRE voting machine]]s can notify voters of under-votes and over-votes. The [[Help America Vote Act]] requires that voters are informed when they have overvoted, unless a paper-ballot voting system is in use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ252/html/PLAW-107publ252.htm Help America Vote Act] Section 301(a)1(A)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Insider's Guide to the Colleges ''''' is a college educational guide which has been published annually by the student editorial staff of the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' for over three decades. It provides insight to prospective undergraduate students using first-hand accounts of attending students as well as an overview of the [[college admissions in the United States|admissions process]].

This guidebook offers information about 323 [[Higher education in the United States|American Institutions of Higher Education]]. It includes information about [[public universities]], [[private universities]], and [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] from all regions of the United States.

Information about each college and university is gathered entirely from student interviews. The editors (students themselves) note that their

:primary objective is to paint an accurate picture of what day-to-day life is like for college students at each school.  In each write-up, we rely on hours of personal interviews with actual college students [...] we  research each school in ''The Insider's Guide,'' by interviewing friends, friends of friends, and a random selection of students at each school. This gives ''The Insider's Guide'' a unique perspective from students whose opinions we trust.  It also means that we are only as accurate as our sources. Though we have worked hard to make each article factually correct and current, the college experience is unique for every individual. (1)

The editors also offer what they refer to as the "College Finder" or "Top Ten Lists." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707092732/http://www.yaledailynews.com/pages/view/books] Of the methodology used to create these lists they note,

:while our top ten lists use a mix of statistics and subjectivity to provide an alternative perspective on the schools we include, we have avoided the temptation to pigeonhole the colleges with some kind of catch-all rating system or worse, to numerically rank them from first to last. Our reason is that the 'best' college for one person may come near the bottom of the list for another. (4-5)

The guide offers an overview of the entire application process including college visits and the application process (including the interview). It also offers a chapter called "The College Spectrum" which offers suggested areas of consideration when choosing a college including size, location, the makeup of a school, whether to choose a professional or liberal arts curriculum and general concerns regarding "quality of life." (34) There is also a section for students with disabilities as well as a glossary of terms related to the admissions process.

{{History of Indonesia}}
[[Indonesia]]'s '''transition to the "[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]]"''' in the mid-1960s, ousted the country's first president, [[Sukarno]], after 22 years in the position. One of the most tumultuous periods in [[History of Indonesia|the country's modern history]], it was the commencement of [[Suharto]]'s 31-year presidency.

Described as the great ''[[dhalang]]'' ("puppet master"), Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI).  By 1965, the PKI extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), pp. 271-283&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 1965, six of the military's most senior officers were killed in an action (generally labelled an "attempted coup") by the so-called [[30 September Movement]], a group from within the armed forces.  Within a few hours, [[Suharto|Major General Suharto]] mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta.  Anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|a violent purge of communists throughout the country]], killing an estimated half million people and destroying the PKI, which was officially blamed for the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people =Chris Hilton (writer and director) | title =Shadowplay | medium =Television documentary | publisher =Vagabond Films and Hilton Cordell Productions |date = 2001 }}; Ricklefs (1991), pages 280–283, 284, 287–290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unresolved Problems in the Indonesian Killings of 1965-1966 |author=Robert Cribb |journal=Asian Survey |volume=42 |issue=4 |year=2002 |pages=550–563 |doi=10.1525/as.2002.42.4.550}}; Friend (2003), page 107-109, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Indonesian parliament (MPRS) named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later.  Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suharto's pro-Western "New Order" stabilised the economy but continued the policies of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]].

==Background==
[[File:Soekarno.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sukarno]], President of Indonesia (1945-1967) in undated photo]]Nationalist leader Sukarno had declared [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]] in 1945 and was appointed president. Following an [[Indonesian National Revolution|internal national revolution and struggle]] against the former [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]], Sukarno had managed to hold together the disparate country; however, his administration had not been able to provide a viable economic system to lift its citizens out of severe poverty.  He stressed [[Socialism|socialist]] policies domestically and an avidly [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] international policy, underpinned by an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] style of rule dependent upon his charismatic personality. Pursuing an independent Indonesian foreign policy, Sukarno developed friendly ties with the [[Eastern Bloc]], the [[China|People's Republic of China]], whilst courting friendly relations with the [[United States]] at the same, in his efforts to maximise Indonesian bargaining power in its foreign policy. Sukarno was also a pioneering figure in developing the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], playing a lead role in hosting the [[Bandung Conference]] in 1955. In Indonesia's domestic politics, Sukarno also carefully balanced Indonesia's various political parties, including the PKI.

From the late 1950s, political conflict and economic deterioration worsened. By the mid-1960s, the cash-strapped government had to scrap critical public sector subsidies, estimates put annual inflation at 500-1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible [[investment]]. Severe poverty and hunger were widespread, and Sukarno led his country in [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|a military confrontation with Malaysia]] whilst stepping up revolutionary and anti-western rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1994), pages 52–57, {{cite news

Described as the great ''dhalang'' ("puppet master"), President Sukarno's position came to depend on balancing the opposing and increasingly hostile forces of the army and the PKI. His anti-imperial ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on the [[Soviet Union]] and China. By 1965, at the height of the [[Cold War]], the PKI penetrated all levels of government extensively. With the support of Sukarno and the air force, the party gained increasing influence at the expense of the army, thus ensuring the army's enmity.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), page 282&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1965, the army was divided between a left-wing faction allied with the PKI, and a right-wing faction that was being courted by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), pages 272–280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military split===
These same policies, however, won Sukarno few friends and many enemies in the [[Western world]]. These especially included the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], whose investors were increasingly angered by Sukarno's [[nationalisation]] of mineral, agricultural, and energy assets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In need of Indonesian allies in its [[Cold War]] against the Soviet Union, the United States cultivated a number of ties with officers of the military through exchanges and arms deals. This fostered a split in the military's ranks, with the United States and others backing a right-wing faction against a left-wing faction overlapping with the PKI.

When Sukarno rejected food aid from [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], thereby exacerbating famine conditions, the right-wing military adopted a regional command structure through which it could smuggle staple commodities to win the loyalty of the rural population. In an attempt to curtail the right-wing military's increasing power, the PKI and the left-wing military formed a number of peasant and other mass organisations.

===Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation===
{{main|Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation}}
[[File:Sukarno konfrontasi, indonesia's undeclared war, ABC 1966.webm|thumb|1966 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] report discussing the Indonesian political context of Konfrontasi]]
In 1963, a policy of ''[[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'' (Confrontation) against the newly formed [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] was announced by the Sukarno regime. This further exacerbated the split between the left-wing and right-wing military factions, with the left-wing faction and the Communist Party taking part in guerrilla raids on the border with Malaysia, while the right-wing faction was largely absent from the conflict (whether by choice or orders of Sukarno is not clear).

The Confrontation further encouraged the West to seek ways to topple Sukarno, viewed as a growing threat to Southeast Asian regional stability (as with [[North Vietnam]] under the [[Domino theory]]). The deepening of the armed conflict, coming close to all-out warfare by 1965, both increased popular dissatisfaction with the Sukarno regime and strengthened the hand of the right-wing generals whose forces were still close to the centre of power in Jakarta.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===30 September Movement===
{{main|30 September Movement}}
[[File:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|As Major General, Suharto (''at right, foreground'') attends the funeral of assassinated generals 5 October 1965. (Photo by the Department of Information, Indonesia)]]

On the night of 30 September&amp;ndash;1 October 1965 six senior army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by a battalion of soldiers from the Presidential Guard in an "attempted coup." The right faction among the top generals was wiped out, including the powerful Army Chief of Staff, [[Ahmad Yani]]. Around 2,000 troops from [[Coup d'état|coup]] groups occupied three sides of [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]], and commanded the Presidential Palace, radio station, and telecommunications centre, but did not occupy the east side, site of Kostrad headquarters.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 281"&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Calling themselves the "[[30 September Movement]]", the group announced on radio around 7{{nbsp}}am that they were trying to stop a military coup backed by the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) that was planned to remove Sukarno from power.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 281"/&gt;

They claimed to have arrested several generals belonging to a conspiracy, the "Council of Generals", that had plotted a military coup against the government of President Sukarno. They further alleged that this coup was to take place on Armed Forces Day (5 October) with the backing of the CIA, and that the Council would then install themselves as a [[Military dictatorship|military junta]].&lt;ref name="RICKLEFS"&gt;Ricklefs (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ROOSA"&gt;Roosa (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the soldiers proclaimed the establishment of a "Revolutionary Council" consisting of various well-known military officers and civilian leaders that would be the highest authority in Indonesia. Additionally, they declared President Sukarno's Dwikora Cabinet as invalid ("demisioner").&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_94App9"&gt;Sekretariat Negara Republik Indonesia (1994) Appendix p19 (verbatim record of radio announcement)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one chief conspirator, Lt. Col. Latief, the Palace Guards had not attempted to kill or capture Major General [[Suharto]], commander of [[Kostrad]] (Komando Strategi dan Cadangan TNI Angkatan Darat &amp;ndash; the Army Strategic and Reserves Command), because he was considered a Sukarno loyalist.&lt;ref name="Latief279"&gt;Latief (1999) p279&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto, along with the surviving General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]], made the counter-allegation that the G30S was a rebellious movement that sought to replace President Sukarno's government with a [[Communism|Communist]] government. Upon hearing of the [[radio]] announcement, Suharto and Nasution began consolidating their forces, successfully gaining the loyalty of Jakarta Garrison Commander Maj. Gen. Umar Wirahadikusumah and Colonel Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, the commander of army special forces RPKAD ([[Kopassus|Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat]] &amp;ndash; the Army's Para-Commando Regiment).

During the evening of 1 October, RPKAD soldiers recaptured RRI and Telecommunications Building without any resistance as the rebel soldiers had retreated back to Halim Air Force Base. RPKAD forces proceeded to attack Halim Perdanakusumah AF Base on the morning of 2 October, but was stopped by the rebel soldiers in a fierce gunbattle in which several fatalities were inflicted on both sides. A direct order from President Sukarno managed to secure the surrender of the rebel soldiers by noon, after which Suhartoist forces occupied the base. On 4 October, the generals' bodies were discovered at Halim and on 5 October (Armed Forces Day) a large public funeral was held.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287"/&gt;

===Internal military power-struggle===
The killing of the generals saw influence in the Army fall to those more willing to stand up to Sukarno and the Army's enemies on the left.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), page 281&lt;/ref&gt; After the assassinations of those generals, the highest-ranking officer in the Indonesian military, and third highest in the overall chain-of-command, was Defense Minister and Armed Forces Chief-of-Staff Gen. [[Abdul Haris Nasution]], a member of the right-wing camp.
On 2 October, Suharto accepted Sukarno's order for him to take control of the army, but on the condition that Suharto personally have authority to restore order and security. 1 November formation of [[Kopkamtib]] (''Komando Operasi Pemulihan Keamanan dan Keteriban'', or Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order), formalised this authority.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287"/&gt; However, on 5 October Sukarno moved to promote Maj. Gen. Pranoto Reksosamudra, considered a Sukarno loyalist, to Army Chief of Staff.

After the promotion, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that an unnamed Western "diplomatic report" alleged that Pranoto was a former member of the PKI. Pranoto's alleged communism, as well as his timely promotion, led them to promote the view that the PKI and Sukarno conspired to assassinate the generals to consolidate their grip on power.&lt;ref name="NYT100665"&gt;''New York Times'', 6 October 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the assassinations, however, Major Gen. Suharto and his KOSTRAD (Army Strategic Reserves) units were closest to Jakarta. By default, Suharto became the field general in charge of prosecution of the G30S. Later, at the insistence of Gen. [[Abdul Haris Nasution]], Pranoto was removed and Suharto was promoted to Army Chief-of-Staff on 14 October 1965.&lt;ref name="NYT101565"&gt;''New York Times'', 15 October 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-communist purge===
{{see also|Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66}}
In early October, a military propaganda campaign began to sweep the country, successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a Communist coup, and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, page 157"&gt;Vickers (2005), page 157&lt;/ref&gt; 30 September Movement was called ''Gestapu'' (from ''Gerakan September Tigapuluh'', "30 September Movement"). The Army, acting on orders by Suharto and supervised by Nasution, began a campaign of agitation and incitement to violence among Indonesian civilians aimed at the Communist community and toward President Sukarno himself. The PKI's denials of involvement had little effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), page 287&lt;/ref&gt; The regime was quickly destabilised, with the Army the only force left to maintain order.&lt;ref name="NYT101965"&gt;''New York Times'', 19 October 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

At the funeral of Nasution's daughter Irma, Navy commander Admiral [[Eddy Martadinata]] gave Muslim leaders the signal to attack Communists. On 8 October, the PKI head office was ransacked and burned to the ground while firefighters stood by idly.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"&gt;Hughes (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; They then marched demanding the dissolution of the Communist Party. The homes of senior party figures, including PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit|D. N. Aidit]], [[M. H. Lukman]] and [[Nyoto]] were also torched. The army led campaign to purge Indonesian society, government and armed forces of the communist party and other leftist organisations. Leading PKI members were immediately arrested, some summarily executed.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, page 157"/&gt;

On 18 October, a declaration was read over the army-controlled radio stations, banning the PKI. The ban included the party itself, and its youth and women's wings, peasant associations, intellectual and student groups, and the [[Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia|SOBSI]] union. At the time, it was not clear whether this ban applied only to Jakarta (by then controlled by the Army), or the whole Republic of Indonesia. However, the ban was soon used as a pretext for the Indonesian Army to go throughout the country carrying out [[extrajudicial punishment]]s, including [[mass arrest]] and [[summary execution]]s, against suspected leftists and Sukarno loyalists. As the violence spread, Sukarno issued orders to try to stop it, but he was ignored. He also refused to blame the PKI for the coup, let alone ban it as the Army demanded. However, although Suharto and Nasution were increasingly suspicious about Sukarno's role in the affair, the Army was reluctant to confront the president directly because of his still widespread popularity.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;

Beginning in later October 1965, and feeding off pent-up communal hatreds, the Indonesian army and its civilian allies (especially Muslim vigilante groups) began to kill actual and suspected&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287"&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; members and associates of the PKI.  The U.S. government covertly supported the massacres, providing extensive lists of suspected communists to be targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.namebase.org/kadane.html |title=Ex-agents say CIA compiled death lists for Indonesians |publisher=States News Service |date=20 May 1990 |first=Kathy |last=Kadane |accessdate=30 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113014153/http://www.namebase.org/kadane.html |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB52/ |work=[[National Security Archive]] |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Blanton |title=CIA stalling State Department histories: State historians conclude U.S. passed names of communists to Indonesian Army, which killed at least 105,000 in 1965-66 |date=27 July 2001 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings started in the capital [[Jakarta]], spread to [[Central Java|Central]] and [[East Java]], and later [[Bali]].

It is thought that as many as 1.5m were imprisoned at one stage or another.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), pages 159–60&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the purge, one of Sukarno's three pillars of support, the PKI, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam.

===Demonstrations===

In October 1965, students in Jakarta formed [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]] (''Kesatuan Aksi Mahasiswa Indonesia'', Indonesian Students Action Front), which called for the banning of the PKI.&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_2"/&gt; It was soon joined by a host of similar organisations made up of high school students, workers, artists and labourers and the like. Other targets for the demonstrators were rising prices and government inefficiency.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt; They also demonstrated against [[Subandrio]], the foreign minister and head of the BPI intelligence agency and the number two man in the government.&lt;ref name="ROOSA"/&gt;

On 10 January 1966, demonstrators, including KAMI, demonstrated in front of the Provisional legislature and announced what became known as the ''Three Demands of the People'' (''Tritura''):
* Dissolution of the PKI
* The expulsion from the cabinet of G30S/PKI elements
* Lower prices and economic improvements&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_2"/&gt;

In February 1966, as anti-communist demonstrations continued, Sukarno tried to placate Suharto by promoting him. On 21 February, he tried to regain the initiative by announcing a new cabinet, which included former Air Force chief [[Omar Dani]], who had issued a statement on 1 October 1965 initially supporting the coup. More provocatively still, Sukarno fired General Nasution from his cabinet post. The new cabinet immediately became known as the Gestapu cabinet, after the acronym coined by the military for 30 September Movement.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;

Two days after the announcement, a huge crowd attempted to storm the presidential palace. The next day, while the new cabinet was being inaugurated, soldiers from the presidential guard opened fire on a crowd in front of the palace, killing student protester [[Arif Rachman Hakim]], who was turned into a martyr and given a hero's funeral the following day.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_2"/&gt;

On 8 March 1966, students managed to ransack the foreign ministry, and held it for five hours. They daubed slogans, one accusing Subandrio of murdering the generals, and drew graffiti showing Subandrio as a Pekingese dog (a reference to his perceived closeness to communist China) or hanging from gallows.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;

Sukarno then planned a three-day series of meetings to restore his authority. The first, on 10 March, involved the leaders of political parties.  He managed to persuade them to sign a declaration warning against the undermining of presidential authority by student demonstrations. The second stage was a cabinet meeting planned for 11 March. However, as this meeting was underway, word reached Sukarno that unidentified troops were surrounding the palace. Sukarno left the palace in haste for [[Bogor]], where later that night, he signed the [[Supersemar]] document transferring authority to restore order to Major General Suharto. Suharto acted quickly. One 12 March he banned the PKI. The same day, there was a "show of force" by the Army in the streets of Jakarta, which was watched by cheering crowds.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt; On 18 March, Subandrio and 14 other ministers were arrested., including third deputy prime minister [[Chairul Saleh]]. That night, the radio announced that the ministers were in "protective custody".&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;

Suharto later admitted in his autobiography that he frequently liaised with the student protesters throughout this period and Sukarno often pleaded with him to stop the demonstrations.

==Political manoeuvring==
[[File:Suhartoappointedpresident.jpg|thumb|right|General Suharto is sworn in as Indonesia's second president on 27 March 1968 (Photo by the Department of Information, Indonesia)]]
On 27 March, the new cabinet line-up, agreed between Suharto and Sukarno, was announced. It included the key figures of Suharto himself as interim deputy prime minister for security and defence affairs, tasked with preventing the resurgence of communism, the Sultan of Yogyakarta [[Hamengkubuwono IX|Sri Sulan Hamengkubuwono IX]] as deputy prime minister for economic, financial and development affairs, tasked with solving the nation's economic problems and [[Adam Malik]] as deputy prime minister for social and political affairs, whose job it would be to manage foreign policy.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SIMANJUNTAK"&gt;Simanjuntak(2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 1966, Suharto gave a speech to members of the [[Indonesian National Party]] in which he spoke of the "three deviations" that would have to be corrected by the youth of the country in co-operation with the Armed Forces. These were:
* The extreme-left radicalism of the PKI and its efforts to impose a class struggle on the Indonesian people;
* Political opportunism motivated by personal gain led and exploited by the "puppet masters" of the Indonesian Central Intelligence Board (BPI), at the time led by Sukarno ally [[Subandrio]];
* Economic adventurism, resulting in the deliberate creation of economic chaos.&lt;ref name="FEITH_CASTLES"&gt;''Feith &amp; Castles'' (Eds) (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime turned away from China and began moves to end the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, in defiance of Sukarno's wishes.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Suharto and his allies continued to purge state institutions of Sukarno loyalists. The Tjakrabirawa palace guard was disbanded, and following further student demonstrations in front of the legislature building on 2 May, the leadership of the Mutual Cooperation House of Representatives (DPR-GR) was replaced and Sukarnoist and pro-communist members were suspended from the DPR-GR and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS), the supreme lawmaking body. Pro-Suharto replacements were appointed.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;

A session of the MPRS was scheduled to open 12 May, but eventually began on 20 June and continued until 5 July. One of its first actions was to appoint General [[Abdul Haris Nasution]] as chairman. It then set about dismantling the apparatus Sukarno had built around himself. It passed several decrees, one of which was the ratification of the [[Supersemar]], thus making revocation of it almost impossible. It also ratified the banning of the PKI and the teaching of [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]], instructed Suharto to form a new cabinet, called on Sukarno to provide an explanation for the economic and political situation in the nation and stripped him of the title "president for life". It also passed a decree stating that if the president was unable to carry out his duties, the holder of the Supersemar would assume the presidency.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_2"/&gt; Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president amongst elements of the armed forces (particularly the [[Indonesian Marine Corps|Marines]], the navy, and some regional army divisions).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The new cabinet, announced by Sukarno on 20 June, was led by a five-man presidium headed by Suharto, and including Malik and Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX.

On 11 August, against the wishes of Sukarno, a peace treaty was signed, formerly ending ''Konfrontasi''. Indonesia announced it would rejoin the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[United Nations]]. It released political prisoners and paid compensation to the British and American governments for the damage caused to their diplomatic buildings during the demonstrations of the Sukarno era.

On 17 August, in his annual independence day speech, Sukarno claimed that Indonesia was not about to recognise Malaysia nor rejoin the UN. He also stated that he had not transferred power to Suharto. This provoked an angry reaction in the form of demonstrations, and Indonesia did indeed rejoin the UN in September, participating in the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on 28 September.&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_2"/&gt;  Meanwhile, criticism from demonstrators became increasingly vociferous and personal, and there were calls for him to be put on trial.

On 10 January 1967, Sukarno wrote to the MPRS, enclosing a document known as ''Nawaksara'' giving his version of the events surrounding the 30 September Movement. In it, he said the kidnappings and murders of the generals had been a "complete surprise" to him, and that he alone was not responsible for the nation's moral and economic problems. This led to demonstrators calling for Sukarno to be hanged.&lt;ref name="HUGHES"/&gt;

The MPRS leadership met on 21 January and concluded that Sukarno had failed to fulfill his constitutional obligations. In a resolution passed on 9 February, the DPR-GR rejected the '' Nawaksara'' and asked the MPRS to convene a special session.&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_2"&gt;Sekretariat Negara Republik Indonesia (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indonesian president sukarno responds to political tensions, ABC 1967.webm|thumb|April 1967 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] report of the political tensions at end of the Sukarno era]]
On 12 March 1967, the special session began. After heated debates, it agreed to strip Sukarno of his power. On 12 March, Suharto was appointed acting president. Sukarno went into ''de facto'' [[house arrest]] in Bogor. A year later, on 27 March 1968, another session of the MPRS appointed Suharto the second president of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="SEKNEG_2"/&gt;

General Nasution was believed to have launched his own bid for power on 16 December 1965, when he won appointment to the Supreme Operations Command, and gained a grip over the traditionally civilian-held portion of the military hierarchy. It was reported that Nasution would have preferred forming a military [[military dictatorship|junta]] to replace Sukarno.&lt;ref name="NYT121665"&gt;''New York Times'', 16 December 1965&lt;/ref&gt; (''New York Times'', 16 December 1965.)

==Consequences==
{{see also|New Order (Indonesia)}}

===Anti-Chinese laws===
{{see also|Chinese Indonesians|Legislation on Chinese Indonesians}}

While resentment toward [[Chinese Indonesians]] by indigenous Indonesians-descended peoples of the archipelago dated back to the Dutch East Indies era, the New Order instigated anti-Chinese legislation following the quashing of the Communists. Stereotypes of the Chinese as disproportionately affluent and greedy were common throughout the time (both in Indonesia as well as Malaysia), but with the anti-communist hysteria, the association of the Chinese Indonesians with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] caused them to also be viewed as a communist [[fifth column]].&lt;ref name="Suryadinata2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Suryadinata|title=Ethnic Chinese in Contemporary Indonesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFNKQcvGNSAC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-230-835-1|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/104.htm | title=China | publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesia's hitherto friendly diplomatic relations with mainland China were severed, and the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta burnt down by a mob. New legislation included the banning of Chinese language signs on shops and other buildings, and the closure of [[Chinese language]] schools, adoption of "Indonesian" sounding names, and limits on [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple construction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===A new political system===
The liquidation and banning of the Communist Party (and related organisations) eliminated one of the largest political parties in Indonesia. It was also among the largest Communist Parties in the [[Communist International|Comintern]], at an estimated 3 million members. Along with the subsequent efforts by Suharto to wrest power from Sukarno by purging loyalists from the parliament, civilian government in Indonesia was effectively put to an end by the coup countermeasures.

Strident anti-communism remained a hallmark of the 31-year regime.&lt;ref name="Aspinall"&gt;Aspinall (1999), p i&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime that emerged from the upheavals of the 1960s was dedicated to maintaining political order, promoting economic development, and excluding mass participation from the political process. The military was given a strong role in politics, political and social organisations throughout the country were bureaucratised and corporatised, and a selective but effective and sometimes brutal repression was used against opponents of the regime.&lt;ref name="Aspinall" /&gt;

A number of seats in the Parliament were set-aside for the military under as part of the ''[[dwifungsi]]'' (dual function) doctrine. Under the system, the military took roles as administrators in all levels of government. The political parties not banned outright were consolidated into a single party, the Party of the Functional Groups (Indonesian: ''Partai Golongan Karya''), more commonly known as [[Golkar]]. Though Suharto would allow for the formation of two non-Golkar parties, these were kept weak during his regime.

===Rise of Islamism===
The purging of two secularist parties, the Nationalists and the Communists, had a notable side effect of giving greater space for the development of [[Islamism]] in Indonesia. This included liberal, conservative, and extremist groups practising [[Islam in Indonesia]].

===Improved ties with the West===
The change in regime brought a shift in policy that allowed [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] and other relief agencies to operate within the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Suharto would open Indonesia's economy by divesting state owned companies, and Western nations in particular were encouraged to invest and take control of many of the mining and construction interests in Indonesia. The result was stabilisation of the economy and the alleviation of absolute poverty and [[famine]] conditions that had resulted from shortfalls in the rice supply and Sukarno's reluctance to take Western aid.

As a result of his elimination of the communists, Suharto would come to be seen as a pro-Western and [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]]. An ongoing military and diplomatic relationship between the Indonesia and the Western powers was cemented, leading to American, British, and Australian arms sales and training of military personnel.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===US assistance to Suharto===
{{See also|Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66#Foreign involvement}}

Some experts assert that the United States directly facilitated and encouraged the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in Indonesia during the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/telegrams-confirm-scale-of-us-complicity-in-1965-genocide/|title=Telegrams confirm scale of US complicity in 1965 genocide|last= Melvin|first=Jess|date=20 October 2017|website=Indonesia at Melbourne|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]]|access-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Scott|first=Margaret|date=26 October 2017|title=Uncovering Indonesia's Act of Killing|url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/10/20/uncovering-indonesias-act-of-killing/|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|location= |access-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the [[National Security Archive]], says "Washington did everything in its power to encourage and facilitate the army-led massacre of alleged PKI members, and U.S. officials worried only that the killing of the party's unarmed supporters might not go far enough, permitting Sukarno to return to power and frustrate the [Johnson] Administration's emerging plans for a post-Sukarno Indonesia."&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Bradley. ''[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=7853 Economists with Guns: Authoritarian Development and U.S.–Indonesian Relations, 1960-1968].'' [[Stanford University Press]], 2010. p. 193. {{ISBN|0804771820}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Simpson, the terror in Indonesia was an "essential building block of the quasi [[neo-liberal]] policies the West would attempt to impose on Indonesia in the years to come".&lt;ref&gt;Brad Simpson (2009). [http://www.insideindonesia.org/accomplices-in-atrocity Accomplices in atrocity]. ''[[Inside Indonesia]].'' Retrieved 6 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian John Roosa, commenting on documents released from the US embassy in Jakarta in 2017, says they confirm that "the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bevins |first=Vincent |date=20 October 2017 |title=What the United States Did in Indonesia|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/the-indonesia-documents-and-the-us-agenda/543534/|work= The Atlantic|location= |access-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey B. Robinson, historian at UCLA, argues that without the support of the U.S. and other powerful Western states, the Indonesian Army's program of mass killings would not have happened.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |last= Robinson|first=Geoffrey B.|date= 2018|title=The Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Massacres, 1965-66|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11135.html|location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=|isbn=9781400888863|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–23, 177}}

As early as 1958, the U.S. and its allies backed anti-communist elements within the Indonesian Army with secret assurances, financial and military support, and this support solidified once the mass killing campaigns were underway, demonstrating the "resolve" of the army.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|83, 179}} During the height of the violence, U.S. embassy official Robert J. Martens provided lists containing roughly 5,000 names of high ranking PKI members to the Indonesian Army, which, according to Robinson, "almost certainly aided in the death or detention of many innocent people". He notes that providing these kill lists "sent a powerful message that the US government agreed with and supported the army's campaign against the PKI, even as that campaign took its terrible toll in human lives."&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|202–203}}
