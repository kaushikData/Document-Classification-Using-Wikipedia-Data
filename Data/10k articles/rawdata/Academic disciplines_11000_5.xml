'''Active duty''' is a full-time occupation as part of a military force, as opposed to [[Military reserve force|reserve duty]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] the equivalent term is '''active service'''.

==India==
The [[Indian Armed Forces]] are considered to be one of the [[List of countries by size of armed forces|largest active service forces in the world]], with almost 1.42 million Active Standing Army. An additional 2.20 million reserve forces can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of India]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[India]]. This does not include the additional 1.40 million troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of India|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==Israel==
In the [[Israel Defense Forces]], there are two types of active duty: regular service ({{lang-he|שרות סדיר}}, ''Sherut Sadir''), and active [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reserve duty]] ({{lang-he|שרות מילואים פעיל}} ''Sherut Milu'im Pa'il'', abbr. ''Shamap''). Regular service refers to either mandatory service ({{lang-he|שרות חובה}}, ''Sherut Hova''), according to the laws of [[Israel]], or [[standing army]] service ({{lang-he|שרות קבע}}, ''Sherut Keva''), which consists of paid [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]].

Active reserve service refers to the actual time in which reservists are called up. This varies from once every few years to a month every year. During active reserve duty, [[military law]] can be applied to reservists, similarly to regular soldiers.

==Pakistan==
The [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] are one of the largest active service forces in the world, with almost 617,000 full-time personnel, due to the complex and volatile nature of Pakistan's relationship with India and the Kashmir region, and its porous border with Afghanistan. An additional 513,000 part-time reservists (including armed civilians of [[FATA]]) can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of Pakistan]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[Pakistan]]. This does not include the additional 427,627 troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==United States==
In the [[military of the United States|United States military]], active duty refers to military members who are currently serving on full-time status in their military capacity. Full-time status is not limited to members of the active components of the military services; members of any of the [[United States Armed Forces#Personnel in each service|three components]] (active, [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve]], and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]) may be placed into active status. All personnel in the active components are in active status.  Reservists may be placed into active status as units or individuals.  Units may be mobilized in support of operations, such as the reserve units that have been deployed in support of the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]] or those called up within the United States to provide [[Defense Support of Civil authorities|support to civil authorities]]. Individuals may be placed in active status as part of the [[Active Guard Reserve]] program, as augmentees to  active or reserve component units, or to attend full-time military training.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29806">{{short description|The bacterial component of the plankton that drifts in the water column}}
'''Bacterioplankton''' refers to the [[bacterium|bacterial]] component of the [[plankton]] that drifts in the water column.  The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''{{lang|grc|πλανκτος}}'' (''{{lang|grc-Latn|planktos}}''), meaning "wanderer" or "drifter", and ''{{lang|la|bacterium}}'', a [[Latin]] term coined in the 19th century by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]].  They are found in both [[seawater]] and [[freshwater]].

Bacterioplankton occupy a range of [[ecological niche]]s in marine and aquatic ecosystems. They are both primary producers and primary consumers in these ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycling of elements essential for life (e.g., carbon and nitrogen). Many bacterioplankton species are [[autotroph]]ic, and derive energy from either [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemosynthesis]]. Photosynthetic bacterioplankton are often categorized as [[phytoplankton|picophytoplankton]], and include major [[cyanobacteria]]l groups such as ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' and ''[[Synechococcus]]''. Other heterotrophic bacterioplankton are [[saprotroph]]ic, and obtain energy by consuming organic material produced by other organisms. This material may be [[Dissolved Organic Carbon|dissolved]] in the medium and taken directly from there, or bacteria may live and grow in association with particulate material such as [[marine snow]]. Bacterioplankton play critical roles in global [[nitrogen fixation]], [[nitrification]], [[denitrification]], [[remineralisation]] and [[methanogen]]esis.

Bacterioplankton [[Bacterioplankton counting methods|abundance]] depends on environmental variables like temperature, nutrient availability and predation. Like other small plankton, the bacterioplankton are [[predation|preyed]] upon by [[zooplankton]] (usually [[protozoa]]ns), and their numbers are also controlled through [[infection]] by [[bacteriophage]]s.

== Major groups ==

=== Photosynthetic Bacterioplankton ===
Photosynthetic bacterioplankton are responsible for a large proportion of the total [[primary production]] of aquatic food webs, supplying organic compounds to higher trophic levels. These bacteria undergo [[Photosynthesis|oxygenic]] and [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]]. Differences between these processes can be seen in the byproducts produced, the primary electron donor, and the light harvesting pigments used for energy capture.

[[Cyanobacteria]] are a large group of photosynthetic bacterioplankton, often growing as cells or in filamentous colonies.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Photosynthetic Prokaryotes {{!}} SpringerLink|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-1332-9|year = 1992|isbn = 978-1-4757-1334-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organisms are the dominant group of bacterioplankton using oxygenic photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems.

Other photosynthetic bacterioplankton, including purple and green bacteria, undergo anoxygenic photosynthesis in anaerobic conditions. The pigments synthesized in these organisms are sensitive to oxygen. In purple bacteria the major pigments include [[bacteriochlorophyll]] a and b and carotenoids.  Green bacteria have different light harvesting pigments consisting of bacteriochlorophyll c, d and e.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt; These organisms do not produce oxygen through photosynthesis or use water as a reducing agent. Many of these organisms use sulfur, hydrogen or other compounds as an energy source to drive photosynthesis. Most of these bacterioplankton are found in anoxic waters, including stagnant and hypersaline environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopylov|first=Alexander I.|last2=Kosolapov|first2=Dmitriy B.|last3=Degermendzhy|first3=Nadezhda N.|last4=Zotina|first4=Tatiana A.|last5=Romanenko|first5=Anna V.|date=2002-04-01|title=Phytoplankton, bacterial production and protozoan bacterivory in stratified, brackish-water Lake Shira (Khakasia, Siberia)|journal=Aquatic Ecology|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=205–218|doi=10.1023/a:1015611023296|issn=1386-2588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heterotrophic Bacterioplankton ===
Heterotrophic bacterioplankton rely on the available concentration of dissolved organic matter in the water column. Usually these organisms are saprophytic, absorbing nutrients from their surroundings. These heterotrophs also play a key role in the microbial loop and the remineralization of organic compounds like carbon and nitrogen. Pelagibacterales, also known as members of an alphaproteobacteria clade, are the most abundant bacterioplankton in the oceans. Members of this group are found in waters with low nutrient availability and are preyed on by protists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robert M.|last2=Rappé|first2=Michael S.|last3=Connon|first3=Stephanie A.|last4=Vergin|first4=Kevin L.|last5=Siebold|first5=William A.|last6=Carlson|first6=Craig A.|last7=Giovannoni|first7=Stephen J.|date=December 2002|title=SAR11 clade dominates ocean surface bacterioplankton communities|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=420|issue=6917|pages=806–810|doi=10.1038/nature01240|pmid=12490947|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=JJ|last2=Findlay|first2=S|last3=Pace|first3=ML|title=Bacterial production in fresh and saltwater ecosystems: a cross-system overview|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/43/m043p001.pdf|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=43|pages=1–10|doi=10.3354/meps043001|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogeochemical cycling ==

=== Carbon ===
Atmospheric carbon is sequestered into the ocean by three main pumps which have been known for 30 years: the [[solubility pump]], the [[carbonate pump]], and the [[Biological pump|biological carbon pump]] (BCP).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-05-01|title=The microbial carbon pump concept: Potential biogeochemical significance in the globally changing ocean|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661115000105|journal=Progress in Oceanography|language=en|volume=134|pages=432–450|doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2015.01.008|issn=0079-6611|last1=Legendre|first1=Louis|last2=Rivkin|first2=Richard B.|last3=Weinbauer|first3=Markus G.|last4=Guidi|first4=Lionel|last5=Uitz|first5=Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological carbon pump is a vertical transmission pump driven mainly by the sinking of organic rich particles. Bacterial phytoplankton near the surface incorporate atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other nutrients into their biomass during photosynthesis. At the time of their death these phytoplankton, along with their incorporated carbon, sink to the bottom of the ocean where the carbon remains for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780080959757006045|last=De La Rocha|first=C.L.|last2=Passow|first2=U.|pages=93–122|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-095975-7.00604-5|title=Treatise on Geochemistry|year=2014|isbn=9780080983004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other biologically mediated sequestration of carbon in the ocean occurs through the microbial pump. The microbial pump is responsible for the production of old recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which is &gt;100 years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Plankton in the ocean are incapable of breaking down this recalcitrant DOC and thus it remains in the oceans for 1000's years without being respired. The two pumps work simultaneously, and the balance between them is believed to vary based on the availability of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polimene|first=Luca|last2=Sailley|first2=Sevrine|last3=Clark|first3=Darren|last4=Mitra|first4=Aditee|last5=Allen|first5=J Icarus|date=2017-03-01|title=Biological or microbial carbon pump?

Scientific Affairs Division.|isbn=9781402020872|location=Dordrecht|oclc=54974524}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when bacterioplankton and other organisms in the ocean consume organic matter and respire CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and as a result of the solubility equilibrium between the ocean and the atmosphere.

=== Nitrogen ===
[[File:Marine Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|A schematic showing the cycling of nitrogen within the ocean.]]
The nitrogen cycle in the oceans is mediated by microorganisms, many of which are bacteria, performing multiple conversions such as: [[nitrogen fixation]], [[denitrification]], [[Nitrogen assimilation|assimilation]], and anaerobic ammonia oxidation ([[anammox]]). There are many different nitrogen metabolism strategies employed by bacterioplankton. Starting with molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is fixed by [[Diazotroph|diazatrophs]] such as [[trichodesmium]] into usable forms like ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergman|first=Birgitta|last2=Sandh|first2=Gustaf|last3=Lin|first3=Senjie|last4=Larsson|first4=John|last5=Carpenter|first5=Edward J|date=20 September 2012|title=Trichodesmium – a widespread marine cyanobacterium with unusual nitrogen fixation properties | journal=Fems Microbiology Reviews|volume=37|issue=3|pages=286–302|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2012.00352.x|pmc=3655545|pmid=22928644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ammonia can then be assimilated into organic matter like amino and nucleic acids, by both photoautrophic and heterotrophic plankton, it can also be [[Nitrification|nitrified]] to NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for energy production by nitrifying bacteria. Finally the use of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as [[Electron acceptor|terminal electron acceptors]] reduces the nitrogen back into N&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; which is then released back into the atmosphere thus closing the cycle.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zehr|first=Jonathan P.|last2=Kudela|first2=Raphael M.|title=Nitrogen Cycle of the Open Ocean: From Genes to Ecosystems|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=197–225|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142819|pmid=21329204|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important process involved in the regeneration of atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is anammox.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases|volume=15|last=Reimann|first=Joachim|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

=== Dissolved Organic Matter ===
[[Dissolved organic carbon|Dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) is available in many forms in the ocean, and is responsible for supporting the growth of bacteria and microorganisms in the ocean. The two main sources of this dissolved organic matter are; decomposition of higher trophic level organisms like plants and fish, and secondly DOM in runoffs that pass through soil with high levels of organic material. It is important to note that the age and quality of the DOM is important for its usability by microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Søndergaard|last2=Middelboe|date=1995-03-09|title=A cross-system analysis of labile dissolved organic carbon|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v118/p283-294/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=118|pages=283–294|doi=10.3354/meps118283|issn=0171-8630}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the DOM in the oceans is refractory or semi-labile and is not available for biodegradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruber|first=David F.|last2=Simjouw|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Seitzinger|first3=Sybil P.|last4=Taghon|first4=Gary L.|date=2006-06-01|title=Dynamics and Characterization of Refractory Dissolved Organic Matter Produced by a Pure Bacterial Culture in an Experimental Predator-Prey System|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/72/6/4184|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=72|issue=6|pages=4184–4191|doi=10.1128/aem.02882-05|issn=0099-2240|pmid=16751530|pmc=1489638}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above the microbial pump is responsible for the production of refractory DOM which is unavailable for biodegradation and remains dissolved in the oceans for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The turnover of labile DOM organic material is quite high due to scarcity, this is important for the support of multiple trophic levels in the microbial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirchman|first=David L.|last2=Suzuki|first2=Yoshimi|last3=Garside|first3=Christopher|last4=Ducklow|first4=Hugh W.|date=1991|title=High turnover rates of dissolved organic carbon during a spring phytoplankton bloom|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/352612a0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=352|issue=6336|pages=612–614|doi=10.1038/352612a0|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uptake and respiration of DOM by heterotrophs closes the cycle by producing CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt;

Predation of ciliates is analogous to predation by flagellates on bacteria as well.

[[Bacterioplankton counting methods|Estimates of bacterioplankton abundance and density]] can be derived with a variety of methods including direct counts, flow cytometry, and conclusions drawn from metabolic measures.

Further, as discussed in the biogeochemical cycling section, plankton are responsible for the recycling and movement of essential nutrients (i.e. nitrogen/carbon/DOM) which are essential building blocks for many of the organisms co-existing with bacterioplankton in these ecosystems. These recycled nutrients can be reused by primary producers, thus increasing the efficiency of the biological food web and minimizing energy waste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2277">Chemical Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) is a [[bioassay]] used in the detection of specific chemicals in samples. It consists of a modified cell line that has a [[DNA construct]] with a [[luciferase]] [[reporter gene]] in conjunction with [[response elements]] that can induce [[Transcription_(genetics)|transcription]] of the inserted [[gene]] for the light-generating enzyme. The response elements can be varied in order to provide binding sites for other receptors that relate to a chemical of interest that is wished to be detected. The CALUX bioassay has thus been redesigned to detect certain chemicals of interest. Most applications have been oriented in detecting environmentally harmful chemicals like [[environmental hormones]].

CALUX is an effect based screening method as it measures the total effect [[ligands]] (from a sample) have on a receptor. Unlike [[chemical analysis]], CALUX is thus able to measure all activity on the receptor of interest. This also includes unidentified [[Congener_(chemistry)|congeners]] of certain ligands.

==Applications==
Dioxin Responsive (DR)CALUX is a bioassay used in the detection of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]]. It is based on the mechanisms of the [[AhR]]-pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murk,|first=A.J. |author2=J. Legler |author3=M.S. Denison |author4=J.P. Giesy |author5=C. van de Guchte |author6=A.

Chronic activation of the AhR-pathway by these compounds has been shown to cause cancer in the predominantly the liver and can cause developmental defects in [[vertebrates]]. DR CALUX is used by companies that want to screen for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in order to guarantee [[food safety]] of their products. Dioxins are considered to be the most toxic man-made chemical.

'''Cautelary jurisprudence''' is [[law]] made in a precautionary way prior to or outside of the normal [[Legislature|legislative enactment]]. It meant empirical, practical legal efforts aimed at solving individual cases, as distinguished from regular [[jurisprudence]] which sought to establish abstract rules under which individual cases would fall.&lt;ref&gt;Tuori, Kaius. ''Ancient Roman Lawyers and Modern Legal Ideals: Studies on the Impact of Contemporary Concerns in the Interpretation of Ancient Roman Legal History'' Vittorio Klostermann: 2007 {{ISBN|3-465-04034-1}} {{ISBN|9783465040347}}; p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Its first proponent was [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex]], who thus gave his name to the Roman designation for this kind of law, the ''[[cautio muciana]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary law is a tentative "procedure" used by [[lawyers]]. Initially, in [[Ancient Rome]], the idea of [[inheritance]] as being subject to conditions was not in practice. With ''cautio muciana'' it gave those who are to inherit a legacy, the ''[[legatee]]s'', a "negative authority" over something which otherwise would not have occurred until the death of the owner of the legacy, the ''[[legator]]''. It thus also makes it possible for the legator to gain promises from legatees.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The legatee provides a [[stipulatio]] or ''cautio'', promising something in return for a legacy. Thus, for example, it may be stipulated in the negative, "I agree that I can have full and exclusive use of, and live in the house, so long as I am not married."

The ''cautio muciana'' is one of a long list of legal devices invented used by the Romans to address practical situations without changes of general principles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary jurisprudence nowadays is associated with [[inheritance law]] and the administration of [[trusts]]. The various inventions by lawyers of these new, arrangements, or forms of law, are often enacted outside of nation or state legislature, but with agreement amongst other lawyers and/or [[judge]]s. Often, many years later, such arrangements are fully enacted as a 'catching up' exercise by the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[telecommunications]], the '''center frequency''' of a filter or channel is a measure of a central frequency between the upper and lower [[cutoff frequency|cutoff frequencies]].  It is usually defined as either the [[arithmetic mean]] or the [[geometric mean]] of the lower cutoff frequency and the upper cutoff frequency of a [[band-pass filter|band-pass system]] or a [[band-stop filter|band-stop system]].

Typically, the geometric mean is used in systems based on certain transformations of [[lowpass filter]] designs, where the [[frequency response]] is constructed to be symmetric on a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] frequency scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = CRC Handbook of Electrical Filters | author = John T.

The arithmetic definition is used in more general situations, such as in describing [[passband]] [[telecommunication]] systems, where filters are not necessarily symmetric but are treated on a linear frequency scale for applications such as [[frequency-division multiplexing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fiber Optics Illustrated Dictionary | author = Julie K.

== Influences from Marxism ==

=== Frantz Fanon ===
Frantz Fanon's Marxist writings on [[imperialism]], [[racism]], and decolonizing struggles have influenced post-colonial discussions about the internalization of colonial prejudice. Fanon first tackled the problem of, what he called, the "colonial alienation of the person"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Skin,  White Masks|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2008|isbn=978 0 7453 2849 2|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a mental health issue through [[Psychiatric assessment|psychiatric]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Michael|last2=Walter|first2=Garry|date=2009|title=Frantz Fanon and the confluence of psychiatry, politics, ethics and culture|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/frantz-fanon-and-the-confluence-of-psychiatry-politics-ethics-and-culture/CBD3BF91C1D4CCE616DA14F16D492697|journal=Acta Neuropsychiatrica|volume=21|issue=6|pages=308–309|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5215.2009.00428.x|issn=0924-2708|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' ([[French language|French]]: ''Les Damnés de la Terre),'' published in 1961, Fanon used psychiatry to analyze how [[French Algeria|French colonization]] and the carnage of the [[Algerian War]] had mentally affected Algerians' [[National identity|self-identity]] and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Vikki|date=2011-01-04|title=Introduction: Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth 50 Years On|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276410383721|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=27|issue=7-8|pages=7–14|doi=10.1177/0263276410383721}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that during the period of colonization there was a subtle and constant mental pathology that developed within the colonial psyche.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=250|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanon argued that the colonial psyche is fractured by the lack of mental and material homogeneity as a result of the colonial power's [[Western culture]] being pressured onto the colonized population despite the existing material differences between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=194|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here Fanon expands traditional Marxist understandings of [[historical materialism]] to explore how the dissonance between [[Base and superstructure|material existence and culture]] functions to transform the colonized people through the mold of the Western [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=162|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the native Algerian came to view their own traditional culture and identity through the lens of colonial prejudice. Fanon observed that average Algerians internalized and then openly repeated remarks that were in line with the institutionalized racist culture of the French colonizers; dismissing their own culture as backward due to the internalization of Western colonial ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=161|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fanon this results in a destabilizing existential conflict within the colonized culture:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In [[Western world|the West]], the family circle, the effects of education, and the relatively high [[standard of living]] of the working class provide a more or less efficient protection against the harmful action of these pastimes. But in an African country, where mental development is uneven, where the violent collision of two worlds has considerably shaken old traditions and thrown the universe of the perceptions out of focus, the impressionability and sensibility of the Young African are at the mercy of the various assaults made upon them by the very Nature of Western Culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://abahlali.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Frantz-Fanon-The-Wretched-of-the-Earth-1965.pdf|title=The Wretched of the Earth|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|publisher=Grove Press, Inc|others=Sartre, Jean-Paul, 1905-1980, Farrington, Constance,|year=1961|isbn=0802150837|location=New York|pages=194–195|oclc=1316464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is usually used in a derogatory fashion, connoting disloyalty to India. It derives from 19th century British historian, politician, and colonial administrator [[Thomas Macaulay]], who regarded [[British culture]] as superior to Indian culture and who famously argued in favor of replacing Indian languages/dialects with [[English language|English]] as the medium of instruction in educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html|title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay|last=Pritchett|first=Frances|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Stephen|date=2002-09-01|title=Macaulay's Minute Revisited: Colonial Language Policy in Nineteenth-century India|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01434630208666469|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=23|issue=4|pages=260–281|doi=10.1080/01434630208666469|issn=0143-4632}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of this development can still be felt in contemporary India, where the use of English, as opposed to [[Hindi]], still carries with it a level of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prasad|first=G.

==Spanish Empire==

In the colonial territories administered by the [[Spanish Empire]], [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] between Spaniard settlers and the [[indigenous peoples]] resulted in the restrictive racial classes, like [[mestizo]], which promoted Spanish cultural hegemony and restricted '[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|Otherness]]' within these colonized societies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangan|first=Jane E.|date=2013|title=Moving Mestizos in Sixteenth-Century Peru: Spanish Fathers, Indigenous Mothers, and the Children In Between|jstor=10.5309/willmaryquar.70.2.0273|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=70|issue=2|pages=273–294|doi=10.5309/willmaryquar.70.2.0273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zuniqa|first=Jean-Paul|date=1999|title=The Power of Blood: From Mestizo to the Idea of Race Mixture in Spanish Colonial America|url=|journal=Annales|volume=54 |issue=2|pages=425|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]Mestizos and other mixed raced combinations were categorized into different [[casta]]s by colonial administrators as a means of maintaining Spanish dominance over the majority.

These racial categories punished those with [[Black African]], [[Afro-Latinos|Afro-Latin]], or ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indígenas]]'' (natives) heritage specifically.  With those of European descent given privilege over these other mixtures. As a result of this system, Mestizos struggled to downplay their indigenous heritage and cultural trappings, in order to appear superficially more Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957615716|title=Playing in the cathedral : music, race, and status in New Spain|last=Ramos-Kittrell|first=Jesús A.|isbn=0190236833|location=New York, NY|oclc=957615716}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/466659990|title=Maya or mestizo? : nationalism, modernity, and its discontents|last=Ronald.|first=Loewe,|date=2011|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=|isbn=9781442601420|location=Toronto|pages=1–5|oclc=466659990}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these internalized prejudices individuals' choices of clothes, occupations, and forms of religious expression.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/664565692|title=Indians and mestizos in the "lettered city" : reshaping justice, social hierarchy, and political culture in colonial Peru|last=1954-|first=Dueñas, Alcira,|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Colorado|isbn=9781607320197|location=Boulder, Colo.|oclc=664565692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those of mixed racial identities who wanted to receive the institutional benefits of being Spanish (such as higher educational institutions and career opportunities), could do so by suppressing their own cultures and acting with "Spanishness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933580544|title=Playing in the cathedral : music, race, and status in New Spain|last=Ramos-Kittrell|first=Jesús A.|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780190236816|location=New York, NY|pages=37–38|oclc=933580544}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mentality lead to commonplace racial forgery in Latin America, often accompanied by legitimizing oral accounts of a Spanish ancestor and a Spanish surname.

In this heavily racial segregated context, the [[encomienda]] system was put in place. Under this system, entire native communities could be used as forced labor under the guise of collecting tribute.

===Philippines===

{{Main|Filipino mestizos}}

Prior to colonization by the Spanish (1565-1898), the [[Sulu Archipelago]] (located in southern Philippines) was a colony of the [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293–1527) based in Indonesia. The Americans were the last country to colonize the [[Philippines]] (1898–1946) and nationalists claim that it continues to act as a [[neo-colony]] of the US despite its formal independence in 1946.&lt;ref name="Gómez Rivera 2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gómez Rivera|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|García|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines colonial mentality is most evident in the preference for [[Mestizo#Philippines|Filipino mestizos]] (primarily those of mixed [[Filipino people|native Filipino]] and [[white (people)|white]] ancestry, but also mixed indigenous Filipino and [[Chinese race|Chinese]], and other ethnic groups) in the entertainment industry and mass media, in which they have received extensive exposure despite constituting a small fraction of the population.&lt;ref name="americanchronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=11261|title=Americanchronicle.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the 'racist' BAYO advert real?|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/260881/scitech/socialmedia/is-the-racist-bayo-advert-real|work=6 June 2012|publisher=GMA News Online|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The semantics of 'mestizo'|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/267061/lifestyle/culture/the-semantics-of-mestizo|work=27 July 2012|publisher=GMA News|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Cádiz Constitution of 1812]] automatically gave [[Spanish nationality law|Spanish citizenship]] to all Filipinos regardless of race.&lt;ref name="Gómez Rivera 2000"/&gt; The census of 1870 stated that at least one-third of the population of [[Luzon]] had partial Hispanic ancestry (from varying points of origin and ranging from [[Latin America]] to Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Jagor, Fëdor, et al. (1870). [http://www.authorama.com/former-philippines-b-8.html ''The Former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined number of all types of white mestizos or Eurasians is 3.6%, according to a genetic study by [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2001_v68_p432.pdf |title=A Predominantly Indigenous Paternal Heritage for the Austronesian-Speaking Peoples of Insular Southeast Asia and Oceania |accessdate=2008-02-20 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214223039/http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2001_v68_p432.pdf |archivedate=14 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contradicted by another genetic study done by California University which stated that Filipinos possess moderate amounts of European admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2015/06/18/genetics.115.178616.full.pdf+html|author= *Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco

Evidence suggests that fair skin was a characteristic of the cloistered ''[[binukot]]'', who were often kept indoors from a very early age. In historical epics of the Philippines their fair skin was presented as a standard of beauty among the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abrera|2008-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cite this as proof that desire for light-colored skin predates colonial influences.

One of the more adverse physical consequences in the idealization and acceptance of colonial mentality can be seen in the high rate of consumer demand for [[skin bleaching]] products used by some indigenous women and a smaller percentage of indigenous men and dark-skinned mestizas and mestizos, in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="americanchronicle.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston2003"&gt;Counter, S.

Demand in the Philippines and in some other tropical countries continue to be widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.niu.edu/ptaa/beauty_in_me.htm|title=The Beauty In Me&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715193304/http://www3.niu.edu/ptaa/beauty_in_me.htm|archivedate=15 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''critical period hypothesis''' is the subject of a long-standing debate in [[linguistics]] and [[language acquisition]] over the extent to which the ability to acquire [[language]] is biologically linked to age. The hypothesis claims that there is an ideal time window to acquire language in a linguistically rich environment, after which further language acquisition becomes much more difficult and effortful.

The critical period hypothesis states that the first few years of life is the crucial time in which an individual can acquire a [[first language]] if presented with adequate stimuli. If language input does not occur until after this time, the individual will never achieve a full command of language—especially [[grammar|grammatical systems]].

The evidence for such a period is limited, and support stems largely from theoretical arguments and analogies to other [[critical period]]s in biology such as [[visual system|visual development]], but nonetheless is widely accepted. The nature of such a critical period, however, has been one of the most fiercely debated issues in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive science]] in general for decades. Some writers have suggested a "sensitive" or "optimal" period rather than a critical one; others dispute the causes (physical maturation, cognitive factors). The duration of the period also varies greatly in different accounts.

In [[second-language acquisition]], the strongest empirical evidence for the critical period hypothesis is in the study of [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], where most older learners do not reach a native-like level. However, under certain conditions, native-like accent has been observed, suggesting that accent is affected by [[individual variation in second-language acquisition|multiple factors]], such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[second-language acquisition#Motivation|motivation]], rather than a critical period biological constraint.

==History==
The critical period hypothesis was first proposed by Montreal neurologist [[Wilder Penfield]] and co-author Lamar Roberts in their 1959 book ''Speech and Brain Mechanisms'',{{sfn|Penfield|Roberts|1959}} and was popularized by [[Eric Lenneberg]] in 1967 with ''Biological Foundations of Language.''{{sfn|Lenneberg|1967}}

Lenneberg's critical period hypothesis states that there are maturational constraints on the time a first language can be acquired. First-language acquisition relies on [[neuroplasticity]]. If [[language acquisition]] does not occur by puberty, some aspects of language can be learned but full mastery cannot be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lenneberg|1967|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the critical period theory stems largely from theoretical arguments and analogies to other critical periods in biology such as visual development. Strictly speaking, the experimentally verified [[Critical period#Vision|critical period]] relates to a time span during which ''damage'' to the development of the visual system can occur, for example if animals are deprived of the necessary binocular input for developing [[stereopsis]]. It has however been considered "likely",{{sfn|Fawcett|Wang|Birch|2005}} and has in many cases been flatly presented as fact, that experimental evidence would point to a comparable critical period also for ''recovery'' of such development and ''treatment''; however this is a hypothesis. Recently, doubts have arisen concerning the validity of this critical period hypothesis with regard to visual development, in particular since the time it became known that neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]] and others have [[Stereopsis recovery|achieved stereopsis]] as adults, long after the supposed critical period for acquiring this skill.{{sfnm|1a1=Sacks|1y=2006|2a1=Barry|2y=2010}}

Recently, it has been suggested that if a critical period does exist, it may be due at least partially to the delayed development of the [[prefrontal cortex]] in human children.&lt;ref name="Thompson-Schill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson-Schill|Ramscar|Chrysikou|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramscar|Gitcho|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have suggested that delayed development of the [[prefrontal cortex]] and an associated delay in the development of [[cognitive control]] may facilitate convention learning, allowing young children to learn language far more easily than cognitively mature adults and older children.  This pattern of prefrontal development is unique to humans among similar mammalian (and primate) species, and may explain why humans—and not chimpanzees—are so adept at learning language.{{sfn|Dye|2010}}

==Second-language acquisition==
The theory has often been extended to a critical period for [[second-language acquisition]] (SLA), although this is much less widely accepted. Certainly, older learners of a [[second language]] rarely achieve the native-like fluency that younger learners display, despite often progressing faster than children in the initial stages. [[David Singleton]] states that in learning a second language, "younger = better in the long run", but points out that there are many exceptions, noting that five percent of adult bilinguals master a second language even though they begin learning it when they are well into adulthood—long after any critical period has presumably come to a close.{{sfn|Singleton|Lengyel|1995}}

While the window for learning a second language never completely closes, certain linguistic aspects appear to be more affected by the age of the learner than others. For example, adult second-language learners nearly always retain an immediately identifiable foreign accent, including some who display perfect grammar.{{sfn|Oyama| 1976}} A possible explanation for why this foreign accent remains is that [[pronunciation]], or phonology, is susceptible to the critical period.{{sfn|Singleton|Lengyel|1995}} The pronunciation of speech sounds relies on neuromuscular function. Adults learning a new language are unlikely to attain a convincing native accent since they are past the prime age of learning new neuromuscular functions, and therefore pronunciations. Writers have suggested a younger critical age for learning phonology than for morphemes and syntax. {{harvtxt|Singleton|Lengyel|1995}} reports that there is no critical period for learning vocabulary in a second language because vocabulary is learned consciously using declarative memory.{{sfn|Paradis|1999|pp=59–60}} The attrition of [[procedural memory]] with age results in the increased use of declarative memory to learn new languages, which is an entirely different process from L1 (first language) learning. The plasticity of procedural memory is argued to decline after the age of 5. The attrition of procedural memory plasticity inhibits the ability of an L2 user to speak their second language automatically. It can still take conscious effort even if they are exposed to the second language as early as age 3. This effort is observed by measuring brain activity. L2-users that are exposed to their second language at an early age and are everyday users show lower levels of brain activity when using their L1 than when using their L2. This suggests that additional resources are recruited when speaking their L2 and it is therefore a more strenuous process.

The critical period hypothesis in SLA follows a "use it '''then''' lose it" approach, which dictates that as a person ages, excess neural circuitry used during L1 learning is essentially broken down.{{sfn|Birdsong|1999|p=5}} If these neural structures remained intact they would cost unnecessary metabolic energy to maintain. The structures necessary for L1 use are kept. On the other hand, a second "use it '''or''' lose it" approach dictates that if an L2 user begins to learn at an early age and continues on through his life, then his language-learning circuitry should remain active. This approach is also called the "exercise hypothesis".{{sfn|Birdsong|1999|p=6}}

There is much debate over the timing of the critical period with respect to SLA, with estimates ranging between 2 and 13 years of age.{{sfnm|1a1=Paradis|1y=1999|1pp=59–60|2a1=Loewen|2a2= Reinders|2y=2011}} These estimates tend to vary depending on what component of the language learning process a researcher considers. For instance, if an SLA researcher is studying L2 ''phonological'' development, they will likely conclude that the critical period ends at around age 3. If another SLA researcher is studying L2 ''syntactical'' development, they may conclude that the critical period ends at a much later age. These differences in research focus are what create the critical period timing debate.

Some writers have argued that the critical period hypothesis does not apply to SLA, and that second-language proficiency is determined by the time and effort put into the learning process, and not the learner's age.{{sfnm|1a1=Loewen|1a2= Reinders|1y=2011|2a1=Birdsong|2y=1999|2p=9}} {{Harvtxt|Robertson|2002}}  observed that factors  other than age may be even more significant in successful second-language learning, such as personal motivation, anxiety, input and output skills, and the learning environment. A combination of these factors often leads to [[individual variation in second-language acquisition]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=P.|date=2002|title=The Critical Age Hypothesis: A Critique of Research Methodology|url=|journal=Asian EFL Journal|volume=4 |issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On reviewing the published material, Bialystok and Hakuta (1994) conclude that second-language learning is not necessarily subject to biological critical periods, but "on average, there is a continuous decline in ability [to learn] with age."

==Experimental and observational studies==
How children acquire native language (L1) and the relevance of this to foreign language (L2) learning has long been debated. Although evidence for L2 learning ability declining with age is controversial, a common notion is that children learn L2s easily, whilst older learners rarely achieve fluency. This assumption stems from ‘[[critical period]]’ (CP) ideas. A CP was popularised by [[Eric Lenneberg]] in 1967 for L1 acquisition, but considerable interest now surrounds age effects on second-language acquisition (SLA). SLA theories explain learning processes and suggest causal factors for a possible CP for second language acquisition. These SLA-CP theories mainly attempt to explain apparent differences in language aptitudes of children and adults by distinct learning routes, and clarify these differences by discussing psychological mechanisms. Research explores these ideas and hypotheses, but results are varied: some demonstrate pre-pubescent children acquire language easily, and some that older learners have the advantage, whilst others focus on existence of a CP for SLA. Recent studies (e.g. Mayberry and Lock, 2003) have recognised certain aspects of SLA may be affected by age, whilst others remain intact. The objective of this study is to investigate whether capacity for vocabulary acquisition decreases with age.

Other work has challenged the biological approach; Krashen (1975) re-analysed clinical data used as evidence and concluded cerebral specialisation occurs much earlier than Lenneberg calculated. Therefore, if a CP exists, it does not coincide with lateralisation. Despite concerns with Lenneberg’s original evidence and the dissociation of lateralisation from the language CP idea, however, the concept of a CP remains a viable hypothesis, which later work has better explained and substantiated.

===Effects of aging===
A review of SLA theories and their explanations for age-related differences is necessary before considering empirical studies. The most reductionist theories are those of Penfield and Roberts (1959) and Lenneberg (1967), which stem from L1 and brain damage studies. Children who suffer impairment before puberty typically recover and (re-)develop normal language, whereas adults rarely recover fully, and often do not regain verbal abilities beyond the point reached five months after impairment. Both theories agree that children have a neurological advantage in learning languages, and that puberty correlates with a turning point in ability. They assert that language acquisition occurs primarily, possibly exclusively, during childhood as the brain loses plasticity after a certain age. It then becomes rigid and fixed, and loses the ability for adaptation and reorganisation, rendering language (re-)learning difficult. Penfield and Roberts (1959) claim children under nine can learn up to three languages: early exposure to different languages activates a reflex in the brain allowing them to switch between languages without confusion or translation into L1 (Penfield, 1964). Lenneberg (1967) asserts that if no language is learned by puberty, it cannot be learned in a normal, functional sense. He also supports Penfield and Roberts’ (1959) proposal of neurological mechanisms responsible for maturational change in language learning abilities. This, Lenneberg maintains, coincides with brain lateralisation and left-hemispherical specialisation for language around age thirteen: infants’ motor and linguistic skills develop simultaneously, but by age thirteen the cerebral hemispheres’ functions separate and become set, making language acquisition extremely difficult (Lenneberg, 1967).

===Deaf and feral children===
Cases of deaf and [[feral child]]ren provide evidence for a biologically determined CP for L1. Feral children are those not exposed to language in infancy/childhood due to being brought up in the wild, in isolation and/or confinement. A classic example is [[Genie (feral child)|'Genie']], a victim of [[child abuse]] who was deprived of social interaction from birth until discovered aged thirteen. Her father had judged her retarded at birth and had chosen to isolate her. She was kept strapped to a potty chair and forced to wear diapers. She was completely without language. Her case presented an ideal opportunity to test the theory that a nurturing environment could somehow make up for the total lack of language past the age of 12. After seven years of rehabilitation Genie still lacked linguistic competence, although the degree to which she acquired language is disputed.{{sfn|Jones}} Another case is 'Isabelle', who was incarcerated with her deaf-mute mother until the age of six and a half (pre-pubescent). She also had no language skills, but, unlike Genie, quickly acquired normal language abilities through systematic specialist training.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vvk2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=child+language+acquisition+and+development+matthew+saxton#v=onepage&amp;q=isabelle&amp;f=false|title=Child Language: Acquisition and Development|last=Saxton|first=Matthew|date=2017-10-02|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781526421906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors of the critical period hypothesis point out that in these examples and others like them (see [[feral child]]ren), the child is hardly growing up in a nurturing environment, and that the lack of language acquisition in later life may be due to the results of a generally abusive environment rather than being specifically due to a lack of exposure to language. Such studies are problematic; isolation can result in general retardation and emotional disturbances, which may confound conclusions drawn about language abilities.

Studies of deaf children learning American Sign Language (ASL) have fewer methodological weaknesses. Newport and Supalla &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newport|first=E.L.|last2=Supalla|first2=T.|date=n.d.a.|title=Critical Period Effects in the Acquisition of a Primary Language: The Influence of Maturational State on the Acquisition of Complex Morphology in American Sign Language|url=|journal=|volume=21|issue=1|pages=60–99|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied ASL acquisition in deaf children differing in age of exposure; few were exposed to ASL from birth, most of them first learned it at school. Results showed a linear decline in performance with increasing age of exposure; those exposed to ASL from birth performed best, and 'late learners' worst, on all production and comprehension tests. Their study thus provides direct evidence for language learning ability decreasing with age, but it does not add to Lenneberg's CP hypothesis as even the oldest children, the 'late learners', were exposed to ASL by age four, and had therefore not reached puberty, the proposed end of the CP. In addition, the declines were shown to be linear, with no sudden 'drop off' of ability at a certain age, as would be predicted by a strong CP hypothesis. That the children performed significantly worse may suggest that the CP ends earlier than originally postulated. However, this decline in performance may also be attributed in part to limitations of second language acquisition for hearing parents learning ASL.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Behavioural approaches===
Contrary to biological views, behavioural approaches assert that languages are learned as any other behaviour, through [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]. [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1957) details how [[operant conditioning]] forms connections with the environment through interaction and, alongside [[O. Hobart Mowrer]] (1960), applies the ideas to language acquisition. Mowrer hypothesises that languages are acquired through rewarded imitation of ‘language models’; the model must have an emotional link to the learner (e.g. parent, spouse), as imitation then brings pleasant feelings which function as [[positive reinforcement]]. Because new connections between behaviour and the environment are formed and reformed throughout life, it is possible to gain new skills, including language(s), at any age.

To explain observed language learning differences between children and adults, children are postulated to create countless new connections daily, and may handle the language learning process more effectively than do adults. This assumption, however, remains untested and is not a reliable explanation for children’s aptitude for L2 learning. Problematic of the behaviourist approach is its assumption that all learning, verbal and non-verbal, occurs through the same processes. A more general problem is that, as [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] (1995) notes, almost every sentence anybody voices is an original combination of words, never previously uttered, therefore a language cannot consist only of word combinations learned through repetition and conditioning; the brain must contain innate means of creating endless amounts of grammatical sentences from a limited vocabulary. This is precisely what Chomsky (1965) (reprinted as {{harvtxt|Chomsky|1969}}) argues with his proposition of a [[universal grammar]] (UG).

===Universal grammar===
{{harvtxt|Chomsky|1969}} asserts that environmental factors must be relatively unimportant for language emergence, as so many different factors surround children acquiring L1. Instead, Chomsky claims language learners possess innate principles building a '[[language acquisition device]]' (LAD) in the brain. These principles denote restricted possibilities for variation within the language, and enable learners to construct a grammar out of 'raw input' collected from the environment. Input alone cannot explain language acquisition because it is degenerated by characteristic features such as stutters, and lacks corrections from which learners discover incorrect variations.

Singleton and Newport (2004) demonstrate the function of UG in their study of 'Simon'. Simon learned ASL as his L1 from parents who had learned it as an L2 after puberty and provided him with imperfect models. Results showed Simon learned normal and logical rules and was able to construct an organised linguistic system, despite being exposed to inconsistent input. Chomsky developed UG to explain L1 acquisition data, but maintains it also applies to L2 learners who achieve near-native fluency not attributable solely to input and interaction {{harv|Chomsky|1969}}.

Although it does not describe an optimal age for SLA, the theory implies that younger children can learn languages more easily than older learners, as adults must reactivate principles developed during L1 learning and forge an SLA path: children can learn several languages simultaneously as long as the principles are still active and they are exposed to sufficient language samples (Pinker, 1995). The parents of Singleton and Newport's (2004) patient also had linguistic abilities in line with these age-related predictions; they learned ASL after puberty and never reached complete fluency.

====Problems within UG theory for L2 acquisition====
There are, however, problems with the extrapolation of the UG theory to SLA: L2 learners go through several phases of types of utterance that are not similar to their L1 or the L2 they hear. Other factors include the cognitive maturity of most L2 learners, that they have different motivation for learning the language, and already speak one language fluently. Other studies also highlight these problems: [[Stanislas Dehaene]] has investigated how cerebral circuits used to handling one language adapt for the efficient storage of two or more.{{sfn|Dehaene| Spelke| Pinel| Stanescu |1999}} He reports observations of cerebral activation when reading and translating two languages. They found the most activated brain areas during the tasks were not those generally associated with language, but rather those related to mapping [[orthography]] to [[phonology]]. They conclude that the left temporal lobe is the physical base of L1, but the L2 is 'stored' elsewhere, thus explaining cases of bilingual aphasia where one language remains intact. They maintain that only languages learned simultaneously from birth are represented, and cause activity, in the left hemisphere: any L2 learned later is stored separately (possibly in the right hemisphere), and rarely activates the left temporal lobe.

This suggests that L2 may be qualitatively different from L1 due to its dissociation from the 'normal' language brain regions, thus the extrapolation of L1 studies and theories to SLA is placed in question. A further disadvantage of UG is that supporting empirical data are taken from a limited sample of syntactic phenomena: a general theory of language acquisition should cover a larger range of phenomena. Despite these problems, several other theorists have based their own models of language learning on it. These ideas are supported by empirical evidence, which consequently supports Chomsky's ideas. Due to this support and its descriptive and explanatory strength, many theorists regard UG as the best explanation of language, and particularly grammar, acquisition.

====UG and the critical period hypothesis====
A key question about the relationship of UG and SLA is: is the [[language acquisition device]] posited by Chomsky and his followers still accessible to learners of a second language? The critical period hypothesis suggests that it becomes inaccessible at a certain age, and learners increasingly depended on explicit teaching. In other words, although all of language may be governed by UG, older learners might have great difficulty in gaining access to the target language's underlying rules from positive input alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singleton|first=David|date=2005-11-18|title=The Critical Period Hypothesis: A coat of many colours|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/iral.2005.43.issue-4/iral.2005.43.4.269/iral.2005.43.4.269.xml|journal=IRAL - International Review of Applied Linguistics in Language Teaching|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=269–285|doi=10.1515/iral.2005.43.4.269|issn=1613-4141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piaget===
[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] (1926) is one psychologist reluctant to ascribe specific innate linguistic abilities to children: he considers the brain a homogeneous computational system, with language acquisition being one part of general learning. He agrees this development may be innate, but claims there is no specific language acquisition module in the brain. Instead, he suggests external influences and social interaction trigger language acquisition: information collected from these sources constructs symbolic and functional schemata (thought or behaviour patterns). According to Piaget, cognitive development and language acquisition are lifelong active processes that constantly update and re-organise schemata. He proposes children develop L1 as they build a sense of identity in reference to the environment, and describes phases of general cognitive development, with processes and patterns changing systematically with age. Piaget assumes language acquisition is part of this complex cognitive development, and that these developmental phases are the basis for an optimal period for language acquisition in childhood. Interactionist approaches derived from Piaget’s ideas supports his theory. Some studies (e.g. Newport and Supalla)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; show that, rather than abrupt changes in SLA ability after puberty, language ability declines with age, coinciding with declines in other cognitive abilities, thus supporting Piaget.

===Krashen===
Although [[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]] (1975) also criticises this theory, he does not deny the importance of age for second-language acquisition. Krashen (1975) proposed theories for the close of the CP for L2 at puberty, based on Piaget’s cognitive stage of formal operations beginning at puberty, as the ‘ability of the formal operational thinker to construct abstract hypotheses to explain phenomena’ inhibits the individual’s natural ability for language learning.

The term "[[language acquisition]]" became commonly used after [[Stephen Krashen]] contrasted it with formal and non-constructive "learning." Today, most scholars use "language learning" and "language acquisition" interchangeably, unless they are directly addressing Krashen's work. However, "second-language acquisition" or "SLA" has become established as the preferred term for this academic discipline.

Though SLA is often viewed as part of [[applied linguistics]], it is typically concerned with the language system and learning processes themselves, whereas applied linguistics may focus more on the experiences of the learner, particularly in the classroom. Additionally, SLA has mostly examined ''naturalistic'' acquisition, where learners acquire a language with little formal training or teaching.
&lt;!-- This is extra material from excess critical period hypothesis left over at [[second language acquisition]]. See talk page for more details --&gt;

===Other directions of research===

====Effect of illiteracy====
Virtually all research findings on SLA to date build on data from literate learners. {{harvtxt|Tarone| Bigelow |Hansen |2009}} find significantly different results when replicating standard SLA studies with low literate L2 learners. Specifically, learners with lower alphabetic literacy levels are significantly less likely to notice corrective feedback on form or to perform elicited imitation tasks accurately. These findings are consistent with research in cognitive psychology showing significant differences in phonological awareness between literate and illiterate adults .{{sfnm|1a1=Reis |1a2=Castro-Caldas|1y= 1997|2a1=Castro-Caldas|2a2=Petersson|2a3= Reis|2a4= Stone-Elander| 2a5=Ingvar|2y=1998}} An important direction for SLA research must therefore involve the exploration of the impact of alphabetic literacy on cognitive processing in second-language acquisition.

Empirical research has attempted to account for variables detailed by SLA theories and provide an insight into L2 learning processes, which can be applied in educational environments. Recent SLA investigations have followed two main directions: one focuses on pairings of L1 and L2 that render L2 acquisition particularly difficult, and the other investigates certain aspects of language that may be maturationally constrained. {{harvtxt|Flege| Mackay |Piske |2002}}  looked at bilingual dominance to evaluate two explanations of L2 performance differences between bilinguals and monolingual-L2 speakers, i.e. a maturationally defined CP or interlingual interference.

====Bilingual dominance====
{{Harvtxt|Flege|Mackay|Piske|2002}} investigated whether the age at which participants learned English affected dominance in [[Italian language|Italian]]-English bilinguals, and found the early bilinguals were English (L2) dominant and the late bilinguals Italian (L1) dominant. Further analysis showed that dominant Italian bilinguals had detectable foreign accents when speaking English, but early bilinguals (English dominant) had no accents in either language. This suggests that, though interlingual interference effects are not inevitable, their emergence, and bilingual dominance, may be related to a CP.

{{harvtxt|Sebastián-Gallés|Echeverría|Bosch|2005}} also studied bilinguals and highlight the importance of early language exposure. They looked at vocabulary processing and representation in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-[[Catalan language|Catalan]] bilinguals exposed to both languages simultaneously from birth in comparison to those who had learned L2 later and were either Spanish- or Catalan-dominant. Findings showed 'from birth bilinguals' had significantly more difficulty distinguishing Catalan words from non-words differing in specific vowels than Catalan-dominants did (measured by reaction time).

These difficulties are attributed to a phase around age eight months where bilingual infants are insensitive to vowel contrasts, despite the language they hear most. This affects how words are later represented in their [[lexicon]]s, highlighting this as a decisive period in language acquisition and showing that initial language exposure shapes linguistic processing for life. {{harvtxt|Sebastián-Gallés|Echeverría|Bosch|2005}} also indicate the significance of phonology for L2 learning; they believe learning an L2 once the L1 phonology is already internalised can reduce individuals’ abilities to distinguish new sounds that appear in the L2.

====Age effects on grammar learning====
Most studies into age effects on specific aspects of SLA have focused on grammar, with the common conclusion that it is highly constrained by age, more so than semantic functioning. {{Harvtxt|Harley|1986}} compared attainment of French learners in early and late immersion programs. She reports that after 1000 exposure hours, late learners had better control of [[French language|French]] verb systems and syntax. However, comparing early immersion students (average age 6.917 years) with age-matched native speakers identified common problem areas, including third person plurals and polite ‘[[T-V distinction|vous]]’ forms. This suggests grammar (in L1 or L2) is generally acquired later, possibly because it requires abstract cognition and reasoning.{{sfn|Harley|1986}}

B. Harley also measured eventual attainment and found the two age groups made similar mistakes in syntax and lexical selection, often confusing French with the L1. The general conclusion from these investigations is that different aged learners acquire the various aspects of language with varying difficulty. Some variation in grammatical performance is attributed to maturation,{{sfn|Harley|1986}} however, all participants began immersion programs before puberty and so were too young for a strong critical period hypothesis to be directly tested.

This corresponds to [[Noam Chomsky]]’s UG theory, which states that while language acquisition principles are still active, it is easy to learn a language, and the principles developed through L1 acquisition are vital for learning an L2.

{{harvtxt|Scherag|Demuth|Rösler|Neville |2004}} also suggest learning some syntactic processing functions and lexical access may be limited by maturation, whereas semantic functions are relatively unaffected by age. They studied the effect of late SLA on speech comprehension by [[Germans|German]] immigrants to the U.S.A. and American immigrants to Germany. They found that native-English speakers who learned German as adults were disadvantaged on certain grammatical tasks but performed at near-native levels on lexical tasks.

====Semantic functions acquisition====
One study that specifically mentions semantic functions acquisition is that of {{Harvtxt|Weber-Fox|Neville|1996}}. Their results showed that [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-English bilinguals who had been exposed to English after puberty, learned vocabulary to a higher competence level than syntactic aspects of language. They do, however, report that the judgment accuracies in detecting semantic anomalies were altered in subjects who were exposed to English after sixteen years of age, but were affected to a lesser degree than were grammatical aspects of language. It has been speculated by {{harvtxt|Neville |Bavelier| 2001}} and {{harvtxt|Scherag|Demuth|Rösler|Neville |2004}} that semantic aspects of language are founded on associative learning mechanisms, which allow lifelong learning, whereas syntactical aspects are based on computational mechanisms, which can only be constructed during certain age periods. Consequently, it is reasoned, semantic functions are easier to access during comprehension of an L2 and therefore dominate the process: if these are ambiguous, understanding of syntactic information is not facilitated. These suppositions would help explain the results of Scherag et al.'s (2004) study.

====Advantages of bilingual education for children====
It is commonly believed that children are better suited to learning a second language than are adults. However, general second-language research has failed to support the critical period hypothesis in its strong form (i.e., the claim that full language acquisition is impossible beyond a certain age).
According to Linda M. Espinosa, especially in the United States the number of children growing up with a home language that is not English but Spanish is constantly increasing.&lt;ref name="espinosa"&gt;{{Harvnb|Espinosa|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these children have to learn the English language before kindergarten as a second language. It is better for young children to maintain both their home language and their second language. Cultivating their home language, children create their own cultural identity and become aware of their roots. This fact leads to the question whether having the ability to speak two languages helps or harms young children. Research shows that the acquisition of a second language in early childhood confers several advantages, especially a greater awareness of linguistic structures. Furthermore, it is advantageous for young children to grow up bilingually because they do not need to be taught systematically but learn languages intuitively. How fast a child can learn a language depends on several personal factors, such as interest and motivation, and their learning environment. Communication should be facilitated rather than forcing a child to learn a language with strict rules. Education in early childhood can lead to an effective educational achievement for children from various cultural environments.

Another aspect worth considering is that bilingual children are often doing code switching, which does not mean that the child is not able to separate the languages. The reason for code switching is the child's lack of vocabulary in a certain situation. The acquisition of a second language in early childhood broadens children's minds and enriches them more than it harms them. Thus they are not only able to speak two languages in spite of being very young but they also acquire knowledge about the different cultures and environments. It is possible for one language to dominate. This depends on how much time is spent on learning each language.&lt;ref name="espinosa" /&gt;

==Evolutionary explanations==

===Hurford’s model===

In order to provide evidence for the evolutionary functionality of the critical period in language acquisition, {{harvtxt|Hurford|1991}} generated a computer simulation of plausible conditions of evolving generations, based on three central assumptions:

# Language is an evolutionary adaptation that is naturally selected for.
# Any given individual’s language can be quantified or measured.
# Various aspects of maturation and development are under genetic control, which determines the timing for critical periods for certain capacities (i.e. [[polygenic inheritance]]).

According to Hurford's evolutionary model, language acquisition is an adaptation that has survival value for humans, and that knowing a language correlates positively with an individual’s reproductive advantage. This finding is in line with views of other researchers such as Chomsky{{sfn|Chomsky|Huybregts|Riemsdijk|1982}} and {{harvtxt|Pinker | Bloom |1990}}. For example, [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] argue that because a language is a complex design that serves a specific function that cannot be replaced by any other existing capacity, the trait of language acquisition can be attributed to natural selection.

However, while arguing that language itself is adaptive and "did not 'just happen'" (p.&amp;nbsp;172), Hurford suggests that the critical period is not an adaptation, but rather a constraint on language that emerged due to a lack of selection pressures that reinforce acquiring more than one language. In other words, Hurford explains the existence of a critical period with [[genetic drift]], the idea that when there are no selection pressures on multiple alleles acting on the same trait, one of the alleles will gradually diminish through evolution. Because the simulation reveals no evolutionary advantage of acquiring more than one language, Hurford suggests that the critical period evolved simply as a result of a lack of selection pressure.

===Komarova and Nowak's dynamical system===

{{harvtxt|Komarova |Nowak |2001}} supported Hurford's model, yet pointed out that it was limited in the sense that it did not take into account the costs of learning a language. Therefore, they created their own algorithmic model, with the following assumptions:

# Language ability correlates with an individual’s reproductive fitness
# The ability to learn language is inherited
# There are costs to learning a language

Their model consists of a population with constant size, where language ability is a predictor of reproductive fitness. The learning mechanism in their model is based on linguistic theories of {{harvard citations |txt |last=Chomsky|author1-link=Noam Chomsky |year=1980 |year2=1993  }}– the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) and the notion of [[universal grammar]]. The results of their model show that the critical period for language acquisition is an "[[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS)" (Komarova &amp; Nowak, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1190). They suggest that this ESS is due to two competing selection pressures. First, if the period for learning is short, language does not develop as well, and thus decreases the evolutionary fitness of the individual. Alternatively, if the period for learning language is long, it becomes too costly to the extent that it reduces reproductive opportunity for the individual, and therefore limits reproductive fitness. Therefore, the critical period is an adaptive mechanism that keeps these pressures at equilibrium, and aims at optimal reproductive success for the individual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="895">A '''cut-out score''' or '''cutout score''' is a [[Sheet music|musical score]] in which measures with [[rest (music)|rests]] are simply omitted, and no rests of any kind are used. Cut-out scores are mostly used for proportional notation scores, such as Penderecki's ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]''. "Proponents of this arrangement argue that it dispenses with needless clutter on the score page," while "others maintain that not enough is gained by this format to justify the extra effort in setting up the score."&lt;ref&gt;Kennan &amp; Grantham (1990): 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut-out scores can be created with any full-featured [[scorewriter]], such as Finale or Sibelius. Instead of extracting parts, all the players are given the score.

[[File:Le Rêve d'un flagellant by George Topfer.jpg|thumb|200px|This 1921 illustration of a [[clothed male, naked female]] shows an example of [[female submission]]. The art is by Georges Topfer from his work ''Le Rêve d’un flagellant'' ("The dream of a flagellant").]]

'''Dominance and submission''' (also called '''D/s''') is a set of behaviours, customs, and rituals involving the submission of one person to another in an erotic episode or [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. It is a subset of [[BDSM]].

Physical contact is not necessary, and D/s can be conducted anonymously over the telephone, email, or other messaging systems. In other cases, it can be intensely physical, sometimes crossing into [[sadomasochism]]. In D/s, both parties take pleasure or erotic enjoyment from either dominating or being dominated. Those who take the superior position are called [[dominant (BDSM)|dominants]]—Doms (male) or Dommes (female)—while those who take the subordinate position are called [[submissive (BDSM)|submissives]]—or subs (male or female). A switch is an individual who plays either role. Two switches together may negotiate and exchange roles several times in a session. A [[dominatrix]] is usually a female [[sex worker]] who dominates others for pay.

It is common for writers to capitalise the "D" in Dominant but leave the "s" in lowercase for the submissive. Many extend this to His/Hers, Him/Her, He/She, etc., to make it clear when they are referring to a Dominant.

==Overview==
The inner conflict and surrender connected with dominance and submission are enduring themes in human [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In human sexuality, this has broadened to include mutual exploration of roles, emotions, and activities that would be difficult or impossible to act out without a willing partner taking an opposing role.

A 1985 study suggests that only about 30 percent of participants in [[BDSM]] activities are females.&lt;ref&gt;Breslow N, Evans L, Langley J. "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m7276ut047xg5316/ On the prevalence and roles of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: report of an empirical study.]" Archives of Sexual Behavior 1985 Aug;14(4):303-17. {{PMID|4051718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene E. Levitt, Charles Moser, and Karen V. Jamison "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7993186 The prevalence and some attributes of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: A second report.]" [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] 23(4) / August, 1994 DOI 10.1007/BF01541410 {{PMID|7993186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study indicates that 89% of [[heterosexual]] females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for the submissive-recipient role in [[sexual bondage]], expressing also a preference for a [[Male dominance (BDSM)|dominant male]], and that 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role.&lt;ref&gt;Ernulf KE, Innala SM. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8572912 Sexual bondage: a review and unobtrusive investigation.]" Archives of Sexual Behavior 1995 Dec;24(6):631-54. {{PMID|8572912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[safeword]]'' is usually given to the submissive partner to prevent the dominant from overstepping physical and emotional boundaries. The safeword is especially important when engaging in verbal [[erotic humiliation|humiliation]] or playing "mind-games", because the dominant may not be aware of an emotional boundary until it is crossed. If an emotional boundary is breached and the safeword spoken, the dominant should cease all play immediately and discuss the emotional breach with the submissive in a tender and understanding manner. Negotiating limits in advance is also an important element in a D/s relationship.

It is important to note that for a safe, sane, and consensual environment to be maintained, all participants should have a safeword of which the other is aware; this includes the Dominant partner. While it may not seem so from the outside, Dominants will also have limits and boundaries of their own, and should not only have a safeword but also be comfortable calling it if their own limits are exceeded. This includes cases where the dominant may feel things have gone too far and is uncomfortable continuing. As with any other participant, the dominant's safeword call should herald the stopping of all play and the start of a recuperative discussion between the participants.

D/s may be ritualized or freeform. It is usually a negotiated lifestyle, with people discussing their wishes, [[Limits (BDSM)|limits]], and needs in order to find commonality.  A D/s relationship may be sexual or non-sexual, long- or short-term, and intimate or anonymous.  Most adherents search for the essential intensity, trust, and intimacy that are required to make any deep relationship possible.

Based on gender (of the dominant or submissive), D/s can be divided into the following sub-types:-

* [[Male dominance (BDSM)|Male dominance]]
* [[Male submission]]
* [[Female dominance]]
* [[Female submission]]

==Terminology==
{{Main article|Glossary of BDSM}}
[[File:Folsom Street Fair master and 2 slaves.jpg|thumb|A dominant male publicly holds two submissive females using [[leash|leashes]] tied to their neck, [[Folsom Street Fair]], 2010]]

D/s participants often refer to their activity as "play", with an individual play session being called a "scene". In addition to "dominant" and "submissive", a "switch" is a person who can take either role. A scene between two switches can involve trading off the dominant and submissive roles, possibly several times. In contrast, the terms "top" and "bottom" refer to the active ([[Agent (grammar)|agent]]) and passive ([[Patient (grammar)|patient]]) roles, respectively. In a given scene, there is no requirement that the dominant also be the top, or that the submissive be the bottom, although this is often the case.

The term "vanilla" refers to normative ("non-[[Kink (sexuality)|kinky]]") sex and relationships, the vanilla world being mainstream society outside of the BDSM subculture. The term comes from vanilla ice cream being considered the "default" flavor.

===Linguistic conventions===
Some people in the D/s world capitalize words and names that refer to dominants, and do not capitalize those that refer to submissives, hence the capitalization of D/s; others do not. It was popularized in internet chatrooms, to make it easier to identify the orientation of the writer or the person being written about.

Also, some submissives eschew personal pronouns, instead referring to themselves as "this slave" or "Master Bob's girl". This is sometimes considered an expression of modesty, but it is an entirely optional method of depersonalizing a submissive during "play". It may have roots in the [[military]], where new recruits are required to refer to themselves as "this recruit", rather than "I" or "me".

==D/s relationship styles==
{{ref improve section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Facesitting-facesitting--Couple--domination--2 large (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Face sitting]] can be a way of expressing dominance.]]
[[File:Fucking Machines top banner cropped to machine example.jpg|thumb|A [[sex machine]] being used on a woman]]

[[File:Bling-bling - table.jpg|thumb|[[Human furniture]]: A nude submissive woman being used as a decorative table. She is required to stay in the same posture, such that the [[vase]] over her does not fall.]]

There can be any number of partners in a D/s relationship: one dominant may have several submissives, who may in turn dominate others, or a submissive may have multiple dominants. Relationships may be [[monogamous]] or [[polyamorous]]. Romantic love is not necessarily a feature in D/s: partners might be very much in love or have no romantic relationship at all. Some D/s relationships are sexual, others completely chaste.

[[Fantasy role play]] can be an element, with partners taking classic dominant or submissive roles, or classic authority-figure roles such as teacher and student, police officer and suspect, or parent and child. [[Human pony|Animal play]], where one partner takes the role of owner or caretaker and the other takes the part of a pet or animal, can also be D/s play.

A classic example of a D/s role is the [[Feminization (activity)|"sissy" maid]], where an adult male dresses in cartoonish female clothing and performs [[stereotype|stereotypical]] female chores such as housecleaning or serving tea. It should be noted that cross-dressing in D/s does not always involve a desire to be sissified or made into caricatures of women or to serve: for example, others may desire to be made as beautiful as possible and interact on a "girlfriend-to-girlfriend" non-sexual basis.

Variation in D/s is virtually limitless and the activities take many forms, and may be combined with other forms of BDSM. These variations may include:
* domestic [[servitude (BDSM)|servitude]] or consensual [[Slave (BDSM)|slavery]]
* enforced [[chastity]] of the submissive
* [[erotic humiliation]]
* [[sexual slavery (BDSM)|sexual slavery]]
* verbal humiliation
* fetishes—such as shoe or boot worship, uniforms, smoking, latex, and heavy rubber—are, among other activities, considered part of BDSM
* dehumanization (pony or [[animal roleplay]])
* objectification ([[human furniture]]): ex. submissive's body used as [[footstool]], or sub's mouth used as [[Spittoon|spitting bowl]] and cigarette [[ashtray]]
* [[cross-dressing]]
* [[Flagellation|whipping]]
* [[corporal punishment]]
* [[trampling]]
* human toilet - [[golden showers]]
* [[feminization (activity)|feminization]]
* [[cuckold]]
* [[bondage (sexual)]]
* [[public humiliation]]

==Safety==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

There are some risks commonly associated with D/s.  Because it is mostly a mental activity, many of the risks associated with D/s involve mental health. Others involve abuses of the trust inherent in a D/s relationship.  Some examples are:
* Physically or mentally abusive dominant partner
* Self-hating subs
* Dominant partners who violate the trust relationship by attempting to isolate the sub from society or monetarily exploit the sub

==Consent and contracts==
{{details|topic=when consent can be a defense to criminal liability for any injuries caused, and when, for these purposes, non-physical injuries are included in the definition of [[grievous bodily harm]]|Consent (BDSM)|Consent (criminal){{!}}Legal consent}}
{{See also|Contract (BDSM)}}

'''Consent''' is a vital element in all psychological play, and consent can be granted in many ways. Some employ a written form known as a "Dungeon negotiation form", for others a simple verbal commitment is sufficient. Consent can be limited both in duration and content.

'''Consensual non-consensuality''' is a mutual agreement to act as if consent has been [[waiver|waived]] within [[safe, sane and consensual|safe, sane]] limits. It is an agreement that consent is given in advance, sometimes without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned, though within defined limits subject to a safeword, reasonable care, common sense, or other restrictions. The consent is given with the intent of its being irrevocable under normal circumstances. As such, it is a show of extreme trust and understanding and is usually undertaken only by partners who know each other well, or otherwise agree to set clear, safe limits on their activities.

It's not unusual to grant consent only for an hour or for an evening. When a scene lasts for more than a few hours, it's common to draft a "scene contract" that defines what will happen and who is responsible for what. It's a good way to work out what all the parties want, and usually improves the experience. Some contracts can become quite detailed and run for many pages, especially if a scene is to last a weekend or more.

For long term consent, a "slave contract" may be drawn up. BDSM "contracts" are only an agreement between consenting people and are usually not legally binding; in fact, the possession of one may be considered illegal in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; Slave contracts are simply a way of defining the nature and limits of the relationship and are not intended to carry legal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Makai |first1=Michael |title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationhip Handbook |date=September 2013 |publisher=Createspace |isbn=1492775975|pages=162–171 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a slave contract is drafted, some celebrate the event with a "collaring ceremony", in which the local D/s community is invited to witness the commitment made in the document. Some ceremonies become quite elaborate, and can be as involved as a wedding or any similar ritual.

==Equipment and accessories==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

Some people maintain a special room or area, called a [[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], which contains special equipment ([[shackle]]s, [[handcuffs]], [[whip]]s, [[queening stool]]s, and [[spanking bench]]es or a [[Berkley horse]], for example) used for play scenes, or they may visit a BDSM club that maintains such facilities.

===Collars===
{{Main article|Collar (BDSM)}}

[[Image:BDSM collar back.jpg|thumb|A typical D/s "slave collar"]]

Many submissives wear a collar to denote their status and commitment. It can be much like a wedding band, except that only the submissive partner wears one. The traditional collar is a neck band in leather or metal, chosen, designed, and even crafted by the dominant partner. Some subs wear a "symbolic collar", often a bracelet or ankle chain, which is more subdued than the traditional collar and can pass in non-BDSM situations. It is not uncommon for a sub to have several collars for special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Makai |first1=Michael|title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|date=September 2013 |publisher=Createspace |isbn=1492775975 |pages=152–161 |language=English |chapter=Chapter 6: The Collar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dog collars are integral for K-9 [[Human animal roleplay|roleplaying]]—[[pup-play]].

Many people—for example, some in the [[punk rock]] and [[goth subculture]]s—wear collars for other reasons, such as fashion. So, one cannot assume that all people wearing collars are involved in BDSM. Members of the [[furry fandom]] may also wear collars as a part of costuming or as fashion. Use of collars in the sexual aspects of furry lifestyle may or may not be connected to BDSM, depending on the individual's preferences.

==Literature==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

One of the most famous works in this area is [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]'s ''Venus im Pelz'' (''Venus in Furs'', 1869), in which the protagonist, Severin, persuades a woman, Wanda, to take him on as her slave, serves her, and allows her to degrade him. The book has elements of both social and physical submission, and is the genesis of the term "masochism" coined by the 19th century psychiatrist [[Krafft-Ebing]].

==Music==
[[The Velvet Underground]]'s song "[[Venus in Furs (song)|Venus In Furs]]" is based on Sacher-Masoch's novel and discusses sadomasochism, the character Severin, and common bondage practices in a detached, objective, and non-judgmental manner.

The [[Rolling Stones]] song "[[Under my Thumb]]" (M. Jagger, 1966) is supposedly about a D/s relationship.

The [[Green Day]] song "All By Myself/Dominated Love Slave" (written and sung by [[Tré Cool]]) describes Cool's feelings for female dominance.

[[Dwele]]'s "Obey" is a Neo-Soul song based on the mind of a Dominant in a D/s relationship.

The [[Run The Jewels]] song "Love Again (Akinyele Back)" is a 2014 hip-hop release with verses about sexual dominance by [[Killer Mike]], [[El-P]] and [[Gangsta Boo]].

The [[Rihanna]] song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]" denotes the artist's arousal in BDSM play.

The [[DNCE]] song "Be Mean" is written about the artist's desire to be dominated.

'''Duodenal lymphocytosis''', sometimes called '''lymphocytic duodenitis''', lymphocytic duodenosis, or duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis, is a condition where an increased number of intra-epithelial [[lymphocytes]] is seen in biopsies of the [[duodenum|duodenal]] [[intestinal mucosa|mucosa]] when these are examined microscopically.  It is often a feature of [[coeliac disease]] but may be found in other disorders.

The condition is characterised by an increased proportion of lymphocytes in the [[epithelium]] of the duodenum, usually when this is greater than 20-25 per 100 [[enterocytes]].&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lauwers | first=Gregory Y | last2=Fasano | first2=Alessio | last3=Brown | first3=Ian S | title=Duodenal lymphocytosis with no or minimal enteropathy: much ado about nothing? | journal=Modern Pathology | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=28 | issue=S1 | year=2015 | issn=0893-3952 | doi=10.1038/modpathol.2014.135 | pages=S22–S29|pmid=25560597}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) are normally present in intestine and numbers are normally greater in the [[intestinal crypt|crypts]] and in the [[jejunum]]; these are distinct from those found in the [[lamina propria]] of the intestinal mucosa.  IELs are mostly [[T cell]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;  Increased numbers of IELs are reported in around 3% of in duodenal biopsies, depending on case mix, but may be increasingly being found, in up to 7%.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24565068"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shmidt | first=Eugenia | last2=Smyrk | first2=Thomas C. | last3=Boswell | first3=Christopher L. | last4=Enders | first4=Felicity T. | last5=Oxentenko | first5=Amy S. | title=Increasing duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis found at upper endoscopy: time trends and associations | journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=80 | issue=1 | year=2014 | issn=0016-5107 | doi=10.1016/j.gie.2014.01.008 | pages=105–111|pmid=24565068}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Causes==
The list of possible causes is wide, including coeliac disease, [[environmental enteropathy]] ([[tropical sprue]]), [[autoimmune enteropathy]], [[small intestinal bacterial overgrowth]], [[NSAID]] damage, ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', other infections and [[Crohn's disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by accurate counting of intraepithelial lymphocytes during histological examination of the duodenum.&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;  The definition of the condition includes the requirement that the duodenal histological appearances are otherwise unremarkable, specifically with normal [[intestinal villus|villous]] architecture.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hammer | first=Suntrea T. G. | last2=Greenson | first2=Joel K. | title=The Clinical Significance of Duodenal Lymphocytosis With Normal Villus Architecture | journal=Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | publisher=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine | volume=137 | issue=9 | year=2013 | issn=0003-9985 | doi=10.5858/arpa.2013-0261-ra | pages=1216–1219|pmid=23991733 |url=http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.5858/arpa.2013-0261-RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[coeliac disease]] (also known as [[gluten-sensitive enteropathy]]), duodenal lymphocytosis is found in untreated or partially treated cases. This is the least severe type of change, known as the Marsh I stage, in the classification of histological changes in coeliac disease. Additional features including villous atrophy and [[intestinal crypt|crypt]] [[hyperplasia]] are the other findings in other Marsh stages of coeliac disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marsh | first=Michael N. | title=Gluten, major histocompatibility complex, and the small intestine | journal=Gastroenterology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=102 | issue=1 | year=1992 | issn=0016-5085 | doi=10.1016/0016-5085(92)91819-p | pages=330–354|pmid=1727768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;

Antibodies associated with coeliac disease were reported in around 11% of cases.&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt; These IgA [[endomysial antibodies]] and [[anti-transglutaminase antibodies]] are very sensitive and specific for coeliac disease implying that this proportion of duodenal lymphocytosis cases has definite coeliac disease.  Around 33% of cases have the [[HLA-DQ|HLA-DQ2]] allele, which is found in over 90% of people with coeliac disease.  Absence of HLA-DQ2 (and the rarer HLA-DQ8) makes coeliac disease most unlikely.&lt;ref name="pmid25014240"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aziz | first=Imran | last2=Key | first2=Tim | last3=Goodwin | first3=John G. | last4=Sanders | first4=David S. | title=Predictors for Celiac Disease in Adult Cases of Duodenal Intraepithelial Lymphocytosis | journal=Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | publisher=Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health) | year=2014 | issn=0192-0790 | doi=10.1097/mcg.0000000000000184 | page=1|pmid=25014240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As antibody-negative coeliac disease is recognised, HLA status, persistence or progression of the duodenal IEL numbers following a gluten challenge, followed by symptomatic improvement on a gluten-free diet, has been used to be more certain about the diagnosis, which was made in 22% of one series of over 200 adult cases. &lt;ref name="pmid25014240"/&gt;

Helicobacter infection is a common finding at [[endoscopy]] and although duodenal IEL counts were found to be slightly higher with this infection, this was not considered to be a meaningful cause in children.&lt;ref name="pmid24702235"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guz-Mark | first=A. | last2=Zevit | first2=N. | last3=Morgenstern | first3=S. | last4=Shamir | first4=R. | title=Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis is common in children without coeliac disease, and is not meaningfully influenced by Helicobacter pylori infection | journal=Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | publisher=Wiley | volume=39 | issue=11 | date=2014-04-07 | issn=0269-2813 | doi=10.1111/apt.12739 | pages=1314–1320|pmid=24702235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other infections, including [[Cryptosporidiosis]] and [[Giardiasis]] can also be associated with an increase in IELs.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"/&gt;

==Management==
The management is that of any identified associated disorder such as a [[gluten free diet]] for cases with coeliac disease&lt;ref name="pmid25014240"/&gt; or treatment of associated infections.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"/&gt; 

==Prognosis==
When duodenal lymphocytosis is associated with other features of coeliac disease, in particular positive antibodies, or HLA-DQ2/8 and a family history, treatment with a [[gluten]]-free diet produces an improvement in IEL numbers.&lt;ref name="pmid25014240"/&gt;  Diarrhoea, thyroiditis, weakness and folate deficiency were other predictors of the development of gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease, which developed in 23 of 85 patients over 2 years in one series.&lt;ref name="pmid26140001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Losurdo | first=Giuseppe | last2=Piscitelli | first2=Domenico | last3=Giangaspero | first3=Antonio | last4=Principi | first4=Mariabeatrice | last5=Buffelli | first5=Francesca | last6=Giorgio | first6=Floriana | last7=Montenegro | first7=Lucia | last8=Sorrentino | first8=Claudia | last9=Amoruso | first9=Annacinzia | last10=Ierardi | first10=Enzo | last11=Leo | first11=Alfredo Di | title=Evolution of nonspecific duodenal lymphocytosis over 2 years of follow-up | journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology | publisher=Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.| volume=21 | issue=24 | date=2015-06-28 | pmid=26140001 | doi=10.3748/wjg.v21.i24.7545 | PMC=4481450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|thumb|Thermal energy is the amount of random molecular [[kinetic energy]].]]

Energy accounting is a system used in [[energy management system]]s to measure and analyze energy consumption to improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] within an organization.&lt;ref name=Acc /&gt; Organisations such as Intel corporation use these systems to track energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;E.

Various [[energy transformation]]s are possible. An energy balance can be used to track energy through a system. This becomes a useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts. How much energy is needed at each point in a system is measured, as well as the form of that energy. An accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within a system. Sometimes, non-useful work is what is often responsible for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml Science Notes: Energy Accounting and Balance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |date=2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy balance==
[[Energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) is the ratio of energy delivered by an energy technology to the energy invested to set up the technology.

A '''gas chamber''' is an apparatus for killing humans or other animals with gas, consisting of a sealed chamber into which a [[poison]]ous or [[asphyxiant gas]] is introduced. The most commonly used poisonous agent is [[hydrogen cyanide]]; [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]] have also been used. Gas chambers were used as a method of execution for condemned prisoners in the United States beginning in the 1920s and continue to be a legal execution method in three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution |title=Methods of Execution - Death Penalty Information Center |publisher=deathpenaltyinfo.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225054450/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[the Holocaust]], large-scale gas chambers designed for mass killing were used by [[Nazi Germany]] as part of their [[genocide]] program. The use of gas chambers in [[North Korea]] has also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barnett |first=Antony |title=Revealed: the gas chamber horror of North Korea's gulag |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 1, 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,1136483,00.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |location=London}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]] made extensive use of various types of gas chamber for mass killing.

Beginning in 1939, gas chambers were used as part of the [[Aktion T4|Nazi euthanasia program]] aimed at eliminating physically and intellectually disabled people. Experiments in the gassing of patients were conducted in October 1939 in occupied [[Poznan|Posen]] in Poland. Hundreds of prisoners were killed by [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning in an improvised gas chamber.&lt;ref name="browning"&gt; {{cite book | title=The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 – March 1942 | publisher=Arrow |last=Browning |first=Christopher |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8032-5979-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 gas chambers using bottled pure carbon monoxide were established at six euthanasia centres in Germany.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | title = Gassing Operations | last =  | first =  | date =  | website = Holocaust Encyclopedia | publisher = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | access-date = 30 November 2017 | quote =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171203210358/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | archivedate = 3 December 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to persons with disabilities, these centres were also used to kill prisoners transferred from concentration camps in Germany, Austria, and Poland. Killings of concentration camp inmates continued after the euthanasia program was officially shut down in 1941.&lt;ref name="klee"&gt;{{cite book | title=Euthanasie im NS-Staat. Die Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens [Euthanasia in the NS State: The Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life] (in German)|last=Klee|first=Ernst|year=1983|publisher=Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag|location=Frankfurt am Main|ISBN = 978-3-596-24326-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Russia]], mass executions by [[exhaust gas]] were performed by ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' using [[gas van]]s, trucks modified to divert engine exhaust into a sealed interior gas chamber.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt; 

Starting in 1941, gas chambers were used at [[extermination camp]]s in Poland for the mass killing of [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]], and other victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Gas vans were used at the [[Chełmno extermination camp]]. The [[Operation Reinhard]] extermination camps at [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] used exhaust fumes from stationary [[diesel engine]]s.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt; In search of more efficient killing methods, the Nazis experimented with using the [[hydrogen cyanide]]-based [[fumigation|fumigant]] [[Zyklon B]] at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. This method was adopted for mass killings at the Auschwitz and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] camps. Up to 6000 victims were gassed with Zyklon-B each day at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="USHMM-HE" /&gt;

Most extermination camp gas chambers were dismantled or destroyed in the last months of the [[World War II]] as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops approached, except for those at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and Majdanek. One destroyed gas chamber at Auschwitz was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial.

==Lithuania==
In 1937–1940, [[Lithuania]] operated a gas chamber in [[Aleksotas]] within the First Fort of the [[Kaunas Fortress]].&lt;ref name=cernevic/&gt; Before, the executions were carried out by hanging or by shooting. However, these methods were viewed as brutal and in January 1937, the criminal code was amended to provide execution by gas which at the time was viewed as more civilized and humane. Lithuania considered and rejected execution by poison. The first execution was carried on July 27, 1937: Bronius Pogužinskas, age 37, convicted of murder of five people from a Jewish family.&lt;ref name=cernevic/&gt; Historian Sigita Černevičiūtė counted at least nine executions in the gas chamber, though records are incomplete and fragmentary. Of the nine, eight were convicted of murder. One, Aleksandras Maurušaitis, was in addition convicted of anti-government actions during the [[1935 Suvalkija strike]]. The last known execution took place on May 19, 1940 for robbery. The fate of the gas chamber after the [[Occupation of Lithuania by Soviet Union 1940|occupation by the Soviet Union]] in June 1940 is unclear.&lt;ref name=cernevic&gt;{{cite web |first=Sigita |last=Černevičiūtė |title=Dujų kamera prieškario Lietuvoje 1937-1940 metais |date=April 8, 2014 |url=http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/duju-kamera-prieskario-lietuvoje-1937-1940-metais-582-418225 |publisher=15 min (republished from ''Naujasis Židinys-Aidai'') |language=lt |accessdate=2016-11-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127154408/http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/istorija/duju-kamera-prieskario-lietuvoje-1937-1940-metais-582-418225 |archivedate=November 27, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Korea==
Kwon Hyok, a former head of security at [[Camp 22]], described laboratories equipped with gas chambers for [[Asphyxiant gas|suffocation gas]] experiments, in which three or four people, normally a family, are the experimental subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,1136483,00.html |title=Revealed: the gas chamber horror of North Korea's gulag |first=Antony |last=Barnett |date=31 January 2004 |via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freekorea.us/2007/02/18/holocaust-now-looking-down-into-hell-at-camp-22/ Video testimonials by former guards and prisoners at Camp 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024121846/http://freekorea.us/2007/02/18/holocaust-now-looking-down-into-hell-at-camp-22/ |date=2007-10-24 }}, where the experiments are said to have occurred, with Google Earth images Camp 22 and other camps&lt;/ref&gt;  After undergoing medical checks, the chambers are sealed and poison is injected through a tube, while scientists observe from above through glass. In a report reminiscent of an earlier account of a family of seven, Kwon claims to have watched one family of two parents, a son and a daughter die from suffocating gas, with the parents trying to save the children using [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] for as long as they had the strength. Kwon's testimony was supported by documents from Camp 22 describing the transfer of prisoners designated for the experiments. The documents were identified as genuine by Kim Sang Hun, a London-based expert on Korea and human rights activist.&lt;ref name="bbc01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3440771.stm |title=Within prison walls |accessdate=2009-12-15 |author=Olenka Frenkiel |date=January 30, 2004 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623201644/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3440771.stm |archivedate=June 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A press conference in [[Pyongyang]], organized by North Korean authorities, denounced this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/200403/31/eng20040331_138993.shtml |title=DPRK civilians admit faking papers on chemical weapons testing on humans |accessdate=15 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191733/http://en.people.cn/200403/31/eng20040331_138993.shtml |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2004/200403/news03/31.htm#10 Truth behind False Report about "Experiment of Chem.

Gas chambers have been used for [[capital punishment in the United States]] to execute [[List of United States death row inmates|death row inmates]]. The first person to be executed in the United States by lethal gas was [[Gee Jon]], on February 8, 1924. An unsuccessful attempt to pump poison gas directly into his cell at [[Nevada State Prison]] led to the development of the first makeshift gas chamber to carry out Gee's death sentence.&lt;ref name="DPIC-Descriptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |title=Descriptions of Execution Methods: Gas Chamber |publisher=[[Death Penalty Information Center]] |year=2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112105603/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |archivedate=November 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 1948, [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Sam Shockley]] were executed in the gas chamber at [[San Quentin State Prison]] for their role in the [[Battle of Alcatraz]].

In 1957, [[Burton Abbott]] was executed as the governor of California, [[Goodwin J.

The decision to clear the room while he was still alive was criticized by his [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]].

California's gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison was converted to an execution chamber for lethal injection.

As of 2010, the last person to be executed in the gas chamber was German national [[Walter LaGrand]], sentenced to death before 1992, who was executed in [[Arizona]] on March 3, 1999.

As implemented in the United States, the gas chamber is considered to be the most dangerous, most complicated, and most expensive method of administering the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Death and Dying'' by Clifton D.

Because hydrogen cyanide gas condenses at approximately 78&amp;nbsp;°F (26&amp;nbsp;°C), the temperature in the chamber (when it is in use) is maintained at a minimum of 80&amp;nbsp;°F (27&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html  Mississippi State Penitentiary, Leuchter report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706021251/http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html |date=2015-07-06 }} section 7.002&lt;/ref&gt;

The gas is visible to the condemned, who is advised to take several deep breaths to speed unconsciousness. Nonetheless, there are often convulsions and excessive drooling.  There may also be urinating, defecating, and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Capital Punishment in the United States'', 2d ed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;by Louis J.

Following the execution the chamber is purged with air, and any remnant gas is neutralized with [[Ammonia|anhydrous ammonia]], after which the body can be removed (with great caution, as pockets of gas can be trapped in the victim's clothing).&lt;ref name="HCN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |title=Descriptions of Execution Methods |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |accessdate=2 February 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202105345/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods#gas |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, as a safety precaution, the clothing worn by the executed person is destroyed by incineration.&lt;ref name="leuchter2"&gt;[http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html  Mississippi State Penitentiary, Leuchter report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706021251/http://www.zundelsite.org/archive/leuchter/report3/ch7000.html |date=2015-07-06 }} section 7.007&lt;/ref&gt;  The undertaker who handles the body wears rubber gloves for protection against any trace amounts of cyanide that might still be present on or in the body.&lt;ref name="leuchter2" /&gt;

====Excluding all oxygen====
{{main article|Inert gas asphyxiation}}
Nitrogen gas or oxygen-depleted air has been considered for human execution, as it can induce [[nitrogen asphyxiation]]. The victim detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to [[asphyxia]]tion (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation, or the side effects of poisoning.

In April 2015, [[Governor of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Governor]] [[Mary Fallin]] approved a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an execution method.&lt;ref name="newsok.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-gov.-mary-fallin-signs-bill-allowing-nitrogen-asphyxiation-as-alternative-execution-method/article/5411181 |title=Oklahoma Gov.

Gas chambers have also been used for [[animal euthanasia]], using [[carbon monoxide]] as the lethal agent. Sometimes a box filled with [[anesthetic]] gas is used to anesthetize small animals for surgery or euthanasia. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Hobart and William Smith Colleges''' are private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva,]] [[New York (state)|New York]]. They trace their origins to Geneva Academy established in 1797. Hobart College (men) and William Smith College (women) both offer the degrees of [[bachelor of arts]], [[bachelor of science]], and [[master of arts]] in [[teaching]].

Hobart and William Smith are ranked No. 1 by the [[Princeton Review]] for having the "most popular study abroad program" in higher education, as well as 18th in having the happiest students and 18th in best student-rated professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buchiere|first1=Steve|title=The secret to student happiness?

==History==

Hobart and William Smith Colleges, private colleges in Geneva, New York, began on the western frontier as the Geneva Academy.  After some setbacks and disagreement among trustees, the Academy suspended operations in 1817.  By the time Bishop [[John Henry Hobart]], of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]], first visited the city of Geneva in 1818, the doors of Geneva Academy had just closed.  Yet, Geneva was a bustling [[Upstate New York]] city on the main land and stage coach route to the West.  Bishop Hobart had a plan to reopen the Academy at a new location, raise a public subscription for the construction of a stone building, and elevate the school to college status.  Roughly following this plan, Geneva Academy reopened as '''Geneva College''' in 1822 with conditional grant funds made available from [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]].  Geneva College was renamed Hobart College in 1852 in honor of its founder, Bishop Hobart.

William Smith College was founded in 1908, originally as William Smith College for Women.  Its namesake and founder was a wealthy local nurseryman, benefactor of the arts and sciences, and philanthropist.  The school arose from negotiations between William Smith, who sought to establish a women's college, and Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson, who sought to redirect Smith's philanthropy towards Hobart College. Smith, however, was intent on establishing a coordinate, nonsectarian women's college, which, when realized, coincidentally gave Hobart access to new facilities and professors. The two student bodies were educated separately in the early years, even though William Smith College was a department of Hobart College for organizational purposes until 1943. That year, after a gradual relaxation of academic separation, William Smith College was formally recognized as an independent college, co-equal with Hobart. Both colleges were reflected in a new, joint corporate identity.

In April 2018, the president of the institution resigned following anonymous allegations he plagiarized parts of his doctoral dissertation. However, after a review by his degree-granting institution, it was determined his degree should stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/04/24/ex-president-hobart-will-keep-doctorate |title=Ex-President of Hobart Will Keep Doctorate |author=Scott Jaschik |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |publication-date=24 April 2018 |access-date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pat McGuire, an emeritus professor of economics, was appointed the interim president of the Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/04/13/hobart-president-resigns-after-plagiarism-allegations |title=Hobart President Resigns After Plagiarism Allegations |author=Rick Seltzer |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=April 13, 2018 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobart and William Smith Colleges' campus is situated on {{convert|170|acre|km2}} in [[Geneva, New York]], along the shore of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], the largest of the [[Finger Lakes]]. The campus is notable for the style of Jacobean architecture represented by many of its buildings, notably Coxe Hall, which houses the President's Office and other administrative departments. In contrast, the earliest buildings and the chapel are Gothic in style.

[[File:Dem1908.jpg|thumb|left| Hobart Quadrangle (1908)]] '''The Quad''', the core of the Hobart campus, was formed by the construction of Medbery, Coxe, and Demarest. Several years later, Arthur Nash, a Hobart professor, designed Williams Hall, which would be constructed in the gap between Medbery and Coxe. The Quad is formed to the east by Trinity and Geneva Hall, the two original College buildings, and to the south by the Science compound, and Napier Hall. [[Geneva Hall and Trinity Hall, Hobart &amp; William Smith College|Geneva Hall (1822) and Trinity Hall (1837)]] were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the schools announced they were going solar by building two solar farms to create enough electricity for about 50 percent of HWS' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2016/07/03/hobart-william-smith-solar-farms/86597722/|title=Hobart and William Smith Colleges go solar|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hws coxe hall.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The iconic Coxe Hall, fronting the Hobart Quad.  The building, named for Bishop Arthur Cleveland Coxe, is an excellent example of [[Jacobean architecture]].]]

'''The Hill''' (or William Smith Hill) is a prominent feature of the historic William Smith campus. Located at the top of a large sloping hill to the West of Seneca Lake and the Hobart Quad, the Hill houses three historic William Smith dorms, and one built in the 1960s (Comstock, Miller, Blackwell, and Hirshson Houses). At its peak resides William Smith's all female dorms. The Hill was the site originally conceived for William Smith College. Unveiled in 2008 for the William Smith Centennial is a statue of the college's founder and benefactor, William Smith.

A 15 million dollar expansion of the Scandling Campus Center was completed in autumn 2008.  This renovation added over 17,000 additional square feet, including an expanded cafe, a new post office, and more meeting areas. In 2016 the Gearan Center for Performing Arts was completed at a cost of 28 million dollars; the largest project in the history of the colleges. This 65,000 square foot facility brings together music, dance, theater and media and society in a unified academic space.

===Key buildings===

'''Coxe Hall''', serves as the main administrative hub of campus. Constructed in 1901, the building is named after Bishop Arthur Clevland Coxe, a benefactor of the school, and houses the president's office, Bartlett Theater, The Pub, and a classroom wing, which was added in the 1920s. Arthur Cleveland Coxe was closely affiliated with the school. The building was designed by [[Clinton and Russell]] Architects.

'''Gearan Center for the Performing Arts,''' named in honor of President Mark D Gearan and Mary Herlihy Gearan, is a state of the art facility completed in 2016.  It includes a light-filled lobby that links three flexible performance and rehearsal spaces designed specifically for theater, music and dance. Adaptable seating allows for the creation of spaces that can be changed to accommodate multiple types of productions and audience sizes. Also included are faculty offices, practice and recital rooms and a film screening room.

'''Scandling Campus Center''', named after [[William F. Scandling|William F. Scandling '49]], is the central hub of student life. Scandling, renovated and expanded in 2009, houses Saga (the dining hall), the post office, offices of student activities, a cafe, and Vandervort room (a large event space).

'''Gulick Hall''', was built in 1951 as part of the post-war "mini-boom" that also included the construction of the Hobart "mini-quad" dormitories Durfee, Bartlett, and Hale (each named for a 19th-century Hobart College president). Gulick Hall originally housed the campus dining services and, later, the Office of the Registrar.  Completely renovated in 1991, Gulick now houses both the Office of the Registrar and the Psychology department, which was moved from Smith Hall in 1991 prior to its renovation in 1992.

[[File:Mh1955a.jpg|thumb|left| Medbery Hall in 1955]]

'''Stern Hall''', named for the lead donor, Herbert J. Stern '58, was completed in 2004. It houses the departments of economics, political science, anthropology &amp; sociology, environmental studies and Asian languages and cultures.

'''Smith Hall''', built in 1907, originally housed both the Biology and Psychology Departments.  It is now home to the Dean's Offices of both colleges, along with the departmental offices of Writing and Rhetoric and the various modern language departments.  Smith Hall was the first building constructed with funds from William Smith on the William Smith College campus, but it is also the first building that has always been shared by both colleges.

'''Williams Hall''', completed in 1907, housed the first campus gymnasium and, after the construction of Bristol gymnasium, served several other lives as campus post office, book store, IT services and location of the Music Department.

'''Demarest Hall''', connected to St. John's Chapel by St. Mark's Tower, houses the departments of Religious Studies and English and Comparative Literature as well as the Women's Studies Program.  Also home to the Blackwell Room, named in honor of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (once used as study area and library, the space is now used for classrooms in the absence of more intentional planning for classroom space),  Demarest was designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]'s son, Richard M. Upjohn. (Upjohn's grandson, [[Hobart Upjohn]] would design several of the College's buildings as well). Demarest served as the College's library until the construction of the Warren Hunting Smith Library in the early 1970s. In the 1960s it was expanded to hold the College's growing number of volumes. Today, it also houses the Fisher Center for the Study of Women and Men, an intellectual center led by such scholar faculty as Dunbar Moodie (Sociology), and Betty Bayer (Women's Studies).

[[File:Dem1919.jpg|thumb|left| Demarest Hall, 1919]]

'''Trinity Hall''' built in 1837, was the second of the colleges' buildings. Trinity Hall was designed by college president Benjamin Hale, who taught architecture. Trinity served as a dormitory and a library, but it was converted into a space for classrooms, labs, and offices later in the 19th century. It presently is home to the Salisbury Center for Career Services.

[[File:Merritt2.jpg|thumb|right| Merrit Hall, Chemistry Dept.]]

'''Merrit Hall''', completed in 1879, was built on the ruins of the old medical college. Merrit was the first science building on campus and housed the chemistry labs. Merrit also housed a clock atop the quad side of the building. On the eve of the Hobart centennial in 1922, students climbed to the top and made the bell strike 100 times. Merrit Hall was also one of the first buildings shared by Hobart and William Smith. Today Merrit Hall houses a lecture hall and faculty offices.
'''St. John's Chapel''', designed by [[Richard Upjohn]] the architect of [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in New York City, served as the religious hub of the campus, replacing Polynomous, the original campus chapel. In the 1960s, St. John's was connected to Demarest Hall by St. Marks Tower.

'''Houghton House''', the mansion, known for its Victorian elements, is home to the Art and Architecture departments. The country mansion was built, in the 1880s by [[William J. King]]. It was purchased in 1901 by the wife of Charles Vail (maiden name Helen Houghton), Hobart graduate and professor, as the family's summer home. Mrs. Vail remodeled the Victorian mansion's interior to the present classical decor in 1913.  The family's "town home" is 624 S. Main Street and is now the Sigma Phi fraternity. Helen Vail's heirs donated the house and its grounds to the colleges to be used as a woman's dormitory. After many years as a student dorm, the house became home to the art department after the original art studio was razed to make way for the new Scandling Campus Center. The building is now home to the Davis Art Gallery, with lecture rooms, multiple faculty offices, and architecture studios on the top floor.

'''Katherine D. Elliot Hall''', was constructed in 2006. The "Elliot" houses {{convert|14600|sqft|m2}} contains art classrooms; offices; studios for painting, photography, and printing; and wood and metal shops.

[[File:Wh1909c.jpg|thumb|right| Williams Hall, 1909. Old College Gymnasium.]]

'''Goldstein Family Carriage House''', was built by William J. King in 1882 and was renovated in 2006 to house a digital imaging lab and a photo studio with a darkroom for black-and-white photography.

'''Warren Hunting Smith Library''', in the center of the campus, houses 385,000 volumes, 12,000 periodicals, and more than 8,000 VHS and DVD videos.  In 1997, the library underwent a major renovation, undergoing several improvements, such the addition of multimedia centers, and the addition to its south side of the L. Thomas Melly Academic Center, a spacious, modern location for "round the clock" study.

'''Napier Hall''', attached to the Rosenberg Hall, houses several classrooms and was completed in 1994.

'''Rosenberg Hall''', named for Henry A. Rosenberg (Hobart '52), is an annex of Lansing and Eaton Hall, the original science buildings. Rosenberg houses many labs and offices.

'''Lansing Hall''', built in 1954, is home to Sciences and Mathematics. The building is named for John Ernest Lansing, Professor of Chemistry (1905–1948), who twice served as acting president.

'''Eaton Hall''', is named for [[Elon Howard Eaton]], Professor of Biology (1908–1935). Eaton, one of New York's outstanding ornithologists, was one of the professors brought to campus with William Smith grant funds. He received the Distinguished Faculty Award in 1992. Eaton Hall is a part of the science complex at the south end of the Hobart Quad, which consists of Lansing, Rosenberg, and Napier.

===Dormitories===

====Men's dorms====
[[File:GenevaHall1896.jpg|thumb|right| Geneva Hall, 1896 Class Day]]

'''Geneva Hall''', built in 1822, is the college's first building, and the cornerstone site designated by the School's founder, Bishop [[John Henry Hobart]]. The building is one of the oldest academic building in continuous use, having served as a dormitory, among other uses, since its completion. The building has inscribed into its quoins, and alongside the perimeter of its facade, plaques which list the graduates of classes dating back to the 19th century.

'''The Mini Quad''', consisting of three building, Durfee, Hale, and Bartlett, houses about 150 Hobart students.  Since the 2010 academic year, Hale is home to one floor of William Smith students.

'''Hale Hall''' is named for Benjamin Hale, president of Hobart College from 1836 to 1858.

'''Bartlett Hall''' was named after the Reverend Murray Bartlett, who served as fourteenth president of Hobart College from 1919 to 1936

'''Durfee Hall''' was named after [[William Pitt Durfee]], who from 1884 to 1929 served as Professor of Mathematics and Chair of the Mathematics Department. He was the first dean of a liberal arts college and served as acting president of the Colleges four times.

====Women's dorms====

'''Blackwell House''' was designed and built in 1860 by [[Richard Upjohn]] as a residence for William Douglass, who served as a trustee of Hobart College. The house was purchased in 1908 as the first William Smith dormitory. The house still houses William Smith students and is known for its grand Victorian features from fireplaces, to chandeliers, to large old windows. Though rarely recognized as such, the house is named for Elizabeth Blackwell, an early graduate of what became the Colleges.

[[File:BlackwellHouse.jpg|thumb|left| Historic Blackwell House]]

'''Comstock House''' was designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]'s grandson, Hobart Upjohn, in 1932.  Comstock is a women's dormitory named for Anna Botsford Comstock, friend of William Smith and the first woman to be named a member of the Board of Trustees.

'''Miller House''' was William Smith College's second dormitory. Miller was designed by Arthur Nash, professor and grandson of Arthur Cleveland Coxe. Nash also designed Smith Hall and Williams Hall. This house honors Elizabeth Smith Miller, a leader in the women's movement.

'''Hirshson House''', completed in 1962, was named for the president of the colleges, Dr. Louis Melbourne Hirshson, the last Episcopal clegy person to serve in that capacity. The building is home to William Smith students.

====Coed dorms====

[[File:Mh1955c.jpg|thumb| Medbery Hall, 1955|alt=]]

'''Medbery Hall''' is an original Hobart College dorm dating from the 1900. Medbery defines the right side of the Hobart Quadrangle. Designed by [[Clinton and Russell]] architects at the same time as Coxe Hall, the two buildings share similarity in their Jacobean Gothic style. Medbery is adorned with a recognizable Flemish roofline. Medbery was designed without long hallways "conductive to rioting" and mischief, such as rolling a cannonball down the hallway. Such mischief was experienced in the other two dormitories on campus, Geneva and Trinity Halls.

'''Jackson, Potter, Rees''', together known as JPR for short (and once dubbed "superdorm"), the three identical buildings create their own quad in the south end of campus. The dorms were built in 1966 and are named after various historical figures of Hobart College. The complex houses about 230 first-year and upper class Hobart and William Smith students. The building was completely renovated in 2005 to include quad living spaces (two double bed rooms connected by a common living room) and open lounge spaces and lounges on every floor.

'''Jackson Hall''' is named for Abner Jackson, president of the Hobart in the middle of the 19th century.  Jackson would go on to become president of [[Trinity College, Hartford|Trinity College]] in Connecticut, where he would be the principal designer of its present campus.

'''Rees Hall''' is named for Major James Rees, an early settler and landowner in Geneva and an acquaintance of George Washington.

'''Potter Hall''' is named for John Milton Potter, President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges from 1942 to 1947.

"The Village at Odells Pond" is a collection of apartment style dorms available to upperclassmen at the colleges. The units have either four or five bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen.

The surrounding ecosystem plays a major role in the Colleges' curriculum and acquisitions.  The Colleges own the {{convert|108|acre|km2|adj=on}} Hanley Biological Field Station and Preserve on neighboring [[Cayuga Lake]] and hosts the [[Finger Lakes Institute]], a non-profit institute focusing on education and ecological preservation for the Finger Lakes area.

On Seneca Lake one will find the ''William Scandling'', a Hobart and William Smith {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} research vessel used to monitor lake conditions and in the conduct of student and faculty research.

The Colleges also own and operate [[WEOS]]-FM and [[WHWS-LP]], public radio stations broadcasting throughout the Finger Lakes and worldwide, on the web.

==Academics==
Hobart and William Smith Colleges offer the degrees of [[bachelor of arts]], [[bachelor of science]], and [[Master of Arts in Teaching]]. The colleges follow the semester calendar and have a student to faculty ratio of 11:1.

The colleges are known for the number of students that study abroad for a semester during the academic year; in recent years, between 40% and 60% of students have spent at least one semester studying off-campus. In former years, the majority of these terms abroad were led by faculty from the Colleges.

The Colleges have long been recognized for the high quality of their education and in 1961 were undefeated National Champions (an honor earned after winning five consecutive challenges) on the [[GE College Bowl]], one of only three institutions in the United States to achieve this distinction at the time. In 2004, a William Smith student was selected as a [[Rhodes Scholar]].

The Colleges have a long history of strength in interdisciplinary programs, including [[women's studies]] (well over 40 years old, and thus one of the first in the nation), [[Asian studies]], [[environmental studies]], and [[LGBT studies]].

In addition to the ''Seneca Review'', published on campus, from 2001 to 2004, Hobart and William Smith Colleges saw the publication of a literary magazine, ''SCRY!: A Nexus of Politics and the Arts''.  Under the editorial supervision of Binh Nguyen (Hobart '04), the magazine included contributions from both professionals and students.  The Canadian poet/classicist [[Anne Carson]] appeared twice. John O'Brien, the founder of The Center for Book Culture, contributed.  Award-winning on-campus writers, such as Jim Crenner, David Weiss, [[Deborah Tall]] and James McCorkle, submitted original poems.  There were writings and artworks by students as well.

===Trias Writers-in-Residence===
Founded in 2011 with a grant from alumnus [[Peter Trias]], Hobart and William Smith Colleges established the Trias Writer-in-Residence, which brings renowned authors to campus for a year to mentor undergraduate creative writing students. Former writers in residence have included [[Mary Ruefle]], [[Mary Gaitskill]], Tom Piazza, [[Chris Abani]], and [[John D'Agata]].

===Elizabeth Blackwell Award===
Given in her memory, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award is presented periodically by Hobart and William Smith Colleges to a woman who has demonstrated "outstanding service to humankind". Its recipients have included [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Janet Yellen]] (2015), the Most Rev. [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] (2013), [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] (2011), first woman ordained a rabbi in the United States, Rabbi [[Sally Priesand]] (2009), [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] (2001), tennis great [[Billie Jean King]] (1998), [[Wilma Mankiller]] (1996), first woman chief of the Cherokee Nation; [[U.S. Representative]] [[Barbara Jordan]] (1993), U.S. Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]] (1991), former Surgeon General [[Antonia Novello]] (1991), Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] (1985), and [[Fe del Mundo]], the first Asian woman admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]] (1966), among many others.&lt;ref name=Recipients&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Blackwell Award Recipients |url=http://www.hws.edu/about/blackwell.aspx|publisher=Hobart and William Smith Colleges|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President's Forum===
Each semester, Hobart and William Smith sponsors a series of guest lectures. The most prominent has been the President's Forum, established in 2000 and led by former president [[Mark Gearan]]. The forum has included The Hon. [[Shireen Avis Fisher]], [[Nancy Zimpher]], [[Mary Matalin]] and [[James Carville]], [[Kathy Platoni]], [[Svante Myrick]], [[Cornel West]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Eric Liu]], and [[Alan Keyes]], among other prominent names.

===Publications===
''Echo and Pine'' is the annual student-produced college yearbook. Originally two separate publications, the Hobart Echo of Seneca, and the William Smith Pine, the two merged in the 1960s to create one publication to serve both colleges.

''The Herald'' is the student-run school newspaper, founded in the late 19th century as the Hobart Herald.

''The Pulteney St. Survey'' is the official magazine of Hobart and William Smith Colleges.

''martini'' is the alternative student publication at Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges.  Characteristically spelled with all lowercase letters, it provides a witty and critical look at music, politics, and social issues in a style that aspires to be "crisp, clean, and hard hitting". ''martini'' is published bi-weekly.

''Thel'' is the Colleges' literary magazine.

''Aleph'' is a journal of international travel, rooted in the colleges' strong study-abroad program.

=== Debate ===
The HWS Debate Team dates back over 100 years.  Notable recent victories include the Northeastern Regional Championship in both 2010 and 2011, the US National Championship in 2012 and winning the Hart House IV in 2016.  The team hosts the HWS IV (one of the largest tournaments in North America) each fall, and the HWS Round Robin (an international tournament of champions) each spring.  Every year, an HWS debater is honored with the Nathan D. Lapham Prize in Public Speaking, which comes with a cash award of up to $1000 to the student.  HWS is among the few liberal-arts colleges to offer numerous four-year debate scholarships.

===Music===

Hobart and William Smith has a number of ensemble groups, including:

'''Colleges Chorale''', which is a mixed ensemble comprising the finest vocal talent on the campus. The students accepted into this 45-voice ensemble have gone through a careful audition process involving evaluation of both vocal technique and musicianship. The Chorale performs a wide range of a cappella choral repertoire—music from the Middle Ages to the present day. In addition to a formal concert at the end of each semester and the annual spring tour, the Colleges Chorale performs at various campus events throughout the year. Each spring the group takes a four-day tour. Recent tour destinations have included New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Boston.

'''Cantori''' is a chamber vocal ensemble comprising members from the larger Colleges Chorale. Since the group's formation in 1993, the sixteen-member Cantori has sought to foster contemporary choral music through the Cantori Commissioning Project – the annual commissioning and performance of a new work by a deserving American composer.

'''Guitar Ensemble''',

==Coordinate system==
Officially chartered as "Hobart and William Smith Colleges," and informally referred to as "HWS" or "the Colleges," William Smith and Hobart have each retained its own traditions, while integrating many aspects of student life in an arrangement called the "coordinate system." When many single-sex institutions became co-ed in the 1960s and '70s, the Colleges, like others such as Columbia/Barnard, chose to maintain two separate entities, joined together in order to work as a whole. Though not donated for this purpose, a prior president, Richard H. Hersh, came to see the system as symbolized in the campus sculpture of a scissors embedded in the lawn south of the library.

[[File:Hws seneca lake.jpg|thumb|left|The colleges' campus borders Seneca Lake.]]

The colleges share most administrative offices (there is only one president's office, for example, which differentiates the Colleges from one or more other coordinate systems), while maintaining separate deans' offices, athletics programs, student governments and, until recently, admissions offices. Even some regulations about student life vary.  Hobart College allows [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] and Greek organizations while William Smith welcomed their first sorority onto campus in the Fall of 2017.

A male graduate receives a degree from Hobart College and a female graduate from William Smith College.  Alums are always referred to in the single-sex sense of the word, as "alumnae and alumni" and any reference to the institution is always in the plural ("colleges"). Of course, the coordinate system allows ease of transfer for those who transition from male to female or female to male during their time at the Colleges and thus offers a challenge both to single sex and co-educational systems.

Each college celebrates its own traditions. During the academic year, William Smith College celebrates annual events such as Founder's Day and Moving Up Day.  Hobart has Charter Day, which celebrates the 1822 founding and its own honor societies:  The Druid Society for seniors (founded 1903), Chimera Society (juniors, 1910) and Orange Key (sophomores, 1926).  The William Smith Senior Honor Society is Hai Timiai ("Honored Women" in Greek). Each society has specific roles and functions on campus. In 2016 the Colleges considered changing the structure of the traditional commencement ceremony. Ultimately the Board of Trustees, administration and student conducted surveys decided to leave the current system in place. The change would have resulted in a completely uniform ceremony of both Hobart and William Smith graduates. The current divides the colleges into Hobart College and William Smith College for men and woman respectively.

===Origins of the coordinate system===
Despite some sharing of facilities, at the beginning of their relationship the two colleges were quite separate. Classes were conducted in duplicate, and women students were not allowed on the Hobart campus. Those who required access to Trinity and Merritt halls (where chemistry and physics classes were held), the library, and the chapel traveled there on public sidewalks along the campus perimeter.

The enforced separation of the colleges eroded gradually over the years. In 1922, the first joint commencement was held, but baccalaureate services remained separate until 1942. By then, the practice of holding duplicate classes was less observed, particularly in upper-level courses with few students. In 1938, first-year courses were held in common, without any of the dire consequences some had predicted, and by 1941 [[coeducational]] classes had become the norm.

In 1943, during the administration of President [[John Milton Potter]], William Smith College was elevated from its original status as a department of Hobart College to an independent college, co-equal with Hobart. At President Potter's suggestion, the two colleges established a joint corporate identity. For a detailed explanation of the shared and structurally separate elements of the Colleges as they now exist, see '''Coordinate System''' below.

====Hobart seal====
Arthur Cleveland Coxe, the namesake of Bishop [[Arthur Cleveland Coxe]], his grandfather (for whom Coxe Hall is named), designed the seal in 1895. The Latin phrase "Sigillvm Collegii Hobartiani in Civ Neo Ebor", along the margin of the seal, translates as "The Seal of Hobart College in the State of New York," "Civ" being short for "Civitate" and "Ebor" for "Eboraco," the ablative case of Eboracum, the Latin name of York. "Vita Lux Hominvm", the phrase on the scroll, translates "Life and Light of Mankind." "Disce" is the Latin singular imperative (command) for "learn," and is a charge to the students to excel, while 1822 signifies the date of the College's charter. On the shield, the book represents learning and education, the cross, religion. The key on the left may symbolize knowledge. The crossing key, on the right, is symbolic of the bishop's crook, a reminder of the College's founder, Bishop Hobart.

====William Smith seal====
The seal of William Smith College depicts a lamp, which is the traditional symbol of enlightenment and education. Greek words meaning "life"  and "soul" are placed above the lamp. This suggests the College is concerned with all phases of life and attempts to meet both the physical and spiritual needs of the students. The date of the founding, 1908, is at the base of the lamp, and the inner field is surrounded by boughs of laurel

;History
Originally known as the Hobart Deacons, Hobart's athletic teams became known as the "Statesmen" in 1936, following the football team's season opener against [[Amherst College]]. The morning after the game, ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the team as "the statesmen from Geneva," and the name stuck. The nickname for William Smith's athletic teams comes from a contest held in 1982. Several names were submitted, but "[[Heron]]s" was selected because of the strong and graceful birds that lived at nearby Odell's Pond. These ominous birds frequently flew over the athletic fields as the teams were practicing.

;Affiliations
The colleges compete in NCAA Division III, with the exception of men's [[lacrosse]], which competes in the Division I [[Northeast Conference]]. The colleges' main conference affiliation is with the [[Liberty League]] with the following exceptions: Hobart hockey competes in the [[New England Hockey Conferene]]; Hobart lacrosse competes in the Northeast Conference; William Smith ice hockey competes in the [[United Collegiate Hockey Conference]]; and the William Smith golf team is an independent.

;Facilities
Hobart and William Smith recently finished construction on the state of the art Caird Center for Sports and Recreation, which is now home to most of its athletics teams.

;Football
Offensive linesman [[Ali Marpet]], drafted in the 2nd round, 61st overall, of the [[2015 NFL draft]], is the highest-drafted pick in the history of [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] football.&lt;ref name="nbcsports.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/02/ali-marpet-puts-d3-hobart-on-the-nfl-draft-scoreboard/|title=Ali Marpet puts D3 Hobart on the NFL Draft scoreboard – College Football Talk|work=NBC Sports |author=Kevin McGuire|date=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was three-time All-[[Liberty League]] first team (2012, 2013, 2014), and 2014 Liberty League Co-Offensive Player of the Year—the first offensive lineman in league history to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libertyleagueathletics.com/news/2014/11/19/FB_1119141022.aspx|title=Liberty League Athletics – Liberty League announces 2014 Football Award Recipients|work=Liberty League}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorbowl.com/news-highlights-detail.php?news=286|title=Press Release: News: Senior Bowl|work=seniorbowl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afca.com/article/article.php?id=2576|title=AFCA Announces 2014 Division III Coaches All-America Team|work=afca.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227094413/http://www.afca.com/article/article.php?id=2576|archivedate=February 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Statesmen lacrosse team has compiled fifteen national championships (1 USILA, 2 NCAA Division II, and 13 NCAA Division III).

;Golf
The Hobart Statesmen golf team is rich in history and tradition dating back to 1912.

;Field hockey
The William Smith field hockey team has captured three national championships, ascending to the top of Division III in 1992, 1997 and 2000.

;Sailing
The lone coed team, the HWS [[sailing]] team is a member of the [[Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association]]. In 2005, the Colleges won the [[Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association]] Team Race National Championship and the ICSA Coed Dinghy National Championship.

;Soccer
The William Smith soccer team was the first Heron squad to capture a national championship, winning the 1988 title bout with a 1–0 victory over [[University of California, San Diego]].  The Herons won their second national championship in 2013 with a 2–0 victory over Trinity University, Texas.

;Crew
The Hobart Crew team has also found success, earning gold medals at the Head of The Charles Regatta, the ECAC National Invitational Regatta (most recently a gold in the 2nd varsity 8+ over the "Hometown Boys" of WPI in 2015), and the IRA National Championships.  While the Hobart Crew team has won gold in every event they have entered since the inception of rowing as a Liberty League Sport, they failed to win the team championships only once (2004.) The eventual champions, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, were known for having a large team and only able to defeat the Statesmen by securing a win in the 2nd Varsity 8+ – the only event that Hobart did not have an entry. However, over the past few seasons Hobart has fielded one of the most dominant 2nd Varsity 8's in school history.  The Crew Team took part in the '''Henley Royal Regatta''' in '''Henley, England''' in the summer of 2011, as well as the summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.row2k.com/henley/features.cfm?ID=1216&amp;site=henley#.VZ2gM_lViko|title=Henley Thursday: Making the Most of Chances|website=row2k.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early History and Growth==

===Geneva Academy===
Geneva Academy was founded in 1796 when Geneva was just a small frontier settlement. It is believed to be the first school formed in Geneva.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.rays-place.com/ny/geneva-4.htm
|title=History of Ontario County – History of Geneva College in Geneva, New York. |accessdate=June 6, 2010|work=|publisher=D. Mason &amp; Company, Syracuse, N.Y., 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was considered "the gateway to Genesee County" and was in the early stages of development from the wilderness.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; Geneva Academy was founded by Rev. Henry Axtell. On May 3, 1796, a special meeting was held, as recorded in town of Seneca records, and three commissioners were chosen to receive the moneys granted by the state for the "use of schools."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

In 1809, the trustees of the academy announced the engagement of the Rev. Andrew Wilson, formerly of the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland as head of the school.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; He remained until 1812 when Ransom Hubell, a graduate of [[Union College]], was made principal.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; The academy was granted a charter on March 29, 1813.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; In 1817, Hubbell was succeeded by the Rev. John S. Cook. On December 8, 1817, due to some "differences of feeling,"&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; a meeting of the board of trustees was held and it was decided the academy operations should be suspended. A committee was appointed consisting of the Rev. Henry Axtell, James Carter, and David Cook, to take charge of the school building and allow use by "any respectable teacher" until the trustees came to a decision and resumed their duties.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt;

The first meeting after the suspension took place on March 6, 1821. It was called by trustee James Rees to announce [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]] had bequeathed an endowment of $750 per annum to the school, specifically for the support of an academy at [[Fairfield, New York]].&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; One of the conditions of the grant from Trinity Church was Geneva residents should erect a building for the accommodation of the "Branch Theological School." Another stipulation required the site location be chosen by Bishop Hobart.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; Agreeable to the resolution, the bishop viewed several sites in Geneva and on March 17, 1821, he communicated to the trustees his selection of the college site.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; The Rev. Daniel McDonald D.D., formerly principal of the Fairfield Academy, was appointed principal of Geneva Academy.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; The academy reopened its doors on April 25, 1821, in a frame schoolhouse erected in 1817 in the rear of Trinity Church in Geneva.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt;

Early pioneers felt the need of "education advantages" beyond what the academy could provide. At the request of Trinity Church,&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; they began raising funds using voluntary labor and subscription. "They boldly built Geneva Hall before they applied to the state for a charter."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; By the spring of 1822,&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; sufficient community funds had been raised to complete Geneva Hall, a stone structure still in use today.

===Geneva College===
On April 10, 1822, Geneva College received a provisional charter. The State Regents of New York demanded the accumulation of funds yielding $4,000 per year before a permanent charter was granted. The college was accorded a three-year grace period to meet this requirement.&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hobart College, 125 Years Old, Prospers on Unusual. |newspaper=[[Rochester Democrat and Chronicle]] |location=Rochester, New York |date=June 1, 1947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regents granted the full charter on February 8, 1825, and at that time, Geneva Academy officially changed its name to Geneva College.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; Rev. J. Adams was president of the college as of 1827.

[[File:Genevacollegedrawing1.jpg|thumb|left| Ad for Geneva College, 1841]]

Creative financing by the founders of Geneva College plagued their successors for several decades. In a marketing effort, the founders sent agents selling certificates, which for $100 entitled "the subscriber, his heirs and assigns, to the privilege of sending one student to the Geneva Academy (or to Geneva College) for 20 years, commencing from the date hereof or any time he choose."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

The certificates became known as "The Little Old Men of the Sea," because decade after decade they were turned in for redemption and caused much consternation for the college fathers. Times changed and the cost of education and the cost of living in Geneva soared, leaving quite a financial burden for the school. The last certificate showed up in 1930 and was honored by Hobart College.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

In 1824, a course in "practical business" was instituted, a creative concept during those days. "In direct reference to the practical business of life by which the Agricultural, the Merchant and the Mechanic may receive a practical knowledge of what genius and experience have discovered without passing through a tedious course of Classical Studies."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; This course was in addition to the traditional college program.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

The "English Course," as it was known, was a radical departure from long established educational usage and represented the beginning of the college work pattern found today.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

===Geneva Medical College===
[[File:Geneva medical college lg.jpg|thumb|Geneva Medical College]]
{{Main|Geneva Medical College}}

Geneva Medical College was founded on September 15, 1834, as a separate department (college) of Geneva College. The medical school was founded by [[Edward Cutbush]], who also served as the first dean for the school.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; In 1871, Hobart College disbanded the medical school and sold its library, anatomical specimens, and other tangible assets to Dean John Towler, who donated them to [[Syracuse University]] on condition the trustees immediately establish an [[American Medical Association]]-approved medical school. Thus the Syracuse University College of Medicine came into being on December 4, 1871, with Frederick Hyde as dean.&lt;ref name="syracuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate.edu/com/about/history.php
|title=History of the College of Medicine |accessdate=June 4, 2010|work=|publisher=SUNY Upstate Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of greatest prosperity for the school occurred between the years 1840 to 1850. During that time, 596 physicians graduated from the college.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt;

===Elizabeth Blackwell===
[[File:P12b9.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Elizabeth Blackwell Class of 1849]]

Amid many distinguished male graduates was one woman. In an era when the prevailing conventional wisdom was no woman could withstand the intellectual and emotional rigors of a medical education, [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], (1821–1910) applied to and was rejected – or simply ignored – by 29 medical schools before being admitted in 1847 to the Medical Institution of Geneva College.&lt;ref name="liz"/&gt;

The medical faculty, largely opposed to her admission but seemingly unwilling to take responsibility for the decision, decided to submit the matter to a vote of the students. The men of the College voted to admit her.&lt;ref name="lizzie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_35.html
|title=Changing the Face of Medicine – Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell |accessdate=June 5, 2010|work=|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell graduated two years later, on January 23, 1849, at the top of her class to become the first woman doctor in the Northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="liz"/&gt; "The occasion marked the culmination of years of trial and disappointment for Miss Blackwell, and was a key event in the struggle for the emancipation of women in the nineteenth century in America."&lt;ref name="liz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031212033218/http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 12, 2003|title=Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell's Graduation – An Eyewitness Account by Margaret Munro De Lancey|accessdate=June 5, 2010|work=|publisher=Hobart and William Smith Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell went on to found the [[Lower Manhattan Hospital|New York Infirmary for Women and Children]] and had a role in the creation of its medical college.&lt;ref name="liz"/&gt; She then returned to her native England and helped found the [[National Health Society]] and taught at the first college of medicine for women to be established there.

===Hobart College===
[[File:Presidentchair1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hobart President's Chair]]

The school was known as Geneva College until 1852, when it was renamed in memory of its most forceful advocate and founder, Bishop Hobart, to Hobart Free College. In 1860, the name was shortened to Hobart College.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

[[File:Bishop hobart.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bishop Hobart.]]

Hobart College of the 19th century was the first American institution of higher learning to establish a three-year "English Course" of study to educate young men destined for such practical occupations as "journalism, agriculture, merchandise, mechanism, and manufacturing", while at the same time maintaining a traditional four-year "classical course" for those intending to enter "the learned professions."  It also was the first college in America to have a Dean of the College.

Notable 19th-century alumni included [[Albert J. Myer|Albert James Myer]], Class of 1847, a military officer assigned to run the [[United States Weather Bureau]] at its inception, was a founding member of the [[International Meteorological Organization]], and helped birth the [[U.S. Signal Corps]], and for whom [[Fort Myer, Virginia]], is named; General [[Edward S. Bragg|E. S. Bragg]] of the Class of 1848, colonel of the Sixth Wisconsin Regiment and a brigadier general in command of the [[Iron Brigade]] who served one term in Congress and later was ambassador to [[Mexico]] and consul general of the U.S. in [[Cuba]]; two other 1848 graduates, [[Clarence A. Seward]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.samueleells.org/SewardScholarships/SewardScholarshipAbout/ClarenceASeward/tabid/67/Default.aspx|title= A Brief History of Clarence A. Seward|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website= http://www.samueleells.org/|publisher= The Samuel Eells Literary and Educational Foundation|access-date= 2015-03-02|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154240/http://www.samueleells.org/SewardScholarships/SewardScholarshipAbout/ClarenceASeward/tabid/67/Default.aspx|archive-date= April 2, 2015|dead-url= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas M. Griffith, who were assistant secretary of state and builder of the first national railroad across the [[Mississippi River]], respectively; and [[Charles J. Folger]], Class of 1836, a [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] in the 1880s.

Until the mid-20th century, Hobart was strongly affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] and produced many of its clergy. While this affiliation continues to the present, the last Episcopal clergyman to serve as President of Hobart (1956–1966) was Louis Melbourne Hirshson. Since then, the president of the colleges has been a layperson.

During [[World War II]], Hobart College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="navalyearbooks-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/yearbooks.htm |title=Naval Training and Education Yearbooks in the Navy Department Library |publisher=Department of the Navy |last= |first= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding of William Smith College===
Toward the end of the 19th century, Hobart College was on the brink of bankruptcy. It was through the presidency of Langdon Stewardson the college obtained a new donor, nurseryman William Smith.  Smith had built the Smith Opera House in downtown Geneva and the Smith Observatory on his property when he became interested in founding a college for women, a plan he pursued to the point of breaking ground before realizing it was beyond his means. As publicized in The College Signal on October 7, 1903, "William Smith, a millionaire nurseryman, will found and endow a college for women at Geneva, N. Y., to be known as the William Smith College for Women The institution will be in the most beautiful section. One building is to cost $150,000. Mr. Smith maintains the Smith observatory there."&lt;ref&gt;"The College Signal" (Semi-monthly published by the Students of the Massachusetts Agricultural College) Vol. XIV. October 7, 1903. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson learned of Smith's interest and, for two years, attempted to convince him to make Hobart College the object of his philanthropy. With enrollments down and its resources strained, Hobart's future depended upon an infusion of new funds.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:William Smith -- founder of William Smith College.jpg|thumb|right|William Smith.]] --&gt;
Unable to convince Smith to provide direct assistance to Hobart, President Stewardson redirected the negotiations toward founding a coordinate institution for women, a plan that appealed to the [[philanthropist]]. On December 13, 1906, he formalized his intentions; two years later William Smith School for Women – a coordinate, nonsectarian women's college – enrolled its first class of 18 students. That charter class grew to 20 members before its graduation in 1912.

In addition, Smith's gift made possible construction of the Smith Hall of Science, to be used by both colleges, and permitted the hiring, also in 1908, of three new faculty members who would teach in areas previously unavailable in the curriculum: biology, sociology, and psychology.

===World War II===
Between 1943 and 1945, Hobart College trained almost 1,000 men in the U.S. Navy's [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]], many of whom returned to complete their college educations when the post-World War II GI Bill swelled the enrollments of American colleges and universities. In 1948, three of those veterans – [[William Scandling|William F. Scandling]], Harry W. Anderson, and W. P. Laughlin – took over operation of the Hobart dining hall. Their fledgling business was expanded the next year to include William Smith College; after their graduation, in 1949, it grew to serve other colleges and universities across the country, eventually becoming [[Saga Corporation]], a nationwide provider of institutional food services.

==Title IX sexual assault investigation==
On May 1, 2014, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] released a list of 55 colleges being investigated for potential violations of federal law regarding [[sexual assault]] and harassment complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i|website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list included Hobart and William Smith Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i|website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[New York Times]]'' article published in July of the same year detailed a case in which a student reported a sexual assault by three college football players two weeks into her first year; within two weeks the college's investigation cleared the two men accused, despite medical evidence, a corroborating witness to one of the incidents and discrepancies in the alleged perpetrators' accounts of the evening. The story also alleged the members of the disciplinary panel that heard the case were uninformed about sexual assault and frequently changed the subject rather than hear the victim's account of events.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bogdanich |first1=Walter|title=Reporting Rape and Wishing She Hadn't: How One College Handled a Sexual Assault Complaint|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/us/how-one-college-handled-a-sexual-assault-complaint.html|accessdate=13 July 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the report, the colleges unveiled new initiatives and policies, including revising their sexual violence policies, creating a rape hotline and forming an Office of [[Title IX]] Programs and Compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fltimes.com/news/new-initiatives-policies-greet-hws-students/article_2037b6fe-30b4-11e4-a4ac-0019bb2963f4.html|title=New initiatives, policies greet HWS students|last=Miller|first=Jim|website=Finger Lakes Times |access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA's IV&amp;V Program was established in 1993 as part of an Agency-wide strategy to provide the highest achievable levels of safety and cost-effectiveness for mission critical software. NASA's IV&amp;V Program was founded under the [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/ NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)] as a direct result of recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the Presidential Commission on the [https://history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html Space Shuttle Challenger Accident].

Since then, NASA's IV&amp;V Program has experienced growth in personnel, projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. NASA IV&amp;V efforts have contributed to NASA's improved safety record since the program's inception. Today, [[Independent Verification and Validation]] (IV&amp;V) is an Agency-level function, delegated from OSMA to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and managed by NASA IV&amp;V. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's primary business, software IV&amp;V, is sponsored by OSMA as a software assurance technology. Having been reassigned as GSFC, NASA IV&amp;V is Code 180 (Center Director's direct report).

NASA's IV&amp;V Program houses approximately 270 employees and leverages the expertise of in-house partners and contractors. Its facilities are located in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. In the summer, high school and college interns are employed in addition.

== Affiliations ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is affiliated with [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the ERC is part of a nationwide network of training sites at NASA centers and facilities.

== Projects ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is the lead NASA organization for system software IV&amp;V, and is responsible for the management of all system software IV&amp;V efforts within the Agency. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's role is to provide value-added service to the Agency's system software projects, primarily by appropriately performing IV&amp;V on system software based on the cost, size, complexity, life span, risk, and consequences of failure.

NASA's IV&amp;V Program also provides independent technical assessments of NASA systems and software processes/products to identify developmental and operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and reliable software is being provided to NASA missions and projects as they work toward successful systems and software development. Independent assessments can address any aspect of software engineering and can be applied within any SDLC phase. This capability provides for multiple spot-checking throughout the SDLC and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and quality.

== Educator Resource Center ==
Thanks to a grant with [[Fairmont State University]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114223/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/education/erc_index.html Independent Verification and Validation Program Educator Resource Center] (ERC) provides resources and training opportunities for approximately 1,000 in-service, pre-service, and informal educators and in West Virginia annually. The materials and training cover a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ERC also loans hands-on STEM kits to trained teachers which impact over 10,000 students per year in the state.  The on-site student outreach program brings over 2,000 youth to the facility annually to experience workshops on robotics, rocketry, aviation, and other STEM topics.  The ERC also runs numerous student STEM competitions in the fields of robotics and aviation.  Starting in 2012 the ERC became the partner for the FIRST LEGO League competition and has overseen a rapid growth in [http://WVRoboticsAlliance.org robotic competitions] that now include over 100 teams at 10 tournaments statewide each fall.

'''Interlacing patterns''' are patterns of lines and shapes that have traditionally dominated [[Islamic art]]. They can be broadly divided into the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], using curving plant-based elements, and the [[girih]], using mostly [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical forms]] with straight lines or regular curves.  Both of these forms of [[Islamic art]] developed from the rich [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlacing patterns]]  of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and from [[Coptic art]].

==Overview==
Eva Baer, in her book ''Islamic Ornament'' (1998), describes the art:
&lt;blockquote&gt;....the intricate interlacings common in later medieval [[Islamic art]], are already prefigured in [[Umayyad architecture]] revetments: in floor [[mosaics]], window grilles, stone and [[stucco]] carvings and wall paintings(Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qusayr'Amra, Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi etc.), and in the decoration of a whole group of early east Iranian, eighth- to tenth-century metal objects.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Baer ''Islamic Ornament'' p. 41. New York University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-8147-1329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first Western studies of the subject was [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin|E. H. Hankin]]'s "The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art", published in ''Memoirs of the Archaeological Society of India'' in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BArchViewPage.asp?ArticleID=108&amp;PO=1#viewpage "The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art"], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmolallie/2073854747/in/set-72157603842997257/ "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Hankin takes the view that the artists who created these designs used a method based on the use of the compass and the straight edge.&lt;ref&gt;E. H Hankin, ''The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art'', p.2&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by the majority of contemporary authorities on the subject, such as [[Keith Critchlow]] in his book, ''Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach''.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Critchlow, ''Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This explains how ornamented objects as varied in size as a book or a mosque, were treated by artists using the same geometric methods adapted to the size and nature of the object being ornamented.&lt;ref&gt;Daud Sutton, ''Islamic Design: A Genius for Geometry'', Walker Publishing Company, 2007. p. 1. ({{ISBN|0-8027-1635-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] describes a method whereby interlace ornament is designed on a foundation of geometric [[wikt:grid|grids]], with the same grids re-drawn to the size of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Jones, ''The Grammar of Ornament'', p. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;
In his catalog for the ''[[The Great Exhibition|Crystal Palace]]'' exhibition, Jones wrote about the decorative art found in the [[Alhambra]], where much of the decoration consists of interwoven designs, that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The grace and refinement of Greek ornament is here surpassed. Possessing, equally with the Greeks, an appreciation of pure form, the Moors exceeded them in variety and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Iain Zaczek quoting Owen Jones, in his annotation of Owen Jones' ''The Grammar of Ornament'', p.206&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arabesque==
{{main|Arabesque (Islamic art)}}

The Islamic arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. It usually consists of a single design which can be 'tiled' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

==Girih==
{{main|Girih}}

'''Girih''' ({{lang-fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, "knot"), also '''''girih sāzī''''' ({{lang|fa|گره سازی}}, "knot making") or '''''girih chīnī''''' ({{lang|fa|گره چینی}}), is an [[Islamic art|Islamic decorative art]] form used in [[architecture]] and handicrafts (book covers, tapestry, small metal objects), consisting of  [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric lines]] that form an [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] [[strapwork]]. In [[Iranian architecture]], ''gereh sazi'' patterns were seen in [[banna'i]] brickwork, [[stucco]], and [[mosaic]] [[faience]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh Sazi | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica Online| accessdate=15 December 2015| url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih has been defined as "geometric (often star-and-polygon) designs composed upon or generated from arrays of points from which construction lines radiate and at which they intersect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Allen, Terry |year=2004 | title=Islamic Art and the Argument from Academic Geometry | url=http://sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/academicgeometry.htm | accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And the answer of his people was not but they said, "Bring us the punishment of Allah, if you should be of the truthful."&lt;br&gt;He said, "My Lord, support me against the corrupting people."&lt;br&gt;And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings, they said, "Indeed, we will destroy the people of that Lot's city. Indeed, its people have been wrongdoers." |Quran|Sura 29 ([[Al-Ankabut]]), 28-31}}

The [[Quran]] expresses clear disapproval of ''lutis'' (described as male [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] rather than as sodomites). In the Qur'an, Lot is quoted as saying to his people:
{{Quote|"Do you approach males among the worlds. And leave what your Lord has created for you as mates? But you are a people transgressing." They said, "If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be of those evicted." He said, "Indeed, I am, toward your deed, of those who detest [it]." |Quran|Sura 26 ([[Ash-Shu'ara]]), 165-168}}

{{Quote|And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you commit immorality while you are seeing? Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly."|Quran|Sura 27 ([[An-Naml]]), 54-55}}


The Qur'an directly comments on the people of Lot and on the nature of their sins:
{{Quote|By your life, [O Muhammad], indeed they [people of Lot] were, in their intoxication, wandering blindly. So the shriek seized them at sunrise. And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay. Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.|Quran|Sura 15 ([[Al-Hijr]]), 72-75}}

Although the Qur'an does not contain a specific punishment or guidance for a ''luti'', the context clearly indicates homosexuality as a moral corruption and describes the punishment for such action for the people of Lot when it grew widespread and accepted in their society.
{{Quote|And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, "Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people." But the answer of his people was only that they said, "Evict them from your city! Indeed, they are men who keep themselves pure." So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was of those who remained [with the evildoers]. And We rained upon them a rain [of stones]. Then see how was the end of the criminals.|Quran|Sura 7 ([[Al-A'raf]]), 80-84}}

===Hadiths===
The [[hadith]] are reports of Muhammad's sayings and deeds from those close to him in his lifetime. Sunni Hadiths on the subject of anal intercourse between individuals clearly state that it is strictly forbidden. The four [[Madh'hab|Sunni schools]] unanimously disapprove anal intercourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/fatwa_sex_008.html |title=Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract? |publisher=Islamawareness.net |date=2004-01-24 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/6792 |title=Islam Question and Answer - Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract? |publisher=[[Islamqa]].info |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as several hadith state:

But when they have cleansed themselves, go in unto them as Allah has commanded you. Allah loves those who keep themselves clean." (2:222)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Sunni Islam, anal intercourse is forbidden even if husband and wife mutually agree on it because mutual agreement does not allow something that has been made forbidden in Sunni hadith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fareena Alam |url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex_queries.htm |title=Matters pertaining to Sex |publisher=Themodernreligion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamworld.net/docs/marriage.html |title=The Etiquettes Of Marriage And Wedding |publisher=Islam World |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |first=Muhammad Naasirudden |last=al-Albaani |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825080106/http://www.islamworld.net/docs/marriage.html |archivedate=2012-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fareena |url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-shariah.html |title=Human Sexuality and the Shariat |publisher=Themodernreligion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/1103|title=Ruling on Intercourse with a Woman in her rectum|last=Al-Munajjid|first=Sheikh Muhammed Salih|date=1998-03-04|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], a contemporary [[Sunni]] [[List of modern-day Muslim scholars|Muslim scholar]], states that anal intercourse is [[Haraam|prohibited]] and a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it, and may seek divorce over it if her husband persists or tries to force her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/6792 |title=Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract? |publisher=Islamqa.info |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 When Husband Insists on Anal Sex with His Wife - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054059/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the act is forbidden. Scholars like Qaradawi and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Salih Al Munajjid]] have clarified that it doesn't nullify the marriage, and the wife must seek divorce in order to separate from the husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 Anal Sex with the Wife: Does It Nullify Marriage? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054251/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/6792|title=Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract?|last=Al-Munajjid|first=Sheikh Muhammed Salih|date=2000-01-06|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Couples who have done it should repent and stop repeating such major sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/52803|title=Is there any expiation for having intercourse with a woman in her back passage|last=|first=|date=2004-12-01|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, a commonly misinterpreted&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and decontextualized verse from the Qur'an is most often cited as a ground to validate anal intercourse between husband and wife:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawaj.com/tag/anal-sex-in-islam/ |title=Anal Sex In Islam |publisher=Zawaj.com |accessdate=2012-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309174333/http://www.zawaj.com/tag/anal-sex-in-islam/|archive-date=2012-03-09|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will''', and send (good deeds) before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and know that ye will (one day) meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, (O Muhammad)
:—Qur'an 2:223&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al Munajjid]] clarifies that this verse is indicative of the different positions a married couple may copulate in, or adopt, in sexual intercourse, and is fully permissible as long as intercourse takes place in the vagina and not anus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Involving the anus in lovemaking or foreplay is also forbidden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/40520|title=Inserting fingers into the back passage|last=|first=|date=2003-09-20|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/71345|title=Intercourse in the back passage|last=|first=|date=2005-12-05|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inserting fingers or objects into the back passage is considered a perversion and is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/44971|title=Repulsive forms of pleasure|last=|first=|date=2003-09-25|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/60200|title=Ruling on one who puts something in his back passage, and how can he be treated?|last=|first=|date=2005-11-19|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the very word "cultivate" has been interpreted unanimously&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by all Sunni Islamic jurists as impregnating the wife or nurturing wife as though a farmer cultivates a piece of land, but not as a means of performing forbidden practices.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Law (Shariah)==

===Sunni opinion ===
Islamic law, or ''[[Sharia|shariah]]'', developed during the 8th and 9th centuries in several different "schools" based on varying interpretations of the Quran and the hadith.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Jivraj&amp;de Jong, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[hadith]]s, the reported sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, prescribe harsh punishments for homosexuality, and this is reflected in the majority of shariah, the Islamic legal codes. Since sexual relations under shariah are only permissible within heterosexual marriage, it follows that sex outside such marriage is adultery and/or fornication, both of which attract punishments.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Homosexual sodomy, defined as adultery or fornication or both, thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi|Abu Eisa At-Tirmidhi]] said, “The people of knowledge disagreed over the legal punishment for the sodomite. The view of some of them is that he should be condemned to death, whether he is married or unmarried, and this is the saying of [[Malik ibn Anas|Malik]], [[Al-Shafi‘i|Ash-Shafi’ee]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ahmad]], and [[Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh|Ishaq]]. Scholars among the jurists of the companion’s students such as [[Hasan of Basra|Hasan Al-Basri]], [[Alqama ibn Qays|Ibrahim An-Nakh’ai]], [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata’ ibn Abu Rabah]] and others said that the legal punishment for sodomy is equivalent to the punishment for adultery, and this is the saying of [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Sufyan Ath-Thawri]] and the people of Kufa.”



One passage in the Qur'an takes a particular legal position towards proven adultery, as well as homosexuality in conjunction with the punishments mentioned in hadith as the punishment is prescribed for 'unlawful sexuality':&lt;ref&gt;Sura 4:16, quoted in Wafer, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Those who commit unlawful sexual intercourse of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. And if they testify, confine the guilty women to houses until death takes them or Allah ordains for them [another] way. And the two who commit it among you, dishonor them both. But if they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone. Indeed, Allah is ever Accepting of repentance and Merciful.|Quran|Sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), 15-16}}

Despite unanimous disapproval of Homosexuality in Islam, in practice, cultural norms in different Muslim countries vary from punishment to condemnation, and only a few Muslim countries actually carry out such punishments.

===Shi'ite opinion ===
Most Shia scholars do not permit anal intercourse, those who do say it is extremely [[Makruh|makrooh]].&lt;ref&gt;Therefore the majority of the Shi'ah mujtahids have derived two conclusions: (l) that anal intercourse is not haram but strongly disliked (karahatan shadidah) provided the wife agrees to it. (2) and if she does not agree to it, then all mujtahids say that it is precautionarily wajib to refrain from it. (See the fatawa of all contemporary mujtahids in their annotations to al-'Urwatu'l-Wuthqa, p. 628)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are strong indications that Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], looked unfavorably upon anal penetration as codified in his two volume work, [[Tahrir al-Wasilah]].

According to Grand Ayatollah [[Ali al-Sistani|Sistani]], anal intercourse between married couple is permissible under condition that "permission is bound to wife’s agreement", however the act itself "is strongly undesirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alulbayt.com/rulings/11.htm|title=Fatwas of Sayyid Sistani|work=alulbayt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Grand Ayatollah [[Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi]], "anal sex is allowed with her (wife's) permission. Although very hated and discouraged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.shirazi.ir/topics/sex |title=Question: Is anal sex allowed in Islam? |publisher=shirazi.ir |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074905/http://www.english.shirazi.ir/topics/sex|archive-date=2017-10-27|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz-Association]], cooperates with the [[University of Rostock]] and was founded in 1992. Employing about 160 people the main focus lies on interdisciplinary study of coastal oceans and marginal seas, especially on [[Baltic Sea]] related [[oceanography]]. The institute is a follow-up of the former Institute of Oceanography ("Institut für Meereskunde") which was part of the [[East Germany|GDR]] Academy of Science.

The institute is divided in four departments: physical oceanography, marine chemistry, biological oceanography, and marine geology. Central task of the institute is fundamental research but also teaching at the universities of [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. IOW has direct access to the research vessel "[[RV Maria S. Merian|Maria S. Merian]]" and can access by request a variety of other medium-sized vessels for longer trips and interdisciplinary tasks from the German research fleet. The institute's facilities are financed by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]], and the Ministry of Education of [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]].

A '''level spreader''' is an [[erosion control]] device designed to reduce [[water pollution]] by mitigating the impact of high-velocity [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff]].  It is used both on [[construction sites]] and for permanent applications such as drainage for [[road]]s and [[highway]]s. The device reduces the energy level in high-velocity flow by converting it into sheet flow, and disperses the discharged water so that it may be [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrated]] into [[soil]].

'''Linnaeus' flower clock''' was a garden plan hypothesized by [[Carl Linnaeus]] that would take advantage of several plants that open or close their flowers at particular times of the day to accurately indicate the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Linnaeus’ Floral Clock. |author=Anonymous |date=March 2013 (acc. January 17, 2014) |url=http://www.linnean.org/The-Society/This+Month/March+2013 |work=The Linnean Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Carolus Linnaeus’ Floral Clocks. |author=Coturnix |date=May 23, 2007 (acc.

He proposed the concept in his 1751 publication ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'', calling it the ''Horologium Florae'' (lit. "''flower clock''").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Philosophia Botanica, section 335. |author=C Linnaeus |date=1751 (acc.

Cadell Publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may never have planted such a garden, but the idea was attempted by several [[botanical garden]]s in the early 19th century, with mixed success. Many plants exhibit a strong [[circadian rhythm]] (see also [[Chronobiology]]), and a few have been observed to open at quite a regular time, but the accuracy of such a clock is diminished because flowering time is affected by weather and seasonal effects. The flowering times recorded by Linnaeus are also subject to differences in daylight due to [[latitude]]: his measurements are based on flowering times in [[Uppsala]], where he taught and had received his university education.

Some 30 years before Linnaeus' birth, such a floral clock may have been described by [[Andrew Marvell]], in his poem "[[The Garden (poem)|The Garden]]" (1678):
&lt;blockquote&gt;How well the skilful gardener drew&lt;br&gt;
Of flow'rs and herbs this dial new;&lt;br&gt;
Where from above the milder sun&lt;br&gt;
Does through a fragrant zodiac run;&lt;br&gt;
And, as it works, th' industrious bee&lt;br&gt;
Computes its time as well as we.&lt;br&gt;
How could such sweet and wholesome hours&lt;br&gt;
Be reckoned but with herbs and flow'rs!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Maritime security operations''' ('''MSO''') are the actions of modern [[Navy|naval forces]] to "combat sea–based [[terrorism]] and other illegal activities, such as hijacking, [[piracy]], and [[slavery]], also known as [[human trafficking]]."&lt;ref name="MARITIME-SECURITY-OPERATIONS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/about/navylife/onduty/navyglobalinvolvement/maritime/|title=Maritime Security Operations|publisher=[[US Navy]]|accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ships assigned to such operations may also assist seafaring vessels in distress. These activities are part of an overall category of activities which fall short of open warfare called [[military operations other than war]] (MOOTW).MSO also involve the marine environmental protection, creating a safer and clean environment.

Their mission is to create a safer and reliable international ocean transportation system, to protect the public from any unfair and deceiving practice.

A primary component of MSO requires inspections and, at times, forced [[Boarding (attack)|boardings]] of vessels at sea. These actions are called [[visit, board, search, and seizure]] (VBSS). Also arrests and VBSS of ships which may have been sighted (via lookouts) from a distance to be underway and not responding to communications made to her or may have some form of smaller attached crafts which may be seen to be used as other means to attack larger crafts.

==Who==

There are two major naval forces that conduct such operations; the United States Coast Guard and the United States Navy. Although they both have very distinct jobs from one another, one of their major jobs is to be able to provide security operations.

The U.S Coast Guard is a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]], they have eleven official missions. Their role is to provide port &amp; waterway security, drug interdiction, search and rescue, marine environment protection, [[ICE operations]], aids to navigation, living marine recourses, marine safety, defense readiness, law enforcement and migrant interdiction along with several other missions. Overall, their role is to provide a safer maritime industry.

Along with the U.S Coast Guard, the U.S Navy is also another branch if the Unites Stated Armed forces. Unlike the Coast Guard, the Navy is a projection of force in areas beyond the U.S shores. Their operations go beyond the shores; they provide aid to military out on the sea, carry troops to other countries, strategic plans for attacks and protect the sea lanes.

==Operations==
Today's modern naval force have been able to detect, strategize, and prevent dozens of several illegal activities. Piracy, being one of the must known crime in the maritime industry has not been able to control its activities. Piracy was known to have a great presence during the early 1500s, up to this day the number of piracy activity is still significantly large. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the number of piracy attack have been found to be cyclical in nature, taking its high points in 2003 and 2010. In spite of this high point, several organization against anti-piracy such as the [[Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO)&lt;ref&gt;Counter-piracy operations (Archived). (2016, December 19). Retrieved April 9, 2017, from http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_48815.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  have been able to disrupt pirates attacks protecting vessel and their crew member along with their cargo.  As a safety measure, the U.S Coast Guard encourage the ships' captain to know his crew, deliver a detailed plan of his sea trip to a trusted friend, final check before departing, notify Coast Guard of any suspicious activity, and finally consider clearing local customs before departing on a foreign cruise. Taking these protective measures will lessen the possibility of piracy or high jacking.&lt;ref&gt;Nincic, D. J. (2013, October 1). Maritime Security: Current Threats and Implications. Retrieved April 9, 2017, from http://www.pacmar.com/story/2013/10/01/features/maritime-security:-current-threats-and-implications/184.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant amount of contraband such as drugs has entered many ports through vessels claiming to be caring different types of cargo. Drug Interdiction is one of the eleven Coast Guard official missions, they aim to prevent drug traffic by intersecting drug carrying vessels out at sea. Mariners aboard a vessel that have information that a ship is involved in narcotics trafficking are required to contact their nearest Coast Guard unit. Several cargo ships have been contained with thousands of kilos on board. In the mid-year of 2015, the {{USS|Gary|FFG 51}} marked its tenth successful interdiction since October 2014. Joining forces with the U.S Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy they contained 11,700 kilograms of cocaine off the coast of Central America. While conducting a regular patrol the USS Gary tailed and located a small coastal freighter. After observing the crew discarding suspicious contraband overboard Gary launched a small boat to recover the suspected contraband.&lt;ref&gt;Singer	USS ''GARY'' (FFG 51) Public Affairs Officer, %. %.

Slavery also known as human trafficking in modern days is the act of forcing some type of labor or sexual act upon someone. As the years go by the number of men, women, and children being trafficking are significantly large, this is happening around the world including the United States. Human trafficking comes second to drug trafficking generating billions of dollars per year. This crime is hard to follow up due to the victim's language and fear to the traffickers and law enforcement. The [[Department of the Navy]] (DoN) and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) along with other offices have come together to fight and ensure that the Combating Trafficking in the Persons (CTIP) policies are properly implemented and integrated. In the month of January 2017, the SDPD was able to arrest 38 men involved with human trafficking during an undercover operation. Even though the Coast Guard and the Navy were not involved in this operation, they also have operations similar to drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Human Trafficking. (2017, March 22).

Retrieved April 9, 2017, from https://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/&lt;/ref&gt;

Search and rescue missions is also considered a maritime security operation, it is one of the oldest Coast Guard missions. As the leader in the field of search and rescue missions, worldwide, to do so the coast guard keeps facilities on the East, West, and Gulf coasts. When a [[search and rescue]](SAR) mission is being conducted, it involves cutter, aircraft, and boats. Their goal is to minimize the loss of life and injuries, to provide aid to those in need of it. Using the coordinates of the vessel in need gives the Coast Guard and an idea of where to look for. These coordinates are given by a device called a "Black Box".&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Coast Guard Office of Search and Rescue (CG-SAR). (2016, December 21). Retrieved April 9, 2017, from https://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such operations is the involvement of the multinational coalition [[Combined Task Force 150]], which performs Maritime Security Operations in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Persian Gulf]]. During the [[Somali Civil War]], they provided anti-piracy operations along the coast of [[Somalia]] in international waters. During the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|2006–2007 war]], they performed a cordon along the coast to prevent the escape of [[Al-Qaeda]] operatives by sea.&lt;!-- ==See also== --&gt;

The '''McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research''' is a research institute of the [[University of Cambridge]] in [[England]].

==History==
The Institute was established in 1990 through a generous benefaction from the late Dr [[Daniel McLean McDonald]], a successful industrialist. Dr D. M. McDonald, (1905 &amp;ndash; 1991),  was founder and Chairman of the [[Birmingham Sound Reproducers|BSR Group]], manufacturers of record turntables and record changers. The benefaction enabled the University to construct purpose-built premises for the Institute which include research rooms and laboratories, together with storage space, a seminar room and a modest library.

==Mission and purpose==
The Institute provides support for Cambridge-based researchers in the various branches of [[archaeology]], with a particular interest in the archaeology of early [[human]] [[cognition]]. The Institute emphasises the value of archaeological science, and contains laboratories for [[geoarchaeology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[archaeobotany]], and artefact analysis. The extensive faunal remains collection of the Department of Archaeology is now based within the McDonald Institute and a corresponding reference collection of plant remains is being assembled. There are also research rooms for post-excavation work on major field projects.

The Institute is primarily a centre for post-doctoral research though it does provide facilities for a number of PhD students whose research fits within existing McDonald Institute themes.  In addition to providing space for projects and researchers, the McDonald Institute also has an annual programme of grants for Cambridge-based projects, and an active publications division which produces the McDonald Institute Monograph series and the twice-yearly ''[[Cambridge Archaeological Journal]]''.

Medical toxicology is officially recognized as a medical subspecialty by the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]].&lt;ref name="ACMT_Intro"/&gt; Its practitioners are [[physician]]s, whose primary specialization is generally in [[emergency medicine]], [[occupational medicine]], or [[pediatrics]].

Medical toxicology is closely related to [[clinical toxicology]], with the latter discipline encompassing non-physicians as well (generally pharmacists or scientists).

==Professional services and venues==
* In [[emergency department]]s, [[intensive care unit]]s, and other [[inpatient]] units, medical toxicoloists provide direct treatment and bedside consultation of acutely poisoned adults and children.&lt;ref name="ACMT_Intro"/&gt;
* In [[outpatient]] clinics, offices, and job sites, medical toxicologists evaluate the health impact from acute and chronic exposure to toxic substances in the workplace, home and general environment.&lt;ref name="ACMT_Intro"/&gt;
* In regional [[poison control center]]s, medical toxicologists provide advice.&lt;ref name="ACMT_Intro"/&gt;

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993).

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

'''''Monatsschrift für die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums''''' ("Monthly magazine for science and history of Judaism", abbreviated to '''''MGWJ''''') is a monthly journal devoted to the [[science of Judaism]]. It was founded by [[Zecharias Frankel]] in [[Dresden]] in 1851, following the suppression of ''[[Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums]]'' in 1846.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt; It was published in [[Germany]] for 83 years between 1851 and 1939&lt;ref name="jvl" /&gt; (except in 1887–1892)&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jvl" /&gt; In time, it became the leading journal in the Jewish world.&lt;ref name="jvl" /&gt;

Frankel believed that the objects striven for in the contest of 1848 had been attained, and that the Jews no longer had separate political interests. He therefore considered that the time had arrived for them to undertake a scientific investigation of their history and literature.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;

The first seventeen volumes of the "''Monatsschrift''" were edited by Frankel, who was succeeded by the historian [[Heinrich Graetz]]. The latter edited vols. xviii. to xxxvi. inclusive, being assisted by Pinkus Frankl of [[Berlin]] in vols. xxxiii. to xxxv. Publication was stopped in 1887, but was resumed in 1892, with Marcus Brann&lt;ref name="jewishencMarcus"/&gt; and [[David Kaufmann]] as joint editors (vols. xxxvii. to xliii.). Upon Kaufmann's death (1899) Brann became sole editor. Since Jan., 1904, the "''Monatsschrift''" has appeared as the organ of the Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaft des Judenthums.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;

The "''Monatsschrif''" was first published in Dresden. Some volumes were then issued in [[Krotoschin]] and some in Berlin; but the greatest number appeared in [[Breslau]]. A complete table of contents for the first seventeen volumes is appended to vol. xvii., and a similar table for the years 1869 to 1887 is given at the end of vol. xxxvi. This table has been published separately also.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;

[[File:Map of America by Sebastian Munster.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Sebastian Münster]]'s map of the New World, first published in 1540]]
[[File:Graverat titelblad - Skoklosters slott - 93404.tif|thumb|History of the New World "Historia antipodum oder newe Welt". Matthäus Merian, 1631.]]

The '''New World''' is one of the names used for the majority of [[Earth]]'s [[Western Hemisphere]], specifically the [[Americas]] (including nearby islands such as those of the [[List of Caribbean islands|Caribbean]] and [[Bermuda]]).

The term originated in the early 16th century after [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Europeans made landfall]] in what would later be called the Americas in the [[age of discovery]], expanding the geographical horizon of [[Greco-Roman geography|classical geographers]], who had thought of the [[world]] as consisting of [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], collectively now referred to as the [[Old World]] (a.k.a. [[Afro-Eurasia]]).

The phrase gained prominence after the publication of a pamphlet titled ''Mundus Novus'' attributed to [[Italians|Italian]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=upkyAQAAMAAJ Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci; translation by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press; 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Americas were also referred to as the "fourth part of the world".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"&gt;M.H.Davidson (1997) ''Columbus Then and Now, a life re-examined. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press'', p. 417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The terms "[[Old World]]" vs. "New World" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major [[ecozones]], and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.

One can speak of the "New World" in a [[history|historical]] context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] and other events of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial]] period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], such as [[Bermuda]] and [[Clipperton Island]], collectively.

The term "New World" is used in a [[biology|biological]] context, when one speaks of Old World ([[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]], [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropic]]) and New World species ([[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]], [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]]). Biological [[Biological classification|taxonomists]] often attach the "New World" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the "Old World" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. [[New World monkey]]s, [[New World vulture]]s, [[New World warbler]]s.

The label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as "Old World". Common Old World crops (e.g., [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[oats]], [[pea]]s, [[rye]], [[wheat]]), and domesticated animals (e.g., [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]]) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian contact]] in the 1490s (see "[[Columbian Exchange]]"). Conversely, many common [[crops]] were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as "[[New World crops]]"; [[common bean]]s (''phaseolus''), [[maiz]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]] – the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]" – as well as the [[avocado]], [[tomato]], and wide varieties of [[capsicum]] ([[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], etc.), and the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] were originally domesticated by [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], while agriculturalists in the [[Andean]] region of South America brought forth the [[cassava]], [[peanut]], [[potato]], [[quinoa]] and domesticated animals like the [[alpaca]], [[guinea pig]] and [[llama]]. Other famous New World crops include the [[cashew]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rubber]], [[sunflower]], [[tobacco]], and [[vanilla]], and fruits like the [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[pineapple]]. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the [[calabash]] (bottle-gourd), [[cotton]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and the dog, are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the [[Old World|Old]] and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by [[Paleo-Indians]] from Asia during the [[last glacial period]].

In [[wine terminology]], "New World" has a different definition. "[[New World wines]]" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the Near East.&lt;ref name="Wine Folly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/new-world-vs-old-world-wine/|title=Real Differences: New World vs Old World Wine |publisher= Wine Folly|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==

[[File:Stradanus America.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the New World: [[Amerigo Vespucci]] awakens the sleeping America]] 
The term "New World" ("Mundus Novus") was first coined by the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], in a letter written to his friend and former patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463–1503)|Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici]] in the Spring of 1503, and published (in [[Latin]]) in 1503–04 under the title ''Mundus Novus''. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by [[Christopher Columbus]], but rather an entirely different continent, a "New World".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"/&gt;

Vespucci first approached this realization in June 1502, during a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions at the watering stop of "Bezeguiche" (the Bay of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]) – his own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered [[Brazil]], and the vanguard ships of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second Portuguese India armada]] of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the [[West Indies]], with what the returning sailors told him of the [[East Indies]]. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet – at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations.&lt;ref&gt;This preliminary letter from Bezeguiche was not published, but remained in manuscript form. It is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen (1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 78–82]).&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501–02, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the ''Mundus Novus'' letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:&lt;ref&gt;English translation of ''Mundus Novus'' as found in Markham (1894: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 42–52])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In passed days I wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries, which have been found and explored with the ships, at the  cost and by the command of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and all who hear about them they will be entirely new.  For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea, which they have called the Atlantic; and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited. But this opinion is false, and entirely opposed to the  truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent in that southern part; full of animals and more populous than our Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us.|}}

Vespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Varnhagen, ''Amerígo Vespucci'' (1865:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 13–26]) provides side-by-side reproductions of both the 1503 Latin version ''Mundus Novus'', and the 1507 Italian re-translation "El Nuovo Mondo de Lengue Spagnole interpretato in Idioma Ro. Libro Quinto" (from ''Paesi Nuovamente retrovati''). The Latin version of ''Mundus Novus'' was reprinted many times (see Varnhagen, 1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 9] for a list of early reprints).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prior usage ===

While Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term "New World" (''Mundus Novus'') for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] had used the term "un altro mundo" ("another world") to refer to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;Cadamosto ''Navigationi'', c. 1470, as reprinted in Giovanni Ramusio (1554: [https://books.google.com/books?id=iZ5TZHXOnYcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA106-IA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 106]). See also M. Zamora ''Reading Columbus'', (1993: p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new "fourth" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.

The [[Italy|Italian]]-born Spanish chronicler [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= de Madariaga | first= Salvador | authorlink= Salvador de Madariaga | year=1952 | publisher= Editorial Hermes | location= Mexico | edition= 5th | title= Vida del muy magnífico señor Don Cristóbal Colón | page= 363 | quote= "nuevo mundo", [...] designación que Pedro Mártyr será el primero en usar | language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr used the term ''Orbe Novo'' (literally, "New Globe", but often translated as "New World") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, "orbis" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while "mundus" refers to the land within it).&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: p. 268)&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr had been writing and circulating private letters commenting on Columbus's discoveries since 1493 and, from the start, doubted Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia ("the Indies"), and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Bourne ''Spain in America, 1450–580'' New York: Harper (1904: p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Peter Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the "western antipodes" ("antipodibus occiduis", letter of May 14, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 72])&lt;/ref&gt; the "new hemisphere of the earth" ("novo terrarum hemisphaerio", September 13, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 133, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt; and in a letter dated November 1, 1493, refers to Columbus as the "discoverer of the new globe" ("Colonus ille novi orbis repertor").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 138, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 76])&lt;/ref&gt; A year later (October 20, 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe ("Novo Orbe") and the "Western hemisphere."("ab occidente hemisphero").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 156 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] touched the continent of South America in his 1498 [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]]. In his own 1499 letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, reporting the results of his third voyage, Columbus relates how the massive waters of the [[Orinoco]] delta rushing into the [[Gulf of Paria]] implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind it.&lt;ref&gt;"if the river mentioned does not proceed from the terrestrial paradise, it comes from an immense tract of land situated in the south, of which no knowledge has been hitherto obtained" (Columbus 1499 letter on the third voyage, as reproduced in R.H. Major, ''Select Letters of Christopher Columbus'', 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 147])&lt;/ref&gt; However, bowing to the classical tripartite division of the world, Columbus discards that hypothesis and proposes instead that the South American landmass is not a "fourth" continent, but rather the [[terrestrial paradise]] of Biblical tradition, not a previously unknown "new" part of the world, but a land already "known" (but location undiscovered) by [[Christendom]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: pp. 266–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter (to the nurse of Prince John, written 1500), Columbus refers to having reached a "new heavens and world" ("nuevo cielo e mundo")&lt;ref&gt;Columbus 1500 letter to the nurse (in Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 154])&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had placed "another world" ("otro mundo") under the dominion of the Kings of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus's 1500 letter to the nurse(Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 170])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acceptance ===
The Vespucci passage above applied the "New World" label to merely the continental landmass of [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Ober ''Amerigo Vespucci'' New York: Harper (1907: pp. 239, 244)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, most of the continent of [[North America]] was not yet discovered, and Vespucci's comments did not eliminate the possibility that the islands of the [[Antilles]] discovered earlier by [[Christopher Columbus]] might still be the eastern edges of Asia, as Columbus continued to insist down to his dying day.&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Morison ''The European Discovery of America, v.2: The southern voyages, 1492–1616''.(1974: pp. 265–66).&lt;/ref&gt; A critical step in the transition was the conference of navigators (''Junta de Navegantes'') assembled by the Spanish monarchs at [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]] in 1505, and continued at [[Burgos]] in 1508, to digest all existing information about the Indies, come to an agreement on what had really been discovered, and set out the future goals of Spanish exploration. Amerigo Vespucci attended both conferences, and seems to have had an outsized influence on them – Vespucci ended up being appointed the first ''piloto mayor'', the chief of navigation of Spain, at Burgos.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of Vespucci at Toro and Burgos,  see Navarette ''Colección de los viages y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles desde fines del siglo XV''(1829: v.iii, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESYW_1DUELoC&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 320–23])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the proceedings of the Toro-Burgos conferences are missing, it is almost certain that Vespucci articulated his recent "New World" thesis to his fellow navigators there. It was during these conferences when Spanish officials seem to have finally accepted that the Antilles and the known stretch of Central America were definitely ''not'' the Indies they had originally sought, and Columbus had insisted they were, and set out the new goal for Spanish explorers: to find a sea passage or [[strait]] through the Americas which would permit them to sail to Asia proper.&lt;ref&gt;C.O. Sauer ''The Early Spanish Main''. Cambridge (1966: pp. 166–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In English usage the term "New World" was problematic and only accepted relatively late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=New World Discovery|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|date=2015|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935338-e-141|accessdate=2 June 2016|doi-broken-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartographic representation ===

[[File:Map Diego Ribero 1529.jpg|thumb|The World Map by [[Diogo Ribeiro]] (1529) labels the [[Americas]] as ''MUNDUS NOVUS''. It traces most of South America and the east coast of North America.]]
While it became generally accepted after Vespucci that Columbus's discoveries were not Asia but a "New World", the geographic relationship between the two continents was still unclear.&lt;ref name = parry&gt;J.H. Parry, ''The Discovery of the Sea'' (1974: p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt; That there must be a large ocean between Asia and the Americas was implied by the known existence of vast continuous sea along the coasts of [[East Asia]]. Given the size of the Earth as calculated by [[Eratosthenes]] this left a large space between Asia and the newly discovered lands.  

Even prior to Vespucci, several maps, e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 and the [[Canerio map]] of 1504, placed a large open ocean between China on the east side of the map, and the inchoate largely water-surrounded North American and South American discoveries on the western side of map. However, out of uncertainty, they depicted a finger of the Asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map, suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere (e.g. the Cantino Planisphere denotes [[Greenland]] as "Punta d'Asia" – "edge of Asia"). Some maps, e.g. the 1506 [[Contarini–Rosselli map]] and the 1508 [[Johannes Ruysch]] map, bowing to Ptolemaic authority and Columbus's assertions, have the northern Asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known North America (Labrador, Newfoundland, etc.). These maps place the island of Japan near Cuba and leave the South American continent – Vespucci's "New World" proper – detached and floating below by itself.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt; The [[Waldseemüller map]] of 1507, which accompanied the famous ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'' volume (which includes reprints of Vespucci's letters) comes closest to modernity by placing a completely open sea (with no stretching land fingers) between Asia on the eastern side and the New World (being represented two times in the same map in a different way: with and without a sea passage in the middle of what is now named Central America) on the western side – which (on what is now named South America) that same map famously labels simply "''[[Naming of America|America]]''". However, [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls ''Terra de Cuba Asie partis''), and quietly drops the "America" label from South America, calling it merely ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]''.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

The western coast of the New World – the [[Pacific Ocean]] – was only discovered in 1513 by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]. But it would take a few more years – [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of 1519–22 – to determine that the Pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating Asia from the Americas. It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the [[Bering Strait]]s in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 [[Johannes Schöner globe]]).&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

In 1524, the term was used by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], land that is now part of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Verrazzano, Giovanni da (1524).[http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm "The Written Record of the Voyage of 1524 of Giovanni da Verrazzano as recorded in a letter to Francis I, King of France, July 8th, 1524"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908085440/http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}.

'''''Nouvelles de l'estampe''''' (in French : "News about prints") is a [[scholarly journal]] on prints ([[etching]]s, [[engraving]]s, [[lithography]], etc.). It is published by the [[Comité national de la gravure française]] and its office is at the prints department of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], which sponsors the journal. The journal is abstracted and indexed in the [[Bibliography of the History of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/bha/journals.pdf List of Journals in BHA]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bibliographie de l’histoire de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhf.revues.org/index81.html Liste of Journals in the ''Bibliographie de l'histoire de France'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The journal was established in 1963 by [[Jean Adhémar]], then curator of the prints department of the National Library. At that time, it was not a journal but just a few sheets presenting news on prints. [[Michel Melot]], also a curator of the prints department, became editor in 1971 initiated the change to a scholarly journal, publishing studies on either old prints or contemporary creations. Part of the journal still presents news about exhibitions, new publications, etc.

'''Order-independent transparency''' (OIT) is a class of techniques in [[rasterization|rasterisational]] [[computer graphics]] for rendering [[Transparency (graphic)|transparency]] in a 3D scene, which do not require rendering geometry in sorted order for [[alpha compositing]].

==Description==
Commonly, 3D geometry with transparency is rendered by blending (using [[alpha compositing]]) all surfaces into a single buffer (think of this as a canvas). Each surface occludes existing color and adds some of its own color depending on its ''alpha'' value, a ratio of light ''transmittance''. The order in which surfaces are blended affects the total occlusion or ''visibility'' of each surface. For a correct result, surfaces must be blended from farthest to nearest or nearest to farthest, depending on the [[alpha compositing]] operation, ''over'' or ''under''.
Ordering may be achieved by rendering the geometry in sorted order, for example sorting triangles by depth, but can take a significant amount of time,
not always produce a solution (in the case of intersecting or circularly overlapping geometry) and the implementation is complex.
Instead, order-independent transparency sorts geometry per-pixel, after rasterisation. For exact results this requires storing all [[Fragment (computer graphics)|fragments]] before sorting and compositing.

==History==
The A-Buffer&lt;ref&gt;Loren Carpenter. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808585 "The A-buffer, an Antialiased Hidden Surface Method"], SIGGRAPH '84 Proceedings of the 11th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques
Pages 103-108, July, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; is a computer graphics technique introduced in 1984 which stores per-pixel lists of fragment data (including [[Micropolygon|micro-polygon]] information) in a software rasteriser, [[Reyes rendering|REYES]], originally designed for [[anti-aliasing filter|anti-aliasing]] but also supporting transparency.

More recently, [[depth peeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://developer.nvidia.com/content/interactive-order-independent-transparency | title=Interactive Order-Independent Transparency | date=2001-05-15 | publisher=[[Nvidia]] | first=Cass | last=Everitt | accessdate=2008-10-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927071951/http://developer.nvidia.com/content/interactive-order-independent-transparency | archivedate=2011-09-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001 described a hardware accelerated OIT technique. With limitations in graphics hardware the scene's geometry had to be rendered many times. A number of techniques have followed, to improve on the performance of depth peeling, still with the many-pass rendering limitation. For example, Dual Depth Peeling (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10/opengl/src/dual_depth_peeling/doc/DualDepthPeeling.pdf | title=Order Independent Transparency with Dual Depth Peeling | date=February 2008 | publisher=[[Nvidia]] | first=Louis | last=Bavoil | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two significant features were introduced in GPU hardware/drivers/Graphics APIs that allowed capturing and
storing fragment data in a single rendering pass of the scene, something not previously possible.
These are, the ability to write to arbitrary GPU memory from shaders and atomic operations. With these features a new class
of OIT techniques became possible that do not require many rendering passes of the scene's geometry.
* The first was storing the fragment data in a 3D array,&lt;ref&gt;Fang Liu, Meng-Cheng Huang, Xue-Hui Liu, and En-Hua Wu. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1598069 "Single pass depth peeling via CUDA rasterizer"], In SIGGRAPH 2009: Talks (SIGGRAPH '09), 2009&lt;/ref&gt; where fragments are stored along the ''z'' dimension for each pixel ''x/y''. In practice, most of the 3D array is unused or overflows, as a scene's [[Depth Complexit (computer graphics)|depth complexity]] is typically uneven. To avoid overflow the 3D array requires large amounts of memory, which in many cases is impractical.
* Two approaches to reducing this memory overhead exist.
*# Packing the 3D array with a prefix sum scan, or ''linearizing'',&lt;ref&gt;Craig Peeper. [http://www.google.com/patents/US20080316214 "Prefix sum pass to linearize A-buffer storage"], Patent application, Dec, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; removed the unused memory issue but requires an additional [[Depth Complexit (computer graphics)|depth complexity]] computation rendering pass of the geometry. The ''"Sparsity-aware"'' S-Buffer, Dynamic Fragment Buffer,&lt;ref&gt;Marilena Maule and João L.D. Comba and Rafael Torchelsen and Rui Bastos. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2420198 "Memory-optimized order-independent transparency with Dynamic Fragment Buffer "], In Computers &amp; Graphics, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''"deque"'' D-Buffer{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}, Linearized Layered Fragment Buffer&lt;ref name="lfb"&gt;Pyarelal Knowles, Geoff Leach and Fabio Zambetta. [http://openglinsights.com/ "Chapter 20: Efficient Layered Fragment Buffer Techniques"], OpenGL Insights, pages 279-292, Editors Cozzi and Riccio, CRC Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; all pack fragment data with a prefix sum scan and are demonstrated with OIT.
*# Storing fragments in per-pixel linked lists&lt;ref&gt;Jason C. Yang, Justin Hensley, Holger Grün, and Nicolas Thibieroz. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2383624 "Real-time concurrent linked list construction on the GPU"], In Proceedings of the 21st Eurographics conference on Rendering (EGSR'10), 2010&lt;/ref&gt; provides tight packing of this data and in late 2011, driver improvements reduced the atomic operation contention overhead making the technique very competitive.&lt;ref name="lfb" /&gt;

==Exact OIT==
Exact, as opposed to [[#Approximate OIT|approximate]], OIT accurately computes the final color, for which all fragments must be sorted. For high depth complexity scenes, sorting becomes the bottleneck.

One issue with the sorting stage is local memory limited ''occupancy'', in this case a [[Single Instruction Multiple Threads|SIMT]] attribute relating to the throughput and operation latency hiding of GPUs. ''Backwards memory allocation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~pknowles/bma-preprint.pdf | title=Backwards Memory Allocation and Improved OIT | date=Oct 2013 | publisher=[[Eurographics Digital Library]] | last=Knowles Et. Al. | accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BMA) groups pixels by their depth complexity and sorts them in batches to improve the occupancy and hence performance of low depth complexity pixels in the context of a potentially high depth complexity scene. Up to a 3× overall OIT performance increase is reported.

Sorting is typically performed in a local array, however performance can be improved further by making use of the GPU's memory hierarchy and sorting in registers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~pknowles/rbs-preprint.pdf | title=Fast Sorting for Exact OIT of Complex Scenes | date=June 2014 | publisher=[[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]] | last=Knowles Et. Al. | accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly to an [[External sorting#External merge sort|external merge sort]], especially in conjunction with BMA.

==Approximate OIT==
Approximate OIT techniques relax the constraint of exact rendering to provide faster results.
Higher performance can be gained from not having to store all fragments or only partially sorting the geometry.
A number of techniques also compress, or ''reduce'', the fragment data.
These include:
* Stochastic Transparency: draw in a higher resolution in full opacity but discard some fragments. Downsampling will then yield transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~d00sint/StochasticTransparency_I3D2010.pdf | title=Stochastic Transparency | date=n.d. | publisher=[[Nvidia]] | first=Eric | last=Enderton | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adaptive Transparency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/adaptive-transparency-hpg-2011 | title=Adaptive Transparency | date=2013-07-18 | last=Salvi Et.

The effect of POPs on human and environmental health was discussed, with intention to eliminate or severely restrict their production, by the international community at the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] in 2001.

Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as [[pesticide]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, and industrial chemicals.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Although some POPs arise naturally, for example volcanoes and various biosynthetic pathways, most are man-made&lt;ref name="El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010"&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{doi|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}.&lt;/ref&gt; via [[total synthesis]].

==Consequences of persistence==
POPs typically are halogenated organic compounds (see lists below) and as such exhibit high [[Lipophilicity|lipid solubility]].  For this reason, they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in [[Adipose tissue|fatty tissues]]. [[Halogenated]] compounds also exhibit great [[Chemical stability|stability]] reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward [[hydrolysis]] and [[Photodissociation|photolytic degradation]].  The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern.  They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances|PBTs]] ('''P'''ersistent, '''B'''ioaccumulative and '''T'''oxic) or TOMPs ('''T'''oxic '''O'''rganic '''M'''icro '''P'''ollutants).

=== Long-range transport ===
POPs enter the [[gas]] phase under certain environmental temperatures and [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatize]] from [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], and [[bodies of water]] into the [[atmosphere]], resisting breakdown reactions in the air, to travel long distances before being re-deposited.&lt;ref name="Kelly, B.C. 2007"&gt;Kelly, B.C., Ikonomou, M.G., Blair, J.D., Morin, A.E., Gobas, F.A.P.C. (2007). Food Web-Specific Biomagnification of Persistent Organic Pollutants. ''Science''. 317, 236–239. {{doi|10.1126/science.1138275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in accumulation of POPs in areas far from where they were used or emitted, specifically environments where POPs have never been introduced such as [[Antarctica]], and the [[Arctic circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, A., Mackay, D., Matthies, M., Wania, F., Webster, E. (2000). Assessing Long-Range Transport Potential of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Environmental Sciences &amp; Technology. 34(4), 699–703. {{doi|10.1021/es990207w}}.&lt;/ref&gt; POPs can be present as vapors in the atmosphere or bound to the surface of solid particles. POPs have low solubility in water but are easily captured by solid particles, and are soluble in organic fluids ([[oil]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[liquid fuel]]s). POPs are not easily degraded in the environment due to their stability and low [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] rates. Due to this capacity for long-range transport, POP environmental contamination is extensive, even in areas where POPs have never been used, and will remain in these environments years after restrictions implemented due to their resistance to degradation.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"&gt;Wania, F., [[Donald Mackay (scientist)|Mackay, D.]] (1996). Tracking the Distribution of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Environmental Science &amp; Technology. 30 (9), 390A–396A. {{doi|10.1021/es962399q}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Astoviza|first=Malena J.|title=Evaluación de la distribución de contaminantes orgánicos persistentes (COPs) en aire en la zona de la cuenca del Plata mediante muestreadores pasivos artificiales|date=15 April 2014|pages=160|language=Spanish|url=http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/34729|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioaccumulation ===
[[Bioaccumulation]] of POPs is typically associated with the compounds high lipid solubility and ability to accumulate in the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] of living organisms for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F. (1998). Controlling persistent organic pollutants – what next? Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 6, 143–175. {{doi|10.1016/S1382-6689(98)00036-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent chemicals tend to have higher concentrations and are eliminated more slowly. Dietary accumulation or [[bioaccumulation]] is another hallmark characteristic of POPs, as POPs move up the food chain, they increase in concentration as they are processed and metabolized in certain tissues of organisms. The natural capacity for animals [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] concentrate ingested chemicals, along with poorly [[Metabolism|metabolized]] and [[hydrophobic]] nature of POPs makes such compounds highly susceptible to [[bioaccumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu, G.W.,, Laseter, J., Mylander, C.

J Environ Public Health. 2011;2011:417980. {{doi|10.1155/2011/417980}}. {{PMID|21647350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus POPs not only persist in the environment, but also as they are taken in by animals they bioaccumulate, increasing their concentration and toxicity in the environment.&lt;ref name="Kelly, B.C. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lohmanna, R., Breivikb, K., Dachsd, J., Muire, D. (2007). Global fate of POPs: Current and future research directions. 150, 150–165. {{doi|10.1016/j.envpol.2007.06.051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants ==
[[File:Map of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.svg|thumb|275px|State parties to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]
{{Main|Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants}}

The Stockholm Convention was adopted and put into practice by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) on May 22, 2001. The UNEP decided that POP regulation needed to be addressed globally for the future. The purpose statement of the agreement is "to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants." As of 2014, there are 179 countries in compliance with the Stockholm convention. The convention and its participants have recognized the potential human and environmental toxicity of POPs. They recognize that POPs have the potential for long range transport and bioaccumulation and biomagnification. The convention seeks to study and then judge whether or not a number of chemicals that have been developed with advances in technology and science can be categorized as POPs or not. The initial meeting in 2001 made a preliminary list, termed the "dirty dozen," of chemicals that are classified as POPs. As of 2014, the [[United States of America]] has signed the Stockholm Convention but has not ratified it. There are a handful of other countries that have not ratified the convention but most countries in the world have ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;"STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS". pp. 1–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compounds on the Stockholm Convention list ===

In May 1995, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Governing Council investigated POPs.&lt;ref name="thedirtydozen"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dirty Dozen|url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/29239_popspresentation.swf|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Convention recognized only twelve POPs for their adverse effects on human health and the environment, placing a global ban on these particularly harmful and toxic compounds and requiring its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs in the environment.
&lt;ref name="El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF| title=STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS| pages=1–43| accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chm.pops.int/&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Aldrin]]''', an insecticide used in soils to kill [[termite]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[Western corn rootworm]], and others, is also known to kill birds, fish, and humans. Humans are primarily exposed to aldrin through dairy products and animal meats.
#'''[[Chlordane]]''', an insecticide used to control termites and on a range of agricultural crops, is known to be lethal in various species of birds, including mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp; it is a chemical that remains in the soil with a reported [[half-life]] of one year. Chlordane has been postulated to affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human [[carcinogen]]. Chlordane air pollution is believed the primary route of humane exposure.
#'''[[Dieldrin]]''', a pesticide used to control termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to dieldrin. Dieldrin’s half-life is approximately five years. [[Dieldrin]] is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. Dieldrin has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]], [[breast cancer]], and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to dieldrin primarily derives from food.
#'''[[Endrin]]''', an insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize endrin, so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. Endrin is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.
#'''[[Heptachlor]]''', a [[pesticide]] primarily used to kill soil insects and termites, along with cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Heptachlor, even at every low doses has been associated with the decline of several wild bird populations – [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[American kestrel]]s. In laboratory tests have shown high-dose heptachlor as lethal, with adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success at low-doses, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Human exposure primarily results from food.
#'''[[Hexachlorobenzene]] (HCB'''), was first introduced in 1945–59 to treat seeds because it can kill [[Fungicide|fungi]] on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, [[colic]], debilitation, and a [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic disorder]] called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.
#'''[[Mirex]]''', an insecticide used against ants and termites or as a [[flame retardant]] in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods. Mirex is one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half-life of up to 10 years.  Mirex is toxic to several plant, fish and [[crustacean]] species, with suggested carcinogenic capacity in humans. Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.
#'''[[Toxaphene]]''', an insecticide used on cotton, cereal, grain, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, as well as for tick and mite control in livestock. Widespread toxaphene use in the US and chemical persistence, with a half-life of up to 12 years in soil, results in residual toxaphene in the environment. Toxaphene is highly toxic to fish, inducing dramatic weight loss and reduced egg viability. Human exposure primarily results from food. While human toxicity to direct toxaphene exposure is low, the compound is classified as a possible human carcinogen.
#'''[[Polychlorinated biphenyls]]''' (PCBs), used as [[Heat-transfer oil|heat exchange fluids]], in [[transformer|electrical transformers]], and [[capacitor]]s, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics. Persistence varies with degree of [[halogenation]], an estimated half-life of 10 years. PCBs are toxic to fish at high doses, and associated with spawning failure at low doses. Human exposure occurs through food, and is associated with reproductive failure and immune suppression. Immediate effects of PCB exposure include pigmentation of nails and [[mucous membranes]] and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Effects are [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational]], as the chemical can persist in a mother’s body for up to 7 years, resulting in developmental delays and behavioral problems in her children. Food contamination has led to large scale PCB exposure.
#[[DDT|'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''']] (DDT) is probably the most infamous POP. It was widely used as insecticide during WWII to protect against malaria and typhus. After the war, DDT was used as an agricultural insecticide. In 1962, the American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] published [[Silent Spring]], describing the impact of DDT spraying on the US environment and human health. DDT’s persistence in the soil for up to 10–15 years after application has resulted in widespread and persistent DDT residues throughout the world including the arctic, even though it has been banned or severely restricted in most of the world. DDT is toxic to many organisms including birds where it is detrimental to reproduction due to eggshell thinning. DDT can be detected in foods from all over the world and food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of human exposure. Short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, however long-term exposure has been associated with chronic health effects including increased risk of cancer and diabetes, reduced reproductive success, and neurological disease.
#'''[[Dioxins]]''' are unintentional by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete combustion and pesticide production. Dioxins are typically emitted from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and [[hazardous waste]], along with automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. Dioxins have been associated with several adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders, [[chloracne]], and are classified as a possible human carcinogen. In laboratory studies of dioxin effects an increase in birth defects and stillbirths, and lethal exposure have been associated with the substances. Food, particularly from animals, is the principal source of human exposure to dioxins.
#'''[[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]]''' are by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete [[combustion]] after [[Incineration|waste incineration]] or in automobiles, pesticide production, and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] production. Structurally similar to dioxins, the two compounds share toxic effects. Furans persist in the environment and classified as possible human carcinogens. Human exposure to furans primarily results from food, particularly animal products.

=== New POPs on the Stockholm Convention list ===
Since 2001, this list has been expanded to include some [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and other compounds. Additions to the initial 2001 Stockholm Convention list are as following POPs:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Depositary notification | url = http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP-NOTIF-DN-CN524-2009.English.pdf | publisher = Secretary-General of the United Nations | date = 26 August 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chlordecone]], a synthetic chlorinated organic compound,is primarily used as an agricultural pesticide, related to DDT and Mirex. Chlordecone is toxic to aquatic organisms, and classified as a possible human carcinogen. Many countries have banned chlordecone sale and use, or intend to phase out stockpiles and wastes.
*[[alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane|α-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (α-HCH) and [[beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane|β-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (β-HCH) are insecticides as well as by-products in the production of [[lindane]].  Large stockpiles of HCH isomers exist in the environment. α-HCH and β-HCH are highly persistent in the water of colder regions. α-HCH and β-HCH has been linked [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Hexabromodiphenyl ether]] (hexaBDE) and [[heptabromodiphenyl ether]] (heptaBDE) are main components of commercial [[octabromodiphenyl ether]] (octaBDE). Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination and the production of [[Bromodiphenylmethane|bromodiphenyl ethers]], which can increase toxicity.
*[[Lindane]] (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane), a pesticide used as a broad spectrum insecticide for seed, soil, leaf, tree and wood treatment, and against [[ectoparasite]]s in animals and humans (head lice and scabies). Lindane rapidly [[Bioconcentration|bioconcentrates]]. It is [[Immunotoxin|immunotoxic]], [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]], [[carcinogenic]], linked to liver and kidney damage as well as adverse reproductive and developmental effects in laboratory animals and aquatic organisms. Production of lindane unintentionally produces two other POPs α-HCH and β-HCH.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Pentachlorobenzene]] (PeCB), is a pesticide and unintentional byproduct. PeCB has also been used in PCB products, dyestuff carriers, as a fungicide, a flame retardant, and a chemical intermediate. PeCB is moderately toxic to humane, while highly toxic to aquatic organisms.
*[[Tetrabromodiphenyl ether]] (tetraBDE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) are industrial chemicals and the main components of commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). PentaBDE has been detected in humans in all regions of the world.
*[[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and its salts are used in the production of fluoropolymers. PFOS and related compounds are extremely persistent, bioaccumulating and [[Biomagnification|biomagnifying]].  The negative effects of trace levels of PFOS have not been established.
*[[Endosulfan]]s are insecticides to control pests on crops such coffee, cotton, rice and sorghum and soybeans, tsetse flies, ectoparasites of cattle. They are used as a [[Wood preservation|wood preservative]]. Global use and manufacturing of endosulfan has been banned under the Stockholm convention in 2011, although many countries had previously banned or introduced phase-outs of the chemical when the ban was announced. Toxic to humans and aquatic and terrestrial organisms, linked to congenital physical disorders, mental retardation, and death. Endosulfans' negative health effects are primarily liked to its endocrine disrupting capacity acting as an [[antiandrogen]].
*[[Hexabromocyclododecane]] (HBCD) is a [[brominated flame retardant]] primarily used in [[thermal insulation]] in the building industry. HBCD is persistent, toxic and [[Ecotoxicity|ecotoxic]], with [[bioaccumulative]] and long-range transport properties.

== Additive and synergistic effects ==
Evaluation of the effects of POPs on health is very challenging in the laboratory setting. For example, for organisms exposed to a mixture of POPs, the effects are assumed to be [[interaction|additive]].&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"&gt;ed. Harrad, S., "Persistent Organic Pollutants" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Mixtures of POPs can in principle produce [[interaction|synergistic effects]]. With synergistic effects, the toxicity of each compound is enhanced (or depressed) by the presence of other compounds in the mixture. When put together, the effects can far exceed the approximated additive effects of the POP compound mixture.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"/&gt;

== Health effects ==
POP exposure may cause developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], possibly including [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Many POPs are capable of [[endocrine disruption]] within the [[reproductive system]], the [[central nervous system]], or the [[immune system]]. People and animals are exposed to POPs mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt;  For humans not exposed to POPs through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"/&gt;

Studies have investigated the correlation between low level exposure of POPs and various diseases. In order to assess disease risk due to POPs in a particular location, government agencies may produce a [[human health risk assessment]] which takes into account the pollutants' [[bioavailability]] and their [[dose-response relationship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |pages= 579|editor= A. Schecter|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date= March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary |isbn= 9781118184141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endocrine disruption ===
The majority of POPs are known to disrupt normal functioning of the endocrine system. Low level exposure to POPs during critical [[developmental biology|developmental]] periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout its lifespan. A 2002 study&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465.&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure to POPs during critical developmental stages in an organism’s lifespan. The study aimed to answer the question whether or not chronic, low level exposure to POPs can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are [[in utero]], [[in ovo]], and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during [[prenatal development|fetal development]].&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproductive system ===
The same study in 2002&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"/&gt; with evidence of a link from POPs to [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]] also linked low dose exposure of POPs to [[reproductive health]] effects. The study stated that POP exposure can lead to negative health effects especially in the [[human male reproductive system|male reproductive system]], such as decreased [[sperm]] quality and quantity, altered sex ratio and early [[puberty]] onset. For females exposed to POPs, altered [[human female reproductive system|reproductive tissues]] and [[pregnancy]] outcomes as well as [[endometriosis]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gestational weight gain and newborn head circumference====
A Greek study from 2014 investigated the link between maternal weight gain during pregnancy, their [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-exposure level and PCB level in their newborn infants, their [[birth weight]], [[gestational age]], and head circumference. The lower the birth weight and head circumference of the infants was, the higher POP levels during [[prenatal development]] had been, but only if mothers had either excessive or inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. No correlation between POP exposure and gestational age was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vafeiadi|first=M|author2=Vrijheid M |author3=Fthenou E |author4=Chalkiadaki G |author5=Rantakokko P |author6=Kiviranta H |author7=Kyrtopoulos SA |author8=Chatzi L |author9=Kogevinas M  |title=Persistent organic pollutants exposure during pregnancy, maternal gestational weight gain, and birth outcomes in the mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (RHEA study)|journal=Environ Int.|year=2014|volume=64|pages=116–123|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2013.12.015|pmid=24389008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 [[case-control study]] conducted 2009 in Indian mothers and their offspring showed prenatal exposure of two types of [[organochlorine pesticides]] ([[Hexachlorocyclohexane|HCH]], [[DDT]] and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]]) impaired the growth of the [[fetus]], reduced the birth weight, length, head circumference and chest circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewan|first=Jain V,|author2=Gupta P |author3=Banerjee BD. |title=Organochlorine pesticide residues in maternal blood, cord blood, placenta, and breastmilk and their relation to birth size|journal=Chemosphere|date=February 2013|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1704–1710|doi= 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.09.083|pmid=23141556|bibcode=2013Chmsp..90.1704D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465. {{PMID|12216998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In urban areas and indoor environments ==
Traditionally it was thought that human exposure to POPs occurred primarily through [[food]], however [[Indoor air quality|indoor pollution]] patterns that characterize certain POPs have challenged this notion. Recent studies of indoor [[dust]] and [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] have implicated indoor environments as a major sources for human exposure via inhalation and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, significant indoor POP pollution must be a major route of human POP exposure, considering the modern trend in spending larger proportions of life indoor. Several studies have shown that indoor (air and dust) POP levels to exceed outdoor (air and soil) POP concentrations.&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"/&gt;

== Control and removal in the environment ==
Current studies aimed at minimizing POPs in the environment are investigating their behavior in [[photocatalysis|photo catalytic oxidation reactions]].  POPs that are found in humans and in [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] the most are the main subjects of these experiments. [[aromatic compound|Aromatic]] and [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] degradation products have been identified in these reactions. [[photocatalysis|Photochemical degradation]] is negligible compared to photocatalytic degradation.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010).

Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{DOI|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of removal of POPs from marine environments that has been explored is adsorption. It occurs when an absorbable solute comes into contact with a solid with a porous surface structure. This technique was investigated by Mohamed Nageeb Rashed of Aswan University, Egypt. &lt;ref&gt;Rashed, M.N. ''Organic pollutants - Monitoring, risk and treatment''. Intech. London (2013). Chapter 7 - Adsorption techniques for the removal of presistent organic pollutants from water and wastewater. &lt;/ref&gt; Current efforts are more focused on banning the use and production of POPs worldwide rather than removal of POPs.&lt;ref&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15626">'''Population viability analysis''' ('''PVA''') is a [[species]]-specific method of [[risk assessment]] frequently used in [[conservation biology]].
It is traditionally defined as the process that determines the probability that a population will go extinct within a given number of years.
More recently, PVA has been described as a marriage of [[ecology]] and [[statistics]] that brings together species characteristics and environmental variability to forecast population health and extinction risk.  Each PVA is individually developed for a target population or species, and consequently, each PVA is unique. The larger goal in mind when conducting a PVA is to ensure that the population of a species is self-sustaining over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, E.W. (2006) How many animals do we want to save? The many ways of setting population target levels for conservation. ''BioScience'' 56: 911-922, (p. 913).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Population viability analysis (PVA) is used to estimate the likelihood of a population’s extinction and indicate the urgency of recovery efforts, and identify key life stages or processes that should be the focus of recovery efforts.  PVA is also used to compare proposed management options and assess existing recovery efforts.  PVA is frequently used in [[endangered species]] management to develop a plan of action, rank the pros and cons of different management scenarios, and assess the potential impacts of habitat loss.&lt;ref name="Beissenger and McCullough"&gt;{{cite book|title=Population Viability Analysis|editor1=Beissenger S.R. |editor2=McCullough D.R. |year=2002|isbn=0-226-04178-6|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
In the 1970s, [[Yellowstone National Park]] was the centre of a heated debate over different proposals to manage the park’s problem [[grizzly bears]] (''Ursus arctos'').  In 1978, Mark Shaffer proposed a model for the grizzlies that incorporated random variability, and calculated extinction probabilities and [[minimum viable population]] size.  The first PVA is credited to Shaffer.

PVA gained popularity in the United States as federal agencies and ecologists required methods to evaluate the risk of extinction and possible outcomes of management decisions, particularly in accordance with the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973, and the [[National Forest Management Act]] of 1976.

In 1986, Gilpin and Soulé broadened the PVA definition to include the interactive forces that affect the viability of a population, including genetics.
The use of PVA increased dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s following advances in personal computers and software packages.

==Examples==
A PVA for the endangered [[Fender's blue butterfly]] (''Icaricia icarioides'') was recently performed with a goal of providing additional information to the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], which was developing a recovery plan for the species.  The PVA concluded that the species was more at risk of extinction than previously thought and identified key sites where recovery efforts should be focused.  The PVA also indicated that because the butterfly populations fluctuate widely from year to year, to prevent the populations from going extinct the minimum annual population growth rate must be kept much higher than at levels typically considered acceptable for other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Cheryl B.|author2=Hammond, Paul C.|title=Using Population Viability Analysis to Develop Recovery Criteria for Endangered Insects: Case Study of the Fender's Blue Butterfly|journal=Conservation Biology|date=October 2003|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1372–1385|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.02141.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a recent outbreak of canine distemper virus, a PVA was performed for the critically endangered [[island fox]] (''Urocyon littoralis'') of [[Santa Catalina Island, California]].  The Santa Catalina island fox population is uniquely composed of two subpopulations that are separated by an [[isthmus]], with the eastern subpopulation at greater risk of extinction than the western subpopulation.  PVA was conducted with the goals of 1) evaluating the island fox’s extinction risk, 2) estimating the island fox’s sensitivity to catastrophic events, and 3) evaluating recent recovery efforts which include release of captive-bred foxes and transport of wild juvenile foxes from the west to the east side.  Results of the PVA concluded that the island fox is still at significant risk of extinction, and is highly susceptible to catastrophes that occur more than once every 20 years.  Furthermore, extinction risks and future population sizes on both sides of the island were significantly dependent on the number of foxes released and transported each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlmann|first=Stephan G.|author2=Schmidt, Gregory A. |author3=Garcelon, David K. |title=A population viability analysis for the Island Fox on Santa Catalina Island, California|journal=Ecological Modelling|date=April 2005|volume=183|issue=1|pages=77–94|doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVAs in combination with [[sensitivity analysis]] can also be used to identify which vital rates has the relative greatest effect on population growth and other measures of population viability. For example, a study by Manlik ''et al.'' (2016) forecast the viability of two [[bottlenose dolphin]] populations in Western Australia and identified reproduction as having the greatest influence on the forecast of these populations. One of the two populations was forecast to be stable, whereas the other population was forecast to decline, if it isolated from other populations and low reproductive rates persist. The difference in viability between the two studies was primarily due to differences in reproduction and not survival. The study also showed that temporal variation in reproduction had a greater effect on population growth than temporal variation in survival.&lt;ref name="Manlik et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Manlik O. |author2=McDonald J.A. |author3=Mann J. |author4=Raudino H.C. |author5=Bejder L. |author6=Kruetzen M. |author7=Connor R.C. |author8=Heithaus M.R. |author9=Lacy R.C. |author10=Sherwin W.B. | title=The relative importance of reproduction and survival for the conservation of two dolphin populations| journal=Ecology and Evolution | year=2016 | URL=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2130/full| doi=10.1002/ece3.2130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Debates exist and remain unresolved over the appropriate uses of PVA in conservation biology and PVA’s ability to accurately assess extinction risks.

A large quantity of field data is desirable for PVA; some conservatively estimate that for a precise extinction probability assessment extending ''T'' years into the future, five-to-ten times ''T'' years of data are needed.  Datasets of such magnitude are typically unavailable for rare species; it has been estimated that suitable data for PVA is available for only 2% of threatened bird species.  PVA for threatened and endangered species is particularly a problem as the predictive power of PVA plummets dramatically with minimal datasets.  Ellner et al. (2002) argued that PVA has little value in such circumstances and is best replaced by other methods.  Others argue that PVA remains the best tool available for estimations of extinction risk, especially with the use of sensitivity model runs.

Even with an adequate dataset, it is possible that a PVA can still have large errors in extinction rate predictions.  It is impossible to incorporate all future possibilities into a PVA: habitats may change, catastrophes may occur, new diseases may be introduced.  PVA utility can be enhanced by multiple model runs with varying sets of assumptions including the forecast future date.  Some prefer to use PVA always in a relative analysis of benefits of alternative management schemes, such as comparing proposed resource management plans.

Accuracy of PVAs has been tested in a few retrospective studies. For example, a study comparing PVA model forecasts with the actual fate of 21 well-studied taxa, showed that growth rate projections are accurate, if input variables are based on sound data, but highlighted the importance of understanding density-dependence (Brook ''et al.'' 2000).&lt;ref name="Brook et al. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brook B.W. |author2=O'Grady J.J. |author3=Chapman A.P. |author4=Burgman H.R. |author5=Akçakaya H.R. |author6=Frankham R. | title=Predictive accuracy of population viability analysis in conservation biology| journal=Nature | year=2000 |volume=329| pages=512–519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, McCarthey ''et al.'' (2003)&lt;ref name="McCarthy et al. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCarthy M.A. |author2=Andelman S.J. |author3=Possingham H.P. | title=Reliability of relative predictions in population viability analysis| journal=Conservation Biology | year=2003 | volume=17|pages=982–989 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that PVA predictions are relatively accurate, when they are based on long-term data. Still, the usefulness of PVA lies more in its capacity to identify and assess potential threats, than in making long-term, categorical predictions (Akçakaya &amp; Sjögren-Gulve 2000).&lt;ref name="Akçakaya &amp; Sjögren-Gulve 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Akçakaya H.R. |author2=Sjörgren-Gulve P. | title=Population viability analysis in conservation planning: an overview| journal=Ecological Bulletins | year=2000 |volume=48|pages=9–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
Improvements to PVA likely to occur in the near future include: 1) creating a fixed definition of PVA and scientific standards of quality by which all PVA are judged and 2) incorporating recent genetic advances into PVA.

'''Rainforests''' are [[forest]]s characterized by high [[rain]]fall, with annual rainfall in the case of [[tropical rainforest]]s between {{convert|250|and|450|cm|in}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/troprain.htm ''The Tropical Rain Forest.''] Marietta College. Marietta, Ohio. Retrieved 14 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; and definitions varying by region for [[temperate rainforest]]s. The [[monsoon trough]], alternatively known as the [[intertropical convergence zone]], plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the [[Earth]]'s tropical rainforests.

The [[undergrowth]] in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of [[sunlight]] to ground level. If the [[leaf]] [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] is destroyed or thinned, the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense, tangled growth of [[vine]]s, [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s, called a [[jungle]]. The term ''jungle'' is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally.

Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to [[#Deforestation|deforestation]], the resulting [[habitat loss]] and [[air pollution|pollution of the atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0908.htm |title=Impact of Deforestation – Extinction |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|left|General distribution of [[temperate rainforest]]s]]

Tropical forests cover a large part of the globe, but '''temperate rainforests''' only occur in few regions around the world. Temperate rainforests are rainforests in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions. They occur in [[North America]] (in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in [[Alaska]], [[British Columbia]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]]), in [[Europe]] (parts of the [[British Isles]] such as the coastal areas of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], [[southern Norway]], parts of the western [[Balkans]] along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, as well as in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and coastal areas of the eastern [[Black Sea]], including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and coastal [[Turkey]]), in [[East Asia]] (in [[Northern and southern China|southern China]], Highlands of [[Taiwan]], much of [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], and on [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] and the adjacent [[Temperate rainforests of the Russian Far East|Russian Far East]] coast), in [[South America]] (southern [[Chile]]) and also in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/temprain.htm|title= The Temperate Rainforest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layers==
{{main|Stratification (vegetation)}}
A tropical rainforest typically has a number of layers, each with different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area. Examples include the emergent, [[canopy (biology)|canopy]], [[understory]] and [[forest floor]] layers.

===Emergent layer===
The '''emergent layer''' contains a small number of very large [[tree]]s called '''emergents''', which grow above the general [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]], reaching heights of 45–55 m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80 m tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bourgeron |first= Patrick S.|editor= Frank B. Golley |title=Tropical Rain Forest Ecosystems. Structure and Function |year= 1983 |edition= 14A|series= Ecosystems of the World |publisher= Elsevier Scientific |isbn= 0-444-41986-1 |pages= 29–47 |chapter= Spatial Aspects of Vegetation Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nativetreesociety.org/worldtrees/sea_ei/malaysia/sabah2005.htm | title = Sabah | publisher = [[Eastern Native Tree Society]] | accessdate= 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. [[Eagle]]s, [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[bat]]s and certain [[monkey]]s inhabit this layer.
[[File:FRIM canopy.JPG|thumb|The canopy at the [[Forest Research Institute Malaysia]] showing [[crown shyness]]]]

===Canopy layer===
{{Main|Canopy (biology)}}
The '''canopy''' layer contains the majority of the largest trees, typically {{convert|30|m}} to {{convert|45|m}} tall. The densest areas of [[biodiversity]] are found in the forest canopy, a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops. The canopy, by some estimates, is home to 50 percent of all plant species. [[Epiphyte|Epiphytic plants]] attach to [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and [[branch]]es, and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. A quarter of all insect species are believed to exist in the rainforest canopy. Scientists have long suspected the richness of the canopy as a habitat, but have only recently developed practical methods of exploring it. As long ago as 1917, [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[William Beebe]] declared that "another continent of life remains to be discovered, not upon the Earth, but one to two hundred feet above it, extending over thousands of square miles." True exploration of this habitat only began in the 1980s, when scientists developed methods to reach the canopy, such as firing ropes into the trees using [[crossbow]]s. [[Canopy research|Exploration of the canopy]] is still in its infancy, but other methods include the use of [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and [[airship]]s to float above the highest branches and the building of cranes and walkways planted on the forest floor. The science of accessing tropical forest canopy using airships or similar aerial platforms is called [[dendronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dendronautics.org/ Dendronautics – Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614070953/http://www.dendronautics.org/ |date=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understory layer===
{{Main|Understory}}
The '''understory''' or '''understorey''' layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. It is home to a number of [[bird]]s, [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s, as well as [[predation|predators]] such as [[jaguar]]s, [[boa (genus)|boa constrictors]] and [[leopard]]s. The leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is abundant. Many [[seedling]]s that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory. Only about 5% of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory. This layer can be called a ''[[shrub layer]]'', although the shrub layer may also be considered a separate layer.

===Forest floor===
{{main article|Forest floor}}

[[File:Forest in the bluemountains.jpg|thumb|Rainforest in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], [[Australia]]]]
The '''forest floor''', the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants [[Adaptation|adapted]] to low light can grow in this region. Away from [[river]]banks, [[swamp]]s and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. It also contains [[decomposition|decaying]] plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of [[Fungus|fungi]] growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Chameleon - Tanzania - Usambara Mountains.jpg|thumb|right|upright|West Usambara Two-Horned Chameleon (''[[Bradypodion fischeri]]'') in the [[Usambara Mountains]], [[Tanzania]].]]
More than half of the world's species of plants and animals are found in the rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm |title=Rainforest Facts |publisher=Rain-tree.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainforests support a very broad array of [[fauna]], including [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.  Mammals may include [[primate]]s, [[felidae|felids]] and other families.  Reptiles include [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[chameleon]]s and other families; while birds include such families as [[vanga|vangidae]] and [[cuckoo|Cuculidae]]. Dozens of families of invertebrates are found in rainforests. [[Fungus|Fungi]] are also very common in rainforest areas as they can feed on the decomposing remains of plants and animals. 

==Soils==
{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}
Despite the growth of [[vegetation]] in a tropical rainforest, [[soil quality]] is often quite poor. Rapid [[bacteria]]l decay prevents the accumulation of [[humus]]. The concentration of [[iron]] and [[aluminium]] [[oxide]]s by the [[Laterite|laterization]] process gives the [[oxisol]]s a bright red colour and sometimes produces [[mineral]] [[deposition (geology)|deposits]] such as [[bauxite]]. Most trees have roots near the surface, because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface; most of the trees' minerals come from the top layer of decomposing leaves and animals. On younger substrates, especially of [[Volcano|volcanic]] origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile. If rainforest trees are cleared, rain can accumulate on the exposed soil surfaces, creating run-off and beginning a process of soil [[erosion]]. Eventually streams and rivers form and flooding becomes possible.

==Effect on global climate==
A natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast quantities of [[carbon dioxide]]. On a global scale, long-term fluxes are approximately in balance, so that an undisturbed rainforest would have a small net impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg1/pdf/TAR-03.PDF |title=Grida.no |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they may have other climatic effects (on [[cloud]] formation, for example, by recycling [[water vapour]]). No rainforest today can be considered to be undisturbed.&lt;ref name = Lewis&gt;Lewis, S.L., Phillips, O.L., Baker, T.R., Lloyd, J. et al. 2004 “Concerted changes in tropical forest structure and dynamics: evidence from 50 South American long-term plots”  Phil.

Lond. 359&lt;/ref&gt;  Human-induced [[deforestation]] plays a significant role in causing rainforests to release carbon dioxide,&lt;ref name = Malhi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malhi|first1=Yadvinder|authorlink1=Yadvinder Malhi|last2=Grace|first2=John|title=Tropical forests and atmospheric carbon dioxide|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=15|issue=8|year=2000|pages=332–337|issn=0169-5347|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trgac&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tropical Forests and Global Atmospheric Change|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor-last1=Malhi|editor-first1= Yadvinder|editor-link1=Yadvinder Malhi|editor-last2= Phillips|editor-first2=Oliver|isbn=9780198567066|location=Oxford, New York|oclc=77178196|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198567066.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as do other factors, whether human-induced or natural, which result in tree death, such as burning and drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/06/1078464675256.html?from=storyrhs | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Drought may turn forests into carbon producers | date=2004-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some climate models operating with interactive vegetation predict a large loss of Amazonian rainforest around 2050 due to drought, forest dieback and the subsequent release of more carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cox |first1=P.

==Human uses==
[[File:Campo12Foto 2.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Amazon rainforest]], taken from a plane.]]
{{further|Tropical rainforest#Human dimensions}}
Tropical rainforests provide [[timber]] as well as animal products such as meat and hides. Rainforests also have value as [[tourism]] destinations and for the [[ecosystem services]] provided. Many foods originally came from tropical forests, and are still mostly grown on [[plantation]]s in regions that were formerly primary forest.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. (1985). ''The primary source''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], New York, pp. 189–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, plant-derived medicines are commonly used for fever, fungal infections, burns, gastrointestinal problems, pain, respiratory problems, and wound treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/fieldcourses03/PapersCostaRicaArticles/FinalPaper.TheMedicinalVa.html |title=Final Paper: The Medicinal Value of the Rainforest May 15, 2003. Amanda Haidet May 2003 |publisher=Jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, rainforests are usually not used [[sustainably]] by non-native peoples but are being [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited]] or removed for [[agricultural expansion|agricultural purposes]].

===Native peoples===
{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}
On January 18, 2007, [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribes]] in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, [[Brazil]] has now overtaken the island of [[New Guinea]] as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN17285256 |title=Brazil sees traces of more isolated Amazon tribes |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province of Irian Jaya or [[West Papua (Indonesian province)|West Papua]] in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survival-international.org/news.php?id=2191 BBC: First contact with isolated tribes?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206061137/http://survival-international.org/news.php?id=2191 |date=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribes are in danger because of the deforestation, especially in Brazil.

Central African rainforest is home of the [[Mbuti]] [[pygmies]], one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below one and a half metres, or 59&amp;nbsp;inches, on average). They were the subject of a study by [[Colin Turnbull]], ''The Forest People'', in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/26252/explore/15.htm The Tribal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020212056/http://library.thinkquest.org/26252/explore/15.htm |date=2012-10-20 }}, [[ThinkQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pygmies who live in Southeast Asia are, amongst others, referred to as “[[Negrito]]”.

==Deforestation==
{{further|Deforestation in Southeast Asia|Deforestation in Madagascar|Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest}}
[[File:Satellite image of 2015 Southeast Asian haze - 20150924.jpg|thumb|Satellite photograph of the [[2015 Southeast Asian haze|haze]] above [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]] on 24 September 2015.]]
[[Tropical rainforest|Tropical]] and [[temperate rainforest]]s have been subjected to heavy [[logging|legal]] and [[illegal logging]] for their valuable [[Tropical timber|hardwood]]s and [[agricultural expansion|agricultural]] clearance ([[slash-and-burn]], [[clearcutting]]) throughout the 20th century and the area covered by rainforests around the world is shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081204095313/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/entire-rainforests-set-to-disappear-in-next-decade-585840.html Entire rainforests set to disappear in next decade], [[The Independent]] 5 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologists have estimated that large numbers of species are being driven to [[extinction]] (possibly more than 50,000 a year; at that rate, says [[E. O. Wilson]] of [[Harvard University]], a quarter or more of all species on Earth could be exterminated within 50 years)&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB163CF930A35750C0A964958260 Talks Seek to Prevent Huge Loss of Species], [[New York Times]] 3 March 1992&lt;/ref&gt; due to the removal of habitat with destruction of the rainforests.

Another factor causing the loss of rainforest is expanding [[urban area]]s.

{{Translation sidebar}}

In [[translation]], '''Realia ''' (plural noun) are words and expressions for culture-specific material elements. The word ''realia'' comes from medieval [[Latin]], in which it originally meant “the real things”, i.e. material things, as opposed to abstract ones. The [[Bulgaria]]n translators Vlahov and Florin, who were the first to carry out an in-depth study of realia, coined the modern sense of the word. They indicate that since realia carry a very local overtone, they often pose a challenge for translation.&lt;ref&gt;Vlahov, S. and Florin, S. “Neperovodimoe v perevode. Realii”, in [[Bruno Osimo]]. “Manuale del Traduttore, Seconda Edizione”. Hoepli, 2004, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Realia must not be confused with terminology: the latter is primarily used in the scientific literature to designate things that pertain to the scientific sphere, and usually only appears in other kinds of texts to serve a very specific stylistic purpose. Realia, on the other hand, are born in popular culture, and are increasingly found in very diverse kinds of texts. [[Fiction]], in particular, is fond of realia for the exotic touch they bring.

==Types and examples of realia==
Vlahov and Florin classify them into various categories:

===Geography===
* '''physical geography''': [[fjord]], [[mistral (wind)|mistral]], [[steppe]], [[tornado]], [[tsunami]]…
* '''geographic objects tied to man’s activity''': [[polder]]…
* '''endemic species''': [[kiwi]], [[koala]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|sequoia]], [[yeti|Abominable Snowman]]…

==Translating realia==

To translate realia, various strategies exist : they range from phonetic transcription to  translation of the overall meaning. Israeli scholar [[Gideon Toury]] offers one way of defining such solutions. According to his characterization, each of these can be placed between two extremes: '''adequacy''' (closeness to the original) and '''acceptability''' (making the word entirely consistent with the target culture). Here are the various possibilities at hand for translating realia:

* [[transcription (linguistics)|Transcribing]] (i.e. copying) the word, character by character. This is called [[transliteration]] when the original word is written in a different alphabet.
* Transcribing according to the target language’s pronunciation rules. For instance, the Hindi word ''Kašmir '' becomes ''cachemire'' in French.
* Creating a new word or a [[calque]], such as the English ''flea market'' inspired by the French ''marché aux puces''
* Creating a new word, analogous to the original one, but which has a more local ring to it, e.g.  ''muezzin'' from the Arabic ''mu'adhdhin''
* Using a different but related word from the source language, passing it off as the original word. For instance, the Italian word ''cappuccino'' is often translated into English as ''latte'', which in Italian means “milk”.
* Making the meaning explicit, such as ''jewish temple'' for ''synagogue''
* Replacing the word with a similar, local one, such as the French ''art nouveau'' (literally “new art”) for ''Jugendstil''
* Replacing the word with one that is more generic or international, such as ''red wine'' for ''Beaujolais''
* Adding an adjective to help the reader identify the origin of the element of realia, as in ''the Argentine pampa''
* Translating the overall meaning. For example, the English sentence ''Does the National Health Service cover this drug?'' could become, in an American context, ''Is this drug expensive?''&lt;ref&gt;Osimo, Bruno. “Manuale del Traduttore, Seconda Edizione”. Hoepli, 2004, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

How suitable each of these solutions is depends on various factors. One of them is the type of text that is being translated. Adequate translations (in Toury's sense) of realia add some exoticism, a quality that is often desirable in fiction. For non-fiction, nowadays adequacy is usually preferred to acceptability, so as to avoid the ambiguity that can arise from the use of more culturally neutral translations – though the opposite preference has prevailed in the past. One must also consider how the element of realia relates to the source culture in terms of importance and familiarity. If, for instance, it is rather common in the source culture, then providing an adequate translation creates an exotic note that wasn’t there in the first place (though this can be justified by the fact that, after all, one is not dealing with an original, but a translation). If, on the contrary, the source culture perceives the element of realia as unusual, unless the translator renders such an element more culturally neutral, readers of the translation will most likely also perceive it as unusual. Another thing to keep in mind when establishing a translation strategy is that not all languages are equally open to “foreignisms”, and how familiar speakers of that language may be with the realia one introduces. Some languages, such as Italian, welcome such words and frequently integrate them into their vocabulary. Other languages, on the contrary, have the opposite tendency: they are wary of foreign words and are very impermeable to them. French is a good example of such protectionism. Lastly, the expected readership (which may or may not be similar to that of the original) influences the choice of a suitable translation strategy. For example, the name of a chemical compound will be translated differently depending on whether one expects the text to be read by chemists or schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.logos.it/pls/dictionary/linguistic_resources.cap_3_38?lang=en “How Realia Can Be Translated”] “Logos”, accessed on May 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reclaimed Water Jars.jpg|thumb|Sequence of reclamation from left: raw sewage, plant effluent, and finally reclaimed water (after several treatment steps)]]

'''Reclaimed''' or '''recycled water''' (also called '''wastewater reuse''' or '''water reclamation''') is the process of converting [[wastewater]] into water that can be [[reuse]]d for other purposes. Reuse may include [[irrigation]] of gardens and agricultural fields or replenishing [[surface water]] and [[groundwater]] (i.e., [[groundwater recharge]]). Reused water may also be directed toward fulfilling certain needs in residences (e.g. [[Flush toilet|toilet flushing]]), businesses, and industry, and could even be treated to reach [[drinking water]] standards. This last option is called either "direct potable reuse" or "indirect potable" reuse, depending on the approach used. Colloquially, the term "toilet to tap" also refers to potable reuse.&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview&gt;{{cite journal | last=Warsinger | first=David M. | last2=Chakraborty | first2=Sudip | last3=Tow | first3=Emily W. | last4=Plumlee | first4=Megan H. | last5=Bellona | first5=Christopher | last6=Loutatidou | first6=Savvina | last7=Karimi | first7=Leila | last8=Mikelonis | first8=Anne M. | last9=Achilli | first9=Andrea | last10=Ghassemi | first10=Abbas | last11=Padhye | first11=Lokesh P. | last12=Snyder | first12=Shane A. | last13=Curcio | first13=Stefano | last14=Vecitis | first14=Chad D. | last15=Arafat | first15=Hassan A. | last16=Lienhard | first16=John H. | title=A review of polymeric membranes and processes for potable water reuse | journal=Progress in Polymer Science | publisher=Elsevier BV | year=2018 | issn=0079-6700 | doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2018.01.004 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Reclaiming water for reuse applications instead of using [[Fresh water|freshwater]] supplies can be a water-saving measure. When used water is eventually discharged back into natural water sources, it can still have benefits to [[ecosystem]]s, improving streamflow, nourishing plant life and recharging [[aquifer]]s, as part of the natural [[water cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bischel | first =H.N. |author2=J.E.

Wastewater reuse is a long-established practice used for irrigation, especially in [[arid]] countries. Reusing wastewater as part of sustainable [[water management]] allows water to remain as an alternative water source for human activities. This can reduce [[water scarcity|scarcity]] and alleviate pressures on groundwater and other natural water bodies.&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnström, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C.

== Background ==
[[File:Effluent storage tank from where treated effluent is pumped away for irrigation (3232428204).jpg|thumb|[[Irrigation]] water is pumped from this tank which stores effluent received from a [[constructed wetland]] in Haran-Al-Awamied, Syria.]]
Achieving more [[sustainable sanitation]] and wastewater management  will require emphasis on actions linked to resource management, such as wastewater reuse or [[excreta reuse]] that will keep valuable resources available for productive uses.&lt;ref name="Andersson" /&gt; This in turn supports human wellbeing and broader [[sustainability]].

Simply stated, reclaimed water is water that is used more than one time before it passes back into the natural water cycle. Advances in wastewater treatment technology allow communities to reuse water for many different purposes. The water is treated differently depending upon the source and use of the water and how it gets delivered.

Cycled repeatedly through the planetary hydrosphere, all water on Earth is recycled water, but the terms "recycled water" or "reclaimed water" typically mean wastewater sent from a home or business through a [[Sewerage|sewer system]] to a [[wastewater treatment plant]], where it is treated to a level consistent with its intended use.

The [[World Health Organization]] has recognized the following principal driving forces for wastewater reuse:&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|title=The United Nations World Water Development Report 2017.

#increasing [[water scarcity]] and stress,
#increasing populations and related [[food security]] issues,
#increasing environmental pollution from improper wastewater disposal, and

== Types and applications ==

Most of the uses of water reclamation are non potable uses such as washing cars, flushing toilets, cooling water for power plants, concrete mixing, artificial lakes, irrigation for golf courses and public parks, and for hydraulic fracturing. Where applicable, systems run a dual piping system to keep the recycled water separate from the potable water.

The main reclaimed water applications in the world are shown below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Water Quality Management Strategy.|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/044e7a7e-558a-4abf-b985-2e831d8f36d1/files/water-recycling-guidelines-health-environmental-21.pdf|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Recycling and Reuse: The Environmental Benefits|url=https://www3.epa.gov/region9/water/recycling/|website=USEPA|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC92582/lb-na-26947-en-n.pdf|title=Water reuse in Europe.

===  De facto wastewater reuse (unplanned potable reuse) === 
De facto, unacknowledged or unplanned potable reuse refers to a situation where reuse of treated wastewater is, in fact, practiced but is not officially recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for water reuse|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FS7K.pdf|website=USEPA|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[wastewater treatment plant]] from one city may be discharging [[effluents]] to a [[river]] which is used as a drinking water supply for another city downstream.

Unplanned Indirect Potable Use&lt;ref name="unplanned-ipu"&gt;[[Public Utilities Board]], [http://www.pub.gov.sg/NEWater_files/overseas_experiences/index.html Overseas Experiences], accessed 24 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has existed for a long time. Large towns on the [[River Thames]] upstream of [[London]] ([[Oxford]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Swindon]], [[Bracknell]]) discharge their treated sewage ("non-potable water") into the Thames, which supplies water to London downstream. In the United States, the [[Mississippi River]] serves as both the destination of sewage treatment plant effluent and the source of potable water.

=== Urban reuse ===
* Unrestricted: The use of reclaimed water for [[Non potable|non-potable]] applications in municipal settings, where public access is not restricted.
* Restricted: The use of reclaimed water for non-potable applications in municipal settings, where public access is controlled or restricted by physical or institutional barriers, such as fencing, advisory signage, or temporal access restriction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for water reuse|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FS7K.pdf|website=USEPA|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural reuse ===
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
There are benefits of using recycled water for irrigation, including the lower cost compared to some other sources and consistency of supply regardless of season, climatic conditions and associated water restrictions. When reclaimed water is used for irrigation in agriculture, the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content of the treated wastewater has the benefit of acting as a [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="Otoo"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/other-publication-types/books-monographs/iwmi-jointly-published/resource-recovery-from-waste/|title=Resource recovery from waste: business models for energy, nutrient and water reuse in low- and middle-income countries|last=Otoo|first=Miriam|last2=Drechsel|first2=Pay|publisher=Routledge - Earthscan|year=2018|isbn=|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can make the [[reuse of excreta]] contained in sewage attractive.&lt;ref name="WHO2006"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

The irrigation water can be used in different ways on different crops:
* [[Food crops]] to be eaten raw: crops which are intended for human consumption to be eaten raw or unprocessed. 
* [[Processed food]] crops: crops which are intended for human consumption not to be eaten raw but after treatment process (i.e. cooked, industrially processed). 
* Non-food crops: crops which are not intended for human consumption (e.g. pastures, forage, fiber, ornamental, seed, forest and turf crops).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 16075-1:2015 - Guidelines for treated wastewater use for irrigation projects -- Part 1: The basis of a reuse project for irrigation|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62756|website=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, [[agriculture]] is increasingly using untreated wastewater for irrigation - often in an unsafe manner. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so are attractive to farmers. However, because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce [[water resources]] with industry and municipal users, there is often no alternative for farmers but to use [[water pollution|water polluted]] with urban waste directly to water their crops.

There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated  wastewater in agriculture. Wastewater from cities can contain a mixture of chemical and biological pollutants. In low-income countries, there are often high levels of pathogens from excreta. In [[Emerging countries|emerging nations]], where industrial development is outpacing environmental regulation, there are increasing risks from inorganic and organic chemicals. The [[World Health Organization]], in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), has developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in 2006.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; These guidelines advocate a ‘multiple-barrier’ approach  wastewater use, for example by encouraging farmers to adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw, cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.&lt;ref name="Otoo" /&gt;

=== Environmental reuse === 
The use of reclaimed water to create, enhance, sustain, or augment water bodies including [[wetland]]s, aquatic habitats, or stream flow is called "environmental reuse".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, [[constructed wetland]]s fed by wastewater provide both [[wastewater treatment]] and [[habitat]]s for flora and fauna.

=== Industrial reuse === 
The use of reclaimed water to recharge aquifers that are not used as a potable water source.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===  Planned potable reuse ===
Planned potable reuse is publicly acknowledged as an intentional project to recycle water for drinking water. There are two ways in which potable water can be delivered for reuse - "Indirect Potable Reuse" (IPR) and "Direct Potable Reuse". Both these forms of reuse are described below, and commonly involve a more formal public process and public consultation program than is the case with de facto or unacknowledged reuse. In ‘indirect’ potable reuse applications, the reclaimed wastewater is used directly or mixed with other sources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Pecson|first2=B|last3=Trussell|first3=R.S.|last4=Trussell|first4=R.R.|title=Potable reuse treatment trains throughout the world|url=http://www.trusselltech.com/uploads/media_items/potable-reuse-treatment-trains-throughout-the-world.original.pdf|journal=J. Water Supply Res. Technol.-AQUA|volume=62|pages=321–338|last1=Gerrity|first1=D|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct potable reuse is also called "toilet to tap".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Some water agencies reuse highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater or resource recovery plants as a reliable, drought proof source of drinking water. By using advanced purification processes, they produce water that meets all applicable drinking water standards.  System reliability and frequent monitoring and testing are imperative to them meeting stringent controls.&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview/&gt;

The water needs of a community, water sources, public health regulations, costs, and the types of water infrastructure in place, such as distribution systems, man-made reservoirs, or natural groundwater basins, determine if and how reclaimed water can be part of the drinking water supply. Some communities reuse water to replenish groundwater basins. Others put it into surface water reservoirs. In these instances the reclaimed water is blended with other water supplies and/or sits in storage for a certain amount of time before it is drawn out and gets treated again at a water treatment or distribution system.  In some communities, the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system.

Modern technologies such as [[reverse osmosis]] and ultraviolet disinfection are commonly used when reclaimed water will be mixed with the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview/&gt;

==== Indirect potable reuse ====
Indirect potable reuse (IPR) means the water is delivered to the consumer indirectly.  After it is purified, the reused water blends with other supplies and/or sits a while in some sort of storage, man-made or natural, before it gets delivered to a pipeline that leads to a water treatment plant or distribution system. That storage could be a [[groundwater]] basin or a surface water reservoir.

Some municipalities are using and others are investigating Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) of reclaimed water. For example, reclaimed water may be pumped into (subsurface recharge) or percolated down to (surface recharge) groundwater aquifers, pumped out, treated again, and finally used as drinking water. This technique may also be referred to as ''groundwater recharging''. This includes slow processes of further multiple purification steps via the layers of earth/sand (absorption) and microflora in the soil (biodegradation).

IPR or even unplanned potable use of reclaimed wastewater is used in many countries, where the latter is discharged into groundwater to hold back [[saline intrusion]] in coastal aquifers. IPR has generally included some type of environmental buffer, but conditions in certain areas have created an urgent need for more direct alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Michael|first2=C.|last3=Duan|first3=X.|last4=He|first4=X.|last5=Dionysiou|first5=D.D.|last6=Mills|first6=M.A.|last7=Fatta-Kassinos|first7=D.|date=June 2015|title=Dissolved effluent organic matter: Characteristics and potential implications in wastewater treatment and reuse applications|journal=Water Research|volume=77|pages=213–248|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2015.03.011|last1=Michael-Kordatou|first1=I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Direct potable reuse ====
Direct potable reuse means the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system.  Direct potable reuse may occur with or without “engineered storage” such as underground or above ground tanks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In a Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) scheme, water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system.  Direct potable reuse may occur with or without “engineered storage” such as underground or above ground tanks. In other words, DPR is the introduction of reclaimed water derived from urban wastewater after extensive treatment and monitoring to assure that strict water quality requirements are met at all times, directly into a municipal water supply system.

==== Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) ==== 
IPR occurs through the augmentation of drinking water supplies with urban wastewater treated to a level suitable for IPR followed by an environmental buffer (e.g. rivers, dams, aquifers, etc.) that precedes drinking water treatment. In this case, urban wastewater passes through a series of treatment steps that encompasses [[membrane filtration]] and separation processes (e.g. MF, UF and RO), followed by an advanced chemical oxidation process (e.g. UV, UV+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ozone).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Reuse in space ===
Wastewater reclamation can be especially important in relation to [[human spaceflight]].  In 1998, [[NASA]] announced it had built a human waste reclamation [[bioreactor]] designed for use in the [[International Space Station]] and a manned [[Mars]] mission. Human [[urine]] and [[feces]] are input into one end of the reactor and pure [[oxygen]], pure [[water]], and [[compost]] ([[humanure]]) are output from the other end. The soil could be used for growing [[vegetable]]s, and the [[bioreactor]] also produces [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/ASEN/asen5519/1999-Files/presentations/dave-waller.pdf University of Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/saf/transcripts/transcript902.htm|title=Scientific American Frontiers|work=Scientific American Frontiers - PBS Programs - PBS|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboard the [[International Space Station]], [[astronauts]] have been able to drink recycled urine due to the introduction of the [[ECLSS]] system.  The system costs $250 million and has been working since May 2009. The system recycles wastewater and urine back into potable water used for drinking, food preparation, and oxygen generation.  This cuts back on the need for resupplying the space station so often.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/090520-space-urine.html|title=Astronauts Drink Recycled Urine, and Celebrate|date=May 20, 2009|work=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

Water/wastewater reuse, as an alternative water source, can provide significant economic, social and environmental benefits, which are key motivators for implementing such reuse programmes. Specifically, in agriculture, irrigation with wastewater may contribute to improve production yields, reduce the ecological footprint and promote socioeconomic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Irrigation with Treated Wastewater: Potential Impacts on Microbial Function and Diversity in Agricultural Soils|publisher=Springer|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F698_2015_346|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Reuse in Europe - Relevant guidelines, needs for and barriers to innovation|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC92582|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* Increased [[water resources|water availability]] 
* [[Drinking water]] substitution - keep drinking water for drinking and reclaimed water for non-drinking use (i.e. industry, cleaning, irrigation, domestic uses, toilet flushing, etc.)
* Reduced over-abstraction of surface and groundwater
* Reduced energy consumption associated with production, treatment, and distribution of water compared to using deep groundwater resources, water importation or desalination 
* Reduced nutrient loads to receiving waters (i.e. rivers, canals and other surface [[water resources]])
* Reduced manufacturing costs of using high quality reclaimed water
* Increased agricultural production (i.e. crop yields)
* Reduced application of fertilizers (i.e. conservation of nutrients, reducing the need for artificial fertilizer (e.g. soil nutrition by the nutrients existing in the treated effluents))
* Enhanced environmental protection by restoration of streams, [[wetlands]] and ponds
* Increased employment and local economy (e.g. tourism, agriculture).

== Design considerations ==
=== Distribution ===
[[File:Nonpotable water pipeline in Mountain View.gk.jpg|thumb|A lavender-colored pipeline carrying nonpotable water in a dual piping system in Mountain View, California, U.S.]]
Nonpotable reclaimed water is often distributed with a [[dual piping]] network that keeps reclaimed water pipes completely separate from potable water pipes.

In many cities using reclaimed water, it is now in such demand that consumers are only allowed to use it on assigned days. Some cities that previously offered unlimited reclaimed water at a flat rate are now beginning to charge citizens by the amount they use.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Treatment processes ===
{{Main|Sewage treatment}}
For many types of reuse applications wastewater must pass through numerous [[sewage treatment]] process steps before it can be used. Steps might include screening, primary settling, biological treatment, tertiary treatment (for example reverse osmosis), and disinfection.

There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: [[Ozonation]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[Aerobic treatment system|aerobic treatment]] ([[membrane bioreactor]]), [[forward osmosis]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[Advanced oxidation process|advanced oxidation]].&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview/&gt;

Wastewater is generally treated to only [[Secondary treatment|secondary level treatment]] when used for irrigation.

A pump station distributes reclaimed water to users around the city. This may include golf courses, agricultural uses, cooling towers, or in land fills.

=== Alternative options ===
Rather than treating wastewater for reuse purposes, other options can achieve similar effects of [[Fresh water|freshwater]] savings: 
* [[Greywater]] reuse systems - at a household level, treated or untreated greywater may be used for [[flush toilet]]s or to water the garden. 
* [[Rainwater harvesting]] and [[Stormwater harvesting|stormwater recovery]]- Urban design systems which incorporate rainwater harvesting and reduce runoff are known as [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD) in Australia, [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] (LID) in the United States and [[Sustainable urban drainage systems]] (SUDS) in the United Kingdom.   
* Seawater [[desalination]] - an energy-intensive process where salt and other minerals are removed from seawater to produce potable water for drinking and irrigation, typically through [[membrane filtration]] ([[reverse-osmosis]]), and [[steam-distillation]].

=== Costs  ===
The cost of reclaimed water exceeds that of [[potable water]] in many regions of the world, where a [[fresh water]] supply is plentiful. However, reclaimed water is usually sold to citizens at a cheaper rate to encourage its use. As fresh water supplies become limited from distribution costs, increased population demands, or climate change reducing sources, the cost ratios will evolve also. The evaluation of reclaimed water needs to consider the entire water supply system, as it may bring important value of flexibility into the overall system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=S.X.|date=2012|title=A real options approach to the design and architecture of water supply systems using innovative water technologies under uncertainty|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf|journal=Journal of Hydroinformatics|author2=V. Babovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaimed water systems usually require a [[dual piping]] network, often with additional [[water tower|storage tanks]], which adds to the costs of the system.

=== Barriers to implementation ===
* Full-scale implementation and operation of water reuse schemes still face regulatory, economic, social and institutional challenges.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ncube-EJ-Water-Scarcity-a-driver-for-water-reclamation-and-collaboration.pdf|title=Water Scarcity, a driver for water reclamation, reuse and collaboration|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Economic viability of water reuse schemes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Costs of water quality monitoring and identification of contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/reuse.htm|title=Water Reuse - Environment - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in contaminant identification may include the separation of inorganic and [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutants]], [[Microorganism|microorganisms]], [[Colloid|Colloids]], and others. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pintilie|first=Loredana|last2=Torres|first2=Carmen M.|last3=Teodosiu|first3=Carmen|last4=Castells|first4=Francesc|date=December 15, 2016|title=Urban wastewater reclamation for industrial reuse: An LCA case study|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652616311143|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=139|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.209|issn=0959-6526|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Full cost recovery from water reuse schemes - lack of financial water pricing systems comparable to already subsidized conventional treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Meeker|first2=Melissa|last3=Minton|first3=Julie|last4=O'Donohue|first4=Mark|date=2015|title=International research agency perspectives on potable water reuse|journal=Environ.

== Health aspects ==
Reclaimed water is considered safe when appropriately used. Reclaimed water planned for use in recharging aquifers or augmenting surface water receives adequate and reliable treatment before mixing with naturally occurring water and undergoing natural restoration processes. Some of this water eventually becomes part of drinking water supplies.

A water quality study published in 2009 compared the water quality differences of reclaimed/recycled water, surface water, and groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Helgeson|first=Tom|title=A Reconnaissance-Level Quantitative Comparison of Reclaimed Water, Surface Water, and Groundwater|year=2009|publisher=WateReuse Research Foundation|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=978-1-934183-12-0|pages=141|url=http://www.watereuse.org/product/reconnaissance-level-quantitative-comparison-reclaimed-water-surface-water-and-groundwater}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results indicate that reclaimed water, surface water, and groundwater are more similar than dissimilar with regard to constituents. The researchers tested for 244 representative constituents typically found in water. When detected, most constituents were in the parts per billion and parts per trillion range. DEET (a bug repellant), and caffeine were found in all water types and virtually in all samples. Triclosan (in anti-bacterial soap &amp; toothpaste) was found in all water types, but detected in higher levels (parts per trillion) in reclaimed water than in surface or groundwater. Very few hormones/steroids were detected in samples, and when detected were at very low levels. Haloacetic acids (a disinfection by-product) were found in all types of samples, even groundwater. The largest difference between reclaimed water and the other waters appears to be that reclaimed water has been disinfected and thus has disinfection by-products (due to chlorine use).

A 2005 study titled "Irrigation of Parks, Playgrounds, and Schoolyards with Reclaimed Water" found that there had been no incidences of illness or disease from either microbial pathogens or chemicals, and the risks of using reclaimed water for irrigation are not measurably different from irrigation using potable water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crook|first=James|title=Irrigation of Parks, Playgrounds, and Schoolyards: Extent and Safety|year=2005|publisher=WateReuse Research Foundation|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=0-9747586-3-9|pages=60|url=http://www.watereuse.org/product/irrigation-parks-playgrounds-and-schoolyards-reclaimed-water-extent-and-safety-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study conducted by the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] in the United States of America found that the risk of exposure to certain microbial and chemical contaminants from drinking reclaimed water does not appear to be any higher than the risk experienced in at least some current drinking water treatment systems, and may be orders of magnitude lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13303|title=Water Reuse: Potential for Expanding the Nation's Water Supply through Reuse of Municipal Wastewater|date=2012|publisher=National Research Council|isbn=978-0-309-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report recommends adjustments to the federal regulatory framework that could enhance public health protection for both planned and unplanned (or de facto) reuse and increase public confidence in water reuse.

Many humans associate a feeling of [[disgust]] with reclaimed water and 13% of a survey group said they would not even sip it.&lt;ref name="Kean"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Winter 2015|title=Waste Not, Want Not|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/waste-not-want-not|journal=Distillations|volume=1|issue=4|page=5|last1=Kean|first1=Sam|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nonetheless, the main health risk for potable use of reclaimed water is the potential for pharmaceutical and other household chemicals or their derivatives ([[Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s) to persist in this water.&lt;ref name="Owens"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/features/pharmaceuticals-in-the-environment-a-growing-problem/20067898.article|title=Pharmaceuticals in the environment: a growing problem|date=19 February 2015|work=The Pharmaceutical Journal|last1=Owens|first1=Brian|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be less of a concern if [[human excreta]] was kept out of [[sewage]] by using [[dry toilet]]s or systems that treat [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] separately from [[greywater]].

To address these concerns about the source water, reclaimed water providers use multi-barrier treatment processes and constant monitoring to ensure that reclaimed water is safe and treated properly for the intended end use.

== Environmental aspects ==
There is debate about possible health and environmental effects. To address these concerns, A Risk Assessment Study of potential health risks of recycled water and comparisons to conventional Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Product (PPCP) exposures was conducted by the [[WateReuse|WateReuse Research Foundation]]. For each of four scenarios in which people come into contact with recycled water used for irrigation - children on the playground, golfers, and landscape, and agricultural workers - the findings from the study indicate that it could take anywhere from a few years to millions of years of exposure to nonpotable recycled water to reach the same exposure to PPCPs that we get in a single day through routine activities.

Using reclaimed water for non-potable uses saves potable water for drinking, since less potable water will be used for non-potable uses.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region09/water/recycling/|title=Water Recycling and Reuse: The Environmental Benefits/|publisher=US Environment Protection Agency|date=23 February 2016|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sometimes contains higher levels of nutrients such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[oxygen]] which may somewhat help [[fertilizer|fertilize]] garden and agricultural plants when used for irrigation.

The usage of water reclamation decreases the pollution sent to sensitive environments.  It can also enhance [[wetland]]s, which benefits the wildlife depending on that [[eco-system]]. It also helps to stop the chances of drought as recycling of water reduces the use of fresh water supply from underground sources.  For instance, The San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant instituted a water recycling program to protect the [[San Francisco Bay]] area's natural salt water marshes.&lt;ref name="EPA" /&gt;

The main potential risks that are associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes, when the treatment is not adequate are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/044e7a7e-558a-4abf-b985-2e831d8f36d1/files/water-recycling-guidelines-health-environmental-21.pdf|title=NATIONAL WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC92582|title=Water Reuse in Europe - Relevant guidelines, needs for and barriers to innovation|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[contamination]] of the food chain with microcontaminants, [[pathogens]] (i.e. [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[protozoa]], [[helminths]]), or [[antibiotic resistance]] determinants; 
# soil [[Soil salinity|salinization]] and accumulation of various unknown constituents that might adversely affect agricultural production; 
# distribution of the indigenous soil [[microbial communities]];

# excessive growth of [[algae]] and vegetation in canals carrying wastewater (i.e. [[eutrophication]]); 
# groundwater quality degradation by the various reclaimed water contaminants, migrating and accumulating in the soil and aquifers.

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation|Ecological sanitation#History}}

Wastewater reuse (planned or unplanned)  is an ancient practice, which has been applied since the dawn of human history and is closely connected to the development of sanitation provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/04/01/000009265_3961006165519/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|title=Reuse of wastewater in agriculture: A guide for planners|last2=Kalbermatten|first2=J. M.|last3=Bartone|first3=C. R.|last1=Khouri|first1=N|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. ===
In the U.S., the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972 mandated elimination of the discharge of untreated waste from municipal and industrial sources to make water safe for fishing and recreation. The US federal government provided billions of dollars in grants for building sewage treatment plants around the country. Modern treatment plants, usually using [[oxidation]] and/or [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] in addition to primary and secondary treatment, were required to meet certain standards.&lt;ref&gt;33 Usc 1251 seq., 1972, [[Federal Water Pollution Control Act]], Enacted by Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles County]]'s sanitation districts started providing treated wastewater for landscape irrigation in parks and golf courses in 1929.  The first reclaimed water facility in [[California]] was built at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in 1932.  The Water Replenishment District of Southern California was the first groundwater agency to obtain permitted use of recycled water for groundwater recharge in 1962.

[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] is located in Southern California, USA, and houses a classic example in indirect potable reuse.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/volume6/v6issue1/199-a6-1-4/file|title=Remaking waste as water: The governance of recycled effluent for potable water supply|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area, providing a much-needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watereuse.org/files/s/docs/OCWD_Tampa _Potable_Reuse_Workshop.pdf.|title=Orange County’s groundwater replenishment system: Potable reuse for the best available water|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the injected water consists of recycled water, starting as of 1976 with Water Factory 21, which used RO and high lime to clean the water (production capacity of 19,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wastewater.co.za/images/files/Advanced_reuse_Whk_to_Singapore_Water_May_2003.pdf|title=Advanced reuse: from Windhoek to Singapore and beyond, Water|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plant was decommissioned in 2004 and has since made place for a new project with a higher capacity (265,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day with an ultimate capacity of 492,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day), under the name of Groundwater Replenishment System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/volume6/v6issue1/199-a6-1-4/file|title=Remaking waste as water: The governance of recycled effluent for potable water supply,|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidelines and regulations ==

=== International organisations ===

* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO): “Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater” (2006).&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; 
* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP): “Guidelines for municipal wastewater reuse in the Mediterranean region” (2005). 
* United Nations Water Decade Programme on Capacity Development (UNW-DPC): Proceedings on the UNWater project “Safe use of wastewater in agriculture” (2013).

=== European Union ===

The health and environmental safety conditions under which wastewater may be reused are not specifically regulated at the [[European Union]] (EU) level. There are no guidelines or regulations at EU level on water quality for water reuse purposes. In the [[Water Framework Directive]], reuse of water is mentioned as one of the possible measures to achieve the Directive’s quality goals, however this remains a relatively vague recommendation rather than a requirement: Part B of Annex VI refers to reuse as one of the “supplementary measures which Member States within each river basin district may choose to adopt as part of the programme of measures required under Article 11(4)”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC92582|title=Water Reuse in Europe - Relevant guidelines, needs for and barriers to innovation|last2=Gawlik|first2=Bernd|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|last1=Alcalde Sanz|first1=Laura|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides that, Article 12 of the [[Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive|Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive]] concerning the reuse of treated wastewater states that “treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate”, is not specific enough to promote water reuse and it leaves too much room for interpretation as to what can be considered as an “appropriate” situation to reuse treated wastewater.

Despite the lack of common water reuse criteria at the EU level, several Member States (MS) have issued their own legislative frameworks, regulations, or guidelines for different water reuse applications (e.g. Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, and Spain).

However, after an evaluation carried out by the [[European Commission]] (EC) on the water reuse standards of several member states it was concluded that they differ in their approach. There are important divergences among the different standards regarding the permitted uses, the parameters to be monitored, and the limit values allowed. This lack of harmonization among water reuse standards might create some trade barriers for agricultural goods irrigated with reclaimed water. Once on the common market, the level of safety in the producing member states may be not considered as sufficient by the importing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Reuse - Environment - European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/reuse.htm|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most representative standards on wastewater reuse from European member states are the following:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 
* Cyprus: Law 106 (I) 2002 Water and Soil pollution control and associated regulations (KDP 772/2003, KDP 269/2005) (Issuing Institutions: Ministry of Agriculture, Natural resources and Environment, Water Development Department).

=== U.S. ===
Reclaimed water is not regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), but the EPA has developed water reuse guidelines that were most recently updated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/region9/water/recycling/|title=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FS7K.pdf|title=2012 Guidelines for Water Reuse|date=2012|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse represents the international standard for best practices in water reuse. The document was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the global consultancy CDM Smith. The Guidelines provide a framework for states to develop regulations that incorporate the best practices and address local requirements.

==Examples==

=== Australia ===
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in Australia}}
When there are droughts in [[Australia]] interest in reclaimed effluent options increases. Brisbane has been seen as a leader in this trend, and other cities and towns will review the [[Western Corridor Recycled Water Project]] once completed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Van Buynder|first2=Paul|last3=Lugg|first3=Richard|last4=Blair|first4=Palenque|last5=Devine|first5=Brian|last6=Cook|first6=Angus|last7=Weinstein|first7=Philip|date=17 March 2009|title=Indirect Potable Reuse: A Sustainable Water Supply Alternative|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=6|issue=3|pages=1174–1203|doi=10.3390/ijerph6031174|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Clemencia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While there are currently no full-scale direct potable reuse schemes operating in Australia, the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] is investigating the option of installing a potable reuse scheme at its Davis research base in [[Antarctica]]. To enhance the quality of the marine discharge from the Davis [[Wastewater Treatment Plant|WWTP]], a number of different, proven technologies have been selected to be used in the future, such as [[ozonation]], UV [[disinfection]], [[chlorine]], as well as UF, activated carbon filtration and RO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Israel ===
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in Israel}}
As of 2010, Israel leads the world in the proportion of water it recycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE6A01DQ20101114?pageNumber=3&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true|title=Arid Israel recycles waste water on grand scale|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel treats 80% of its sewage (400 billion liters a year), and 100% of the sewage from the Tel Aviv metropolitan area is treated and reused as irrigation water for agriculture and public works. As of today, all the reclaimed sewage water in Israel is used for agricultural and land improvement purposes.

=== Namibia ===
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in Namibia}}
An example of direct potable reuse is the case of [[Windhoek]] (Namibia, New Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant (NGWRP)), where treated wastewater has been blended with drinking water for more than 40 years. It is based on the multiple treatment barriers concept (i.e. pre-ozonation, enhanced [[coagulation]]/dissolved air flotation/rapid sand filtration, and subsequent [[ozone]], biological activated carbon/granular [[activated carbon]], [[ultrafiltration]] (UF), chlorination) to reduce associated risks and improve the water quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The reclaimed wastewater nowadays represent about 14% of the city’s drinking water production.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER FOR RE-USE IN THE DRINKING WATER SYSTEM OF WINDHOEK|url=http://www.ewisa.co.za/literature/files/339%20Menge.pdf|last1=MENGE|first1=J|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in Singapore}}
In Singapore reclaimed water is called [[NEWater]] and is bottled directly from an advanced water purification facility for educational and celebratory purposes. Though most of the reused water is used for high-tech industry in Singapore, a small amount is returned to reservoirs for drinking water.

At the end of 2002, the programme - successfully branded as NEWater - had garnered a 98 percent acceptance rate, with 82% of respondents indicating that they would drink the reused water directly, another 16% only when mixed with reservoir water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/books/9781843393641/water-sensitive-cities|title=Water Sensitive Cities|publisher=IWA Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The produced NEWater after stabilization (addition of alkaline chemicals) is in compliance with the WHO requirements and can be piped off to its wide range of applications (e.g. reuse in industry, discharge to a drinking water reservoir).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/newater/Pages/default.aspx|title=Singapore Public Utilities Board|accessdate=29 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528095250/http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/newater/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NEWater]] now makes up around 30% of Singapore’s total use, by 2060 Singapore’s National Water Agency plans to triple the current NEWater capacity as to meet 50% of Singapore’s future water demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/books/9781780400075/milestones-water-reuse|title=Global milestones in water reuse: keys to success and trends in development|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in South Africa}}
In South Africa, the main driver for wastewater reuse is drought conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example, in [[Beaufort West]], South Africa’s a direct wastewater reclamation plant (WRP) for the production of drinking water was constructed in the end of 2010, as a result of acute [[water scarcity]] (production of 2,300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/146252.pdf|title=Risk Assessment for South Africa’s first direct wastewater reclamation system for drinking water production|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imesa.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-6.pdf|title=Beaufort West Water Reclamation Plant: First Direct (Toilet-to-Tap) Water Reclamation Plant in South Africa|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process configuration based on multi-barrier concept and includes the following treatment processes: sand filtration, [[UF]], two-stage [[Reverse osmosis|RO]], and permeate disinfected by [[ultraviolet light]] (UV).

=== U.S. ===
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in the United States}}
The leaders in use of reclaimed water in the U.S. are [[Florida]] and California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ufl.edu/2000/05/24/water/ UF Professor: Drought Highlights Value Of Reused Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907013345/http://news.ufl.edu/2000/05/24/water/ |date=2006-09-07 }}. [[University of Florida]] News. May 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2012 U.S. National Research Council report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Water-Reuse-Potential-Expanding/13303/|title=Water Reuse: Potential for Expanding the Nation's Water Supply through Reuse of Municipal Wastewater (2012) : Division on Earth and Life Studies|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a committee of independent experts found that expanding the reuse of municipal wastewater for irrigation, industrial uses, and drinking water augmentation could significantly increase the United States’ total available water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4307-Water-Reuse|title=Division on Earth and Life Studies|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] which is located in Southern California, USA, and houses a classic example in indirect potable reuse.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A large-scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area, providing a much-needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Reef Life Survey''' is a marine life monitoring programme&lt;ref name = RLS &gt;Staff, RLS website home page http://reeflifesurvey.com/&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]. It is international in scope, but predominantly [[Australian]], as a large proportion of the volunteers are Australian. Most of the surveys are done by volunteer [[Recreational diver training|recreational divers]], collecting [[biodiversity]] data for [[marine conservation]]. The database is available to [[marine ecology]] researchers, and is used by several [[marine protected area]] managements in Australia,&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Naturalresources /&gt; New Zealand, American Samoa and the eastern Pacific.

==Function==

Reef Life Survey provides data to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources. They collect and curate biodiversity information at spatial and temporal scales beyond those possible by most scientific dive teams which have to work with limited resources, by using volunteer recreational divers trained in the RLS survey procedures.&lt;ref name = RLS /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gertz 2014" /&gt; The [[University of Tasmania]] houses and manages the RLS database, and the data is freely available to the public for non-profit purposes through public outputs, including their website.

==History==

Reef Life Survey was started by researchers at the University of Tasmania and initially funded by the [[Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities]] (CERF) Program. This program is the core activity of the Reef Life Survey Foundation Incorporated – a not for profit Australian organisation.&lt;ref name = RLS /&gt;

==Personnel==

Reef Life Survey includes a volunteer network of recreational [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]], trained in the relevant skills, and an Advisory Committee. The advisory committee is made up of managers and scientists who use the collected data, and representatives of the recreational diver network.&lt;ref name="RLS website" /&gt;

==Procedures==
[[File:Diver swimming a transect for Reef Life Survey PB164699.JPG|thumb|Diver swimming a transect for Reef Life Survey]]
Standard survey procedures are used matched to a variety of habitat [[topographies]], and using simple equipment - waterproof clipboard with records sheet, [[underwater camera]], and 50m surveyor's tape measure. The surveys are typically repeated at irregular intervals at listed sites, identified by [[GPS]] location, [[transect]] depth and direction, and are usually conducted as a pair of transects in opposite directions from the nominal position, at approximately constant depth. Data collected includes fish counts by visual census in a 5m x 5m corridor on both sides of the transect line (Method 1), mobile [[invertebrate]] counts in a 1m corridor on both sides of the line (Method 2), and photo-quadrats at 2.5m intervals along the 50m transect line. Manufactured debris may also be recorded. Off transect observations of interest are recorded separately (Method 0). Numbers and size class are recorded for fish, just numbers for most invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Methods Manual" /&gt;

==Data==
Since 2006, divers have collected data for RLS from over 44 countries. As of September 2015, more than 4500 species have been recorded from over 7000 surveys.

==Expeditions==

A [[circumnavigation]] of Australia by volunteer citizen scientists aboard the sailing [[catamaran]] Reef Dragon left [[Port Davey, Tasmania|Port Davey]], Tasmania, on February 16, 2013 on an counterclockwise journey around the continent of Australia and ended in February 2014 in [[Prince of Wales Bay]], Hobart. During the voyage a marine baseline of reef biodiversity for the new [[Commonwealth Coral Sea Marine Reserve]] network was established.&lt;ref name="Mounster 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Darby 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="U Tas" /&gt;

'''Reflective writing''' is an [[analysis|analytical]] practice in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, form, adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the item or incident, thought, feeling, emotion, or situation in his or her life. Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as "What did I notice?", "How has this changed me?" or "What might I have done differently?".

Thus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.

Reflective writing is also analyzing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different [[Point of view (literature)|perspectives]], and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from the subject.)

[[Image:Love in a Tub.png|thumb|Refinement meets burlesque in Restoration comedy. In this scene from [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'', musicians and well-bred ladies surround a man who is wearing a tub because he has lost his trousers.]]

"'''Restoration comedy'''" is English [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexually explicit language was encouraged by  [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian [[George Norman Clark]] argues:

{{quote|The best-known fact about the Restoration drama is that it is immoral. The dramatists did not criticize the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper....The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660-1714'' (1956) p 369.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]].

==Theatre companies==

===Original patent companies, 1660–1682===
[[Image:Settle-Morocco.png|thumb|The sumptuously decorated Dorset Gardens playhouse in 1673, with one of the sets for [[Elkannah Settle]]'s ''The Empress of Morocco''. The [[thrust stage|apron stage]] at the front which allowed intimate audience contact is not visible in the picture (the artist is standing on it).]] Charles II was an active and interested patron of the drama. Soon after his restoration, in 1660, he granted exclusive play-staging rights, so-called [[letters patent|Royal patents]], to the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]], led by two middle-aged [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] playwrights, [[Thomas Killigrew]] and [[William Davenant]]. The patentees scrambled for performance rights to the previous generation's [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and Caroline plays, which were the first necessity for economic survival before any new plays existed. Their next priority was to build new, splendid [[patent theatre]]s in [[Drury Lane]] and [[Dorset Gardens]], respectively. Striving to outdo each other in magnificence, Killigrew and Davenant ended up with quite similar theatres, both designed by [[Christopher Wren]], both optimally provided for music and dancing, and both fitted with moveable scenery and elaborate machines for thunder, lightning, and waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatists of the Restoration renounced the tradition of satire, as recently embodied by [[Ben Jonson]], and devoted themselves to the [[comedy of manners]], which uncritically accepted the social code of the upper class.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p194"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA194 pp.194, 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience of the early Restoration period was not exclusively [[noble court|courtly]], as has sometimes been supposed, but it was quite small and could barely support two companies. There was no untapped reserve of occasional playgoers. Ten consecutive performances constituted a smash hit. This closed system forced playwrights to be extremely responsive to popular taste. Fashions in the drama would change almost week by week rather than season by season, as each company responded to the offerings of the other, and new plays were urgently sought. The King's Company and the Duke's Company vied with one another for audience favour, for popular actors, and for new plays, and in this hectic climate the new [[genre]]s of [[heroic drama]], [[she-tragedy|pathetic drama]], and Restoration comedy were born and flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 17, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Company, 1682–1695===
Both the quantity and quality of the drama suffered when in 1682 the more successful Duke's Company absorbed the struggling King's Company, and the amalgamated ''United Company'' was formed. The production of new plays dropped off sharply in the 1680s, affected by both the monopoly and the political situation (see [[Restoration comedy#Decline of comedy, 1678–90|Decline of comedy]] below). The influence and the incomes of the actors dropped, too.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80s, predatory investors ("Adventurers") converged on the United Company, while management was taken over by the lawyer [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]]. Rich attempted to finance a tangle of "farmed" shares and sleeping partners by slashing salaries and, dangerously, by abolishing the traditional perks of senior performers, who were stars with the clout to fight back.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of the theatres, 1695–1700===
The company owners, wrote the young United Company employee [[Colley Cibber]], "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public were inclined to support."&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers like the legendary [[Thomas Betterton]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]], and the rising young comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]] had the audience on their side and, in the confidence of this, they walked out.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 68–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors gained a Royal "licence to perform", thus bypassing Rich's ownership of both the original Duke's and King's Company patents from 1660, and formed their own cooperative company. This unique venture was set up with detailed rules for avoiding arbitrary managerial authority, regulating the ten actors' shares, the conditions of salaried employees, and the sickness and retirement benefits of both categories. The cooperative had the good luck to open in 1695 with the première of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s famous ''Love For Love'' and the skill to make it a huge box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

London again had two competing companies. Their dash to attract audiences briefly revitalised Restoration drama, but also set it on a fatal downhill slope to the lowest common denominator of public taste. Rich's company notoriously offered [[Bartholomew Fair]]-type attractions – high kickers, jugglers, ropedancers, performing animals – while the co-operating actors, even as they appealed to snobbery by setting themselves up as the only legitimate theatre company in London, were not above retaliating with "prologues recited by boys of five, and epilogues declaimed by ladies on horseback".&lt;ref&gt;Dobrée, xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
===First actresses===
[[File:Nell gwyn peter lely c 1675.jpg|thumb|[[Nell Gwynn]] was one of the first actresses and the mistress of Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy was strongly influenced by the introduction of the first professional actresses. Before [[London theatre closure 1642|the closing of the theatres]], all female roles had been taken by [[boy player]]s, and the predominantly male audiences of the 1660s and 1670s were curious, censorious, and delighted at the novelty of seeing real women engage in risqué repartee and take part in physical seduction scenes. [[Samuel Pepys]] refers many times in his famous diary to visiting the playhouse to watch or re-watch the performance of particular actresses, and to how much he enjoys these experiences.

Daringly suggestive comedy scenes involving women became especially common, although of course Restoration actresses were, just like male actors, expected to do justice to all kinds and moods of plays. (Their role in the development of Restoration tragedy is also important, compare [[She-tragedy]].)

A new speciality introduced almost as early as the actresses was the [[breeches role]], which called for an actress to appear in male clothes (breeches being tight-fitting knee-length pants, the standard male garment of the time), for instance to play a witty heroine who disguises herself as a boy to hide, or to engage in escapades disallowed to girls. A quarter of the plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700 contained breeches roles. Playing these [[cross-dressing]] roles, women behaved with the freedom society allowed to men, and some feminist critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, regard them as subversive of conventional [[gender roles]] and empowering for female members of the audience. Elizabeth Howe has objected that the male disguise, when studied in relation to playtexts, prologues, and epilogues, comes out as "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object" to male patrons, by showing off her body, normally hidden by a skirt, outlined by the male outfit.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful Restoration actresses included Charles II's mistress [[Nell Gwyn]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]] who was famous for her ability to "move the passions" and make whole audiences cry, the 1690s comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]], and Susanna Mountfort (a.k.a. [[Susanna Verbruggen]]), who had many breeches roles written especially for her in the 1680s and 90s. Letters and memoirs of the period show that both men and women in the audience greatly relished Mountfort's swaggering, roistering impersonations of young women wearing breeches and thereby enjoying the social and sexual freedom of the male [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]].

===First celebrity actors===
[[Image:Thomas Betterton.gif|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Betterton]] played the irresistible Dorimant in [[George Etherege]]'s ''[[Man of Mode]].'' Betterton's acting ability was praised by [[Samuel Pepys]], [[Alexander Pope]], and [[Colley Cibber]].]]
During the Restoration period, both male and female actors on the London stage became for the first time public personalities and [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Documents of the period show audiences being attracted to performances by the talents of particular actors as much as by particular plays, and more than by authors (who seem to have been the least important draw, no performance being advertised by author until 1699). Although the playhouses were built for large audiences—the second Drury Lane theatre from 1674 held 2000 patrons – they were of compact design, and an actor's charisma could be intimately projected from the [[thrust stage]].

With two companies competing for their services from 1660 to 1682, star actors were able to negotiate star deals, comprising company shares and [[Benefit concert|benefit nights]] as well as salaries. This advantageous situation changed when the two companies were amalgamated in 1682, but the way the actors rebelled and took command of a new company in 1695 is in itself an illustration of how far their status and power had developed since 1660.

The greatest fixed stars among Restoration actors were Elizabeth Barry ("Famous Mrs Barry" who "forc 'd Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory") and [[Thomas Betterton]], both of them active in organising the actors' revolt in 1695 and both original patent-holders in the resulting actors' cooperative.

Betterton played every great male part there was from 1660 into the 18th century. After watching ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1661, Samuel Pepys reports in his diary that the young beginner Betterton "did the prince's part beyond imagination." Betterton's expressive performances seem to have attracted playgoers as magnetically as did the novelty of seeing women on the stage. He was soon established as the leading man of the Duke's Company, and played Dorimant, the seminal irresistible [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]], at the première of [[George Etherege]]'s ''Man of Mode'' (1676). Betterton's position remained unassailable through the 1680s, both as the leading man of the United Company and as its stage manager and ''de facto'' day-to-day leader. He remained loyal to Rich longer than many of his co-workers, but eventually it was he who headed the actors' walkout in 1695, and who became the acting manager of the new company.

==Comedies==
Variety and dizzying fashion changes are typical of Restoration comedy. Even though the "Restoration drama" unit taught to college students is likely to be telescoped in a way that makes the plays all sound contemporary, scholars now have a strong sense of the rapid evolution of English drama over these forty years and of its social and political causes. The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged.

[[File:John Lacy by John Michael Wright 1668-70.png|thumb|upright|[[John Lacy (playwright)|John Lacy]] was the favourite comic of King Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of [[Aphra Behn]] in the 1680s is to be noted. In the mid-1690s a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are extremely different from each other. An attempt is made below to illustrate the generational taste shift by describing ''The Country Wife'' (1675) and ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697) in some detail. These two plays differ from each other in some typical ways, just as a Hollywood movie of the 1950s differs from one of the 1970s. The plays are not, however, offered as being "typical" of their decades. Indeed, there exist no typical comedies of the 1670s or the 1690s; even within these two short peak-times, comedy types kept mutating and multiplying.

===Aristocratic comedy, 1660–1680===
The drama of the 1660s and 1670s was vitalised by the competition between the two patent companies created at the Restoration, as well as by the personal interest of Charles II, and the comic playwrights rose to the demand for new plays. They stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, and combined the looted plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Early Restoration audiences had little enthusiasm for structurally simple, well-shaped comedies such as those of [[Molière]]; they demanded bustling, crowded multi-plot action and fast pace. Even a splash of high heroic drama might be thrown in to enrich the comedy mix, as in [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'' (1664), which has one heroic verse "conflict between love and friendship" plot, one urbane wit comedy plot, and one burlesque pantsing plot. (''See illustration, top right''.) Such incongruities contributed to Restoration comedy being held in low esteem in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but today the early Restoration total theatre experience is again valued on the stage, as well as by [[postmodern]] academic critics.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court, and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' (1676), a variation on the theme of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation "Plain Dealer" Wycherley or "Manly" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675). [[Image:William Wycherley.png|thumb|[[William Wycherley]], ''[[The Country Wife]]'': "O Lord, I'll have some china too. Good Master Horner, don't think to give other people china, and me none. Come in with me too."]]

====Example. William Wycherley, ''The Country Wife'' (1675)====
''[[The Country Wife]]'' has three interlinked but distinct plots, which each project sharply different moods:

1. Horner's [[impotence]] trick provides the main plot and the play's organising principle. The upper-class town rake Horner mounts a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible, first spreading a false rumour of his own impotence, to be allowed where no complete man may go. The trick is a great success and Horner has sex with many married ladies of virtuous reputation, whose husbands are happy to leave him alone with them. In one famously outrageous scene, the "China scene", sexual intercourse is assumed to take place repeatedly just off stage, where Horner and his mistresses carry on a sustained [[double entendre]] [[dialogue]] purportedly about Horner's china collection. ''The Country Wife'' is driven by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth about Horner's sexual prowess (and thus the truth about the respectable ladies), from which he extricates himself by quick thinking and good luck. Horner never becomes a reformed character, but keeps his secret to the end and is assumed to go on merrily reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.

2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière's ''[[School for Wives]]''. Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married an ignorant young country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swathe through the sophistications of London marriage without even noticing them. She is enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors (such self-referential stage jokes were nourished by the new higher status of actors), and keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's [[pathological jealousy]] always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.

3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a comparatively uplifting love story in which the [[wit]]ty Harcourt wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea from the hands of the Upper-class town snob Sparkish, to whom she was engaged until discovering he loved her only for her money.

===Decline of comedy, 1678–1690===
When the two companies were amalgamated in 1682 and the London stage became a monopoly, both the number and the variety of new plays being written dropped sharply. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]] (1682). The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dramatist [[Thomas Shadwell]] sparring with the [[Tory|Tories]] [[John Dryden]] and [[Aphra Behn]]. Behn's unique achievement as an early professional woman writer has been the subject of much recent study.

===Comedy renaissance, 1690–1700===
During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong middle-class element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. [[Thomas Southerne]]'s dark ''[[The Wives' Excuse]]'' (1691) is not yet very "soft": it shows a woman miserably married to the [[fop]] Friendall, everybody's friend, whose follies and indiscretions undermine her social worth, since her honour is bound up in his. Mrs Friendall is pursued by a would-be lover, a matter-of-fact rake devoid of all the qualities that made Etherege's Dorimant charming, and she is kept from action and choice by the unattractiveness of all her options. All the humour of this "comedy" is in the subsidiary love-chase and fornication plots, none in the main plot.

In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the  "wit duels" between lovers typical of 1670s comedy are underplayed. The give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous "Proviso" scene in ''The Way of the World'' (1700). Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) follows in the footsteps of Southerne's ''Wives' Excuse'', with a lighter touch and more humanly recognisable characters.

====Example. John Vanbrugh, ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697)====
[[Image:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Vanbrugh]], ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'': "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."]]
''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]] (see Stone).

Sir John Brute in ''The Provoked Wife'' is tired of matrimony. He comes home drunk every night and is continually rude and insulting to his wife. She is meanwhile being tempted to embark upon an affair with the witty and faithful Constant. Divorce is not an option for either of the Brutes at this time, but forms of legal separation have recently come into existence, and would entail a separate maintenance to the wife. Such an arrangement would not allow remarriage. Still, muses Lady Brute, in one of many discussions with her niece Bellinda, "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."

Bellinda is at the same time being grumpily courted by Constant's friend Heartfree, who is surprised and dismayed to find himself in love with her. The bad example of the Brutes is a constant warning to Heartfree to not marry.

''The Provoked Wife'' is a talk play, with the focus less on love scenes and more on discussions between female friends (Lady Brute and Bellinda) and male friends (Constant and Heartfree). These exchanges are full of jokes, but are also thoughtful and have a dimension of melancholy and frustration.

After a forged-letter complication, the play ends with marriage between Heartfree and Bellinda and stalemate between the Brutes. Constant continues to pay court to Lady Brute, and she continues to shilly-shally.

===End of comedy===
The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out at the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by the drama of obvious sentiment and exemplary morality.

==After Restoration comedy==
===Stage history===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the sexual frankness of Restoration comedy ensured that theatre producers cannibalised it or adapted it with a heavy hand, rather than actually performed it. Today, Restoration comedy is again appreciated on the stage. The classics, Wycherley's ''The Country Wife'' and ''The Plain-Dealer'', Etherege's ''The Man of Mode'', and Congreve's ''Love For Love'' and ''The Way of the World''  have competition not only from Vanbrugh's ''The Relapse'' and ''The Provoked Wife'', but from such dark, unfunny comedies as [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''The Wives Excuse''. Aphra Behn, once considered unstageable, has had a major renaissance, with ''The Rover'' now a repertory favourite.

===Literary criticism===
Distaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only off the stage but also locked in a critical poison cupboard. Victorian critics like [[William Hazlitt]], although valuing the linguistic energy and "strength" of the [[wiktionary:canon|canonical]] writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always found it necessary to temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor [[Montague Summers]], whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.

"Critics remain astonishingly defensive about the masterpieces of this period", wrote Robert D. Hume as late as 1976. It is only over the last few decades that that statement has become untrue, as Restoration comedy has been acknowledged a rewarding subject for high theory analysis and Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'', long branded the most obscene play in the English language, has become something of an academic favourite. "Minor" comic writers are getting a fair share of attention, especially the post-Aphra Behn generation of women playwrights which appeared just around the turn of the 18th century: [[Delarivier Manley]], [[Mary Pix]], [[Catharine Trotter]], and [[Susannah Centlivre]]. A broad study of the majority of never-reprinted Restoration comedies has been made possible by Internet access (by subscription only) to the first editions at the [[British Library]].

By definition, '''stomatal conductance''', usually [[diffusion flux|measured]] in mmol m⁻² s⁻¹, is the measure of the [[mass transfer|rate of passage]] of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) entering, or water vapor exiting through the [[stoma]]ta of a leaf. Stomata are small pores on the top and or bottom of a leaf that are responsible for taking in and expelling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and moisture from and to the outside air. 
The rate of stomatal conductance, or its inverse, stomatal resistance, is directly related to the boundary layer resistance of the leaf and the absolute concentration gradient of water vapor from the leaf to the atmosphere. It is under direct biological control of the leaf through the use of guard cells, which surround the stomatal pore &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taiz/Zeiger|title=Plant Physiology|year=1991|publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Redwood City, CA|isbn=978-0-8053-0245-5|pages=92–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Taiz/Zeiger 1991).  The [[turgor pressure]] and osmotic potential of guard cells is directly related to the stomatal conductance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=Thomas|title=Modelling Stomatal Conductance in Response to Environmental Factors|journal=Plant, Cell &amp; Environment|date=September 2013|volume=36|issue=9|pages=1691–1699|doi=10.1111/pce.12140|pmid=23730938}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stomatal conductance is a function of stomatal density, stomatal aperture, and stomatal size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ziegler, Farquhar, Cowan|first1=Eduardo, G.D., I.R.|title=Stomatal Function|date=1987|publisher=Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University|location=Stanford, California|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mp-aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=conductance&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2016|isbn=9780804713474}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stomatal conductance is integral to leaf level calculations of [[transpiration]] (E). Multiple studies have shown a direct correlation between the use of herbicides and changes in physiological and biochemical growth processes in plants, particularly non-target plants, resulting in a reduction in stomatal conductance and turgor pressure in leaves.&lt;ref name="Beerling2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beerling|first1=D.

== Light-dependent stomatal opening ==

Light-dependent stomatal opening occurs in many species and under many different conditions. Light is a major stimulus involved in stomatal conductance, and has two key elements that are involved in the process: the stomatal response to blue light, and photosynthesis in the [[guard cell|guard cell's]] [[chloroplast]]. The stomata open when there is an increase in light, and they close when there is a decrease in light. This is because the blue light activates a receptor on the guard cell membrane which induces the pumping of protons of the cells, which creates an electrochemical gradient. This causes free floating potassium and other ions to enter the guard cells via a [[Potassium channel|channel]]. The increase in solutes within the guard cells leads to a decrease in the [[osmotic potential]] of the cells, causing water to flood in, the guard cell's to become enlarged, and therefore open.The second key element involved in light-dependent stomatal opening is the [[photosynthesis]] in the guard cell's chloroplast. This event also increases the amount of solutes within the guard cell. Carbon Dioxide enters the chloroplasts which increases the amount of photosynthesis. This increases the amount of solutes that are being produced by the chloroplast which are then released into the cytosol of the guard cell. Again, this causes a decrease in osmotic potential, water floods into the cells, the cells swell up with water, and the stomate is opened&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taiz|first1=Lincoln|last2=Zeiger|first2=Eduardo|last3=Moller|first3=Ian Max|last4=Murphy|first4=Angus|title=Plant Physiology and Development|publisher=Sinauer Associates|pages=270–281|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Recent studies have looked at the stomatal conductance of fast growing tree species to identify the water use of various species. Through their research it was concluded that the predawn [[water potential]] of the leaf remained consistent throughout the months while the midday water potential of the leaf showed a variation due to the seasons. For example, canopy stomatal conductance had a higher water potential in July than in October. The studies conducted for this experiment determined that the stomatal conductance allowed for a constant water use per unit leaf area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.12.003|title = Stomatal and hydraulic conductance and water use in a eucalypt plantation in Guangxi, southern China| journal=Agricultural and Forest Meteorology| volume=202| pages=61–68|year = 2015|last1 = Zhu|first1 = L.W.| last2=Zhao| first2=P.| last3=Wang| first3=Q.| last4=Ni| first4=G.Y.| last5=Niu| first5=J.F.| last6=Zhao| first6=X.H.| last7=Zhang| first7=Z.Z.| last8=Zhao| first8=P.Q.| last9=Gao| first9=J.G.| last10=Huang| first10=Y.Q.| last11=Gu| first11=D.X.| last12=Zhang| first12=Z.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other studies have explored the relationship between drought stress and stomatal conductance. Through these experiments, researchers have found that a drought resistant plant regulates it's [[transpiration]] rate via stomatal conductance. This minimizes water loss and allows the plant to survive under low water conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cj.2017.01.001|title = Improving water-use efficiency by decreasing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate to maintain higher ear photosynthetic rate in drought-resistant wheat| journal=The Crop Journal| volume=5| issue=3| pages=231–239|year = 2017|last1 = Li|first1 = Yuping| last2=Li| first2=Hongbin| last3=Li| first3=Yuanyuan| last4=Zhang| first4=Suiqi}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Methods for measuring==
Stomatal conductance can be measured in several ways:
Steady-state porometers:
A ''steady state porometer'' measures stomatal conductance using a sensor head with a fixed diffusion path to the leaf. It measures the vapor concentration at two different locations in the diffusion path. It computes vapor flux from the vapor concentration measurements and the known conductance of the diffusion path using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{C_{vL}-C_{v1}}{R_{vs}+R_1}=\frac{C_{v1}-C_{v2}}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where &lt;math&gt;C_{vL}&lt;/math&gt; is the vapor concentration at the leaf, &lt;math&gt;C_{v1}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;C_{v2}&lt;/math&gt;  are the concentrations at the two sensor locations, &lt;math&gt;R_{vs}&lt;/math&gt; is the stomatal resistance, and &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; are the resistances at the two sensors. If the temperatures of the two sensors are the same, concentration can be replaced with relative humidity, giving

&lt;math&gt;R_{vs}=\frac{1-h_1}{h_2-h_1}R_2-R_1&lt;/math&gt;

Stomatal conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, therefore

&lt;math&gt;g_{vs}=\frac{1}{R_{vs}}&lt;/math&gt; .

A ''dynamic porometer'' measures how long it takes for the humidity to rise from one specified value to another in an enclosed chamber clamped to a leaf. The resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is then determined from the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta t=\frac{\left(R+A\right)l\Delta h}{1-h}&lt;/math&gt;

where ∆&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time required for the cup humidity to change by ∆&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the cup humidity, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the cup “length,” and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an offset constant.

''Null balance porometers'' maintain a constant humidity in an enclosed chamber by regulating the flow of dry air through the chamber and find stomatal resistance from the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;R_{vs}=\frac{A}{f}\left(\frac{1}{h}-1\right)-R_{va}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{vs}&lt;/math&gt; is the stomatal resistance, &lt;math&gt;R_{va}&lt;/math&gt; is the boundary layer resistance, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the leaf area, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the flow rate of dry air, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the chamber humidity.

The resistance values found by these equations are typically converted to conductance values.

== Models ==
A number of models of stomatal conductance exist.

===  Ball-Berry-Leuning model ===
The '''Ball-Berry-Leuning''' model was formulated by  Ball, Woodrow and Berry in 1987, and improved by Leuning in the early 90s.&lt;ref name="Dewar02"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model formulates stomatal conductance, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;
g = g_0 + \frac{a_1 A_n}{(c_s - \Gamma)  (1 + \frac{D_s}{D_0})}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the stomatal conductance for {{CO2}} diffusion, &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; at the light compensation point, &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is {{CO2}} assimilation rate of the leaf, &lt;math&gt;D_s&lt;/math&gt; is the vapour pressure deficit, &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the leaf-surface CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compensation point. &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_0&lt;/math&gt; are empirical coefficients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">'''TIME-ITEM''' is an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of ''Topics'' that describes the content of undergraduate [[medical education]].  TIME is an acronym for "Topics for Indexing Medical Education"; ITEM is an acronym for "Index de thèmes pour l’éducation médicale."  Version 1.0 of the taxonomy has been released and the [[web application]] that allows users to work with it is still under development.  Its developers are seeking more collaborators to expand and validate the taxonomy and to guide future development of the web application.

== History ==

The development of TIME-ITEM began at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 2006.  It was initially developed to act as a content [[Index (publishing)|index]] for a [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum map]] being constructed there.  After its initial presentation at the 2006 conference of the [http://www.came-acem.ca/ Canadian Association for Medical Education],&lt;ref&gt;Willett T &amp; Clarke M. A Map of Medical Concepts: A General-use Database for Applications in Medical Education.  AFMC Resource Group on Medical Informatics Reception.  At the Canadian Association for Medical Education Conference (May 2006) London, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; early collaborators included the [[University of British Columbia]], [[McMaster University]] and [[Queen's University]].

== Features ==

The TIME-ITEM ontology is unique in that it is designed specifically for undergraduate medical education.  As such, it includes fewer strictly biomedical entries than other common medical [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabularies]] (such as [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] or [[SNOMED CT]]) but more entries relating to the medico-social concepts of communication, collaboration, professionalism, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Willett | first1 = TG. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = KC. | last3 = Broudo | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarke | first4 = M. | title = It's about TIME: a general-purpose taxonomy of subjects in medical education | journal = Med Educ | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–8 |date=Apr 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03012.x | pmid = 18298447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics within TIME-ITEM are arranged poly-[[Hierarchy (object-oriented programming)|hierarchically]], meaning any Topic can have more than one [[Tree (data structure)|parent]].  Relationships are established based on the logic that learning about a Topic contributes to the learning of all its parent Topics. 

In addition to housing the ontology of Topics, the TIME-ITEM web application can house multiple [[Curriculum framework|Outcome frameworks]].  All [[Outcome-based education|Outcomes]], whether private Outcomes entered by single institutions or publicly available medical education Outcomes (such as [[CanMeds 2005]]) are hierarchically linked to one or more Topics in the ontology.  In this way, the contribution of each Topic to multiple Outcomes is made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Willett TG, Marshall KC, Broudo M &amp; Clarke M.  TIME as a generic index for outcome-based medical education.  ''Medical Teacher'' 2008; 29(7):655-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the [[XML]] documents exported from TIME-ITEM (which contain the hierarchy of Outcomes and TIME-ITEM Topics) is being developed alongside the [http://www.medbiq.org MedBiquitous] Competency standards.  

The taxonomy currently exists in English only but translation to Canadian French is in progress.

== Applications ==

TIME-ITEM is intended to be a general-use ontology for medical [[Education Informatics|education informatics]].  It has two primary potential applications:
# Inclusion in [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum maps]].  By mapping learning objects or sessions to TIME-ITEM Topics in a curriculum map, the map becomes searchable for both granular and broad concepts.  If one or more Outcome frameworks are included with the Topic ontology, then the contribution of each curricular element to one or more Outcomes is made explicit.  This also facilitates curriculum [[evaluation]] in terms of one or more outcome frameworks.
# Indexing learning, assessment and portfolio objects.  Metatagging [[learning object]]s or [[assessment objects]] with a controlled vocabulary enhances the organization and retrieval of objects from a [[Disciplinary repository|repository]].  Metatagging [[electronic portfolio]] entries allows one to show how multiple entries "add up" to a demonstration of competence with respect to certain educational outcomes.

The possibility of expanding or modifying TIME-ITEM for use in postgraduate/continuing medical education and in nursing education is currently being explored.

'''Those firmly rooted in knowledge''' is a recurring theme in the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]]. This term is of special interest for the [[Shi'a]].

==Qur'an==
The term and its like is used in [[Al-Imran]] {{Quran-usc|3|7}} and {{Quran-usc|4|162}}.

==Sunni view==
All those who speak truth, their hearts are firm in belief, do not commit any unlawful acts, those who are well grounded in their knowledge of [[Din_(Arabic)|Deen]], their knowledge translates into their actions, does not swear or take false oaths, does not consume wealth unlawfully.

Sunni view that '''those firmly rooted in knowledge''' are the body of Muslim Jurists ({{lang-ar|[[Ulema]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}) who interpret the [[Divine Law]] ({{lang-ar|[[sharia]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}), deriving the [[Islamic]] [[Jurisprudence]] ({{lang-ar|[[Fiqh]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}). 

'''[[Ulema]]''' is the plural of '''[['alim|Alim]]''', Arabic for [[wikt:knowledgeable|knowledgeable]]. This connects to the Arabic for knowledge, [[Ilm (Arabic)|ilm]], the last word of this term: "al-rasikhuna fi 'l-''''ilm'''"

==Shi'a view==
Shi'a view '''those firmly rooted in knowledge''' to be [[Muhammad]]'s [[household]] and ({{lang-ar|[[Ahl al-Bayt]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}) himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.swipnet.se/islam/books/imamate/lesson21.htm Lesson Twenty-One: The Sources of the Imam's Knowledge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Al-Imran]] {{Quran-usc|3|7}} for some hadith in this regard.

A '''trace fossil''', also '''ichnofossil''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|ɪ|k|n|oʊ|f|ɒ|s|ᵻ|l}}; from {{lang-el|ἴχνος}} ''ikhnos'' "trace, track"), is a [[Geology|geological]] record of [[Earliest known life forms|biological activity]]. '''Ichnology''' is the study of such traces, and is the work of '''ichnologists'''. Trace [[fossil]]s may consist of impressions made on or in the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] by an organism: for example, [[burrow fossil|burrow]]s, borings ([[bioerosion]]), [[urolite]]s (erosion caused by evacuation of liquid wastes), [[Ichnite|footprints]] and feeding marks, and root cavities. The term in its broadest sense also includes the remains of other organic material produced by an organism — for example [[coprolite]]s (fossilized droppings) or chemical markers — or sedimentological structures produced by biological means - for example, [[stromatolites]]. Trace fossils contrast with body fossils, which are the fossilized remains of parts of organisms' bodies, usually altered by later chemical activity or mineralization.

[[Sedimentary structures]], for example those produced by empty shells rolling along the sea floor, are not produced through the behaviour of an organism and not considered trace fossils.

The study of traces - ichnology - divides into ''paleoichnology'', or the study of trace fossils, and ''neoichnology'', the study of modern traces. Ichnological science offers many challenges, as most traces reflect the behaviour — not the biological affinity — of their makers.   Accordingly, researchers classify trace fossils into [[form genera]], based on their appearance and on the implied behaviour, or [[ethology]], of their makers.

==Occurrence==
[[Image:MammothFootImpressions25.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-section of [[mammoth]] footprints at The Mammoth Site, [[Hot Springs, South Dakota]].]]
Traces are better known in their fossilised form than in modern sediments.&lt;ref name=Seilacher1967/&gt;  This makes it difficult to interpret some fossils by comparing them with modern traces, even though they may be extant or even common.&lt;ref name=Seilacher1967/&gt;  The main difficulties in accessing extant burrows stem from finding them in consolidated sediment, and being able to access those formed in deeper water.

Trace fossils are best preserved in sandstones;&lt;ref name=Seilacher1967/&gt; the grain size and depositional facies both contributing to the better preservation.  They may also be found in shales and limestones.&lt;ref name=Seilacher1967/&gt;

==Classification==
{{main|Trace fossil classification}}
Trace fossils are generally difficult or impossible to assign to a specific maker. Only in very rare occasions are the makers found in association with their tracks.  Further, entirely different organisms may produce identical tracks.  Therefore, conventional taxonomy is not applicable, and a comprehensive form of taxonomy has been erected.  At the highest level of the classification, five behavioral modes are recognized:&lt;ref name=Seilacher1967&gt;{{cite journal

* '''Cubichnia''', resting traces, in the form of an impression left by an organism on a soft sediment;
* '''Repichnia''', surface traces of creeping and crawling.

Fossils are further classified into form genera, a few of which are even subdivided to a "species" level.  Classification is based on shape, form, and implied behavioural mode.


To keep body and trace fossils nomenclatorially separate, ''ichnospecies'' are erected for trace fossils. [[Ichnotaxa]] are classified somewhat differently in [[zoological nomenclature]] than taxa based on body fossils (see [[trace fossil classification]] for more information). Examples include:
*Late [[Cambrian]] trace fossils from intertidal settings include ''[[Protichnites]]'' and ''[[Climactichnites]]'', amongst others
*[[Mesozoic]] dinosaur footprints including ichnogenera such as ''[[Grallator]]'', ''[[Atreipus]]'' and ''[[Anomoepus]]''
*[[Triassic]] to [[Holocene|Recent]] termite mounds, which can encompass several square kilometers of sediment

=== Paleoecology ===
Trace fossils provide us with indirect evidence of [[prehistoric life|life in the past]], such as the footprints, tracks, burrows, borings, and feces left behind by animals, rather than the preserved remains of the body of the actual animal itself. Unlike most other fossils, which are produced only after the death of the organism concerned, trace fossils provide us with a record of the activity of an organism during its lifetime.

Trace fossils are formed by organisms performing the functions of their everyday life, such as walking, crawling, burrowing, boring, or feeding. [[Tetrapod]] footprints, [[worm]] trails and the burrows made by [[clam]]s and [[arthropods]] are all trace fossils.

Perhaps the most spectacular trace fossils are the huge, three-toed footprints produced by [[dinosaur]]s and related [[archosaur]]s. These imprints give scientists clues as to how these animals lived. Although the skeletons of dinosaurs can be reconstructed, only their [[fossilized]] footprints can determine exactly how they stood and walked. Such tracks can tell much about the gait of the animal which made them, what its stride was, and whether or not the front limbs touched the ground.

However, most trace fossils are rather less conspicuous, such as the trails made by [[segmented worm]]s or [[nematode]]s. Some of these [[worm]] castings are the only fossil record we have of these soft-bodied creatures.

=== Paleoenvironment ===
[[Image:Eubrontes01.JPG|thumb|''Eubrontes'', a [[dinosaur]] footprint in the Lower [[Jurassic]] [[Moenave Formation]] at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah.]]
Fossil footprints made by tetrapod [[vertebrate]]s are difficult to identify to a particular species of animal, but they can provide valuable information such as the speed, weight, and behavior of the organism that made them. Such trace fossils are formed when [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[mammal]]s or [[bird]]s walked across soft (probably wet) mud or sand which later hardened sufficiently to retain the impressions before the next layer of sediment was deposited.  Some fossils can even provide details of how wet the sand was when they were being produced, and hence allow estimation of paleo-wind directions.&lt;ref name=Trewin1995&gt;{{cite journal

Assemblages of trace fossils occur at certain water depths,&lt;ref name=Seilacher1967 /&gt; and can also reflect the salinity and turbidity of the water column.

=== Stratigraphic correlation ===
Some trace fossils can be used as local [[index fossil]]s, to date the rocks in which they are found, such as the burrow ''[[Arenicolites]] franconicus'' which occurs only in a 4&amp;nbsp;cm (1.6") layer of the [[Triassic]] Muschelkalk epoch, throughout wide areas in southern [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Schlirf2006&gt;{{cite journal

Surface trails on sediment in shallow marine environments stand less chance of fossilization because they are subjected to wave and current action. Conditions in quiet, deep-water environments tend to be more favorable for preserving fine trace structures.

Most trace fossils are usually readily identified by reference to similar phenomena in modern environments. However, the structures made by organisms in recent sediment have only been studied in a limited range of environments, mostly in coastal areas, including [[tidal flat]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Trace fossils are a particularly significant source of data from this period because they represent a data source that is not directly connected to the presence of easily fossilized hard parts, which are rare during the Cambrian. Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is difficult, the trace fossil record seems to indicate that at the very least, large, bottom-dwelling, [[Symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetrical]] organisms were rapidly diversifying during the early Cambrian.&lt;ref&gt;Although some [[cnidaria]]ns are effective burrowers, e.g. {{cite journal

* ''[[Asteriacites]]'' is the name given to the five-rayed fossils found in rocks and they record the resting place of [[starfish]] on the sea floor. ''Asteriacites'' are found in European and American rocks, from the [[Ordovician]] period onwards, and are numerous in rocks from the [[Jurassic]] period of [[Germany]].
* ''[[Burrinjuckia]]'' is a bioclaustration. ''Burrinjuckia '' includes outgrowths of the [[brachiopod]]'s secondary shell with a hollow interior in the mantle cavity of a brachiopod. 
* ''[[Chondrites (genus)|Chondrites]]'' (not to be confused with stony meteorites of the same name) are small branching burrows of the same diameter, which superficially resemble the roots of a plant. The most likely candidate for having constructed these burrows is a [[nematode]] (roundworm). ''Chondrites'' are found in marine sediments from the [[Cambrian]] period of the [[Paleozoic]] onwards. They are especially common in sediments which were deposited in reduced-oxygen environments.
* ''[[Climactichnites]]'' is the name given to surface trails and burrows that consist of a series of chevron-shaped raised cross bars that are usually flanked on either side by a parallel ridge. They somewhat resemble tire tracks, and are larger (typically about four inches wide) than most of the other trace fossils made by [[invertebrates]]. The trails were produced on sandy tidal flats during [[Cambrian]] time. While the identity of the animal is still conjectural, it may have been a large [[slug]]-like animal - its trails produced as it crawled over and processed the wet sand to obtain food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Getty|first=Patrick|author2=James Hagadorn |title=Palaeobiology of the ''Climactichnites'' trailmaker|journal=Palaeontology|year=2009|volume=52|issue=4|pages=758–778|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2009.00875.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Getty|first=Patrick|author2=James Hagadorn |title=Reinterpretation of ''Climactichnites'' Logan 1860 to Include Subsurface Burrows, and Erection of ''Musculopodus'' for Resting Traces of the Trailmaker|journal=Journal of Paleontology|year=2008|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1161–1172|doi=10.1666/08-004.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Cruziana]]'' are excavation trace marks made on the sea floor which have a two-lobed structure with a central groove. The lobes are covered with scratch marks made by the legs of the excavating organism, usually a [[trilobite]] or allied arthropod. ''Cruziana'' are most common in marine sediments formed during the [[Paleozoic]] era, particularly in rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Ordovician]] periods. Over 30 ichnospecies of ''Cruziana'' have been identified. See also [[Isopodichnus]].
* ''[[Entobia]]'' is a boring produced by endolithic clionaid [[sponges]] consisting of galleries excavated in a carbonate substrate; often has swollen chambers with connecting canals.
* ''[[Gastrochaenolites]]'' are clavate (club-shaped) borings also produced in calcareous hard substrates, usually by [[bivalve]]s.
* ''[[Oikobesalon]]'' is an unbranched, elongate burrow with single-entrance and circular cross-section produced by terebellid polychaetes. They are covered with thin lining which has a transverse ornamentation in the form of fusiform annulation.
* ''[[Petroxestes]]'' is a shallow groove boring produced by mytilacean bivalves in carbonate hard substrates.
* ''[[Protichnites]]'' consists of two rows of tracks and a linear depression between the two rows. The tracks are believed to have been made by the walking appendages of [[arthropod]]s. The linear depression is thought to be the result of a dragging tail. The structures bearing this name were typically made on the tidal flats of [[Paleozoic]] seas, but similar ones extend into the [[Cenozoic]].
* ''[[Rhizocorallium]]'' is a type of [[burrow]], the inclination of which is typically within 10° of the bedding planes of the sediment. These burrows can be very large, over a meter long in sediments that show good preservation, e.g. [[Jurassic]] rocks of the [[Yorkshire]] Coast (eastern [[United Kingdom]]), but the width is usually only up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm, restricted by the size of the organisms producing it. It is thought that they represent fodinichnia as the animal (probably a [[nematode]]) scoured the [[sediment]] for food.
* ''[[Rogerella]]'' is a small pouch-shaped boring with a slit-like aperture currently produced by [[acrothoracica]]n [[barnacles]].
* ''[[Rusophycus]]'' are bilobed "resting traces" associated with trilobites and other arthropods such as horseshoe crabs.
* ''[[Skolithos]]'': One well-known occurrence of Cambrian  trace fossils from this period is the famous '[[Pipe Rock]]' of northwest [[Scotland]]. The 'pipes' that give the rock its name are closely packed straight tubes- which were presumably made by some kind of [[worm]]-like organism. The name given to this type of tube or burrow is ''Skolithos'', which may be 30&amp;nbsp;cm (12") in length and between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;cm (0.8 to 1.6") in diameter. Such traces are known worldwide from sands and [[sandstone]]s deposited in shallow water environments, from the [[Cambrian]] period (542&amp;ndash;488 [[annum|Ma]]) onwards.
* ''[[Thalassinoides]]'' are burrows which occur parallel to the bedding plane of the rock and are extremely abundant in rocks, worldwide, from the [[Jurassic]] period onwards. They are repeatedly branched, with a slight swelling present at the junctions of the tubes. The burrows are cylindrical and vary from 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm (0.8" to 2") in diameter. ''Thalassinoides'' sometimes contain scratch marks, droppings or the bodily remains of the [[crustacean]]s which made them.
* ''[[Teichichnus]]'' has a distinctive form produced by the stacking of thin 'tongues' of [[sediment]], atop one another. They are again believed to be fodinichnia, with the organism adopting the habit of retracing the same route through varying heights of the sediment, which would allow it to avoid going over the same area. These 'tongues' are often quite sinuous, reflecting perhaps a more nutrient-poor environment in which the feeding animals had to cover a greater area of sediment, in order to acquire sufficient nourishment.
* ''[[Tremichnus]]'' is an embedment structure (i.e. [[bioclaustration]]) formed by an organism that inhibited growth of the crinoid host stereom.
* ''[[Trypanites]]'' are elongated cylindrical [[bioerosion|boring]]s in calcareous substrates such as shells, carbonate [[hardground]]s and [[limestones]]. Usually produced by worms of various types and [[sipunculids]].

==Other notable trace fossils==
Less ambiguous than the above ichnogenera, are the traces left behind by [[invertebrate]]s such as ''[[Hibbertopterus]]'', a giant "sea scorpion" or [[eurypterid]] of the early [[Paleozoic]] era. This marine [[arthropod]] produced a spectacular hibbertopteroid track preserved in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whyte, MA |year=2005 |title=Palaeoecology: A gigantic fossil arthropod trackway |journal=Nature|volume=438|pages=576 |doi=10.1038/438576a|pmid=16319874|issue=7068|bibcode = 2005Natur.438..576W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bioerosion]] through time has produced a magnificent record of borings, gnawings, scratchings and scrapings on hard substrates. These trace fossils are usually divided into macroborings&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, M.A., 2007. Macroborings and the evolution of bioerosion, p. 356-367. In: Miller, W.

The oldest types of [[tetrapod]] tail-and-foot prints date back to the latter [[Devonian]] period. These [[vertebrate]] impressions have been found in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Australia]].

Important [[human evolution|human]] trace fossils are the [[Laetoli]] ([[Tanzania]]) footprints, imprinted in volcanic ash 3.7 [[annum|Ma]] (million years ago) -- probably by an early [[Australopithecus]].&lt;ref name=RaichlenEtal1010&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2010 |author=David A.

== Confusion with other types of fossils ==
[[Image:AsteriacitesDevonianOhio.jpg|thumb|''[[Asteriacites]]'' (sea star trace fossil) from the [[Devonian]] of northeastern Ohio. It appears at first to be an external mold of the body, but the sediment piled between the rays shows that it is a burrow.]]
Trace fossils are not body casts. The [[Ediacara biota]], for instance, primarily comprises the casts of organisms in sediment. Similarly, a footprint is not a simple replica of the sole of the foot, and the resting trace of a seastar has different details than an impression of a seastar.

Early paleobotanists misidentified a wide variety of structures they found on the bedding planes of [[sedimentary rocks]] as fucoids ([[Fucales]], a kind of [[brown algae]] or [[seaweed]]). However, even during the earliest decades of the study of ichnology, some fossils were recognized as animal footprints and burrows. Studies in the 1880s by [[A. G. Nathorst]] and [[Joseph F. James]] comparing 'fucoids' to modern traces made it increasingly clear that most of the specimens identified as fossil fucoids were animal trails and burrows. True fossil fucoids are quite rare.

[[Pseudofossil]]s, which are ''not'' true fossils, should also not be confused with ichnofossils, which are true indications of prehistoric life.

# [[Problematization]] - the definition of the nature of the problem in a specific situation by an actor (a group or an individual) and the consequential establishment of dependency
# [[Interessement]] - "locking" other actors into the roles that were proposed for them in the actor's &lt;!--approach/--&gt;programme for resolving that problem
# [[Enrolment (sociology)|Enrolment]] - the definition and interrelation of the roles that were allocated to other actors in the previous step
# [[Mobilization (translation)|Mobilization]] - ensuring that supposed spokespersons for relevant collective entities are properly representative of all members of the network that are acting as a single agent.

==History and culture==

===Etymology and usage===
The term ''tribadism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word τριβάς (''tribas''), meaning "a woman who practices unnatural vice with herself or with other women",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtriba%2Fs τριβάς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the verb τρίβω (''tribō''), "rub".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtri%2Fbw τρίβω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greek and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], a tribas, or tribade (IPA:{{IPA|/ˈtrɪbəd/ /tribad/}}),&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; was a woman or [[intersex]] individual who actively penetrated another person (male or female) through use of the [[clitoris]] or a [[dildo]]. The term ''tribade'' did not begin to refer exclusively to eroticism between women until [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt; Because penetration was viewed as "male-defined" sexuality, a tribas was considered the most vulgar lesbian.&lt;ref name="Penner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Rictor Norton]] |title=A Critique of Social Constructionism and Postmodern Queer Theory, "The 'Sodomite' and the 'Lesbian' |publisher=infopt.demon.co.uk |date=July 12, 2002 |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |url=http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social22.htm |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215084530/http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social22.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sihvola, Juha |author2=Nussbaum, Martha Craven |title=The sleep of reason: erotic experience and sexual ethics in ancient Greece and Rome |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-60915-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks and Romans recognized same-sex attraction, but as any sexual act was believed to require that one of the partners be "[[Phallus|phallic]]" and that therefore sexual activity between women was impossible without this feature, mythology popularly associated lesbians with either having enlarged clitorises or as incapable of enjoying sexual activity without the substitution of a phallus.&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld"&gt;{{cite book|title =Looking at gay and lesbian life|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1993|page=93|isbn=0-8070-7923-5|accessdate=February 19, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WuJYskiyjEoC&amp;pg=PA93|author=Warren J.

In English texts, ''tribade'' is recorded as early as 1601, in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Praeludium'' (Poem X in ''The Forest''),&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; to as late as the mid-nineteenth century; it was the most common lesbian term in European texts,&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt; through the proliferation of classical literature, anatomies, midwiferies, sexual advice manuals, and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; It also came to refer to lesbian sexual practices in general, though anatomical investigation in the mid-eighteenth century led to skepticism about stories of enlarged clitorises and anatomists and doctors argued for a more precise distinction between clitoral [[hypertrophy]] and [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;

Author Bonnie Zimmerman stated, "More often, however, [European] writers avoided the term, instead euphemistically invoking 'unnatural vice,' 'lewd behavior,' 'crimes against nature,' 'using an instrument,' and 'taking the part of a man.'{{-"}}&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; In the eighteenth century, where the term saw one of its most popular uses, it was employed in several pornographic [[Defamation|libels]] against [[Marie Antoinette]], who was "tried and roundly convicted in the press" as being a tribade.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; "[Her] rumored tribadism had historically specific political implications," stated author Dena Goodman. "Consider her final (fictive) testimony in ''The Confession of Marie-Antoinette'': 'People!' she protests, 'because I ceded to the sweet impressions of nature, and in imitating the charming weakness of all the women of the court of France, I surrendered to the sweet impulsion of love...you hold me, as it were, captive within your walls?'" Goodman elaborated that in one libel, Marie-Antoinette is described as generously providing details of her husband's "incapacity in the venereal act" and that her lust resulted in her taking an aristocratic beauty [[Yolande de Polastron]], the Duchess of Polignac (1749-1793), "into [her] service" and later specifying that what makes sex with a woman so appealing is "Adroit in the art of stimulating the clitoris"; Marie-Antoinette is described as having stated that La Polignac's attentions produced "one of those rare pleasures that cannot be used up because it can be repeated as many times as one likes".&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

By the time the [[Victorian era]] arrived, cited Zimmerman, "tribadism tended to be constructed as a lower class and non-Western phenomenon and often was associated with the supposed degeneration of prostitutes and criminals".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; By the twentieth century, "''tribade'' had been supplanted" by the terms ''[[sappho|sapphist]]'', ''lesbian'', ''invert'', and ''homosexual'', as ''tribade'' had become too archaic to use.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; ''Fricatrice'', a synonym for ''tribade'' that also refers to rubbing but has a Latin rather than a Greek root, appeared in English texts as early as 1605 (in Ben Jonson's ''[[Volpone]]'').&lt;ref name="Andreadis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andreadis |first=Harriette |title=Sappho in Early Modern England: Female Same-Sex Literary Erotics, 1550–1714|publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |pages=41, 49–51|isbn=0-226-02009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage suggests that it was more colloquial and more [[pejorative]] than ''tribade''.&lt;ref name="Andreadis"/&gt; Variants include the Latinized ''confricatrice'' and English ''rubster''.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andreadis"/&gt;

In addition to the scissoring position, which involves the partners interlocking their legs in a position similar to the shape of scissors and pressing their vulvas together, tribadism may involve a [[missionary position]], a [[Woman on top (sex position)|woman on top]] position, a [[doggy style]] position or others,&lt;ref name="Hite, Tribadism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schell"/&gt; or simple movement of the woman's vulva against her partner's thigh, stomach, buttocks, arm, or another body part.&lt;ref name="Belge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"&gt;{{cite book | title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | page = 239 | accessdate = November 4, 2012 |isbn = 0495812943| url = https://books.google.com/?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&amp;pg=PA239|quote=Rubbing genitals together or against other parts of a partner's body can be included in any couple's sexual interaction and is common in lesbian lovemaking... ...Many lesbians like [tribadism] because it involves all-over body contact and a generalized sensuality.

Some lesbian and bisexual women do not engage in the scissoring position, because they find it physically uncomfortable, feel that it is not representative of [[lesbian sexual practices]] and is more attributable to the male fantasies of the heterosexual [[Sex industry|porn industry]], or because they otherwise have not included it as part of their sex lives.&lt;ref name="thefrisky.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Dowling|title=Girl On Girl: 11 Misconceptions About Lesbians|date=December 4, 2009|accessdate=December 29, 2010|publisher=TheFrisky.com|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-12-04/girl-on-girl-11-misconceptions-about-lesbians/ |work=[[The Frisky (website)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afterellen.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mia|last=Jones|title=All lesbians are good at sports, and other misconceptions|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=December 29, 2010|publisher=[[AfterEllen.com and TheBacklot.com|AfterEllen.com]]|url=http://www.afterellen.com/all-lesbians-are-good-at-sports-and-other-misconceptions/12/2009/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite web|first=Amanda|last=Hess|title=Lesbians Don't Scissor Edition|date=November 24, 2009|accessdate=December 29, 2010|publisher=[[Washington City Paper]]|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2009/11/24/university-sex-columns-reviewed-lesbians-dont-scissor-edition/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parello"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jennifer|last=Parello|title=Scissor Sex|date=July 28, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2013|publisher=''[[Lavender (magazine)|Lavender]]''|url=http://www.lavendermagazine.com/our-lives/scissor-sex/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Raw Story]]'' states, "Whether [the scissoring position] describes a traditional or even common lesbian act remains up for debate."&lt;ref name="Carpentier"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sarah Silverman offers to ‘scissor' Sheldon Adelson for Obama|publisher=''[[The Raw Story]]''|date= July 16, 2012|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/07/16/sarah-silverman-offers-to-scissor-sheldon-adelson-for-obama/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources, however, such as [[Shere Hite]]'s 1976 and 1981 research, show that women may enjoy performing the scissoring position with other women because it is a variation of vulva-to-vulva contact or can allow for maximum vulva-to-vulva contact and therefore an elevated level of intimacy.&lt;ref name="Hite, Tribadism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schell"/&gt;

Garnets |isbn = 978-1-4051-0080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Halberstam]], in her book ''Female Masculinity'', stated, "If we trace the use of the term forward into present, we find that tribadism is one of those rarely discussed but often practiced sexual activities, and the silence that surrounds it now is as puzzling as the discourse it produced in earlier centuries." She added that [[Sigmund Freud]] "had nothing to say" with regard to the topic, "and few contemporary lesbian sex books even discuss it".&lt;ref name="Halberstam"/&gt;

According to older studies, "approximately one-third of lesbian women used tribadism, or body contact, as a means of achieving orgasm (Saghir &amp; Robins, 1973; Jay &amp; Young, 1977)".&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt; [[Masters and Johnson]]'s 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices found that vaginal penetration with dildos is rare, and that lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) "was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado" and "[w]hen asked what techniques they used in their last 10 lovemaking sessions, 100% were for kissing, sucking on nipples, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported tribadism".&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the [[United Kingdom]] of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 women who have sex with women from a community sample; the study reported that 85% of the women engaged in tribadism (whether genital-to-genital contact or rubbing genitals against another part of a partner's body), and, like older studies, that vaginal penetration with dildos, or with other sex toys, among women who have sex with women is rare.&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual behaviour of lesbians and bisexual women|author1=J V Bailey |author2=C Farquhar |author3=C Owen |author4=D Whittaker |journal=[[Sexually Transmitted Infections (journal)|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]|volume=79|issue=2|date=April 2003|pmid=12690139|doi=10.1136/sti.79.2.147|pages=147–150|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1744617/pdf/v079p00147.pdf|pmc=1744617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safe sex====
As with any exchange of [[body fluid]]s during sexual activities, genital-to-genital tribadism has the potential to transfer [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs) if those are present in one or more of the partners. [[AIDS.gov]] and the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] state that genital-genital and genital-body contact (including tribadism) can spread STIs such as [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]], [[Crab louse|pubic lice]] (crabs) and [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] and that "wearing clothes and for herpes, avoiding contact if sores are present, reduces the risks".&lt;ref name="aids.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Risk Factors|publisher=[[AIDS.gov]]|accessdate=June 8, 2012|url=http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/sexual-risk-factors/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Publichealth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexually Transmitted Disease Program – Resources for Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Women

===Popular culture and other media===
Tribadism has been referenced in various aspects of popular culture. The [[glam rock|glam]] [[Pop music|pop]] band [[Scissor Sisters]] derived their name from the scissoring position.&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Scissor Sisters: On the Cutting Edge |first=Richard |last=Harrington |periodical=[[Washington Post]] |date=January 7, 2005 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53256-2005Jan6.html |accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannaford, Alex (2005).

Genital-genital tribadism was depicted three times during the "[[D-Yikes!]]" episode of the cartoon ''[[South Park]]'', referred to in the episode as ''scissoring''. The episode is credited with having brought more recognition to the act of scissoring,&lt;ref name=thefrisky.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt; with ''[[The Raw Story]]'' stating, "Though the band 'Scissor Sisters' takes its name from descriptions of the act, it wasn't until scissoring was dramatized in the 2007 'South Park' episode 'D-Yikes' that it achieved wide recognition in mainstream culture."&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt; The term additionally received mainstream recognition after the episode "[[Duets (Glee)|Duets]]" of the television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' had characters [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce|Brittany S.

The scene received some criticism for possibly being inappropriate for children.&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/10/13/glee-watch-it-takes-two/|title=Glee Watch: It Takes Two|last=Poniewozik|first=James|date=October 13, 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2010/10/glee-cheerleaders-share-sweet-lady-kisses/1|title='Glee' cheerleaders share 'sweet lady kisses'|last=Oldenburg|first=Ann|date=October 13, 2010|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in response to [[California State University, Long Beach]] refusing to advertise the play "The Night of the Tribades" on the Seventh Street marquee because of the word ''tribades'' in its title, approximately 24 theater arts majors protested in front of Brotman Hall by simulating tribadism (including scissoring). "When you put tribade into a Google search image, apparently it comes up with the word tribadism, which is a sex act and they decided it was inappropriate," stated one student.&lt;ref name="Rivera"/&gt;

Tribadism and other lesbian sex scenes are featured in the 2013 film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]].'' The scenes were the subject of debate among lesbians and critics, with the depiction of scissoring being one of the acts that were criticized; in an interview surveying a small panel of lesbian women, one of the women, who was skeptical that lesbian sexual activity included scissoring at all, seemed more open to the idea of a [[Woman on top#Reverse cowgirl position|reverse cowgirl position]] of scissoring; another woman had engaged in the reverse cowgirl position of scissoring.&lt;ref name="Saraiya"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sonia|last=Saraiya|title=Lesbians have some thoughts about the sex scenes in Blue Is The Warmest Color |date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=December 1, 2013|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Among female bonobos==
Female-female genital sex is not exclusive to humans. Females of the [[bonobo]] species, found in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], also engage in this act, usually referred to by [[Primatology|primatologists]] as ''GG rubbing'' (genital-to-genital).&lt;ref name="songweaver"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Waal|first=Frans|authorlink=Frans de Waal|title=Bonobo sex and society|publisher=''[[Scientific American]]''|volume=272 |issue=3 |pages=82–8 |date=Mar 1995 |pmid=7871411 |url=http://songweaver.com/info/bonobos.html|format=reprint|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0395-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paoli T, Palagi E, Tacconi G, Tarli SB |title=Perineal swelling, intermenstrual cycle, and female sexual behavior in bonobos (Pan paniscus) |journal=Am J Primatol |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=333–47 |date=Apr 2006 |pmid=16534808 |doi=10.1002/ajp.20228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps the bonobo's most typical sexual pattern, undocumented in any other primate, is genito-genital rubbing (or GG rubbing) between adult females," stated primatologist [[Frans de Waal]]. "One female facing another clings with arms and legs to a partner that, standing on both hands and feet, lifts her off the ground."&lt;ref name="songweaver"/&gt;

'''Urban social geography''' is a sub-field within [[human geography]], looking at the factors within an urban environment that affect human relationships on social, economic and political levels. Those human relationships then feed back into the factors which then shape dynamics of the actual city itself. With numerous inputs and outputs, this study is a constantly evolving field.

Cities are more than just a dot on the map or a set of buildings. [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], a Greek poet, wrote about cities "not the house finely  roofed or the stones of walls well builded, nay, nor canals, and dockyards make the city, but men able to use their opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;Pahl, R. E. (2013). "A perspective on urban sociology". ''Readings in Urban Sociology: Readings in Sociology'', '''3'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities have also been described as prisms in which one can see the social, economic, and geographical characteristics from which they evolved. Urban centers not only have  a disproportionate percentage of the population, but also have a large amount of fixed assets, capital, labor resources, and productive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, L. S., &amp; Ley, D. F. (1993). ''Changing social geography of Canadian cities'' (Vol. 2). McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==
;Social dynamics
:The confines of a city often force various social and ethnic groups to live within close proximity of one another. [[Society|Societies]] are defined as a  collective sense of individuals and the relationships they form.&lt;ref&gt;Del Casino Jr, V. (2009). ''Social geography: a critical introduction''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Within societies, individuals help to distinguish from one another based on social identities. Often times, these social identity differences can result in conflict or in a group attempting to separate from the rest of society. London is one of the most diverse cities in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Helena Horton, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11926139/london-passport-diversity-map.html "This map perfectly displays the diversity of London"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 12 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; where a single street can have restaurants from more than 30 countries, from a vast range of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, P., &amp; Pinch, S. (2014). ''Urban social geography: an introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a dense distribution, conflict may arise. Another prime example of this is [[Kurdistan]]. Though the Kurds do not officially have a country of their own, they govern themselves and see themselves as very different from the Turks and Iraqis that surround them. 
;Economics
:In the age of the [[Industrial Revolution]], many populations shifted from rural, agrarian based into the urban areas. Later in the twentieth century, as manufacturing started to leave urban areas, such as happened in [[Detroit]], this acted as a force of change within urban households. Prior to, a single paycheck could often support a household. After manufacturing shifts, a household often had to shift to a dual-income where both parents have to work to support the family. As an example of the effect this creates, there is then a greater demand for child care in that urban area.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, P., &amp; Pinch, S. (2014). ''Urban social geography: an introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; While some families will stick in the area and change their lifestyles to acclimate, some will choose to leave for greener pastures. As families start to leave urban areas, neighborhoods will either become abandoned or to slowly wither in terms of economic status. This changing of the economy often results in a rise in crime and in deterioration of the physical neighborhoods. As those property values decline, eventually this leads to [[gentrification]] where individuals from outside the urban area will move in and fix up the neighborhood. This process will then force property values up and possibly force longstanding residents to move on. 
;Conflict
:In the relative close confines of a city, differences resulting from political, social, and economic differences can result in conflict amongst competing groups. Conflicts in urban areas are intensified because they are often such an extreme intersection of conflicting ideologies. With the close confines of urban areas, conflicts here often result in the greatest number of fatalities and amounts of property destruction, population displacement, and as a result stress on emergency infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Garba, S. B. (2016). "Population Growth, Governance and Urban Social Conflicts in Africa" in ''Population Growth and Rapid Urbanization in the Developing World'', 210-230.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime examples of these conflicts have been seen recently in [[South Africa]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Burundi]]. 
;Social media
:In the advent of the [[social media]] age, there has been a tremendous effect on the way which people interact with one another and the choices they make in their daily lives. Traditions depend on culture, however very often individuals will enter into relationships with those who may be within their neighborhood or those whom cross their paths during their daily routine. The advent of social media has changed that dynamic. No longer are individuals limited to relationships with those in their immediate surroundings. Very often, now, individuals are meeting across long distances via social media. When a relationship progresses, these individuals can choose to live with one another. Thus a person from a different culture, and how has different experiences is injected into a new urban environment. Thus feeding into the changing dynamics of the area. Social media is also used as a means to study the activity patterns of urban dwellers. The immense amount of geo-location available, from social media applications, has opened up a whole new method of study. People's geolocation data is helping to feed the study of the activity choices, and to offer insight into how groups of certain types choose particular neighborhoods that fit their interests. Behavioral analysis has opened up ways to hook into lifestyle patterns and their interconnections within transportation science, travel patterns, workplace location choice, restaurant choice, retail establishment type, vehicle ownership, and income levels.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, S., &amp; Ukkusuri, S. V. (2015). "Location contexts of user check-ins to model urban geo life-style patterns". ''PLoS ONE'', '''10'''(5), e0124819.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3857">A variable-speed drive (VSD) [[air compressor]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quincycompressor.com/qgv.html Variable Speed Drive Compressor]&lt;/ref&gt; is an air compressor that takes advantage of [[variable-speed drive]] technology.  This type of compressor uses a special drive to control the speed (RPM) of the unit, which in turn saves energy compared to a fixed speed equivalent.

The most common form of VSD technology in the air compressor industry is a [[variable-frequency drive]], which converts the incoming [[Alternating current|AC]] power to [[Direct current|DC]] and then back to a quasi-sinusoidal AC power using an inverter switching circuit.  The [[variable-frequency drive]] article provides additional information on electronic speed controls used with various types of AC motors.

==Benefits==
The benefits of this technology included reducing power cost, reducing power surges (from starting AC motors), and delivering a more constant pressure.  The down side of this technology is the heavy expense associated with the drive, and the sensitivity of these drives – specifically to heat and moisture.

==Industry==
Typically a fifth of a factory's electricity bill is attributed to the production of compressed air.  The majority of modern factories are heavily involved in cutting costs, and energy awareness should be a key concern.  For example, 10–12% of all power generated in the UK is dedicated to the production of compressed air, and a portion of this power is wasted energy.

Large electrical cost savings can be achieved by installing a variable speed drive compressor in place of an existing rotary screw or piston machine. Because of this, many governments, including the US and UK, are pushing the industries to move towards this technology in hopes of reducing wasted energy.  Governments offer various incentives, such as tax rebates or interest free loans, to cover the upgrades.

However, variable speed drive compressors are not necessarily appropriate for all industrial applications.  If a variable speed drive compressor operates continuously at full speed, the switching losses of the frequency converter result in a lower energy efficiency than an otherwise identically sized fixed speed compressor.  Where demand remains constant within 5–15% of the total free air delivery flow rate, dual-control compressors configured in a split solution can provide higher efficiency than a VFD.

A professional air audit is the best way to identify if a VFD compressor is most appropriate for any given compressed air application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cascousa.com/our-services/air-system-engineering/ Air Audit]&lt;/ref&gt; These audits are available from various companies that specialize in the implementation of compressed air equipment, which can determine the most efficient controls for a compressed air system – including variable speed, variable capacity or using storage and flow controllers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ace-group.eu/places-might-find-compressor/ Industrial Air Compressor]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?''''' &lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, MI, US/Cambridge, UK, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by biblical scholar and archaeologist [[William G. Dever]] detailing his response to the claims of [[biblical minimalism|minimalists]] to the historicity and value of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

== Summary ==

Dever's book is a response to recent trends in biblical scholarship and [[biblical archaeology]] which question whether the bible can be used as a reliable tool for interpreting history.

The book begins with Dever's explanation of the "minimalist" position, which holds that the bible is a product of the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian]] or even [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic periods]], composed at the very earliest after c. 500 BC, and therefore unreliable as a record of earlier periods. The minimalists do not deny that the biblical books are based on genuinely old material, but they view the task of extracting that material from layers of revision and accretion is virtually unachievable. At the other extreme are the "maximalists" who take the bible at, or almost entirely at, face value. In his first two chapters Dever reviews and rejects both minimalism and maximalism. Dever nevertheless evidently regards the minimalist position as more dangerous than the maximalist, because it tends to eliminate altogether any study of [[First Temple (Judaism)|ancient Israel prior to the Persian period]].

Dever then turns to Syrio-Palestinian archaeology, as the former discipline of [[biblical archaeology]] is now known, and reviews material discoveries to demonstrate that they can in fact be linked to the biblical narrative. The central chapters therefore offer a detailed discussion of the major archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century and relate them to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] (Joshua-2 Kings), "correlat[ing] text and artifact to demonstrate that significant material in the narrative plausibly derives from [[Iron Age]] II (ca. 1000-600 BCE) and not from later periods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[Review |author=John Barclay Brown |journal=[[Biblical Theology Bulletin]]|date=May 2002 |volume=32 |pages=107–108 |doi=10.1177/014610790203200210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dever makes clear that he positions himself in the middle ground between minimalists such as [[Thomas L. Thompson]] (with whom Dever has had a long running and acrimonious public dispute) on the one hand, and maximalists on the other. "While the Hebrew Bible in its present, heavily edited form cannot be taken at face value as history in the modern sense, it nevertheless ''contains'' much history." For Dever, this historical core is concentrated in the period from [[David]] onwards; the [[Torah]] and the period of the [[conquest of Canaan]] he regards as essentially mythical. The final chapter sums up the argument of the book, stating that there was an [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|ancient Israel]], that the bible was written from a genuine historical core, and that archaeology can identify this core and prevent Israel from being "written out of history".&lt;ref name="Dever2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=William G. Dever|title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC&amp;pg=PA298|date=10 May 2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and reviews ==

The book received mixed reviews. Conservative scholars commended Dever for his critique on minimalism but were disappointed by his failure to defend the historicity of the bible prior to the age of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. Others chided his inability to distance himself from his obsessions: 
{{quote|"[Dever's] agendas are that (a) a coordinated team of 'minimalists'/'revisionist' biblical historians are conspiring to deny the existence of ancient Israel (and even of historical 'facts' at all!); (b) Dever has been, and remains, the guardian of truth in matters archaeological; and (c) archaeology can confirm the reliability of Biblical history. The first two of these issues obscure the central thesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0882-8539| volume = 21| issue = 1| pages = 158–160| last = Davies| first = Philip R.| title = What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It? What Archaeology Can Tell Us about the Reality of Ancient Israel [review]| journal = Shofar| date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The archaeological journals were frequently the most scathing, noting his dismissal of contrary evidence without argument and his failure to engage with detail as against wider cultural context: 
{{quote|"If Dever’s attempts to link narrative biblical history and archaeology represent mainstream thinking (as he claims), then the field is indeed in deep trouble. It is the kind of blind acceptance of traditional (unsubstantiated) 'synchronisms' espoused by Dever that has provided the very fuel for the minimalists’ criticisms. In short, Dever may prove to be his own worst enemy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centuries.co.uk/dever-review.pdf Review by Peter James, ''Palestine Exploration Quarterly'', 134, 2 (2002)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
