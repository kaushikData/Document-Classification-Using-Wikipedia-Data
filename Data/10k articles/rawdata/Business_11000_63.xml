'''1095 Avenue Of The Americas''' is a 630&amp;nbsp;ft (192m) tall [[skyscraper]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was constructed from 1972 to 1974 as headquarters of [[New York Telephone]] and has 41 floors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115496/1095-avenue-of-the-americas-new-york-city-ny-usa]&lt;/ref&gt; The building also served as the headquarters of [[NYNEX]] and [[Bell Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010106220900/http://www.bell-atl.com/about/about_mail.htm Mail Us]." [[Bell Atlantic]]. January 6, 2010. Retrieved on April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kahn &amp; Jacobs]] designed the building, which is the 61st tallest in New York. The original facade was said to be designed to resemble the relays which were commonly found inside telephones of the time. From 2006 to 2007, the tower received a $260 million renovation which upgraded the office space from Class B+ to [[Class A office space]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115496/1095-avenue-of-the-americas-new-york-city-ny-usa]&lt;/ref&gt; The phone company moved its headquarters to the [[Verizon Building]] in the early 2000s, and sold off most of the building, retaining a condominium interest in floors 6-12, where Verizon maintained offices and a [[telephone exchange]] serving landlines in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. However, in 2013, the company moved its corporate headquarters back to 1095 Avenue of the Americas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130912/REAL_ESTATE/130919953|title=Storm-soaked Verizon decamps from downtown|author=Geiger, Daniel|publisher=Crain's New York Business|date=12 September 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a sale of the upper floors of the Verizon Building.

In addition to Verizon, other major tenants as of late 2008 include insurance giant [[MetLife]] (whose name is outside above the entryway), law firm [[Dechert]] LLP, iStar Financial, [[Lloyds Banking Group]], [[Instinet]], [[Standard Chartered]] USA, and [[Stifel]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stifel.com/branch/ny|title=Stifel {{!}} New York - Branch|last=Stifel|website=www.stifel.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard Chartered US Locations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Chartered US Locations|url=https://www.sc.com/us/locations/en/|publisher=Standard Chartered}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Whole Foods Market]] finalized a deal to open a 32,000 square foot supermarket spread across the first and second floors of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://therealdeal.com/2013/12/17/whole-foods-inks-deal-for-bryant-park-location/ Whole Foods inks deal for Bryant Park location]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pandora (jewelry)|Pandora Jewelry]], [[Tourneau]], and [[Equinox Fitness]] also operate in the base of the building. [[ASICS]] abruptly vacated its 5,000 square foot space in October 2015 amid a legal battle with the company’s retail operator, less than a year after moving in.&lt;ref&gt;[https://therealdeal.com/2016/06/02/pandora-jewelry-takes-space-in-glass-cube-at-3-bryant-park/ Pandora Jewelry takes space in glass cube at 3 Bryant Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Ivanhoé Cambridge]] and Callahan Capital Properties purchased 1095 Avenue of the Americas from [[The Blackstone Group]] for $2.2 billion, the most expensive transaction involving a single office building in New York City since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://therealdeal.com/2015/01/16/ivanhoe-cambridge-closes-on-2-2b-acquisition-of-1095-sixth/ Ivanhoe Cambridge closes on $2.2B acquisition of 1095 Sixth]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Real Summit Investment, a real estate investment subsidiary of the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]]’s Exchange Fund, paid $1.15 billion for a 49% stake in the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://therealdeal.com/2016/08/03/hong-kong-pays-1-2b-for-stake-in-1095-sixth-ave/ Hong Kong pays $1.2B for stake in 1095 Sixth Ave.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Salesforce.com]] signed a deal to rename the building Salesforce Tower and the San Francisco-based company will eventually occupy 5 floors. The first Salesforce employees in NYC to move to the new office arrived on Monday 14 November 2016. [[U.S. Bancorp]] signed a lease for 68,000 square feet in September 2016&lt;ref&gt;[https://therealdeal.com/2016/09/19/us-bank-to-take-68k-sf-at-3-bryant-park-for-new-hq/ US Bank to take 68K sf at 3 Bryant Park for new HQ]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apollo Global Management]] followed in July 2017 with a 70,000 square foot lease.&lt;ref&gt;[https://therealdeal.com/2017/07/31/apollo-subleases-metlife-space-at-3-bryant-park/ Asset manager Apollo has found a new space in Midtown]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9231">In [[materials management]], the '''ABC analysis''' (or '''Selective Inventory Control''') is an [[inventory]] categorization technique. ABC analysis divides an inventory into three categories—"A items" with very tight control and accurate records, "B items" with less tightly controlled and good records, and "C items" with the simplest controls possible and minimal records.

The ABC analysis provides a mechanism for identifying items that will have a significant impact on overall inventory cost,&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing planning and control systems for supply chain management By Thomas E. Vollmann&lt;/ref&gt; while also providing a mechanism for identifying different categories of stock that will require different management and controls.

The ABC analysis suggests that inventories of an organization are not of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;Lun, Lai, Cheng (2010) Shipping and Logistics Management, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the inventory is grouped into three categories ('''A''', '''B''', and '''C''') in order of their estimated importance.

'A' items are very important for an organization. Because of the high value of these 'A' items, frequent value analysis is required. In addition to that, an organization needs to choose an appropriate order pattern (e.g. 'just-in-time') to avoid excess capacity. 'B' items are important, but of course less important than 'A' items and more important than 'C' items. Therefore, 'B' items are intergroup items. 'C' items are marginally important.

== ABC analysis categories ==
There are no fixed threshold for each class, different proportion can be applied based on objective and criteria. ABC Analysis is similar to the [[Pareto principle]] in that the 'A' items will typically account for a large proportion of the overall value but a small percentage of the number of items.&lt;ref&gt;Purchasing and Supply Chain Management By Kenneth Lysons, Brian Farrington&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Examples of ABC class are
* {{'}}'''A'''{{'}} items – 20% of the items accounts for 70% of the annual consumption value of the items
* {{'}}'''B'''{{'}} items – 30% of the items accounts for 25% of the annual consumption value of the items
* {{'}}'''C'''{{'}} items – 50% of the items accounts for 5% of the annual consumption value of the items

Another recommended breakdown of ABC classes:&lt;ref&gt;Best Practice in Inventory Management, by Tony Wild (2nd Ed., p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

# "A" approximately 10% of items or 66.6% of value
# "B" approximately 20% of items or 23.3% of value
# "C" approximately 70% of items or 10.1% of value

==ABC analysis in ERP packages==
Major [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] packages have built-in function of ABC analysis. User can execute ABC analysis based on user defined criteria and system apply ABC code to items (parts).

==Mathematical calculation of ABC analysis==
Computed (calculated) ABC analysis delivers a precise mathematical calculation of the limits for the ABC classes.&lt;ref&gt;Ultsch, Alfred,  Jörn Lötsch. "Computed ABC analysis for rational selection of most informative variables in multivariate data." PLOS One 10.6 (2015): e0129767.&lt;/ref&gt;
It uses an optimization of cost (i.e. number of items) versus yield (i.e. sum of their estimated importance). 
Computed ABC was, for example, applied to feature selection for biomedical data,&lt;ref&gt;Kringel, D., Ultsch, A., Zimmermann, M., Jansen, J. P., Ilias, W., Freynhagen, R., ... &amp; Resch, E. (2016). Emergent biomarker derived from next-generation sequencing to identify pain patients requiring uncommonly high opioid doses. The pharmacogenomics journal.&lt;/ref&gt; business process management&lt;ref&gt;Iovanella, A.: Vital few e trivial many, Il Punto, pp 10-13,July, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bankruptcy prediction]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Pawelek, Jozef Pociecha, Mateusz Baryla,ABC Anal-ysis in Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction, Abstracts of the IFCS Conference,p 17, Tokyo,Japan,2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example of the application of weighed operation based on ABC class==
Actual distribution of ABC class in the electronics manufacturing company with 4,051 active parts.
[[File:ABC class.jpg|600px]]

{| class="wikitable" border="1" style="text-align:center"

|-
| B || 20％ ||20％
|-
| C || 60％ || 20％
|-
| Total || 100％ || 100％
|}
Using this distribution of ABC class and change total number of the parts to 14,213. 
* '''Uniform purchase'''

When equal purchasing policy is applied to all 14,213 components, for example weekly delivery and re-order point (safety stock) of two weeks' supply, the factory will have 16,000 deliveries in four weeks and average inventory will be 2½ weeks' supply.

|-
| C-class items 3,400 || Re-order point=3 weeks' supply&lt;br&gt;Delivery frequency=every 4 weeks
|}

* '''Weighed purchase'''

In comparison, when weighed purchasing policy is applied based on ABC class, for example C class monthly (every four weeks) delivery with re-order point of three weeks' supply, B class bi-weekly delivery with re-order point of 2 weeks' supply, A class weekly delivery with re-order point of 1 week's supply, total number of delivery in 4 weeks will be (A 200×4=800)+(B 400×2=800)+(C 3,400×1=3,400)=5,000 and average inventory will be (A 75%×1.5weeks)+(B 15%x3 weeks)+(C 10%×3.5 weeks)=1.925 weeks' supply.

| A || 200 || 75% || 800 || 2.5 weeks || 800 || 1.5 weeks&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; || same delivery frequency, safety stock reduced from 2.5 to 1.5 weeks&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;, require tighter control with more man-hours.
|-
| B || 400 || 15% || 1600 || 2.5 weeks || 800 || 3 weeks || increased safety stock level by 20%, delivery frequency reduced to half. Fewer man-hours required.
|-
| C || 3400 || 10% || 13,600 || 2.5 weeks || 3,400 || 3.5 weeks || increased safety stock from 2.5 to 3.5 weeks' supply, delivery frequency is one quarter. Drastically reduced man-hour requirement.
|-
| Total || 4,000 || 100% || 16,000 || 2.5 weeks || 5,000 || 1.925 weeks || average inventory value reduced by 23%, delivery frequency reduced by 69%. Overall reduction of man-hour requirement.
|}
&lt;sup&gt;a)&lt;/sup&gt; A class item can be applied much tighter control like [[Just-in-time manufacturing|JIT]] daily delivery. If daily delivery with one day stock is applied, delivery frequency will be 4,000 and average inventory level of A class item will be 1.5 days' supply and total inventory level will be 1.025 weeks' supply, a reduction of inventory by 59%. Total delivery frequency is also reduced to half from 16,000 to 8,200.
* '''Result'''
By applying weighed control based on ABC classification, required man-hours and inventory level are drastically reduced.
*Alternate way of finding ABC analysis:-
The ABC concept is based on Pareto's law.&lt;ref&gt;Pareto's law in this example is that a few high usage value items constitute a major part of the capital invested in inventories whereas a large number of items having low usage value constitute an insignificant part of the capital.&lt;/ref&gt; If too much inventory is kept, the ABC analysis can be performed on a sample. After obtaining the random sample, the following steps are carried out for the ABC analysis. 
* Step 1: Compute the annual usage value for every item in the sample by multiplying the annual requirements by the cost per unit.
* Step 2: Arrange the items in descending order of the usage value calculated above. 
* Step 3: Make a cumulative total of the number of items and the usage value. 
* Step 4: Convert the cumulative total of the number of items and usage values into a percentage of their grand totals. 
* Step 5: Draw a graph connecting cumulative % items and cumulative % usage value. The graph is divided approximately into three segments, where the curve sharply changes its shape. This indicates the three segments A, B and C.

They were discontinued with the dissolution of the Committee in 1959 under a recommendation from the Special Committee on Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/articles/1032933.3732/1.PDF |author= Zeff, Stephen A. |title= The work of the special committee on research program|accessdate=10 October 2016|work= Accounting Historians Journal |publisher= [[Academy of Accounting Historians]] |date= December 2001 |volume=28|issue=2|pages=141–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 17 [[wikt:bulletin|bulletins]] were issued; however, the lack of [[binding authority]] over [[AICPA]]'s membership reduced the influence of, and compliance with the content of the bulletins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8646">The '''accountancy profession in Malaysia''' is regulated by the [[Malaysian Institute of Accountants]] (MIA) through the powers conferred by the [[Accountant]]s Act, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mia.org.my/handbook/act/01Preliminary.htm] Official website of the [[Malaysian Institute of Accountants]], Accountants Act, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The MIA is an agency under the Ministry of Finance and reports directly to the Accountant General Office. As at 4 February 2016, [[Malaysian Institute of Accountants|MIA]] has 32,618 members of which 68% are involved in commerce and industry, 22% in public practice and 10% in government and academia.  Selangor and the Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur]] Federal Territory have the largest concentration of [[Malaysian Institute of Accountants|MIA]] membership with 13,125 and 7,351 members respectively. http://www.mia.org.my/new/members_statistics_state.asp

MIA sets the [[By-Laws]] (On [[Professional conduct]] &amp; [[Ethics]]) and [[auditing standards]] for the [[accountancy]] profession in [[Malaysia]], which are in line with the standards issued by the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) and the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ([[IAASB]]).

==Other Accountancy Bodies in Malaysia==
The Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA), which was established in 1958, is another accountancy body that is involved in the training and development of accountants in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micpa.com.my/micpastudent/AboutUs.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120230115/http://www.micpa.com.my/micpastudent/AboutUs.asp |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }} Official website of the Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants, About MICPA&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, accountancy bodies from the [[Commonwealth]] countries such as the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA), [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA), the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW), the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia]] (ICAA) and [[CPA Australia]] are also active in training and developing Malaysians towards attaining professional accountancy qualifications.

After the Malaysian Institute of Accountant (MIA) and Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA), the third largest accounting body in Malaysia is Institute of Commercial and Industrial Accountants, Malaysia [http://www.icia.asia (ICIA)].

The institute (ICIA) has signed an [http://www.icia.asia/?page_id=76 MRA with IPA Australia] with reciprocal recognition: of membership status. This means that associates of the ICIA with recognized tertiary qualifications in accounting are eligible to be admitted as an Associate member of the IPA (AIPA). In addition Certified members of the ICIA (deemed to be the equivalent of an Australian bachelor's degree), having completed all the required ICIA professional exams and the required 3 years’ Practical Training with an approved training organization are eligible to be admitted as a full member (MIPA) of the IPA.

==Accountancy Education==
[[Accounting]] courses are offered both by the public and private [[higher education]] institutions in [[Malaysia]]. Presently, accountancy degree from 11 institutions of higher learning are recognised for the purpose of admission to the membership of MIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mia.org.my/mia/accountant/application_guide.asp?mid=60] MIA membership application guidelines&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the institution of higher learnings also offer programmes leading towards attaining professional accountancy qualifications such as [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]], [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales|ICAEW]], [[CPA Australia]] and [[Malaysian Institute of Chartered Public Accountants|MICPA]].

==Accounting Standards==
Accounting standards are issued by the [[Malaysian Accounting Standards Board]] (MASB) by virtue of the power conferred by the [[Financial Reporting]] Act, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masb.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=10] Official website of the Malaysia Accounting Standards Board, Financial Reporting Act, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Reporting Act also establishes the [[Financial Reporting Foundation]], which is the body that is responsible to oversee MASB's performance and financial arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masb.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;ItemId=5] Official website of the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board, Financial Reporting Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The MASB had announced the effort to bring Malaysia to be in full [[Convergence of accounting standards|convergence]] with the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masb.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1239:malaysias-convergence-with-ifrs-in-2012&amp;catid=24:press-release-2008&amp;Itemid=37] Official MASB website, Press release by FRF and MASB&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the MASB issued Malaysian Private Entities Reporting Standard (MPERS) and this sets a new milestone for financial reporting of private entities in Malaysia. MPERS is based substantially on the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs) issued by the IASB in July 2009. The new reporting framework, known as the MPERS Framework, is effective for financial statements beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early application permitted.

Private entities now have a choice of continuing with the existing Private Entity Reporting Standards (PERS) Framework, or apply the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) Framework (mandatory for non-private entities, except transitioning entities), or by 1 January 2016, mandatory migration to the new MPERS Framework. As the requirement for first-time adoption of MPERS is retrospective, it is important the private entities prepare in advance if they have to migrate to the MPERS Framework or the MFRS Framework in the near future. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.3ecpa.com.my/accounting/comparison-of-perss-mpers-and-mfrss/|title=Comparison of PERSs, MPERS and MFRSs in Malaysia|author=|date=|work= 3ecpa.com.my |accessdate=2 Jul 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting Firms in Malaysia==
As at 30 June 2015,  there are 1,407 firms which are offering auditing services and another 836 firms providing other accountancy related services http://www.mia.org.my/new/circularandresources_miaannualreport.asp .&lt;ref name="mia.org.my"&gt;[http://www.mia.org.my/ar/2008/downloads/annualreport.pdf] The MIA Annual Report, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the global networks of accounting firms such as [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Deloitte]], [[KPMG]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[BDO International|BDO]], [[Mazars]], [[Geneva Group International]], [[Crowe Horwath]], [[Baker Tilly]], [[UHY Hacker Young|Urbach Hacker Young]] and [[Grant Thornton]] have their presence in [[Malaysia]].

[[File:Adolfo Calero.jpg|thumb|right|Calero in 1985.]]
'''Adolfo Calero Portocarrero''' (December 22, 1931 &amp;ndash; June 2, 2012) was a [[Nicaraguan]] businessman and the leader of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]], the largest rebel group of the [[Contras]], opposing the [[Sandinista]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hart Strober | first = Deborah|author2= Gerald S. | title = The Reagan Presidency: An Oral History of the Era | publisher = Brassey's | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-57488-583-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlNorthern Front Contras: The Contra Story — Central Intelligence Agency"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/north.html |title=Northern Front Contras: The Contra Story — Central Intelligence Agency |work= |accessdate=2010-05-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100426224615/https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/north.html| archivedate= 26 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calero was responsible for managing the bank accounts into which money was deposited and then used to buy supplies and arms for the Contras. He was brought to testify at hearings of the [[US Congress]] in May 1987.

==Early years==
Calero was born on December 22, 1931 in Managua to Adolfo Calero Orozco (1899–1980) and María Portocarrero (1911–1944), who had married in 1927. The oldest of four children, he studied in the [[United States]], graduating from [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1953 and [[Syracuse University]]. In Managua, he managed the [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant.

Calero was associated with the [[Conservative Party of Nicaragua]]. From 1963, he was a [[CIA]] information source. Before the 1979 overthrow of the government of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]], he had been briefly imprisoned, which gave credibility to his claims to have opposed Somoza as well as the Sandinistas.

==Contra leader==
In early 1983, he joined the political directorate of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN). By October he became its president, but many observers wondered about his real power because of the political wing's weak control over the military wing. In a bid to unify contra factions and win aid from the [[US Congress]], he became a member of the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO) triumvirate with [[Alfonso Robelo]] and [[Arturo Cruz]].

Calero controlled the FDN through his deputy, [[Aristides Sánchez]], and the contras' military commander, [[Enrique Bermúdez]], an alliance so tight that it was dubbed the "Iron Triangle."

However, there were tensions below the surface. After the Sapoa ceasefire, Calero exploited discontent with Bermudez among the FDN's field commanders in an effort to push him out. Heavy-handed intervention by the CIA helped to crush that effort. Later, however, other commanders, with the blessing of the [[US State Department]], ousted both their political and military leadership.
On July 26, 2011, he published his book "Cronicas de un Contra", which narrates his participation during the 1980s in Nicaragua.

== Personal life ==
Calero married Maria Ernestina Lacayo on December 7, 1957. The couple had two children, Myriam (b. 1958) and Adolfo (1960–1994). Calero has three grandchildren. He had three younger siblings: Myriam (b. 1933-2018) Mario (1935–1993) and Martha (b. 1943).

==Death==
Calero died in Managua on June 2, 2012 after complications from [[pneumonia]] and [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18312346&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his wife, daughter, three grandchildren, and two sisters.

==In popular culture==
In the 2017 film ''[[American Made (film)|American Made]]'', he was portrayed by [[Daniel Lugo (actor)|Daniel Lugo]], in a highly innacurate {{Citation needed | reason=How is it innacurate?|date=November 2018}} protrayal of his character and his commitment to Nicaragua's democratization.

During his tenure as head of the ministry, [[Panama]] won in 2010 the award of Investment Grade of three risk rating agencies, over a period of time of 90 days:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Moody´s concede el grado de inversión a Panamá|journal=Panamá ON|date=11 June 2010|url=http://www.panamaon.com/noticias/economia/1620-moodys-concede-el-grado-de-inversion-a-panama.html|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March [[Fitch Ratings]] upgraded the qualification of Panama, allowing the nation to achieve the Investment Grade Category for the first time;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vallarino se reunirá con Fitch Ratings|journal=Panamá América|date=13 March 2010|url=http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/content/vallarino-se-reunir%C3%A1-con-fitch-ratings|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gobierno: Panamá logra grado de inversión|journal=Telemetro|date=24 March 2010|url=http://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/Gobierno-Panama-logra-grado-inversion_0_243875619.html|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Panamá obtiene grado de inversión|journal=La Estrella de Panamá|date=24 March 2010|url=http://laestrella.com.pa/panama/nacional/panama-obtiene-grado-inversion/23698829|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] Ratings Services also upgraded Panama's rating to Investment Grade, due the prospects of moderate deficit and the expectations of economic growth;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Panamá: S&amp;P eleva calificación de deuda soberana a grado de inversión|journal=América Economía|date=25 May 2010|url=http://www.americaeconomia.com/economia-mercados/finanzas/panama-sp-eleva-calificacion-de-deuda-soberana-grado-de-inversion|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; meanwhile, on June [[Moody's]] awarded Panama with the Investment Grade, due the "significant improvement" in the country's fiscal policies and a solid economic growth.&lt;ref name="24 September 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Panama Debt Raised to Investment Grade by Moody’s|journal=Bloomberg Business|date=9 June 2010|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-06-09/panama-raised-to-investment-grade-by-moody-s-matching-moves-by-s-p-fitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Welding Institute at Granta Park near Cambridge UK.JPG|thumb|The Bevan Braithwaite Building of [[The Welding Institute|TWI Ltd]]]]

'''Arthur Bevan Midgley Braithwaite''' (born 27 July 1939 in [[Hoddesdon]], [[Hertfordshire]]; died 25 April 2008) was chief executive of [[The Welding Institute]] and founding director of [[Granta Park]] in Cambridge.

== Education ==

Bevan stemmed from a renowned [[Quaker]] family. His father was a stockbroker and his grandfather was involved in the set-up of the [[Saffron Walden Railway]]. Bevan was brought up by his stepmother Nora (née Ford-Smith), because his Norwegian mother did not survive the [[postpartum period]] after the birth of Bevan's younger sister, Magnhild, in 1946. He was educated at [[Leighton Park School]] and [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], [[Cambridge]], where he obtained an MA in engineering.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;Howard Stephens: [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/27/transport Rail buff who built his own line and became a world authority on structural fatigue.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Welding Engineering==

[[File:Lake at Granta Park near Cambridge UK.JPG|thumb|The Lake at [[Granta Park]] near Cambridge]]

After obtaining a qualification as a Class 1 welder, in 1961 he joined the British Welding Research Association (which subsequently became The Welding Institute and then TWI Ltd), where he conducted research on the fatigue strength of structural steel and on friction welding. In 1988 he was appointed chief executive of The Welding Institute and in 1991 was granted an [[OBE]]. He was president of the International Institute of Welding and a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In 1997 he conceived building a science park around the deteriorating buildings of TWI, going on to build new offices and laboratories for the company in its centre at [[Granta Park]], Cambridge.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

== Railway Engineering ==

Bevan got a passion for railways from the headmaster of [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|The Downs School]] in [[Colwall]], [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], who managed the [[Downs Light Railway]] with a track gauge of {{RailGauge|9.5in}}. He set-up the Institute of Rail Welding in 2001, built a narrow gauge railway line at Granta Park and became chairman of the [[Bressingham Steam and Gardens|Bressingham Steam Preservation Trust]], at [[Bressingham]], near [[Diss]], [[Norfolk]], to which he donated an ex-NCB 1991 Hunslet battery-electric locomotive and three bogie coaches from the Southport Pier Railway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norfolkrailwaysociety.org.uk/archive-july-aug-2007.html Norfolk Railway Society, News Archive, July - August 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; He eagerly supported the restoration of the steam locomotive ''[[LMS Royal Scot Class 6100 Royal Scot|Royal Scot]]'', which had originally run on the west coast main line from London to Glasgow from 1927 to 1962.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

'''Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Agència per a la Competitivitat de l'Empresa, ACCIÓ'') is the [[Catalan Government]]’s agency that promotes foreign investment and business competitiveness. Headquartered in [[Barcelona]], it currently operates globally through a network of 40 offices all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalonia.com/about_us.jsp Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment - WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission== 
Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment’s mission is to promote innovation, internationalisation, trade and funding of Catalan companies and startups. It also provides support, insight and advice to international companies interested in investing in [[Catalonia]] and Barcelona.&lt;ref name="estatutos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Departament d'Empresa i Ocupació&lt;/small&gt;|trans-title=Department of Business and Employment|year=2015|url=http://portaldogc.gencat.cat/utilsEADOP/PDF/6976/1449764.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 2008 as a result of merging the public office Commercial Promotion Consortium of Catalonia (Catalan: Consorci de Promoció Comercial de Catalunya, COPCA) and the Innovation and Business Development Center (Catalan: Centre d'Innovació i Desenvolupament Empresarial, CIDEM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duran |first1=Manuel |title=Mediterranean Paradiplomacies: The Dynamics of Diplomatic Reterritorialization |date=2015 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |isbn=978-90-04-28540-8 |page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first foreign office of COPCA and CIDEM was established in [[Tokyo]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="Japan Action Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Action Plan of the Government of Catalonia 2016-2019|year=2016|url=http://exteriors.gencat.cat/web/.content/saeue/afers_exteriors_cooperacio/04_arees_actuacio/Pla_Catalunya_Japo/Pla-Japo_2016-2019_angles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same period the first American office in [[New York City|New York]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=García |first1=Caterina |title=Democratic Spain: Reshaping External Relations in a Changing World |date=1995 |publisher=Richard Gillespie, Fernando Rodrigo, Jonathan Story |location=London, UK |isbn=978-0-415-11325-0 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 two offices were opened in [[Europe]] ([[London]] and [[Paris]]) and one in North Africa ([[Casablanca]]). In 1992 the first Middle East office in [[Dubai]] was opened.&lt;ref name="CataloniaConnects"&gt;{{cite web|title=CataloniaConnects|year=2016|url=http://www.accio.gencat.cat/web/.content/05_ACCIO/patrocini-col-laboracions/docs/catalonia-connects.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since COPCA and CIDEM merged and became Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment, the number of exterior offices has grown until the current 40. In fact, the latest offices were opened in 2017 in [[Amsterdam]], [[Nairobi]], [[Tehran]] and [[Zagreb]]-[[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government to open six new trade and investment offices worldwide |url=http://www.catalannews.com/business/item/government-to-open-six-new-trade-and-investment-offices-worldwide |accessdate=16 July 2018 |agency=ACN |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency covers 100 markets in the five continents.&lt;ref name="Connect to Acció"&gt;{{cite web|title=Connect to Acció|year=2017|url=http://www.accio.gencat.cat/web/.content/01_Serveis/cartera-de-serveis/doc/cartera-de-serveis-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chuwit Kamolvisit''' ({{lang-th|ชูวิทย์ กมลวิศิษฎ์}}; {{RTGS|Chuwit Kamonwisit}}; born 29 August 1961) is a controversial [[Thailand|Thai]] politician who was once the country's biggest [[massage parlour]] owner, known as the "tub tycoon".&lt;ref name="Prospect-2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Renton|first1=Alex|title=Learning the Thai sex trade|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/learningthethaisextrade|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=Prospect|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an arrest in 2003, he publicly claimed that he paid large bribes to many Thai police officers. He then sold some of his massage parlors, formed his own political party and unsuccessfully ran for Bangkok [[Bangkok gubernatorial election, 2004|governor in August 2004]]. In 2005 he was elected for a four-year term to the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|Thai House of Representatives]], but in 2006 the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] removed him from parliament. In October 2008 he again ran for governor of Bangkok as an independent but was not elected. In the [[Thai general election, 2011|July 2011 general election]] his party won four seats in the House of Representatives. He used the pseudonym '''Davis Kamol''' on occasion.

==Early life and education==
Chuwit is the son of a [[Hong Kong]]-born, [[Thai Chinese|Chinese]] father and a [[Thai people|Thai]] mother. He graduated from the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy at [[Thammasat University]], and then earned a Master of Business Administration degree at [[University of San Diego]] in [[San Diego, California]], United States. Later, he also earned a Masters of Political Science (Politics and Governments) at Thammasat University.

== Business and allegations ==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2014}}
Chuwit controls the Davis Group, a business that consists of six [[Bangkok]] massage parlours near [[Ratchadaphisek Road]], which employ around 600 women each: Copacabana, Victoria's Secret, Honolulu, Hi Class, Emmanuelle, and Julianna. The massage parlours cater mainly to wealthy Thais and operate within a "grey area" of the law: massage parlors are legal, but [[prostitution]] is not.&lt;ref name="Guardian-20040221"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott-Clark|first1=Cathy|last2=Levy|first2=Adrian|title=The brothel king's revenge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/feb/21/weekend.adrianlevy|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=2004-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices are from 3,000 to 6,000 [[baht]] for a two-hour session. The Davis Group's holdings also include the Davis Bangkok Hotel, Thai villas and a shopping mall on [[Sukhumvit Road]] [[Soi]] 24.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, which is one of the most expensive areas in Bangkok.

==="Sukhumvit Square" incident===
In January 2003, Chuwit was accused of hiring around 600 men to raze several bars, shops, a laundry and a travel agency on "Sukhumvit Square", a plot of land he owns on Sukhumvit Soi 10. This was an apparent attempt to remove the low-rent tenants so that the land could be developed. The tenants believed they had valid leases from another company and were not notified of the raid, which took place early on a Sunday morning. Chuwit was arrested and spent a month in prison. He denied responsibility and was finally released on bail.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The police, whom he says he had bribed an average US$160,000 a month over 10 years, refused to protect him, so he went public, releasing the names of the top officers, the sums they were paid, and their frequent visits to his six massage parlors.&lt;ref name="Reuters-20110630" /&gt; He also claimed that "VIP" policemen received free service in his parlours, an allegation that was later confirmed in interviews with some of the masseuses.&lt;ref name="Guardian-20040221"/&gt; Following an investigation, several prominent policemen were suspended or demoted. Chuwit also accused his prison wardens of corruption, as they accepted bribes from him.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Shortly after his corruption revelations, Chuwit disappeared for two days. He later claimed he was abducted and abused by police; however, others believe he had staged his own disappearance. Chuwit's massage parlours were then raided and some of his bank accounts were frozen. He was also charged with procuring minors for prostitution because three masseues under the age of 18 were found working in one of his parlours. He was acquitted in June 2004, as the court found the girls had used forged ID cards and Chuwit was not held responsible. During the same month, Chuwit sold three of his parlours, saying that police harassment had made operations difficult for him.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In a February 2004 interview, Chuwit claimed that he had paid Thai policemen to clear his Sukhumvit Soi 10 property. When the issue became public, the police allegedly demanded more money, which he refused to pay. They turned against him, and he revealed his bribe payments as a response.&lt;ref name="Guardian-20040221"/&gt;

In July 2006, after a three-year trial, Chuwit and 130 associates were acquitted of the razing charges; however, a corporate lawyer was sentenced to eight months in prison for paying army engineers to destroy the businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008667.php Chuwit avoids conviction], ''The Nation'', 14 July 2006 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829033850/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008667.php |date=29 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuwit converted the area on Sukhumvit Soi 10 into a public park named "[[Chuvit Garden]]" for about 100 million baht.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.thingsasian.com/tablogs/page/dgilliland?entry=b_a_new_park_and A New Park and a Mall Facelift] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311022716/http://weblogs.thingsasian.com/tablogs/page/dgilliland?entry=b_a_new_park_and |date=2007-03-11 }}, ''Bangkok Dazed'', 24 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuvit Garden is the last large empty parcel of land in the Sukhumvit area. The land alone is estimated to be worth more than US$160 million or 5,500 million baht.

==Political career==
[[Image:Poster of Chuwit Kamolvisit.JPG|250px|thumb|Chuwit Kamolvisit on a poster for the Bangkok Governor Election 2008]]

In September 2003, Chuwit formed his own political party, called ''First Thai Nation''. In April 2004 he announced that he was running for governor of Bangkok. He planned to spend about 20 million baht on his campaign, with corruption in the police and government as his main campaign topic. The [[Bangkok gubernatorial election, 2004|Bangkok governor elections]] were held on 29 August 2004. Chuwit placed third, with some 300,000 votes, or about 16 percent of the vote.

For the [[Thailand legislative election, 2005|2005 legislative elections]], Chuwit merged his party with the conservative [[Chart Thai Party]]. He ran successfully as a party list candidate, becoming a member of parliament.

In May 2005 he began hosting a weekly call-in radio show, during which he listened to complaints from the public.

In January 2006, however, the Constitutional Court revoked his MP status. A candidate must be a member of a political party for at least 90 days before the general election and the court found that Chuwit had not joined Chart Thai in time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=126756 Chuwit ruled out as MP by top court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312070655/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=126756 |date=2007-03-12 }}, ''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'', 27 January 2006{{Dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he again declared his candidacy for governor of Bangkok. As was the case in 2004, he placed third. He admitted that his campaign may have suffered when he punched a reporter in the face for allegedly describing Chuwit as "unmanly".&lt;ref name="Reuters-20110630"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petty|first1=Martin|title=Thai massage king prefers "pimp" label to politician|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-election-massage/thai-massage-king-prefers-pimp-label-to-politician-idUSTRE75T0Y420110630|accessdate=14 January 2018|agency=Reuters|date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2008/10/03/national/national_30085019.php Encounter], ''The Nation'', 3 October 2008 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205063109/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2008/10/03/national/national_30085019.php |date=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 Chuwit formed a new political party, "[[Rak Thailand Party|Love Thailand]]" (Rak Prathetthai).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/236652/chuwit-launches-new-party|title=Chuwit launches Love Thailand Party|date=12 May 2011|work=Bangkok Post|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Thai general election, 2011|2011 Thai general election]], the party won four seats in the House of Representatives. He had campaigned as a protest candidate and anti-corruption watchdog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand elections yield surprise gains for former brothel tycoon|last1=Branigan|first1=Tania|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 July 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/05/thailand-elections-chuwit-kamolvisit-seats|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the ''Bangkok Post'' published an audio recording of a lecture given by Chuwit at [[Hatyai University]] in southern Thailand. Chuwit spoke to the students about how Thai police make money from the sex industry, and the ''Post'' noted that the topic is "a subject not normally taught in university courses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corruption 101: Prostitution &amp; the police|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-from-news/311742/corruption-101-prostitution-the-police|accessdate=13 September 2014|work=Bangkok Post|date=10 September 2012|format=Audio upload}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
His daughter, Trakarnta Kamolvisit (Thaia), studied at [[Millfield]] School, United Kingdom; and graduated with a degree in Economics from [[University of San Francisco]]. In 2017, she has enrolled MSc Construction Economics and Management at University College London (UCL)

'''Commercial law''', also known as '''trade law''', is the body of [[law]] that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of [[Legal person|persons]] and businesses engaged in [[commerce]], [[merchandising]], [[trade]], and sales.&lt;ref name=cornellcommerciallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Law: An Overview|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_law|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]].

Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; [[Maritime transport|merchant shipping]]; [[guarantee]]; marine, fire, life, and accident [[insurance]]; bills of exchange, [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable instruments]], [[Contract|contracts]] and partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Commercial Law|volume=6|page=771|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these categories fall within [[Financial law]], an aspected of Commercial law pertaining specifically to financing and the financial markets. It can also be understood to regulate [[corporation|corporate]] [[contract]]s, [[Recruitment|hiring practices]], and the [[manufacturing|manufacture]] and [[sales]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]]. Many countries have adopted [[civil code]]s that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law.

In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the [[United States Congress]], under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adoption]] of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the U.S. territories.

Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly ''vis-a-vis'' employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4775">'''Corporate transparency''' describes the extent to which a corporation's actions are observable by outsiders. This is a consequence of regulation, local norms, and the set of information, privacy, and business policies concerning corporate decision-making and operations openness to employees, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], shareholders and the general public. From the perspective of outsiders, transparency can be defined simply as the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from the corporation.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; 

Recent research suggests there are three primary dimensions of corporate transparency: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.&lt;ref name='JOM'&gt;Schnackenberg, A., Tomlinson, E., 2014. Organizational Transparency: A New Perspective on Managing Trust in Organization-Stakeholder Relationships. ''Journal of Management'' DOI: 10.1177/0149206314525202. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206314525202&lt;/ref&gt; To increment transparency, corporations infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with stakeholders. For example, governance decisions to voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists indicate disclosure; decisions to actively limit the use of [[technical terminology]], [[fine print]], or complicated mathematical notations in the firm's correspondence with suppliers and customers indicate clarity; and decisions to not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in the firm's communications with investors indicate accuracy. The ''strategic'' management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the firm's objectives.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; 

[[Standard &amp; Poor's]] has included a definition of corporate transparency in its [http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/ap/page.product/equityresearch_gamma/2,5,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.html GAMMA Methodology] aimed at analysis and assessment of [[corporate governance]]. As a part of this work, Standard &amp; Poor's Governance Services publishes the Transparency Index which calculates the average score for the largest public companies in various countries.

[[Transparency International]] publishes an index of [http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/shining-a-light-on-the-worlds-biggest-companies corporate transparency] based on public disclosure of anti-corruption programmes and country-by-country reporting. Corporate transparency is also used to refer to radical transparency in corporate governance.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Transparency Index calculated as the average score for the largest public companies in various countries.

'''Corporate transparency''' is also used to refer to [[radical transparency]] in corporate governance.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Customer support transparency ==
{{Main article|Customer engagement}}

Corporations may be transparent to investors, the public at large, and to customers.

Opening up the customer support channels may mean using a feedback tool which allows users to publicly vote on new developments, having an open [[internet forum]], or actively responding to social media questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/mar/02/customer-service-social-rules|title=The new, social rules of customer service|last=Norris|first=Jon|date=2012-03-02|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''[[United Kingdom]], [[counselling]]''' is not under statutory regulation, and is overseen and supported by several organisations, none of which are officially recognised by the government.

==National regulation==
In 2007 the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC), which is independent of any professional body, released a [[white paper]], ''Trust Assurance and Safety – The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century'', which said that the Government intended to introduce statutory regulation for [[psychotherapist]]s and counsellors.

The HPC set up a working group of stakeholders, known as a Professional Liaison Group, to consider and make recommendations to the HPC about how psychotherapists and counsellors might be regulated, in light of the statements made in the white paper. The HPC held a public consultation on the PLG recommendations, which ran for three months in 2009. Following the consultation, the PLG was reconvened and had its last meeting on 2 February 2011.

In February 2011, the Government published a [[command paper]], ''Enabling Excellence'', which set out the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]]'s policy on professional regulation. The paper outlined a system of what it called "assured voluntary registration" and said that in the future statutory regulation will only be considered where there is a "compelling case", and where "voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk".&lt;ref name=psyandcou&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/aspirantgroups/psychotherapistscounsellors/|title=Psychotherapists and Counsellors|publisher=[[Health and Care Professions Council]]|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the HPC's Chief Executive Marc Seale wrote to [[Anne Milton]] MP, then [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for Public Health, seeking clarification of the coalition government's policy on the statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors.

At its meeting on 31 March 2011 the Council discussed the response received from Anne Milton MP. The letter said: "...it is not currently our intention to proceed with statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors".&lt;ref name=psyandcou/&gt;

==Counselling organisations==
{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}

;The British Association For Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)
The largest UK counselling organisation is the [[British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy]] (BACP). It grew from the Standing Conference for the Advancement of Counselling, a grouping of organisations inaugurated in 1970 at the instigation of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Membership was extended to include individuals when in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the Home Office Voluntary Service Unit, the British Association for Counselling was founded. In 1978 the headquarters was moved from London to Rugby courtesy of the National Marriage Guidance Council which provided free accommodation to help the association establish itself.

In September 2000, the Association recognised that it no longer represented just counselling, but also psychotherapy. It changed its name to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). BACP is now the largest and broadest body within the sector with approximately 26,000 individual members. BACP participates in the development of counselling and psychotherapy at an international level.

BACP is recognised by most health providers and claims a membership of several thousand.

The aim of the NCS is to promote and support the practice of counselling, and does so by offering a range of services to members, including a comprehensive training programme. The NCS also benefits the patients of counsellors by ensuring that the counsellors in their organisation follow their stringent code of ethics; facing expulsion if they deviate or break any of their established codes of conduct and practice.

According to the introduction on their website in 2007, the Counselling Society launched a campaign by contacting every UK MP, Peer and other national stakeholder via Blake’s Parliamentary Yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.counsellingsociety.com/guests/about_us/index.htm{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a criminal offence of “abuse by a healthcare professional” which would include counsellors as a matter of public safety. This would give courts powers to ban abusive counsellors from practising.

;The Human Givens Institute

According to their main page, the [[Human Givens Institute]] (HGI) is a membership organisation and resource open to anyone wishing to support the new school of psychology known as the [[Human Givens]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hgi.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Appel''' ({{lang-he|דוד אפל}}, born 7 August 1950) is an Israeli [[businessman]], [[general contractor]], and [[Likud]] party [[activist]].

==Background==
Appel was raised by his grandparents, and educated in an [[World ORT|ORT]] technical dormitory school in [[Hod HaSharon#Magdiel|Magdiel]], where he studied [[printing]]. He was not drafted into the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] due to an injury sustained when printing machinery fell on his hand. At age 20 he joined the Likud youth organisation, where he formed lifelong friendships with many people who would later become influential [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politicians]].

In 1975 he opened a baby products store in [[Tel Aviv]], which eventually became a national chain. He was also a partner in the [[Gaza City|Gazan]] UP-7 company. In 1977 he sold his chain and opened a general contracting firm with partner ''Shalom Prussak'', which became state-recognised within three years and ultimately built thousands of housing units, many of them under contract for the Israeli Housing Ministry.

==Corruption charges==
The [[Attorney General of Israel]] ruled that between 1983 and 1986, Appel's contracting company had operated in a manner violating the law, and only 13 years later in 1997 he was cleared of all charges.

In 2003 the State again brought charges against Appel, this time dealing with four separate cases of [[bribery]] and dishonest business practices.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Danon, "David Appel Indicted on Bribery Charges", ''Asia-Africa Intelligence Wire'', 11 September 2003, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24406713_ITM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522193707/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24406713_ITM |date=22 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment charged that he had promised civil servants reelection in exchange for approving his projects in [[Central District (Israel)|Central Israel]], especially [[Lod]] and [[Giv'at Shmuel]]. Among those accused of accepting bribes were former MK Nehama Ronen, then director of the Environment Ministry, [[Israel Land Administration]] official Oded Tal, Lod mayor Benny Regev, and Giv'at Shmuel council head Zamir ben Ari.

In 2004 he was charged with [[bribery|bribing]] [[Israeli prime minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]], in what became known as the [[Greek Island Affair]], and was also charged with five other bribe offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/the-amended-bribery-indictment-against-david-appel-1.111791 |title=The amended bribery indictment against David Appel |publisher=Haaretz, |date=23 January 2004 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney General [[Menachem Mazuz]] eventually ruled that Sharon could not be charged with receiving bribes from Appel. As of September 2008 all but one bribery charge against Appel had been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tomer Zarchin |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/businessman-and-defendant-police-manipulate-justice-system-1.254586 |title=Businessman and defendant: Police manipulate justice system |work=Haaretz |date=25 September 2008 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an Andersen employee for 20 years, who was in charge of the Enron account since 1997, for which he was paid over $1 million.  He was fired from Andersen in January 2002 and charged with [[obstruction of justice]] for ordering Andersen staff to shred over a ton of papers related to Enron.  On April 9, 2002 he pleaded [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y; the maximum sentence for his crimes is ten years, but since he pleaded guilty and became a witness for the [[prosecution]] he would have presumably received a much smaller sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bodurtha.georgetown.edu/enron/Andersen%20Ex-Party%20Pleads%20Guilty,%20In%20a%20Significant%20Blow%20to%20the%20Firm.htm Andersen Ex-Party Pleads Guilty, In a Significant Blow to the Firm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His sentencing date was postponed numerous times.

'''Downtown San Bernardino''' is a district in the city of [[San Bernardino]], [[California]], in [[San Bernardino County]], United States. It is home to city and county government buildings, and to the city's [[central business district]].&lt;ref name="ULI"/&gt; The downtown area of San Bernardino is home to multiple (and the only) diplomatic missions for the Inland Empire, being one of only four California cities with multiple consulates (the other cities being Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco). The governments of Guatemala (opened July 2014) and Mexico have established their consulates in the civic center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pe.com/local-news/local-news-headlines/20140307-immigration-guatemala-to-open-san-bernardino-consulate.ece |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317020932/http://www.pe.com/local-news/local-news-headlines/20140307-immigration-guatemala-to-open-san-bernardino-consulate.ece |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown San Bernardino is bounded by [[Interstate 215 (California)|I-215]] to the west, [[California State Route 18|Waterman Avenue]] to the east, Baseline Street to the north, and Mill Street to the south.&lt;ref name="ULI"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Advisory Services Panel | title=San Bernardino, California: Crossroads of the Southwest | url=http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=4907 | publisher=[[Urban Land Institute]] | location=[[Washington, D.C.]] | date=June 24–29, 2007 | accessdate=2007-12-26 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Bernardino City Council is considering another redevelopment effort. The city’s Economic Development Agency presented the council with a draft of the Downtown Core Vision / Action Plan in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=City of San Bernardino EDA, Pirih Productions, and Brostrom Software Solutions |url=http://www.sbrda.org/corevision.htm |title=Downtown Core Vision |publisher=Sbrda.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009125146/http://www.sbrda.org/corevision.htm |archive-date=2011-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – a guide for revitalizing downtown San Bernardino for the next 10 years. The plan is the culmination of a year of research, community participation, and planning led by the city’s EDA and the urban planning firm [[EDAW]]. The city is discussing the construction of a new government center/civic plaza that will contain an iconic 24 story tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidesocal.com/sb/sbnow/2009/11/webhedsan-bernardino-business.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2014 the county of San Bernardino opened a 12-story, 200-foot-tall courthouse known as the San Bernardino Justice Center.

==Entertainment district==

[[File:California Theatre, San Bernardino.JPG|thumb|left|The historic California Theatre.]]

Downtown is home to three performing arts venues and a movie theatre, the most for any central business district in the Inland Empire. The city is planning a new district along Fourth Street. The key aspect of the plan is to make the area around the California Theatre and future Regal San Bernardino Theatre Square Stadium 14 site on Fourth Street as an area for entertainment and dining. Dining is all that is needed to make this into a reality, as Regal Stadium 14 opened in the spring of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbsun.com/ci_19436441?source=most_viewed |date=2011-11-29 |publisher=[[San Bernardino Sun]] |accessdate=2011-11-29 |title=EDC gives approval for lease to return movie theater to San Bernardino's downtown |author=Josh Dulaney |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201193730/http://www.sbsun.com/ci_19436441?source=most_viewed |archive-date=2011-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norman F. Feldheym Central Library]] is the flagship of the San Bernardino Public Library system.

It serves as a transfer point for bus routes the county, with future connections to the sbX Bus Rapid Transit system, which will connect [[Verdemont, San Bernardino, California|Verdemont]]/[[California State University, San Bernardino]] to the Veterans Hospital in [[Loma Linda, California|Loma Linda]] and the Downtown San Bernardino Passenger Rail System; which is a one-mile Metrolink extension from the Santa Fe Depot, and the Redlands Passenger Light-Rail Project with stops en route to the [[University of Redlands]]. Construction began in June 2013 with minimal service opening in April 2014 (sbX only) while a fully operational center opening in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/transit-684265-morris-million.html|title=SAN BERNARDINO: Agencies pool money for transit center, Metrolink extension|last=Macduff|first=Cassie|date=February 26, 2014|newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]]|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downtownsanbernardino.org/businesses-and-services-directory/15/192/intermodal-transit-center-and-village |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130624221911/http://www.downtownsanbernardino.org/businesses-and-services-directory/15/192/intermodal-transit-center-and-village |archivedate=2013-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omnitrans.org/blog/2012/07/25/san-bernardino-transit-center-a-closer-look/&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Bernardino International Airport===

The [[San Bernardino International Airport]] is expected to provide both domestic and international air services. It will provide growth to the city and the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]. Buses are expected to serve the airport, which lies two to three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from downtown. The airport finished major construction, however there are no current commercial flight airlines occupying the terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbsun.com/news/ci_14861943?source=pkg |title=Airport execs still look to land airline, The Sun, April 2010 |publisher=Sbsun.com |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2011-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229152311/http://www.sbsun.com/news/ci_14861943?source=pkg |archive-date=2012-02-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emilio Coia''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} LLD (13 April 1911 in [[Glasgow]] &amp;ndash; 17 June 1997 in [[Clydebank]]) was a Scottish artist who made his name in the early 1930s as a widely published [[caricaturist]].

==Biography==
Coia was born on 13 April 1911 in Glasgow. He was the son of Italian immigrant Giovanni Coia, a Glasgow ice-cream retailer, who trained him as an artist.

Educated at [[St Mungo's Academy]] and the [[Glasgow School of Art]],&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had a long period of work in [[advertising]] (before, during and after [[World War II]]), before returning to the newspaper business (initially in Glasgow), but later for the [[Edinburgh]]-published ''[[The Scotsman]]''. This led to a long and mutually-beneficial association with the [[Edinburgh Festival]].

Coia also contributed to the early days of [[Scottish Television]]; talking entertainingly on a wide range of subjects and producing caricatures and sketches on live and recorded TV programmes. He was widely and deservedly honoured and acclaimed for his work, and was elected President of [[Glasgow Art Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2mus-XyGPC0C&amp;dat=19710729&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en Evening Times 29 July 1971] Retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Coia married Marie Neale (died 1978).

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1984, his proposers included Sir [[Robin Philipson]] and Andrew Q Morton.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
He died in [[Clydebank]] on 17 June 1997.

'''Entity-level controls''' are [[internal control]]s that help ensure that management directives pertaining to the entire entity are carried out.  They are the second level of a [[SOX 404 top-down risk assessment|top-down approach]] to understanding the risks of an organization.  Generally, entity refers to the entire company.

==Regulation surrounding entity-level controls==
===Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002===

As  a result of several accounting and auditing scandals, congress passed the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]].  Section 404 of the act requires company management to assess and report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control.  It also requires the company's independent auditor to attest to management's disclosures regarding the effectiveness of internal control.  The act also created the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/gwbush/sarbanesoxley072303.pdf |title=Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 |accessdate=2009-04-21 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCAOB Auditing Standard 2201===
The [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) became the primary regulator of audits of publicly traded companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/pcaob.htm|title=SEC Description of the PCAOB|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2007, the PCAOB adopted Auditing Standard 2201 (Supersedes AS No. 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auditing Standard No. 5 |url=http://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/Auditing_Standard_5.aspx |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This standard contains the standards over performing an audit of internal control over financial reporting that is integrated with an audit of financial statements.

The auditor must test entity-level controls that are important to the auditor's conclusion about whether the company has effective internal control over financial reporting.  Depending on the auditor's evaluation of the effectiveness of the entity-level controls, the auditor can increase or decrease the amount of testing that they will perform.

Entity-level controls vary greatly in nature and precision.  Their effect on the audit plan varies according to how precise they are.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Type
! Description
! Audit Effect
|-
| Indirect
| Some entity-level controls have an indirect effect on the chances of detecting or preventing a misstatement on a timely basis.  They do not directly relate to risks at the financial statement assertion level.
| Affect control selection, and the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures performed.
|-
| Monitoring
| Some entity-level controls monitor the effectiveness of other controls.  They could be designed to identify breakdowns of lower level controls.  These controls are not precise enough by themselves to specifically address the assessed risk at the relevant assertion level.
| Reduce the testing of other controls if operating effectively.
|-
| Precise
| Some entity-level controls are precise enough to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
| If the control sufficiently addresses the risk, then additional tests of controls relating to that risk are not necessary
|}

==Common entity-level controls==
{|
|
* Controls related to the [[control environment]]
* Controls over management override
* The company's [[risk assessment]] process
* Centralized processing and controls, including shared service environments

|}

==Evaluating entity-level controls==
===Auditor's evaluation===
Entity-level controls, along with all other internal controls should be evaluated by independent auditors according to SAS 109 (AU 314) issued by the [[AICPA]].  SAS 109 stipulates that "auditors should obtain an understanding of the five components of internal control sufficient to assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud, and to design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicpa.org/download/members/div/auditstd/AU-00314.PDF |title=AU 314 / SAS 109 |accessdate=2009-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203092238/http://www.aicpa.org/download/members/div/auditstd/AU-00314.PDF |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information gathered from obtaining an understanding of the five components of internal control should be used to do the following:
* Identify types of potential misstatements
* Consider factors that affect the risks of material misstatement
* Design tests of controls, when applicable, and substantive procedures

Entity-level controls are generally included in the testing.

===COSO internal control-integrated framework===
The aforementioned five components of internal control refer to the five parts of the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coso.org/IC-IntegratedFramework-summary.htm |title=COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework |accessdate=2009-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228134313/http://www.coso.org/IC-IntegratedFramework-summary.htm |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The framework gives auditors a way to evaluate the controls of an entity.

The five components are:
* Control environment
* Risk assessment
* Information and communication
* Control activities
* Monitoring

Entity-level controls often fit into one or more of the five COSO components.

===Management's evaluation===
There are four basic steps that management can use to evaluate entity-level controls:{{CN|date=May 2016}}

; Identify risks : Use a top-down approach to identify and categorize risk.

; Identify entity-level controls and link to risks : Examine current entity-level controls to determine what controls have been placed into operation.  Also, identify important entity-level controls that may be missing  in the current framework.  Then link the entity-level controls best suited to address the identified risks.

; Evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of entity-level controls : Determine how effectively each entity-level control addresses identified risks by considering, among other things: sensitivity; competency of the reviewer, frequency and consistency of the control's operation; whether the control is reliable and repeatable; and whether appropriate review and follow-up action is taking place.

; Leverage entity-level controls as appropriate to mitigate risks : By leveraging strong entity-level controls, management will be able to develop a more effective and efficient controls evaluation strategy.

==Definitions of selected entity-level controls organized into the COSO framework==
{{CN|reason=No explanation or references has been provided for this section|date=May 2016}}
===Control environment===
{{CN|date=May 2016}}
; Code of Conduct : The norms to which the organization voluntarily agrees to comply.  For example, the company's code of conduct might include a policy for prohibiting employees from accepting gifts from vendors.

; Governance : A mechanism for monitoring how the resources of an organization are being put to an efficient use by management, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability

; Assignment of Authority and Responsibility : The term "authority" refers to the right to perform the organization's activities.  The term "responsibility" refers to the obligation to perform assigned activities.  It is important for the achievement of control objectives that authorities and responsibilities be consistent with the goals of its business activities and assigned to appropriate personnel.

; Hiring and Retention Practices : Hiring and retaining skilled resources is critical to an organization's success. Policies and procedures around job definition, recruitment, training, performance appraisal, [[employee retention]] programs, and management of employee exits are important components of managing human resources.

; Fraud Prevention Prevent/Detect Controls and Analytical Procedures : This refers to the anti-fraud controls and procedures used by management to prevent, detect and mitigate fraud.  Examples might include segregation of duties, setting up an ethics hot line and periodic job rotation.

===Risk assessment===
{{CN|date=May 2016}}
; Risk Assessment Methodology : A systematic approach to identify, assess and prioritize risks.

; Risk Assessment Analytical Techniques : Analytical techniques, if used appropriately, can serve as a tool in the risk assessment process.  Since risk is an outcome of perception, analytical techniques help remove subjectivity, to a certain extent by collation and presentation of data in a systematic manner for assessment of potential impact and likelihood of occurrence or risks.

===Information and communication===
; Internal Communication and Performance Reporting : This refers to the lines of communication that run through an organization's structure, both top-down and bottom-up, including peer communication.  Performance reporting is part of internal communication, and usually involves a two-way process of setting expectations and monitoring performance against agreed-upon expectations.

; Tone Setting : Tone setting refers to various components of the "tone at the top," that are the building blocks of the character of an organization.  Having set the right tone, it is equally important to have open channels of communication so that those within and outside the organization understand and act upon it.  Examples of such components of tone include code of ethics and corporate governance practices.

; Board/Audit Committee Reporting : Board members, including independent directors, assume fiduciary responsibilities which require them to have access to accurate and relevant information.  While most countries have enacted laws regarding formal reporting to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board, these usually constitute baseline procedures and requirements.  Companies are free to adopt more stringent measures regarding Board/Audit Committee Reporting, such as holding more frequent formal Audit Committee Meetings than required by law.

; External Communication : This refers to the communication to the shareholders, stock market, customers, regulators, vendors, and other entities outside the company's formal boundaries.  The annual report is an example of external communication around the company performance, financial statements, vision, goals and targets.

===Monitoring===
{{CN|date=May 2016}}
; Ongoing Monitoring Activities : Periodic review of process and controls using relevant management reporting tools.  For example, these would include monthly review of aging of accounts receivable to determine the extent of reserves required for doubtful debts.

; Independent Assessment Mechanism : Use of external specialists or professionals to review and assess internal controls.  For example, this might include the use of external tax professionals to review the controls around tax positions developed by the in-house tax team.

; Variance Analysis Reporting : Comparison and reporting of actual performance against pre-determined benchmarks, if used appropriately, can serve as an early-warning mechanism.  For example, a steady increase in debtor turnover might indicate varying levels of collection-related issues.

; Remediation Mechanism : This refers to a systematic approach to resolving identified internal control issues.  While an issue could be identified by either an internal or an external monitoring mechanism, the remediation mechanism is usually management-owned.

; Management Triggers Embedded Within IT Systems : Most enterprise applications configure business rules in a manner as to prevent, require pre-approval, or alert relevant management personnel in the event that certain pre-set thresholds are not observed.  For example, a sales application could deploy a control preventing sales transactions above the specified credit limit of a customer.

==Importance==
Entity-level controls have a pervasive influence throughout an organization.  If they are weak, inadequate, or nonexistent, they can produce material weaknesses relating to an audit of internal control and material misstatements in the financial statements of the company.  The presence of material misstatements could result in receiving an adverse opinion on internal controls and a qualified opinion on the financial statements.  Material misstatements are expensive to fix, and receiving an adverse or qualified opinion generally results in a drop in stock price of a publicly traded company.

==Benefits==
* Reduction of the likelihood of a negative risk event by establishing and reinforcing the infrastructure that sets the control consciousness of the organization
* A broad risk coverage over financial reporting and operations.  For companies conducting evaluations of internal controls, the presence of effective entity-level controls can contribute to a more effective and efficient evaluation strategy
* Generation of efficiencies in other business and operational processes
* Reinforcement for all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] of the importance of internal controls to the success of the business
* Better understanding of how identified risks are mitigated, and redirect evaluation and other resources toward priority risk areas
* Increased effectiveness and efficiency of management's risk assessment and controls evaluation

'''Equipment Lease Agreements''' typically contain language prohibiting the lessee from assigning the [[lease]] to a third party.  For example, "You have no right to sell, transfer, assign, sublease, or encumber the equipment or this agreement" protects the Lessor’s [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] and credit [[underwriting]] guidelines in the event the lessee ever wants to transfer the lease to another party.  However, it is possible to assign the lease, but the new party (assignee) will be subject to the lessor’s credit evaluation process and approval. Even if the assignee is approved, the existing lessee’s (assignor’s) personal guarantee(s), if any, might not be released unless the assignee’s credit stature is extremely strong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11534">{{about|general [[fair trade]] certifications|[[FLO International]]'s fair trade certification (known as Fair Trade Certified in the United States and Canada)|Fairtrade certification}}
{{Refimprove|Strong claims like 'must come from' should be referenced and qualified.|date=May 2010}}

A '''fair trade certification''' is a [[product certification]] within the market-based [[social movement|movement]] [[fair trade]]. The most widely used fair trade certification is [[FLO International]]'s, the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]], used in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] is the North American equivalent of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.  As of January 2011, there were over 1000 companies certified to the FLO International's certification and a further 1000 or so certified to other ethical and fairtrade certification schemes around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekobai.org/search/profiles/1522/list-of-companies-with-fairtrade] List of Companies certified to FLO International's fairtrade certification&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairtrade International certification system covers a wide range of products, including banana, coffee, cocoa, cotton, cane sugar, flowers and plants, honey, dried fruit, fruit juices, herbs, spices, tea, nuts and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, K. (2012). ''Is my Fair Trade coffee really fair? Trends and Challenges in Fair Trade certification. Center for Global Development, Policy Paper, pp.17.''&lt;/ref&gt; These commodities have different locations of production and number of farmers and workers covered for production and distribution.

==How it works==
Fair trade is a strategy for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, aiming at creating greater equity in the international trading system. Through trading partnerships with marginalised farmers and craftspeople in developing countries, social and economic opportunities are created for these producers in a way that more customers are accessible to their products and a better deal is issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtradefederation.org, (2014). ''Fair Trade Federation : What is Fair Trade?.'' [online] Available at: https://www.fairtradefederation.org/what-is-fair-trade/ [Accessed 19 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the producers have to comply with all the standards laid down by [[Fairtrade International]].

In reality, packers in developed countries pay a fee to the Fairtrade organisation for the right to use the Fairtrade certification logo. Importers of fairtrade certified products are required to pay exporters a price higher than the market price of non-fairtrade certified products, so as to cover the additional costs used by Fairtrade certified firms in marketing and inspection. Any surplus after paying these costs must be used for local social, environmental and economic projects &lt;ref&gt;Info.fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade Info / Home / What is Fairtrade? / How Fairtrade Works.'' [online] Available at: http://info.fairtrade.net/info-how-fairtrade-works.0.html [Accessed 24 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade Standards==
[[File:FairtradeCertifiedCottonTShirt.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A T-shirt made from Fairtrade certified cotton.]]
Fairtrade Standards are designed to aid the sustainable development of some smaller producers and agricultural workers in [[third world countries]]. In order to become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their fellow farmers have to strictly comply with the standards laid down by Fairtrade International.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade International / Standards / Aims of Fairtrade standards.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.net/aims-of-fairtrade-standards.html [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].)&lt;/ref&gt; FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, is responsible for inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 70 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The general standards set for different stakeholders are listed as follows:

===Small Producer Organizations===
* The majority of the members of the organization must be small-scale producers who do not highly depend on hired workers, but run their farm mainly by their own effort.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations. (2005). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Any profits earned must be equally distributed among the producers. 
* Every member in the organisation should have the right to vote in the decision-making process.

===Hired Labour===
* Workers possess the right to join an independent union to [[collective bargaining|collectively bargain]] their working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Strong Producers, Strong Future. (2014). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* No forced or child labour 
* Working conditions have to be equitable for all workers. Salaries must be at least equal or higher than the [[minimum wage]] in effect. 
* Safety and health measures must be implemented properly so as to avoid unwanted injuries at work.

===Trade Standards===
* Pay a price higher than the Fairtrade Minimum Price in order to cover the costs of sustainable production.
* Pay an additional amount of money that allows producers to invest in development : the Fairtrade Premium.
* Sign contracts that assist long-term planning and sustainable production practices.

==Fairtrade Pricing==
The Fairtrade system mainly consists of two types of pricing, which are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporters according to the proportion of output companies are able to sell with the brand ‘Fairtrade Certified’, typically ranging from 17% to up to 60% of their turnover in some cases.

* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price, as well as the minimum price, that must be paid by buyers to Fairtrade Certified producers. It is a floor price that covers producers’ average cost of production, aiming at protecting producers from selling their products underpriced.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade International / About / What is Fairtrade?.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.net/what-is-fairtrade.html [Accessed 26 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is a sum of money which is paid on top of the payment for the products. Its use is restricted to investment in the producers’ business, livelihood, and the socio-economic development of the workers. The producers have the largest power deciding how these funds are to be spent.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Minimum Price And Fairtrade Premium Table. (2014). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How fairtrade measures its impact==
The Fairtrade system has committed to a programme of Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL), which aims at generating recommendations and analysis in support of greater effectiveness and impact. Ongoing market progress is monitored by market-facing organizations present in countries where Fairtrade certified products are sold; market data is consolidated by Fairtrade International on an annual basis. These data are gathered to form a core basis for the understanding of the dynamics of how certification is developing, and how the impacts of Fairtrade are being distributed between producer organizations, geographies and products.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.org.uk, (2014). ''How Fairtrade monitors and measures impact''. [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/what-is-fairtrade/the-impact-of-our-work/how-fairtrade-monitors-and-measures-impact [Accessed 24 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.org.uk, (2014). ''How Fairtrade monitors and measures impact.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/what-is-fairtrade/the-impact-of-our-work/how-fairtrade-monitors-and-measures-impact [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade’s governance bodies also review key results and evaluate regularly in order to improve strategy and decision-making. These results are publicised within staff throughout the Fairtrade system and relevant stakeholders for further discussion of findings and recommendations.

==Criticisms==

===Little money reaches the farmers===
[[The Fairtrade Foundation]] does not monitor how much of the extra amount of money paid to exporters reaches the farmers. As the cooperatives incur relatively heavy fees on inspection, certification and marketing, only a small amount of money is retained for the farmers.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, (2014). ''Fairtrade coffee fails to help the poor, British report finds.'' [online] Available at: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/fairtrade-coffee-fails-to-help-the-poor-british-report-finds/article18852585/ [Accessed 27 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, R. (2014). ''Fairtrade 'fails to help poor farmers', says damning investigation.'' [online] Mail Online. Available at: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2639135/Fairtrade-fails-help-poor-farmers-Damning-investigation-says-profits-sent-help-Uganda-Ethiopia-not-reach-workforce.html [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Fairtrade producers are only able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified over years, while the rest are sold as uncertified at the market prices.

===Fairtrade helps the rich to a larger extent===
Fair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries rather than that in poor countries. In order to qualify as Fairtrade producers, cooperatives must meet the strict standards set by Fairtrade International, implying that their fellow farmers must be quite skilful and educated. However, it is criticised that these farmers are predominantly from poorest countries, thus lacking the power to bargain with the cooperatives. Corruption even occurs in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Sylla, N. (2014). ''Fairtrade is an unjust movement that serves the rich | Ndongo Samba Sylla. [online] the Guardian. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/05/fairtrade-unjust-movement-serves-rich [Accessed 26 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inefficient marketing system===
There have been complaints that Fairtrade certified products should not be sold through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative because it may be inefficient and corruption easily takes place. Fairtrade farmers should have the right to choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperatives are going bankrupt &lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). ''Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), pp. 42)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other certification and product labelings==
* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] does not certify individual products, but instead evaluates an entire business.
* The FTO Mark, launched in 2004 by [[World Fair Trade Organization]], and identifies registered fair trade organizations.
* [[UTZ Certified|UTZ CERTIFIED]] is a coffee certification program that has sometimes been dubbed "[[Fairtrade]] lite" &lt;ref name="Conroy, Michael 2007 pp.252"&gt;Conroy, Michael (2007). Branded! p252&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.counterculturecoffee.com/ Counter Culture Direct Trade Certification] is a [[direct trade]] alternative to the [[Fairtrade certification]].
* [[Whole Trade Guarantee#Whole Trade Guarantee|Whole Trade Guarantee]], a purchasing initiative launched in 2007 by [[Whole Foods Market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/04/02/fairs-fair-at-whole-foods.aspx Fair's Fair at Whole Foods] The Motley Fool, April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Farouk Shami''' is a [[Palestinian-American]] businessman and founder of the hair-care and spa products company, Farouk Systems located in Texas. He was born in [[Beit Ur al-Tahta]], a village near [[Ramallah]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20100219-50-things-you-need-to-know-9450.ece 50 things you need to know about Farouk Shami]. ''The Dallas Morning News''. 2010-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Shami ran in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 Texas gubernatorial election]].

==Entrepreneur==
Shami has worked for decades in the field of hair-care product development, and attended [[cosmetology]] school in [[Arkansas]]. 
He invented the first [[ammonia]]- free hair color, after developing an allergy to the chemical that initially led doctors to encourage him to leave his profession.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

His company, the Houston-based Farouk Systems, currently employs 600+ people in the US, and exports its line of hair and skin care products under the BioSilk, SunGlitz and Cationic Hydration Interlink (CHI) brands to over 106 countries worldwide.

On May 1, 2011, Shami made an appearance on ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 11)|The Celebrity Apprentice]]'', when the show's contestants were given a project in which they promoted Farouk Systems products. He appeared again in the 4th episode of [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 13)|All Star Celebrity Apprentice]].

==Controversy as Gubernatorial candidate==
On Nov 19, 2009 Shami announced he was [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2010|running for governor]] of Texas as a Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/11/08-barack-hussein-obama-10-far.html&lt;/ref&gt; During his campaign, he stated that he is not a member of any one specific organized religion, but said that he has a deep sense of personal relationship with God and that he felt a 'religious tug' in deciding to run for the public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Farouk's Official Statement On His Personal Religious Beliefs 1/11/2010 |work=Farouk Shami campaign web site |url=http://www.faroukforgovernor.com/page/farouks-official-statement-on-his-personal-religious-beliefs |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115064033/http://www.faroukforgovernor.com/page/farouks-official-statement-on-his-personal-religious-beliefs |archivedate=January 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 50 facts about Farouk Shami | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/state/stories/022110dnpol50thingsshami.1320e5707.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shami lost to former Mayor [[Bill White (Texas politician)|Bill White]] in Democratic Primary by over a 60% margin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/2010/maps/&lt;/ref&gt;

Shami has had controversial moments on the campaign trail. Most notably, when asked if he believed it was possible the U.S. government had involvement in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Shami stated that he was "not sure" if the U.S. government was behind the bombing or not. After being given a chance to clarify his statement, Shami again stated the jury was out and refused to rule out the possibility. In the same interview with a Dallas radio station, Shami stated that he mostly hired blacks and Hispanics because he does not believe that whites wanted to work on factory floors. He stated that white people would want positions as supervisors or would want to be paid more than their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;KVUE-TV Austin.[http://www.kvue.com/news/Shami-Whites-dont-want-to-work-in-factories-84298902.html Shami: 'Whites don't want to work in factories' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216084840/http://www.kvue.com/news/Shami-Whites-dont-want-to-work-in-factories-84298902.html |date=2010-02-16 }}, [[Dallas Morning News]], February 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = People they admire him | url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/03/texas_primary | work=The Economist | date=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shami was a member of the board of the [[American Task Force on Palestine]], he resigned in 2010. [https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Detail.jsp?ssl=1298%20%20%20%200334 Tax records show] he currently owns the building at 1732 Wisconson Ave used by PLO as their mission in Washington, DC. The Trump administration asked the PLO to close their mission  on Sept 10, 2018.

'''George Hunter''' Esq., [[Justice of the peace|JP]] (1788 – 19 July 1843) was the first [[Mayor of Wellington City|Mayor of Wellington]], New Zealand in 1842–43. He was also the first mayor in New Zealand.

==Family==
Born in McDuff Parish, [[Banffshire]], Scotland he came to [[Wellington]] in the ship ''[[Duke of Roxburgh (ship)|Duke of Roxburgh]]'' in 1840, with his wife Helen, six daughters and four sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZGWS18400502.2.10 |title=Shipping Intelligence |work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator |volume=I |issue=4 |date=2 May 1840 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chapelwick.co.nz/History/index.htm | title=History | website=Chapelwick Coastal Estate and Historic Chapel | accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter's wife was the daughter of David Souter, Esq, Chief Factor to the Right Honorable [[James Duff, 4th Earl Fife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Municipal Council |work=New Zealand Colonist and Port Nicholson Advertiser |volume=I |issue=104 |date=28 July 1843 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was described by [[Mary Anne Swainson|Mary Swainson]] as having a bald head, circular spectacles and beaming eyes, and as exactly resembling Mr Pickwick of [[Charles Dickens]] ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. He was one of the founders of the Pickwick Club in Wellington.

Shortly after his arrival, Hunter asked [[Samuel Parnell]], a carpenter he had met on the ship, to build him a store on [[Lambton Quay]], to which Parnell agreed, provided he only worked eight hours a day, the beginning of the [[Eight-hour day|Eight Hour Day]] in New Zealand. As there were only three carpenters in Wellington, Hunter reluctantly agreed to this condition.&lt;ref name="Te Papa bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=1413 | title=Biography of George Hunter | publisher=[[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] | accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter's eldest son, [[George Hunter (politician, born 1821)|George Hunter]] and his grandson Sir [[George Hunter (politician, born 1859)|George Hunter]] were both [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]].

==Business interests==
Prior to coming to New Zealand, Hunter had worked for a major mercantile establishment in [[Aberdeen]]. He moved to [[London]] where he worked as a merchant until leaving in 1839 for New Zealand with the New Zealand Company.

He was in business on [[Willis Street]] with Kenneth Bethune as general and shipping merchants, and lived in Tinakori Road, where [[Premier House]] was later built.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Hunter was the Storemaster-General of the [[New Zealand Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Appointments | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | page=3 | date=18 April 1840 | issue=2 | volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1840 he was appointed as a Director of the Wellington Branch of the [[Union Bank of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Advertisements, Column 2 | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=25 April 1840 | volume=25 | issue=3 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841 Hunter was appointed to the Committee of the [[Flax in New Zealand|New Zealand Flax Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New Zealand Flax Association | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=13 March 1841 | volume=I | issue=48 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic duty==
Hunter's first appointment to public office in Wellington was as a member of the Management Committee of the [[Port Nicholson]] Exchange Room and Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Port Nicholson Exchange Room and Public Library | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=19 December 1840 | issue=36 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first Justices of the Court in Wellington, which was founded in October 1841, having been appointed a Justice of the Peace some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Court of Quarter Sessions | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=6 October 1841 | volume=06 | issue=78 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter was also involved in creating regulations for managing [[Wellington Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=23 April 1842 | volume=III | issue=135 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passing of the Municipal Corporation Bill in 1842, Wellington was able to elect its own mayor and aldermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=13 August 1842 | volume=III | issue=167 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 October 1842, Hunter, with the most votes of the 12 aldermen elected to the new Wellington Borough, was declared elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=5 October 1842 | volume=III | issue=182 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial business of the Council was the appointment of officers and organising its finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Municipal Council | work=New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator | date=19 October 1842 | volume=III | issue=186 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, while attending a meeting to express sympathy for the victims of the [[Wairau Affray]] he caught a chill and died a few days later.&lt;ref name="Te Papa bio" /&gt; His funeral was a significant one, attended by both local [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pākehā]] alike. He was buried at [[Bolton Street Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wellington.govt.nz/services/community-and-culture/cemeteries/cemeteries-search/details?id=97442&amp;serviceType=Burial | title=Details | publisher=[[Wellington City Council]] | accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was succeeded as mayor by [[William Guyton]].

==Public Controversies==
=== Firing Scandal ===

On July 22, 2013, reportedly after servicing a large group of Glass Lewis employees based in the New York City home office, Brendon O'Connor, an employee of the Milk Truck food truck, tweeted "Shout out to the good people of Glass, Lewis &amp; Co. for placing a $170 order and not leaving a tip."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-food-truck-fires-worker-gripes-customer-tips-article-1.1414093&lt;/ref&gt; Citing demands from a Glass Lewis representative, O'Connor's employer promptly fired him in response. &lt;ref&gt;http://boingboing.net/2013/07/30/meet-glass-lewis-and-co-the.html&lt;/ref&gt; The official Glass Lewis twitter page, in response to confirmation of O'Connor's termination, then publicly thanked O'Connor's former employer for firing him. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/GlassLewis/status/360120598283825152&lt;/ref&gt;

A large and multinational public backlash then ensued with, at some point, as many as 10 statements per second being posted on Twitter demanding either a boycott of Glass Lewis or Milk Truck.&lt;ref&gt;http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/milk_truck_owner_fired_employee_for.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Policies==
Glass Lewis has stated that it will use its shareholder proxy to vote against boards of directors that are not adequately diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Lewis 2018 Proxy Paper Guidelines|url=http://www.glasslewis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/US_Guidelines_2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinbar|first1=Sharon|title=How big money can drive diversity in venture capital – TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/how-big-money-can-drive-diversity-in-venture-capital/|website=techcrunch.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Nicolás de Teresa y Miranda''' (August 23, 1850, [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla, Mexico]] - January 11, 1902, in  [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]],)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ai Camp |first=Roderic|title=Mexican Political Biographies, 1884–1934 |year=1991|publisher= University of Texas |location=Austin, Texas|isbn=0-292-75119-2|ref=mexpol}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Mexican businessman and politician. His parents were  [[Nicolás de Teresa y Sánchez Tamés]], founder of the [[Banco Mercantil Mexicano]], and [[Dolores Miranda Muñoz]], daughter of the vice-consul of Spain in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marichal|first=Carlos|title=Empresarios españoles de ida y vuelta  en el México porfiriano y en la España de la Restauración.

José de Teresa married María Luisa Romero Rubio on July 2, 1886,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Paz, et. al. |title=Los hombres prominentes de México |year=1888|publisher= La Patria|location=Mexico|isbn=|ref=hombprom}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of the famous politician [[Manuel Romero Rubio]] and sister-in-law of [[Porfirio Díaz]], who was the president of Mexico from 1876 to 1911. He became City Council of Mexico and Senator of [[Yucatan|Yucatán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ai Camp |first=Roderic|title=Mexican Political Biographies, 1884–1934 |year=1991|publisher= University of Texas |location=Austin, Texas|isbn=0-292-75119-2|ref=mexpol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

José de Teresa was the first ambassador of Mexico in Austria when finally the diplomatic relations between the two countries were re-established after a long period of tensions following the execution of [[Maximilian of Habsburg|Maximilian I of Mexico]] in 1867 by hands of [[Benito Juárez|Benito Juarez]]. José de Teresa died in [[Vienna]], and some rumors interpreted it as the Austrian revenge for the murder of Maximiliano.

José de Teresa created the '''Centro Mercantil''', the first store to accept credit sales in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bunker|first=Steven B. |title=Creating Mexican Consumer Culture in the Age of Porfirio Díaz |year=2012|publisher= University of New Mexico Press|location=New Mexico|isbn=|ref=consumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building that José de Teresa commanded for the '''Centro Mercantil''' was constructed in [[Old Portal de Mercaderes (Mexico City)|Portal de Mercaderes]] and became the first in [[Art Nouveau]] style in Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7774">'''José Carlos Brunoro''' ([[Santo André]], 11 June 1950), commonly known as '''Brunoro''', was the CEO of [[Palmeiras]], one of Brazil's largest soccer teams, and the co-founder of [[Grêmio Osasco Audax Esporte Clube]]. He has over 40 years of experience in professional sports in a plethora of positions: professional athlete, trainer, coach, sports executive, sports marketing consultant, appointed member of  the national council for sports (CNE) by Brazil’s ministry of sports, among others. Brunoro held executive positions in different professional sports such as [[volleyball]], [[soccer]], [[Formula One]], and [[basketball]]. 

==Palmeiras== 
Between 1992 and 1996, Brunoro was a soccer executive at [[Palmeiras]] and signed young players like [[Rivaldo]], [[Roberto Carlos]], who are now recognized as some of the best of all times. On June 12 1993, Palmeiras won the São Paulo championship, beating the rival Corinthians 4x0 in the final. The last major title that the club had won was in 1976, 17 years prior to that one.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.lance.com.br/palmeiras/torcedores-verdao-contam-suas-historias-sobre-junho-1993.html Torcedores do Verdão contam suas histórias sobre 12 de junho de 1993, Lance! 14 de junho de 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Brunoro became the CEO of [[Palmeiras]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://esportes.estadao.com.br/noticias/futebol,por-profissionalizacao-brunoro-sera-ceo-no-palmeiras,987843 Por Profissionalização, Brunoro será CEO no Palmeiras - Estadão.com 23/01/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;Brazil’s fourth largest team with over 10 million fans.

In the beginning of his mandate as CEO, in January 2013, Brunoro ended speculations about bringing Argentine superstar [[Juan Román Riquelme]] to play for [[Palmeiras]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/2013/01/palmeiras-desiste-de-riquelme-nao-podemos-nos-dar-ao-luxo-diz-nobre.html Palmeiras desiste de Riquelme.

==Audax==
In 2003, Brunoro co-founded Audax with [[Abilio Diniz]] and Fernando Solleiro.

From 2003 to 2013, Brunoro led Audax. He left the project to become CEO of Palmeiras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/305970_jose-carlos-brunoro-dividira-atencao-entre-palmeiras-e-os-x-games Jose Carlos Brunoro dividirá atenção entre Palmeiras e os X Games, ESPN.com.br 25 de Janeiro de 2013] &lt;/ref&gt;
Audax, led by Brunoro, organized tryouts for about 70 thousand players to select athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sindicatodeatletas.com.br/?pg=noticias&amp;id=377 Pão de Açúcar, da Série A-2, tem novo nome. Confira, Sindicato de Atletas de São Paulo 18 de Julho de 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In 2016, Audax reached the final of São Paulo Championship, eliminating São Paulo in the quarter finals 4x1, and Corinthians in the semi-final at Corinthians home, where the team had won all its 12 matches in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/sp/futebol/campeonato-paulista/noticia/2016/05/em-osasco-santos-e-audax-comecam-disputa-pelo-titulo-do-paulistao-2016.html, Em Osasco Santos e Audax Comecam Disputa Pelo Titulo do Paulistao 2016, Globoesporte.com 01 de Maio de 2016]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">A '''legal nurse consultant''' ('''LNC''') is a [[registered nurse]] who uses expertise as a [[health care provider]] and specialized [[training]] to consult on medical-related [[legal case]]s. LNCs assist [[Lawyer|attorneys]] in reading [[medical record]]s and understanding medical terminology and [[healthcare]] issues to achieve the best results for their clients.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/?page=WhatisanLNC "What is an LNC?"] on the AALNC website&lt;/ref&gt;  The specialty is a relatively recent one, beginning in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

A legal nurse consultant bridges gaps in an attorney's knowledge. While the attorney is an expert on legal issues, the LNC is an expert on [[nursing]] and the health care system. LNCs screen cases for merit, assist with [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]; conduct the existing literature and [[Biomedical research|medical research]]; review medical records; identify [[Standard of care|standards of care]]; prepare reports and summaries on the extent of injury or illness; create [[demonstrative evidence]]; and locate or act as [[expert witness]]es. The legal nurse consultant acts as a specialized member of the [[litigation]] team whose professional contributions are often critical to achieving a fair and just outcome for all parties.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt;

A legal nurse consultant differs from a [[paralegal]] in that a paralegal assists attorneys in the delivery of legal services and frequently requires a [[legal education]], while a legal nurse consultant is first and foremost a practictioner of nursing, and legal education is not necessarily a prerequisite. A legal nurse consultant uses existing expertise as a health care professional to consult and educate clients on specific medical and nursing issues in their cases.

Aside from within law firms, LNCs may also be found working for government agencies, insurance companies and [[HMO]]s, in hospitals as part of the [[risk management]] department, and may also be in independent practice.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt;

The [[American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants]] (AALNC), which was founded in 1989, is a non-profit membership organization whose mission is to promote legal nurse consulting as a nursing speciality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/?page=MissionStatement "Mission and Goals"] on the AALNC website&lt;/ref&gt;  The Association also promulgates a Code of Ethics for the Legal Nurse Consultant practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/resource/resmgr/becoming_a_lnc_page/codeofethicsupdated2009final.pdf "Codes of Ethics"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on the AALNC website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2001, the Association had approximately 4,000 members, the majority of whom had joined after 1994.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

There are a number of training courses and [[certification]]s available for LNCs. The American Legal Nurse Consultant Certification Board offers an online examination which is the only LNC certification exam credited by the [[American Board of Nursing Specialties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/page/LNCC/? "LNCC"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630034242/http://www.aalnc.org/page/LNCC/ |date=2012-06-30 }} on the AALNC website&lt;/ref&gt; Other training and certification programs are available from both commercial and non-commercial organizations.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; As of 2001, the [[American Bar Association]] sanctioned 28 LNC programs across the United States.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last= Murphy |first= Kate |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/18/business/18PROF.html |title= Private sector: From hospital to law office |newspaper= New York Times |date= February 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AACSB Accredited.svg|thumbnail|Logo of accredited schools]]
There are 182 schools that hold the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business's]] (AACSB) [[Accounting]] [[Accreditation]]. The AACSB accredits [[business school]]s by evaluating critical areas of each school to ensure that it provides top-quality education,&lt;ref name="AACSB Accreditation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/aacsb.asp|publisher=AACSB International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and schools can apply for the [[accounting]] accreditation, which focusses on the schools' accounting programs, in addition to business accreditation.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/|publisher=AACSB International|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation is gained and maintained via a peer-review system, and schools are assessed in the context of their respective missions rather than against a fixed standard.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Melissa|title=B-School Accrediting Body Retools Standards|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323820304578411071717286236|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To apply for accounting accreditation, a school is required either to already hold the business accreditation, or to apply for both the business and accounting accreditations at the same time.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt;

The initial accounting accreditation process starts with the submission of an eligibility application, and includes self-evaluations and peer reviews.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt; The business school and the accounting academic unit are evaluated on their alignment with the AACSB's accreditation standards; under the standard for accounting accreditation, an accounting academic unit is evaluated based on its mission, intellectual contributions, and financial strategies for achieving its mission. For example, one of the bases of evaluation is whether the academic unit has produced intellectual contributions that have affected [[accounting]], [[business]] and [[management]] "in ways that are consistent with the mission, expected outcomes, and strategies of the unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility Procedures and Accreditation Standards for Accounting Accreditation |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108093650/http://aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |archivedate= 8 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the accounting accreditation is extended via 5-year review cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook For Joint Business And Accounting Continuous Improvement Reviews |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175301/http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the AACSB estimated that 5% of all business programs internationally, and most top business programs in the [[United States]], held AACSB accreditation.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013" /&gt; AACSB accreditation is seen as a standard requirement in graduate business education, and universities are more likely to accept [[transfer credit]] earned from accredited schools;&lt;ref name="HK 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilpert|first=Ditmar|author2=Thomas Kern |title=Success Factors of American Business Schools or "How Business Schools Attract Promising Students"|journal=Applied Marketing|year=2003|pages=995–1012|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18981-4_87|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it has been called "the hallmark of excellence in business education".&lt;ref name=SMU&gt;{{cite web|title=SMU is one of the youngest universities to receive accreditation from oldest global accrediting body AACSB International|url=http://www.smu.edu.sg/news/2011/04/11/smu-one-youngest-universities-receive-accreditation-oldest-global-accrediting-body|publisher=Singapore Management University|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Martyn Arbib''' is a British businessman who led the [[Perpetual plc|Perpetual]] [[asset management|fund management]] company during the late 20th century, unusually based in [[Henley-on-Thames]], rather than London.

In January 2008, Swindon Town Holdings Limited, where Arbib is an investor but not a director, took control of [[Swindon Town FC]].

The established '''nuclear industry in South Australia''' is focused on [[uranium mining]], milling and the export of uranium oxide concentrate for use in the production of nuclear fuel for [[nuclear power plant]]s. The state is home to the world's largest known single deposit of uranium, which is worked by [[BHP Billiton]] at the [[Olympic Dam mine]]. Contaminated legacy sites exist at [[Maralinga]] and [[Emu Field, South Australia|Emu Field]], where nuclear weapons tests were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s and at former uranium mines and milling sites. Nuclear waste is stored by CSIRO at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] and future waste storage prospects were considered during the deliberations of the [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] in 2016. The Commission has recommended that South Australia considers opportunities in nuclear waste storage (including developing a repository for spent nuclear fuel), the establishment of a nuclear fuel leasing scheme and the repeal of prohibitions which currently prevent future nuclear industrial development nationally.

In June 2017, former Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] acknowledged fellow former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]]'s support for expanding the nuclear industry and asserted that the "Australian Labor government under Premier Jay Weatherill would like to develop new industries to supplement the uranium mine at Roxby Downs. Why not have a nuclear submarine servicing facility in that state – and the industries that would inevitably spin-off?"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cis.org.au/commentary/articles/transcript-the-hon-tony-abbot-mp-submarines-why-settle-for-second-best/|title=TRANSCRIPT.

== Uranium mining ==
[[File:Radium Hill 1954.jpg|alt=Radium Hill uranium mine (1954)|thumb|Radium Hill uranium mine (1954)]]
[[Uranium mining in Australia|Uranium mining]] has occurred in [[South Australia]], since the early 20th century, when [[radium]] was the target mineral in uranium-bearing ore. During the Cold War, the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] government facilitated the development of the [[Radium Hill uranium mine]] and the associated Port Pirie uranium treatment complex. These closed in the early 1960s after a seven-year contract of supply had been fulfilled. In the 1970s, the discovery of a massive uranium-bearing [[iron oxide copper gold ore deposits|IOCG orebody]] near [[Roxby Downs, South Australia|Roxby Downs]] led to the eventual opening of the Olympic Dam mine in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110611186|title=Official opening of Roxby Downs – The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 – 1995) – 5 Nov 1988|website=Trove|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the sector expanded to include [[In situ leach|in-situ leach mining]] operations at [[Beverley Uranium Mine|Beverley]], [[Four Mile uranium mine|Four Mile]] and [[Honeymoon Uranium Mine|Honeymoon]]. As of May 2016, Beverley and Honeymoon mines are in care and maintenance mode&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/mining/mines_and_quarries|title=Mines and quarries|website=minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; owing to weak uranium prices in the wake of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]].

Exploration for uranium in South Australia reached a record high in 2006 with forty companies exploring for the mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sarigbasis.pir.sa.gov.au/WebtopEw/ws/samref/sarig1/image/DDD/MESAJ080.pdf|title=20 Years of MESA Journal|website=MESA Journal 80 – 1|publisher=Government of South Australia|page=6|access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uranium export ===
Uranium mined in South Australia is exported, where it is used in the production of nuclear fuel for use in nuclear power plants. In 2013, uranium oxide concentrate produced in South Australia was being exported to Britain, France, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill expressed his support for exporting uranium to India, despite its status as a non-signatory to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty/Treaty text|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3367260.htm|title=SA Premier supports uranium export to India|date=15 November 2011|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2015, no further barriers remained preventing such trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/12/19/australias-nuclear-deal-with-india_n_8824564.html|title=Australia Ready For Uranium Sales To India|website=Huffington Post Australia|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rowan Ramsey (2015).jpg|thumb|Rowan Ramsey (2015)]]
Concentrations of nuclear waste in South Australia exist in the tailings ponds at the Olympic Dam mine, at the site of the former Port Pirie uranium treatment works and in the tailings block at the former Radium Hill mine. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] operates a nuclear waste storage facility at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] in the state's far north. Unsuccessful attempts were made by the [[Howard Government]] to establish further [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste storage]] facilities in South Australia between 1998 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-22/a-timeline-of-south-australia's-nuclear-dump-debate/6794606|title=A timeline of South Australia's nuclear dump debate|date=22 September 2015|publisher=ABC News|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prospective nuclear waste storage site at Barndioota was announced in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-13/government-releases-shortlist-sites-for-nuclear-waste-storage/6937244|title=Six sites shortlisted for nuclear waste storage facility|date=12 November 2015|publisher=ABC News|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property is owned by [[Grant Chapman]], and the traditional owners are the [[Adnyamathanha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-29/nuclear-waste-dump-expected-south-australian-cattle-station/7369346|title=SA cattle station could be first nuclear waste dump site|date=28 April 2016|publisher=ABC News|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is a candidate for a future National Nuclear Waste Management Facility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioactivewaste.gov.au/|title=National Radioactive Waste Management Facility|publisher=radioactivewaste.gov.au|dead-url=|access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where domestically produced nuclear waste, and repatriated, reprocessed [[spent nuclear fuel]] from Australia's research reactors at Lucas Heights would be stored. Two other candidate sites exist near [[Kimba, South Australia|Kimba]] on [[Eyre Peninsula]], and as of 2017, community consultation there is ongoing.

The Kimba sites are located in the federal electorate of Grey, for which [[Rowan Ramsey|Rowan Ramsay]] is the sitting member. Ramsey has publicly advocated for the establishment of nuclear waste storage facilities in South Australia, and has stated that he would be comfortable storing it on his own property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/lib-mp-happy-to-store-nuclear-waste/news-story/9e93eed3f783657116093ff7d0af22a4|title=Lib MP happy to store nuclear waste|work=NewsComAu|access-date=3 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsay did not nominate his own property for the project after receiving advice that it would constitute a [[conflict of interest]]. Opinion on the benefits and risks associated with establishing a facility has divided the township of Kimba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-02-18/nuclear-dump-support-at-kimba-diifficult-to-determine/7181410|title=Kimba community divided over proposed nuclear dump|date=18 February 2016|work=ABC Rural|access-date=3 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the establishment of a new national facility for domestically produced nuclear waste believe that such waste should be stored long-term at Lucas Heights, where much of the waste was and continues to be generated. Spokespeople for the opposition include [[Jim Green (activist)|Jim Green]] of [[Friends of the Earth Australia|Friends of the Earth]] and [[Dave Sweeney|David Sweeney]] of the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/kimba-votes-yes-to-radioactive-waste-dump-in-eyre-peninsula/news-story/96ca27ddaa0f67519b60a366584156bc|title=Kimba votes yes to radioactive waste dump|access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of storing nuclear waste in the tunnels of the Olympic Dam mine has also been speculated upon by opinion writers, politicians and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themonitor.com.au/news-articles/160616-ramsey-visits-ahead-of-important-election|title=160616 – Ramsey visits ahead of 'important' Election|publisher=themonitor.com.au|access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the development of new nuclear waste storage facilities in South Australia was expressed by the [[Committee for Adelaide]] on 6 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-06/nuclear-dump-investigation-committee-for-adelaide/7391554|title=Finland nuke trip convinces delegation to support SA waste dump plan|date=6 May 2016|publisher=ABC News|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission's final report, which was delivered to the Governor of South Australia on 6 May 2016 recommended the consideration of the establishment of a repository for imported spent nuclear fuel in South Australia. The report was released in full on 9 May 2016.

The report was put before a Citizens Jury, which ultimately voted not to proceed with investigating the prospect of importing spent nuclear fuel for storage and disposal in South Australia. In December 2016, a group of prominent citizens signed an open letter expressing an opposing view. It stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We, the undersigned, call on South Australia’s elected representatives of all parties to continue to explore this opportunity. We request further investigations into issues that a) are essential for better understanding project feasibility and b) could be investigated at relatively low cost.

In March 2017, it was estimated that $30&amp;nbsp;million would need to be spent to manage nuclear waste stored at Woomera. Barrels containing the wastes were found to be rusting and deteriorating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/deteriorating-radioactive-waste-barrels-at-woomera-require-30-million-cleanup-by-csiro/news-story/35e145b33ce748406d46d892ade39e96|title=Deteriorating radioactive waste barrels at Woomera require $30&amp;nbsp;million clean-up by CSIRO|last=Jean|first=Peter|date=14 March 2017|work=The Advertiser|access-date=3 September 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear weapons ==
A series of British [[Nuclear weapons tests in Australia|nuclear weapons tests]] were conducted at [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga and Emu Field]] during the 1950s and early 1960s. Land remains contaminated at these sites and access is restricted.

Australia has no domestic nuclear weapons nor the capability to develop them. Australia is allied with countries which do maintain nuclear arsenals. As of 2016 the [[Liberal-National Coalition]] does not support a prospective ban on the possession of nuclear weapons, while the [[Australian Labor Party]] and [[Australian Greens]] do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/barack-obama-goes-to-hiroshima-while-australia-stops-worrying-and-loves-the-bomb-20160525-gp3gi2.html|title=Barack Obama makes history in Hiroshima, while Australia stops worrying and loves the bomb|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential expansion ==
In 2015, a [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] was initiated by the Government of South Australia. It was tasked with investigating opportunities and risks associated with potential expansion of the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. Commissioner [[Kevin Scarce]] delivered its final report to the Governor of South Australia on 6 May 2016. The Commission's final report recommended the repeal of prohibitions preventing nuclear industrial development in Australia, including the legalisation of nuclear power generation. The report recommended the establishment of a facility to store international stockpiled [[spent nuclear fuel]] and the consideration of a [[nuclear fuel leasing]] scheme to accompany it. The latter was also described by the Commission as a potential enabler for future [[Enriched uranium|enrichment]] and fuel processing activities, though such further processing developments were deemed to not be feasible within the next decade. The establishment of nuclear power generation in South Australia was also deemed inappropriate given the state's high penetration of solar and wind power.{{Main|Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission}}

=== 2016–17 ===
The Government of South Australia has allocated $3.6&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Department of the Premier and Cabinet (South Australia)|Department of the Premier and Cabinet]] for 2016–17 "to enable the government to engage with the community to develop an informed response to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission Final Report."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://servicesa.cdn.on.net/budget201617/pdfs/budget/2016-17_budget_measures_statement.pdf|title=2016–17 STATE BUDGET – Budget Paper 5 – Budget Measures Statement|last=|first=|publisher=Government of South Australia|year=2016|isbn=|location=Adelaide, South Australia|pages=69–70|issn=1440-8589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Citizens' Jury process ====
[[File:Nigel McBride, Business SA at CEDA event in Adelaide (2016).jpg|alt=Nigel McBride, Business SA|thumb|Nigel McBride, Business SA]]
Following the conclusion of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission, the Department of the Premier and Cabinet established a "YourSAy nuclear?" website, advertising campaign and Citizens' Jury process. Managed by the [[New Democracy Foundation]], the Citizens' Jury process randomly invited 25,000 South Australians to participate by post. Of those who accepted the invitation, a total of 350 jurors will be chosen to meet and discuss the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission's final report, help produce a simplified version for further discussion, and ultimately express their support or rejection of its various recommendations. South Australian company DemocracyCo won the contract to facilitate the first Citizens' Jury. DemocracyCo spokesperson Emily Jenke described the process and its result as "one of the pieces the Premier and Government will be using to inform their thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indaily.com.au/news/local/2016/06/03/nuclear-jury-about-the-big-picture-not-manufacturing-consent/|title=Nuclear jury about the big picture, not manufacturing consent – InDaily|date=3 June 2016|website=InDaily|access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Citizens Jury produced a report after hearing witnesses and deliberating over four sitting days. Its publication was followed by the launch of a statewide community consultation program coordinated by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. The campaign carried the slogan "Get to know nuclear. Discover. Discuss. Decide" and included print, radio and television commercials, online discussions and community displays attended by DPC staff.

A second jury was later formed, expanding the cohort of jurors to approximately 350 people.

After hearing from a larger cohort of expert witnesses, the citizens' jury ultimately concluded, by a two-thirds majority vote, to not pursue to prospect of the importation of spent nuclear fuel to South Australia under any circumstances. A "lack of trust" was cited as a primary driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/citizens-jury-overwhelmingly-rejects-nuclear-waste-storage-facility-for-south-australia/news-story/8340c103234775fffcf9b88b2aea6906|title='No decision' on nuclear waste plan: Weatherill|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear submarines ===
[[File:Barracuda-Suffren.svg|alt=Profile of the Barracuda type submarine, with her pump-jet propeller and X-shaped stern planes.|thumb|Profile of the Barracuda type submarine, with her pump-jet propeller and X-shaped stern planes.]]
The prospect of constructing nuclear submarines in South Australia has been raised on various occasions during the 2010s.

In 2011, the CEO of [[Defence SA]], [[Andrew Fletcher (businessman)|Andrew Fletcher]] expressed his personal view that it would be unlikely for Australia's Future Submarine project to commit to producing nuclear powered submarines, unless a nuclear industry was established in Australia beforehand, or if their production was outsourced offshore. He expressed his belief that a commitment to 12 diesel-powered submarines was more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiandefence.com.au/news/from-the-source-andrew-fletcher-chief-executive-officer-of-defence-sa|title=From The Source: Andrew Fletcher Chief Executive Officer of Defence SA|access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors from [[UCL Australia]] have written opinion pieces and produced research papers on the topic. In 2016, the contract for the supply of Australia's Future Submarines Project was awarded to French company [[Direction des Constructions Navales Services]] (DCNS), and the [[French Barracuda-class submarine|Barracuda-class submarine]] was selected. The Barracuda-class submarine is currently a [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear powered submarine]], but the Australian Government has sought a modified design with diesel-powered pump jet propulsion. The other bidders which were competing for the tender do not make nuclear powered submarines. Australian Cabinet ministers have discussed the merits of keeping the nuclear propulsion option open by choosing the Barracuda-class design and the coalition government is supportive of nuclear industrial development in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/business/manufacturing/coalition-plans-nuclearpowered-submarine-fleet-over-long-term-20160429-goieal|title=Coalition plans nuclear-powered submarine fleet over long term|date=1 May 2016|website=Financial Review|access-date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, former [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls Royce]] [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear engineer]] and submarine expert [[Steve Ludlam (engineer)|Steve Ludlam]] was appointed to the [[Defence SA Advisory Board]].

in 2017, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke of the merits of considering nuclear propulsion for Australia's Future Submarine Project, claiming various advantages over diesel propulsion, including range and speed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Opposition ===
There has been considerable Australian resistance to [[uranium mining]] for some decades. There have been concerns that uranium drives the global nuclear weapons cycle, disturbs or degrades [[sacred sites]], releases carcinogenic [[radon gas]], and contaminates [[groundwater]]. Nuclear power is considered by opponents as an unsafe, centralised, and secretive energy option, which creates security risks.

'''Ochre Court''' is a large [[châteauesque]] mansion in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], United States. Commissioned by [[Ogden Goelet]], it was built at a cost of $4.5 million in 1892. It is the second largest mansion in Newport after nearby [[The Breakers]]. These two mansions, along with [[Belcourt Castle]] (the 3rd largest mansion) and [[Marble House]], were designed by architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]]. It is owned by [[Salve Regina University]].&lt;ref name="salve"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salve.edu/virtualtour/ochre-court |title=Ochre Court |work=Salve Regina University |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Goelets were an American dynasty that had grown from humble 18th century trade into vast 19th century investments. [[Ogden Goelet]] was a banker, real estate investor and competitive yachtsman. His wife, Mary Wilson Goelet, oversaw the operation of Ochre Court during a typical eight-week summer season.  This usually required twenty-seven house servants, eight coachmen and grooms and twelve gardeners.&lt;ref name="salve"/&gt;

[[File:Salve-gates.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Main entrance]]
Richard Morris Hunt designed Ochre Court, modelling the mansion on the chateaux of France's [[Loire Valley]]. The design is in the [[Louis XIII]]-style of architecture, with high roofs, turrets, tall chimneys and elaborate dormers. Elaborate decoration is seen inside and out in classical-style ceiling paintings, heraldry, carved emblems and statues, and a profusion of stained glass.&lt;ref name="salve"/&gt;

The Goelet's daughter, [[Mary Goelet|May]], married [[Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe]], taking with her an $8 million dowry. Their son, Robert, was a businessman with an interest in American railroads, hotels and real estate. Robert gave Ochre Court to the [[Sisters of Mercy]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="salve"/&gt;

==In Popular Culture==
The exterior of this mansion has been used for the movie ''[[True Lies]]'', to depict the Swiss mansion that Arnold Schwarzenegger infiltrates then escapes in the opening sequence.

In the video game [[Payday 2|''Payday 2'']], the architecture of ''Shacklethorne Mansion'', a fictional mansion which is the location of the ''Shacklethorne Auction'' heist in the game, was inspired by the backside of Ochre Court. ''Shacklethorne Auction'' does not take place in Newport, but in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15865">'''Shadi A. Karam''' received degrees from the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB), [[Columbia University]], and [[Harvard University]]. In his primary professional capacity, he is known as a specialist in the restructuring of organizations and distressed companies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winne.com/mena/lebanon/topinterviews/2004/shadi_karam.php "Interview with Shadi Karam," ''World Investment News''] May 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; most notably occupying the post of Financial Adviser to the Director General of [[UNESCO]] and serving as a [[Chairman]] and [[CEO]] of several major companies in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] in various sectors, ranging from [[Industry]] to Real Estate development, [[Hotels]], [[Trade|Trading]] and [[Financial Services]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zawya.com/pdfstory.cfm?storyid=DS20050415220025119&amp;l=064520050416 "BLC chairman says his independence was key to success," ''Zawya''] April 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Karam was born on September 16, 1948, in Lebanon. Among other aspects of his career, he has taught [[Economics]], [[Finance]] and [[Banking]] at several universities, such as [[Harvard University]], The University of Southern Europe, and the Institut des Etudes Politiques – IEP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confex-lebanon.com/speakerdetails.aspx?speakerid=416&amp;eventid=71 "Safeguarding the Lebanese Economy" Speech at the Confex-Lebanon Conference] February 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the [[Chairman]] of ASTRO Bank, Cyprus, formerly known as Piraeus Bank,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobank.com/Default.aspx?id=20345&amp;nt=18&amp;lang=2 "New Board of Directors at Piraeus Bank following a €40 million capital increase"].&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the [[Vice Chairman]] of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] Lebanon national committee and sits on several boards of commercial and investment banks in Lebanon and Syria.

Prior to this role, &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5209502.stm "Lebanon economy reels as attacks continue," by Jorn Madslien ''BBC NEWS''] July 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Karam served as the Special Adviser to H.E. the President of the Republic of Lebanon, [[Michel Suleiman]] for the duration of his six-year mandate and as Senior Adviser to Prime Minister [[Tammam Salam]] during the critical period of presidential vacancy in the country, 25 May 2014 to 31 October 2016. In this post, he launched a National Sustainable Development Strategy - acting as the national focal point for the Syrian refugee issue - and oversaw international relations for the Office of the Prime Minister. Karam also served as the Adviser to the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] in charge of Economic Affairs of the Arab Republic of Syria, Mr. [[Abdullah Dardari]], entrusted with driving the [[Public Private Partnership]] initiative in the country. Dardari is currently serving as the Senior Advisor on Reconstruction for the Middle East and North Africa at the World Bank.

A patron of the arts and of his alma mater AUB,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aub.edu.lb/development/campaign_report/Pages/ComprehensiveDonorList.aspx "AUB - Office of Development - Campaign Report - Comprehensive Donor List"] July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Karam is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Holy Spirit University Kaslik, the President of the Association Libanaise pour le Développement du Mécénat Culturel and holds several decorations, including the Grand Officer of the Spanish Order of Isabella the Catholic and an Officer of the Lebanese Order of the Cedar. Karam is married with three children, one girl and two boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidDS011108_dsart8/Behind%20closed%20doors%20at%20Beirut%27s%20very%20best%20smoke-filled%20room/ "Behind closed doors at Beirut's very best smoke-filled room" ''The Daily Star''] November 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The BLC Turnaround==
In 2002, the [[Banque du Liban]] (BDL) took control of BLC after bad management pushed the BLC to the edge of bankruptcy. The prospects for a turnaround were widely thought to be grim, with the Central Bank expected to, at best, protect deposits. However, [[Riad Salameh]], governor of the BDL, was determined to develop a plan to rebuild the bank and return it to profitability in Lebanon’s renowned and competitive banking sector. Accordingly, over the next three years he brought in a dynamic management team led by Karam, who already had a great deal of international experience having also worked for several years in the 1990s as a leading banker at [[Merrill Lynch]]. Karam was reportedly concerned about BLC’s fundamentals at first, telling the business magazine Executive: "The bank had a very high negative net worth. The level of accumulated net losses was historic plus... there were dramatic structural problems.” In late 2005, after successfully implementing a plan developed by Karam and approved by Salameh, the BDL decided to sell BLC. Initial reports said that Salemeh was hoping for a $150 million price tag, but bidding began at $165 million. The highest offer, however, came in at $236.37 million for a 96% stake from the High Supreme Council for Qatari Economic Affairs and Investment, which later became known as the [[Qatar Investment Authority]]. Salameh recovered all of the central bank’s investments and made a substantial profit of $90 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20060122133634/The%20Case%20For%20BLC%20Bank "The Case for BLC Bank" ''Executive Magazine''] December, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to Efforts==
Karam has been described as a leading, un-traditional Lebanese banker not only because he has international work experience in the field of finance, but also because he is politically and financially independent - something that Karam argues "protected [me] from being pressured or blackmailed by pressure groups and political parties, unlike other Lebanese bankers who are being criticized and attacked because of that fact." Although he was the subject of defamation campaigns, lawsuits and personal threats, he was able to avoid the pressure traditionally placed on business leaders in the country by politicians because Central Bank head Salameh allowed him complete autonomy in restructuring the troubled company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidDS20050415220025119/BLC%20chairman%20says%20his%20independence%20was%20key%20to%20success "BLC chairman says his independence was key to success," ''Zawya''] April 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microcredit Pioneer==
In 2004, Karam led BLC bank to become the first bank in the country to provide [[micro credit]] loans to small businesses. The Spanish microfinance cooperation program provided 4 million [[Euros]] for the effort initially, which directly injected much needed liquidity “directly into the veins of the economy,” as Karam put it at the time. “[Since] the success of this initiative depends on providing cheap financing to the micro-enterprises, it is imperative for the lending institution (BLC) to source out funds at low rates. For this reason, the management of BLC turned to outside funding agencies as costs of funds outside Lebanon are currently cheaper than the local market,” explained the bank’s press release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20040224080054, "Lebanon: BLC to be the first bank to provide micro-credit loans to small businesses," ''The Daily Star''] February 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning about Lebanon's Debt==
In 2008, Karam wrote a series of articles in the local and regional media laying out Lebanon's unsustainable debt situation (currently pegged at over 160% of debt to [[GDP]]) and recommending ways to deal with the looming crisis head on. "It is recognized that the public debt," he wrote, "is one of the most crucial problems that Lebanon faces today. More important than security considerations, it is susceptible, if mismanaged, to cause damage to the country's basic foundations far more lasting than burnt buildings and regrettable life loss. It is also likely to become itself a source of turbulence." Karam explained further that the country has been "on the brink of disaster for several years and were it not for the steps taken by the governor of the central bank, today and in past years, little would have been done to avoid the collapse." Such steps, he argued, "are cosmetic and their purpose is to avoid an immediate crisis and buy time for true reform and fundamental structural fiscal measures to be conceived and implemented. Financial engineering has never replaced sound policy."

Karam decried the lack of care or concern evinced by "political circles," asking, "What better illustration of the adage that if you owe a little sum you lose sleep over it but if you owe millions, it is your banker who loses sleep over it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuremovement.org/forum/showthread.php?t=37427 "Lebanon's public debt: the moment of truth," ''The Daily Star''] March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized his own industry, Lebanese banks, for being slow to reform themselves and to implement new Basel II regulations, a rare move by an insider for an insular sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20050830155610.jsp "Comprehensive Reform Essential for Lebanon's Economic Growth," by Shadi Karam, ''The Assyrian International News Agency''] August 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several op-eds later in the year, he called for a series of controversial structural reforms, saying that as a first matter, Lebanon "needs to address the [[Treasury]]'s financial priorities by starting to implement existing solutions to the problem of Electricite du Liban, thus tackling one of the main chunks of the budget deficit. Showing determination in this area will encourage the implementation of [[Paris III]] and maybe convince donors" not only to deflect assistance from specific projects to direct and indirect unconditional budget support, but also to "accelerate the pace of their payments." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Will+Lebanon%27s+politicians+spoil+yet+another+opportunity%3F-a0188329777 "Will Lebanon's politicians spoil yet another opportunity?" ''The Daily Star''] November 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making the case for the 'Umma' Currency==
Noting that inter-Arab trade volumes are much more modest than they should be, Karam has argued that the reasons for this are "principally the lack of extensive distribution networks, the absence of comprehensive trade agreements that go beyond the existing accords and the fact that transactions have to go through the US dollar." As such, Karam has become one of the leading voices in the Arab [[Middle East]] calling for a common currency. "The pegging to the US dollar of most of the major currencies in the region will facilitate the technical engineering of the process," he says. "This currency could be named the Umma, with reference to the unattainable dream of a unified Arab nation."

Admitting that there are some potential pitfalls, Karam nevertheless has challenged policymakers and financial analysts alike to "imagine oil barrels partially priced in Umma. Imagine Arab and foreign tourists paying hotels and restaurant bills in one currency all over the Arab world... Imagine an Umma resting solidly on the foundation of a multi trillion economy fueled by three hundred million consumers. Finally, imagine the economic and political convergence this will inevitably generate. Imagine ... But, is it not the lack of imagination our worst endemic disease?" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=3&amp;article_id=98029#axzz0tGsCpoy5 "A case for the 'Umma' currency," ''The Daily Star''] November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urging Economic Reforms in Syria==
In 2007, Karam, urged the Syrian authorities to implement several measures to enhance the role of the central bank and improve the performance of commercial banks in the country, most notably via a lecture he delivered entitled “Issues and the Future of Syrian Banks” before an audience of prominent Syrian businessmen, bankers and politicians at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus. Karam stressed the need for the full independence of the central bank and its total control over exchange rate management, monetary policy and banking supervision to put a stop to the interference of the Ministry of Finance in the banking sector and the role of the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBOS) in exchange markets. Although most of these reforms were subsequently implemented, some critics argue that deeper reforms will be necessary if Syria is to emerge from the decades of state-owned, authoritarianism that has, in part, created long-term systemic risks for the country.&lt;ref&gt;"BLC CEO uses Damascus Lecture to urge banking reforms," ''The Daily Star'' December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase '''sustainable industries''' is related to the development of [[industry|industrial]] processes in a [[sustainability|sustainable]] way.

== History ==
The earliest mention of the phrase "sustainable industries" appeared in 1990 in a story about a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] group [[Reforestation|reforesting]] a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forest]] to help create sustainable industries for the local populace.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Bill. "Our Troubled Earth – Japan." ''The Seattle Times.'' November 13, 1990. Page F-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, a study entitled “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy” by Michael Renner of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] was published, using the term "sustainable industries".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Renner, [http://www.worldwatch.org/node/886 “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy”]. Worldwatch Institute #104 (September 1991). {{ISBN|1-878071-05-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 1991 report concluded, "Contrary to the jobs-versus-owls rhetoric that blames environmental restrictions for layoffs, the movement toward an environmentally sustainable [[World economy|global economy]] will create far more jobs than it eliminates. The chief reason: non-[[Pollution|polluting]], environmentally sustainable industries tend to be intrinsically more labour intensive and less resource intensive than traditional processes."  Among the features of sustainable industry offered in the paper were [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], resource conservation to meet the needs of future generations, safe and skill-enhancing working conditions, [[Waste minimisation|low waste production]] processes, and the use of safe and environmentally compatible materials. Some of the benefits, however would be offset by higher prices (due to labor costs) and a theoretically larger population needed to perform the same amount of work, increasing the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and other loads on the system.

In February 2003 the business magazine Sustainable Industries was first published, offering news and analysis of core industries such as [[clean energy]] and [[green building]]. By 2012 the company had expanded to include digital media and event production with the Sustainable Industries Economic Forum in the U.S. Sustainable Industries merged with Triple Pundit in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/10/triplepundit-sustainable-industries/ Big News: TriplePundit.com and Sustainable Industries Merge]" Triple Pundit, Oct. 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2013 Sustainable Industries stopped publishing under its masthead.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://twitter.com/sustainablemag/status/414167450356170753 Farewell Transmission]" Twitter, Dec. 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TIAA Bank Field''' is an [[American football]] stadium located in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], that primarily serves as the home facility of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The stadium opened in 1995 as '''Jacksonville Municipal Stadium''' on the site of the old [[Gator Bowl Stadium]] (erected 1927), and included some portions of the older stadium. Located on the [[St. Johns River]], it sits on {{convert|10|acres}} of land in [[downtown Jacksonville]]. 

In addition to hosting the Jaguars, the stadium is also regularly used for [[college football]], concerts, and other events. It is the regular site of the annual [[Florida–Georgia football rivalry|Florida–Georgia game]], a college football rivalry game between the [[University of Florida]] and the [[University of Georgia]]. The stadium is also the home of the annual [[Gator Bowl]], a post-season college [[bowl game]]. Additionally, the stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in 2005 and is one of the venues used by the [[United States men's national soccer team]]. 

From 1997 to 2006, the stadium was named '''Alltel Stadium''' after communications company [[Alltel]] purchased [[naming rights]]. The facility was renamed EverBank Field in 2010, following the approval of a five-year, naming rights deal with the financial services company [[EverBank]]. The agreement was extended in 2014 for an additional 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EverBank, Jaguars extend stadium naming rights agreement|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-JaguarsNews/EverBank-Jaguars-extend-stadium-naming-rights-agreement/5247142e-8941-41ea-9da3-2514d0391a75|publisher=Jacksonville Jaguars|date=July 25, 2014|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaguars announced in February 2018 the stadium would be renamed [[TIAA Bank]] Field for the [[2018 NFL season]] after EverBank was acquired by New York-based [[TIAA]].&lt;ref name="New name"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heilman|first=Phillip|title=New name for Jaguars’ stadium: TIAA Bank Field|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/sports/20180216/new-name-for-jaguars-stadium-tiaa-bank-field|newspaper=The Florida Times-Union|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
TIAA Bank Field is located in the [[Downtown Jacksonville#Stadium District|Stadium District]] of [[downtown Jacksonville]], which has been home to football fields since the early 20th century. In 1928 the first permanent football stadium, Fairfield Stadium, was constructed. In 1948 this was expanded and renamed [[Gator Bowl Stadium]], in honor of the annual [[Gator Bowl]] game first played two years earlier.

The current structure was built using a few portions of the historic Gator Bowl Stadium. However, all of the elements included from the older stadium — the pedestrian ramp system and the more recent West Upper Deck section of the complex — dated back only to 1982. Construction started January 3, 1994, and the new stadium opened on August 18, 1995, with an [[exhibition game]] with the [[St. Louis Rams]]. Total construction time was under 20&amp;nbsp;months and total cost was US$134&amp;nbsp;million – $60&amp;nbsp;million of which was provided by the city of Jacksonville.

===Planning===
In January 1993, representatives from the [[University of Florida]] and [[University of Georgia]] began negotiating with Jacksonville representatives to renew the contract to host the [[Florida–Georgia football rivalry|Florida–Georgia game]], the annual rivalry game between the [[college football]] teams of the two universities. The universities' five-year contract with the Gator Bowl ended after the 1994 game, and the [[Citrus Bowl (stadium)|Citrus Bowl]] had offered Florida and Georgia a larger sum of money than the Gator Bowl for the right to host the game.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jeff. "UF-Georgia negotiations start today", ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''. January 12, 1993. Page C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the Citrus Bowl's larger monetary offer, Jacksonville mayor [[Ed Austin]] proposed a $25.5 million renovation plan to Jacksonville's aging Gator Bowl Stadium, which had been built in 1949. Both teams had expressed concerns about the condition of the aging stadium, and renovations were considered key to enticing the teams to keep returning to Jacksonville, bringing tens of millions of dollars in consumer spending with them.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Sun-Sentinel staff reports. "College Football", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. January 22, 1993. Page C2.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promise of renovations, Georgia athletic director [[Vince Dooley]] was unswayed,&lt;ref&gt;Palm Beach Post staff reports. "Georgia may move '96 game to Athens", ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''. February 18, 1993. Page C8.&lt;/ref&gt; so Austin widened the scope of the renovations, increasing their price tag to $49 million, and traveled to Athens, Georgia, to talk with Dooley in person.&lt;ref&gt;Sun-Sentinel staff and wire reports. "Sports in brief", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. March 4, 1993. Page C2.&lt;/ref&gt; Austin's campaigning was partially successful. On March 23, 1993, the two universities announced they had signed a five-year contract with the Gator Bowl, running from 1997 to 2002. The contract was contingent on Austin successfully passing the $49 million renovation bond issue through the [[Jacksonville City Council]] and the city completing the renovations by the 1996 game.&lt;ref&gt;Dame, Mike. "Florida-Georgia moving for '95", ''[[The Orlando Sentinel]]''. March 23, 1993. Page D1.&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday, May 11, the Jacksonville City Council approved a $219.5 million bond issue, including the $49 million for the renovation of the Gator Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press. "Gator Bowl gets funds for repairs", ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. May 12, 1993. Page C6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, Chris. "Gator Bowl plan OK'd to delight of UF, Georgia", ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]''. May 12, 1993. Page Sports 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL expansion===
Soon after the approval of the bond issue, investors interested in attracting a new [[National Football League]] team to Jacksonville requested that another $30 million be added to the $49 million renovations in order to make the stadium more attractive for a professional team.&lt;ref&gt;Tampa Tribune staff. "Pro football", ''Tampa Tribune''. May 14, 1993. Page Sports 2.&lt;/ref&gt; That number climbed higher throughout the summer, and eventually the city reached an agreement with the leading group of investors hoping to attract an NFL team to Jacksonville. On July 1, the city and investors reached a lease agreement contingent on the city investing $112.3 million for improving the Gator Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Don. "NFL expansion a fleeting dream for Jacksonville", ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. July 2, 1993. Page C1.&lt;/ref&gt; The lease agreement later collapsed when the Jacksonville City Council voted to send the lease back to a committee for further study rather than approving it.&lt;ref&gt;Tampa Tribune staff report. "TD Jax! pulls out of race", ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]''. July 22, 1993. Page Sports 9.&lt;/ref&gt; One month after the proposed deal fell through, city officials and investors tried again and were successful in negotiating a deal that included a pledge to spend $121 million on renovations to the Gator Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Sun-Sentinel staff. "Jacksonville back in race", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. August 25, 1995. Page C6.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expanded renovations, it was announced that the 1994 Florida-Georgia game would have to be moved out of the Gator Bowl, as had the 1995 game, in order to provide time for the newly expanded renovation plan to be completed before 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jeff. "UF could host 1994 Georgia game", ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''. September 1, 1993. Page C9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the expanded bond issue and renovation program proved to be successful, as Jacksonville was awarded the 30th NFL franchise—the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]—on November 30, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Michael. "Fantastic finish wins NFL team for Jacksonville", ''[[The Miami Herald]]''. Dec. 1, 1993. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost as soon as the celebration surrounding Jacksonville's new NFL team died down, however, a renovation contractor's plan to give 8% of the stadium work to [[Minority group|minority]]-owned businesses drew criticism. The [[NAACP]] and another group said African-American businesses should have been awarded twice that amount of work.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press. "Groups criticize contractor's plan", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. December 25, 1993. Page A26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current stadium==
The stadium's re-opening day was also the home debut of the Jaguars during the [[1995 NFL season]]. It was the first time that an expansion NFL team had played its first game in a new facility; they played the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] in the opener and lost 10&amp;ndash;3. The [[Gator Bowl]] returned as a New Year's Day bowl game on January 1, 1996, following the 1995 NCAA season.

The stadium contains 11,200 club seats, 88 luxury suites, and a "super suite".&lt;ref name="ballparks"/&gt;

In 1997, the stadium changed its name to Alltel Stadium after naming rights were acquired by [[Alltel]], a telecommunications company best known as a [[mobile phone|wireless]] carrier. The name Alltel Stadium stopped being used by the city after January 2007 when the contract expired; by that point, most of Alltel's assets had been purchased by [[Verizon]].

[[File:Superbowl XXXIX, 2005.JPG|thumb|left|238px|[[Super Bowl XXXIX]]]]
In 2005, the stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in which the [[New England Patriots]] defeated the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 24–21 in front of 78,125, the largest Super Bowl in attendance since 1994. [[Paul McCartney]] performed at halftime, performing [[Beatles]] classics "[[Drive My Car]]", "[[Get Back]]", and "[[Hey Jude]]", as well as a firework-filled "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]". In 2003 and 2004, $47&amp;nbsp;million in improvements to the stadium were implemented to prepare for the Super Bowl. These improvements included the addition of a unique sports bar in the south end zone called the "[[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Bud]] Zone", a larger and wider video and scoring display from [[Daktronics]], escalators in the north and south end zone, and a new "terrace suite" called the "Sky Patio" right above the "Bud Zone" in the south end zone.&lt;ref name=Daktronics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/photos/details?pn=WP-18759&amp;cid=186431|title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Jacksonville Jaguars, Jacksonville Municipal Stadium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Navy 110911-N-YR391-035 Service members, firemen and police officers participate in a ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|EverBank Field during the 10th anniversary of 9/11]]
Before the 2005 season, mainly due to low attendance figures and looming [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]]s, team officials installed a series of tarps to reduce the [[seating capacity]] for Jaguars games. The covers were placed to block out seven sections in the upper north end zone and four in each upper deck section, located on the corners of each. This puts 9,703 seats out of service, leaving the stadium with 66,851 seats for the regular season.  However, in the event the Jaguars make the AFC Championship Game, the stadium can easily be expanded to full capacity.  Some believed that this was a sign that the city couldn't support an NFL team; the city is the second-smallest market in the league.  However, the current capacity is actually very close to what Wayne Weaver included in his original proposal to bring the Gator Bowl up to NFL standards.  The city council turned this plan down, mainly out of concern for not having enough seats to accommodate the annual Florida-Georgia game.

Despite the changes, however, blackouts have still occurred, including two of their first three home games in [[2007 NFL season|2007]] and nine of ten games in 2009. It is believed that the [[Great Recession|2008 US financial crisis]] played a major part in the 2009 season blackouts,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} leading to insufficient ticket sales, with only the final home engagement of the regular season, with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], managing to sell out. However, the Jaguars' 2010 season saw a huge turnaround in ticket sales, with no games being blacked out that year. The Jaguars avoided blackouts in all games in 2011 and 2012.

For the Super Bowl, Florida–Georgia game, and occasionally the Gator Bowl, temporary bleachers are put up in the south end zone and the tarps are removed, raising capacity to over 84,000.

The attendance record was set on September 29, 2007, when 85,413 watched [[2007 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] defeat [[2007 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] in what was dubbed the River City Showdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272720052|title=Lee comes off bench, rescues Florida State from Alabama|publisher=ESPN|date=September 29, 2007|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each school received nearly 36,000 tickets, and the Gator Bowl Association added 5,800 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openbuildings.com/buildings/alltel-stadium-profile-9988?_show_description=1|title=Alltel Stadium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2010, naming rights to the stadium were bought by [[EverBank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EverBank buying naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-07-26/story/everbank-buying-naming-rights-jacksonville-municipal}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the nation's largest privately held bank holding companies with approximately $11.2 billion in assets. On August 10, the deal was officially approved by the [[Jacksonville City Council]] with a 14–3 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mitchell|first=Tia|title=City Council OKs EverBank Field deal|publisher=Jacksonville.com|date=August 10, 2010|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-07-26/story/everbank-buying-naming-rights-jacksonville-municipal|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EverBankFIeld2014.jpg|thumb|295px|right|New scoreboard and party deck installed in 2014]]
In November 2013, Jacksonville's City Council approved $63 million in improvements to EverBank Field. Jaguars owner [[Shahid Khan]] helped finance $20 million of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiRocco|first1=Michael|title=Jaguars unveil mammoth video boards|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/jacksonville-jaguars/post/_/id/6885/jaguars-unveil-mammoth-video-boards|website=ESPN.go.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations included two end zone video scoreboards 362-foot-long that are the largest [[High-definition video|HD]] [[LED]] of their kind in the world, a platform area in the north end zone with two wading pools, unique food and beverage offerings, interactive activities, and 55,000 square feet of HD video screens, which is a world record for a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/sports/2014/06/30/jaguars-video-board-dallas-texans/11820057/ Jaguars: 'Not everything is bigger in Texas']. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the platform resulted in the removal of approximately 7,000 seats, though temporary seating can be installed for major events that will require a larger stadium capacity. During the construction a live webcam was set up to view the progress of the new video scoreboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaguars.com/livecam/|title=Jaguars.com Live Cam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scoreboards were publicly unveiled on July 26, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/7/27/5941601/jaguars-worlds-largest-scoreboards-everbank-field|title=Jaguars unveil world's largest scoreboards at EverBank Field|first=Ryan Van|last=Bibber|date=27 July 2014|publisher=SB Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of 2016, the Jaguars and the city of Jacksonville announced $90 million in improvements to the stadium. Phase 1 includes the improvements to club seating, sponsored by [[US Assure]], new walkout patios at the 50-yard-line and the creation of a new south end zone tunnel that will be the new team entrance and create two new seating environments. Phase 2 includes the construction of an amphitheater ([[Daily's Place]]) and a covered flex field; both phases were completed in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-PressRelease/Jaguars-and-city-of-Jacksonville-unveil-totally-reimagined-US-Assure-Club-at-EverBank-Field/982673e3-7c0e-4520-a611-10e32ae14a9b Jaguars and city of Jacksonville unveil totally reimagined US Assure Club at EverBank Field] August 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful [[2017 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2017 season]] which saw the Jaguars return to the playoffs for the first time since the [[2007 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2007 season]] and host a playoff game for the first time since [[1999 Jacksonville Jaguars season|1999]], the Jaguars announced the removal of last of the tarps on the upper levels. The removal adds 3,501 seats to the capacity of the stadium bringing total capacity to 67,814.&lt;ref name="2018jjmg"/&gt;

On December 2, 2010, Tableau deleted [[WikiLeaks]]'s visualizations about the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], stating it was due directly to political pressure from US Senator [[Joe Lieberman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-tableau-visualisation-joe-lieberman|title=WikiLeaks cables visualisation pulled after pressure from Joe Lieberman | location=London | work=The Guardian|first1=Charles|last1=Arthur|first2=Josh|last2=Halliday|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tableau.com/blog/why-we-removed-wikileaks-visualizations|title=Why we removed the WikiLeaks visualizations|author=Fink, Elissa |date=December 2, 2010 |publisher=Tableau Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Winter Kills''''' is a 1979 American [[black comedy|black comedy film]] directed by [[William Richert]], based on the [[Winter Kills|novel]] by satirist [[Richard Condon]]. A [[black comedy]] fictionalising the assassination conspiracy of [[President John F. Kennedy]], its all-star cast includes [[Jeff Bridges]], [[John Huston]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Richard Boone]], [[Toshirō Mifune]], [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Dorothy Malone]], [[Belinda Bauer (actress)|Belinda Bauer]], [[Ralph Meeker]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Berry Berenson]] and [[Susan Walden]].

The film simplifies the plot of the book somewhat, emphasizing humor. It follows the events surrounding the assassination of President Kegan (patterned after [[John F. Kennedy]]). Several years later, Kegan's half-brother Nick (Bridges) discovers leads which suggest there may have been a plot to kill the President.

Most of the film was photographed by cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and the production designer was [[Robert F. Boyle]], who cited the film as one of his favorites.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Although ''Winter Kills'' was a [[box office bomb]],&lt;ref name=boxofficemojo&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=winterkills.htm "Winter Kills,"] Box Office Mojo.Accessed Nov. 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; it has since become a [[cult classic]].&lt;ref name=rottontomatoes /&gt;

==Plot summary==

Set in the contemporary 1979 but in a different reality, Nick Kegan ([[Jeff Bridges]]) is on board his millionaire father's tanker ship when he phones his lover, Yvette Malone ([[Belinda Bauer (actress)|Belinda Bauer]]), who lives in New York City and leaves a message on her answering machine just to hear her soft and seductive voice. Just then, a family associate named Keifetz ([[Richard Boone]]) arrives on the ship by helicopter with an injured man whose face is wrapped in bandages. Inside a doctor's office, the injured man, Arthur Fletcher ([[Joe Spinell]]), mutters a confession as an orderly transcribes; Fletcher had assassinated Nick's half-brother, the President of the United States, 19 years earlier on February 22, 1960. Fletcher claims that he and another gunman were hired by a man named Casper, Jr., for the job, after which Fletcher hid his rifle in Room 903 of the Engleson Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where the assassination happened as the President was riding in an open limousine beside Philadelphia's City Hall building. Fletcher confesses to the killing because he claims that he wants to be able to prove that he was the real killer. Nick inquires about Willie Arnold, the assassin who was determined to be the lone gunman by the Pickering Commission. However, Fletcher dies before he can answer, so Nick heads to Philadelphia to look for the rifle.

At the Engleson Building, Nick uncovers the weapon, but, just as he and his companions prepare to leave, a young woman on a bicycle (Barbara Richert) rides past their vehicle and pops her chewing gum. In an instant, Nick's associates are shot dead by an unseen sniper. Panicked, Nick runs to call his father, Pa Kegan ([[John Huston]]), but instead is connected to John Cerruti ([[Anthony Perkins]]), the mastermind behind the Kegan empire. When Nick reports the incident and his whereabouts, Cerruti promises to send help, but the vehicle and the rifle inside are stolen by an unseen person as Nick waits.

Sometime later, Nick is chauffeured to Pa Kegan's desert estate in California, where he is greeted by the Japanese butler, Keith ([[Toshirô Mifune]]). Later that evening, Nick sees his emotionally unstable mother, Emma ([[Dorothy Malone]]), and is rebuked by his father for leaving the ship. When Nick reports Fletcher's confession and the incident in Philadelphia, his father storms away. However, Pa wakes Nick in the morning with a plan to expose the assassination conspiracy.

Sometime later, Pa sends Nick to meet his former political rival and one of the richest men in the U.S., Z.K. Dawson ([[Sterling Hayden]]). Driving into Dawson's Tulsa, Oklahoma, ranch, Nick is cornered by WW II tanks. Dawson surfaces from a hatch, arguing that he was not involved with the assassination and implicating the Philadelphia Police Departments Captain Heller and his sidekick, Ray Doty.

On an airplane to New York City, Nick receives a call from Pa, who reports that they no longer have witnesses to Fletcher's confession; Keifetz was killed and the ship's orderly broke his neck in a fall. Sometime later, Nick meets Doty, who remembers that the man implicated in Fletcher's confession, Casper, Jr., was connected to the Philadelphia police through a nightclub owner named Joe Diamond ([[Eli Wallach]]) who murdered Willie Arnold two days after the assassination. According to Doty (in a long flashback sequence to the 1950s), Diamond bribed Captain Heller ([[Brad Dexter]]) for access into the police station so he could kill Willie Arnold after the presidential assassination. Gangster Gameboy Baker ([[Ralph Meeker]]) arranged the assassination because the president did not return favors for the mafia's $2 million campaign contribution and Arnold was their scapegoat. Diamond died in prison four years after the assassination and the killing of Willie Arnold

Sometime after his meeting with Doty, Nick returns to New York City and makes love to Yvette. In the throes of passion, the young woman agrees to marry him but later retracts her promise, claiming that Nick is more intimate with her answering machine. When Nick returns home to his apartment, he is attacked by his maid, but he gains the upper hand and has her arrested.

At lunch the next day at a fancy restaurant, Nick asks Yvette to help him track down information about Joe Diamond through National Magazine, the magazine for which she works. Soon, Yvette directs Nick to a Cleveland, Ohio, diner, where he meets gangster Irving Mentor (Irving Selbst) and bribes him for information. Mentor reports that Casper, Jr., figured in the assassination because he was connected to a Hollywood studio that lost $50 million when one of their stars killed herself over an affair with the president. Just then, the same woman on the bicycle who popped her chewing gum before the shootings in Philadelphia brings a dead cat into Mentor's diner and Nick chases after her as the restaurant explodes from a bomb. The unknown woman again gets away.

Nick returns to New York City, where Pa debunks Mentor's story and orders Nick to meet with imprisoned gangster Frank Mayo ([[Tomas Milian]]), who was given special leave for the interview. When Mayo suggests that Nick is being misled, Nick heads to National Magazine headquarters and learns that Yvette is not actually an employee. Later, the hostile doorman at Yvette's apartment insists that she does not live there.

Returning home, Nick finds Keifetz, who admits that he faked his death and encourages Nick to use Cerruti's intelligence connections to find Yvette. At Pa's financial headquarters, Cerutti tells Nick that Yvette was kidnapped by Casper Jr., and recounts a new version of the assassination. According to Cerruti (in another flashback sequence to 1959), a Washington, D.C. madam named Lola Comante ([[Elizabeth Taylor]]), who obliged the president's fondness for sex, offered him a $2 million campaign contribution from Mayo and his mafia associates. When the president discovered that Pa was behind the deal, he ended their relationship, leaving Pa financially and emotionally devastated.

Changing the story yet again, Cerruti confesses that he arranged for Nick to meet a fraudulent Z.K. Dawson in Tulsa. The real Dawson and his daughter, Yvette, were the true perpetrators of the assassination; Yvette, formerly known as Maggie Dawson, was the president's mistress. Nick discounts Cerruti's story and insists on learning Yvette's whereabouts. As Nick assaults and fractures Cerruti's arms with a baton, he breaks down. Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially, but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick, including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette. When Cerruti says that Jenny is "tied up" at Kegan Medical School, Nick leaves... only to find her body in the morgue.

Sometime later, Nick confronts his father in his office, but Pa claims that Cerruti masterminded the assassination to augment the Kegan coffers and blackmailed Pa into keeping quiet. When Nick attempts to call the police, Keifetz and an officer break into Pa's office and Nick thinks the men are there to back him up; however, Pa announces that Keifetz is an assassin with orders to kill Nick. Defending himself, Nick grabs the officer and uses his gun to fire at Keifetz, who shoots back at the officer as he dies. Nick chases his father onto the high-rise balcony and finds Pa clinging to the rail of an enormous American flag. As Nick reaches for his father, Pa falls to his death, tearing the flag in half with his body as he calls out to Nick: "put my money in South America!". Nick staggers away, but tells the secretary that he will return because he cannot escape his family ties. (In some versions after Pa Kegan's death, Nick has a final encounter with the mystery woman riding on a bicycle, with a young child riding in a child's seat, in a park outside the Kegan Building, waving at him before she rides away; the woman's identity is never revealed).

Sometime later in the final scene, Nick calls Yvette's answering machine to hear her voice one last time.

==Production==
The film original producers were wealthy marijuana dealers Robert Sterling and Leonard Goldberg, who had previously worked on releasing the French [[softcore pornography|softcore]] [[Emmanuelle]] films in the U.S.&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt; Many of the film's interior scenes were shot in 1977 at the [[Greystone Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills]], then home to the [[American Film Institute]]'s film school.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The production went so far over budget that it was shut down three times, having declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;Axemaker, Sean. [http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1312218%7C0/Winter-Kills.html "Winter Kills,"] Turner Classic Movies. Accessed Nov. 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg was murdered (most likely by the [[Mafia]]) in the middle of production, for failure to pay his debts,&lt;ref name=WKWK&gt;Martin, Perry, director. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs7wxvyDgFg ''Who Killed 'Winter Kills'?''] (Anchor Bay, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and Sterling was later sentenced to 40 years in prison for marijuana smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;"Judge hits millionaire pot smuggler with 40-year sentence," UPI, October 23, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

Richert and ''Winter Kills'' stars Bridges and Bauer went to Germany and filmed a comedy called ''[[The American Success Company]]'' (released in 1980), whose distribution rights made enough money for Richert to fund a resumption of ''Winter Kills'' two years later.&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt; All the same, the film's distributor, [[Embassy Pictures]] controlled the final cut.&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

A few years later, Richert acquired the rights to the film and re-released a director's cut, with a new ending, in 1983.&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 86% of 10 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7 out of 10.&lt;ref name=rottontomatoes&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/winter_kills? "''Winter Kills'' (1979)".] Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved November 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Many reviewers pointed out that the film existed on the boundary of a comedy and a thriller. 

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared the film to ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', writing, "'Winter Kills' isn't exactly a comedy, but it's funny. And it isn't exactly serious, but it takes on the serious business of the Kennedy assassination."&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet. [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D00E7DD173EE732A2575BC1A9639C946890D6CF "MOVIE REVIEW: Movie: 'Winter Kills,' a Serio-Comedy: Spring Fever Time,"] ''New York Times'' (May 18, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times''' [[Vincent Canby]] also praised the film, complimenting writer/director William Richert's imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent. [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/27/archives/film-view-a-funny-paranoid-fable.html "FILM VIEW,"] ''New York Times'' (MAY 27, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''Variety'' magazine wrote of the film, "If there’s a decent film lurking somewhere in ''Winter Kills'', writer-director William Richert doesn’t want anyone to see it in his Byzantine version of a presidential assassination conspiracy."&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;Variety staff, [https://variety.com/1978/film/reviews/winter-kills-1200424339/ "Winter Kills,"] ''Variety''. Accessed Nov. 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influential publications, including ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'', also gave the film positive reviews,{{cn|date=November 2017}} but it made little money when released (barely over $1 million on a $6.5 million budget).&lt;ref name=boxofficemojo /&gt; Distributor [[Embassy Pictures]] pulled the film from theaters soon after it was released; Condon and Richert hypothesized that Embassy killed it deliberately in order to avoid threatening legal defense contracts elsewhere within the conglomerate.&lt;ref name=Harpers&gt;Condon, Richard. [https://harpers.org/archive/1983/05/who-killed-winter-kills/ "Who killed Winter Kills? The case of the vanishing movie involving a murder, a forty-year drug sentence, Liz Taylor’s repossessed fur coat, and possible skulduggery at the highest levels. The author of a satirical fantasy reflects on life imitating art,"] ''Harper's'' (May 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1983 re-release (and distribution to video) included scenes not originally shown on screen, including the original ending,&lt;ref name=Variety /&gt; and with additional footage of [[Elizabeth Taylor]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}
