Accessed 2015-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in Manhattan to Benjamin and Anna Briloff, Briloff obtained his BA in commerce at the City College School of Business and Civic Administration, now [[Baruch College]], in 1937. Later in 1965 he obtained his PhD in accountancy and taxation at the [[New York University]] with the thesis, entitled "The Effectiveness of Accounting Communication."

Briloff began his career in the final days of the [[Great Depression]] as high school teacher, teaching bookkeeping and stenography, and as assistant accountant in the accountancy firm of Apfel &amp; Englander. In 1944 he became partner in that firm, and in 1951 started his own accountancy firm. In 1944 he also started lecturing accounting at the [[City College of New York]], where he became a full-time faculty member in 1965. In 1976 he was appointed Emanuel Saxe Distinguished Professor of Accountancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/news/AbrahamBriloffAccountingHallofFame.htm Abraham J.

Accessed 2015-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He later started writing for the [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's Magazine]], a financial weekly.

Briloff was inducted into the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]] in 2014. Their argument was, that "for over half a century, he was the conscience of the accounting profession, challenging it to raise standards and to meet its obligations to society. Always motivated by the best interests of the accounting profession, he was respected by both supporters and targets of his criticism."&lt;ref name="AHoF 2015"/&gt;

'''Asset management''' refers to systematic approach to the governance and realization of value from the things that a group or entity is responsible for, over their whole life cycles. It may apply both to tangible [[asset]]s (physical objects such as buildings or equipment) and to intangible [[asset]]s (such as human capital, [[intellectual property]], [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] and/or [[financial assets]]). Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner (including all costs, risks and performance attributes).

The term is commonly used in the financial sector to describe people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others. Those include, for example, [[Investment management|investment managers]] that manage the assets of a [[pension fund]].

It is also increasingly used in both the business world and [[public infrastructure]] sectors to ensure a coordinated approach to the optimization of costs, risks, service/performance and sustainability.   

The International Standard, [[ISO 55000]], provides a introduction and requirements specification for a management system for asset management.

==By Industry==

===Financial asset management===
The most common usage of the term "asset manager" refers to [[investment management]], the sector of the [[financial services]] industry that manages [[investment fund]]s and [[Security segregation|segregated client accounts]]. Asset management is part of a financial company which employs experts who manage money and handle the investments of clients. From studying the client's assets to planning and looking after the investments, all things are looked after by the asset managers and recommendations are provided based on the financial health of each client.

===Physical and Infrastructure asset management===
{{main article|Infrastructure asset management}}
Infrastructure asset management is the combination of management, financial, economic, engineering, and other practices applied to physical assets with the objective of providing the best value level of service for the costs involved. It includes the management of the entire life cycle—including design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing and decommissioning/disposal—of physical and infrastructure assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgam.info/asset-management|title=Asset Management - LGAM Knowledge Base|author=|date=|website=www.lgam.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation and maintenance of assets in a constrained budget environment require a prioritization scheme. As a way of illustration, the recent development of [[renewable energy]] has seen the rise of effective asset managers involved in the management of solar systems (solar park, rooftops and windmills). These teams often collaborate with financial asset managers in order to offer [[turnkey]] solutions to investors. Infrastructure  asset management became very important in most of the developed countries in the 21st century, since their infrastructure network was almost completed in the 20th century and they have to manage to operate and maintain them cost-effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Vanier, D. (2001) Why Industry Needs Asset Management Tools. ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering. Vol 15(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Software asset management]] is one kind of infrastructure asset management.

The International Organization for Standardization published its management system standard for asset management in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/news/2014/01/Ref1813.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[ISO 55000]] series provides terminology, requirements and guidance for implementing, maintaining and improving an effective asset management system.

* Physical asset management: the practice of managing the entire life cycle (design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing and decommissioning/disposal) of physical and infrastructure assets such as structures, production and service plant, power, water and waste treatment facilities, distribution networks, transport systems, buildings and other physical assets.  The increasing availability of data from asset systems is allowing the principles of [[Total Cost of Ownership]] to be applied to facility management of an individual system, a building, or across a campus.  Physical asset management is related to [[asset health management]].
*[[Infrastructure asset management]] expands on this theme in relation primarily to public sector, [[utilities]], property and transport systems. Additionally, Asset Management can refer to shaping the future interfaces between the human, built, and natural environments through collaborative and evidence-based decision processes
*[[Fixed assets management]]: an accounting process that seeks to track fixed assets for the purposes of [[financial accounting]]
*[[IT asset management]]: the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making for the IT environment. This is also one of the processes defined within [[IT service management]]
*[[Digital asset management]]: a form of electronic media content management that includes digital assets

===Enterprise asset management===
[[Enterprise asset management]] (EAM) systems are asset ''information'' systems that support the management of an organization's assets.   An EAM includes an asset registry (inventory of assets and their attributes) combined with a [[computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS) and other modules (such as inventory or materials management). Assets that are geographically distributed, interconnected or networked, are often also represented through the use of [[Geographic information system|geographic information systems (GIS)]].

GIS-centric asset registry standardizes data and improves interoperability, providing users the capability to reuse, coordinate, and share information in an efficient and effective manner . A GIS platform combined with information of both the "hard" and "soft" assets helps to remove the traditional silos of departmental functions. While the [[hard asset]]s are the typical physical assets or infrastructure assets, the soft assets might include permits, licenses, brands, patents, right-of-ways and other entitlements or valued items.

The EAM system is only one of the 'enables' to good asset management.  Asset managers need to make informed decisions in order to fulfill their organizational goals, this requires good asset information but also leadership, clarity of strategic priorities, competencies, inter-departmental collaboration and communications, workforce and supply chain engagement, risk and change management systems, performance monitoring and continual improvement.

===Public asset management===
{{POV section|date=April 2014}}
Public asset management, also called corporate{{Contradict-inline|reason=public opposite to corporate (private)|date=May 2017}} asset management, expands the definition of enterprise asset management (EAM) by incorporating the management of all things of value to a municipal [[jurisdiction]] and its citizens' expectations. An example in which public asset management is used is land-use development and planning.

==Intellectual and non-physical asset management==
Increasingly both consumers and organizations use assets, e.g. software, music, books, etc. where the user's rights are constrained by a license agreement. An asset management system would identify the constraints upon such licenses, e.g. a time period. If, for example, one licenses software, often the license is for a given period of time. Adobe and Microsoft both offer time based software licenses. In both the corporate and consumer worlds, there is a distinction between software ownership and the updating of software. One may own a version of software, but not newer versions of the software. Cellular phones are often not updated by vendors, in an attempt to force purchase of newer hardware. Large companies such as Oracle, that license software to clients distinguish between the right to use and the right to received maintenance/support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2491993,00.asp|title=The Best Asset Management Software of 2018|author=|date=|website=pcmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's name comes from [[Atelier|the word for an artist's workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rew-online.com/2011/05/05/emperor-of-the-skyline/|title=Emperor of the skyline|last=Li|first=Roland|date=2011-05-05|work=Real Estate Weekly|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building features an art gallery on the ground floor and often holds exhibitions of artwork. The gallery is also visible from the street and includes the lobby of the building as part of its exhibit space. As of January 2009, it featured the works of graphic designer and New York-based artist [[Milton Glaser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/realestate/04cov.html|title=The Come-Hither Lobby|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, solar panels were installed on the roof of the building capable of generating five percent of the energy needs of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/02/the-big-apple-takes-a-bite-out-of-solar-energy.html|title=The Big Apple takes a bite out of solar energy|last=Quick|first=Brad|date=2015-01-03|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, solar panels were generating ten percent of the building's energy needs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/realestate/in-search-of-a-trophy-at-any-cost.html|title=In Search of a Trophy, at Any Cost|last=Barrionuevo|first=Alexei|date=2013-04-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Atelier became one of the first buildings in New York to include an ice-skating rink on the roof of the building which was installed by Daniel Neiditch, president of the condo board who owns many units in the building.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/realestate/pools-golf-and-bowling-right-down-the-hall.html|title=Pools, Golf, and Bowling: Right Down the Hall|last=Hughes|first=C.

'''CORE''' (COnnecting REpositories) is a service provided by the [[Knowledge Media Institute]], based at [[The Open University]], [[United Kingdom]]. The goal of the project is to aggregate all [[open access]] content distributed across different systems, such as [[Institutional repository|repositories]] and [[open access journal]]s, enrich this content using [[text mining]] and [[data mining]], and provide free access to it through a set of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = OU’s full text search system makes huge leaps in widening access to academic papers| url = http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=24452| date = 24 October 2012| accessdate = 19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CORE project also aims to promote open access to scholarly outputs. It fully supports the [[taxpayer]]'s entitlement to the research they have funded and facilitates the wide dissemination of the [[open access]] content. CORE works closely with [[Digital Library|digital libraries]] and [[Institutional repository|institutional repositories]].

Based on the open access fundamental principles, as they were described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]], the open access content not only must be openly available to download and read, but it must also allow its reuse, both by humans and machines. As a result, there was a need to exploit the content reuse, which could be made possible with the implementation of a technical infrastructure. Thus the CORE project started with the goal of connecting [[metadata]] and full-text outputs offering, via the content aggregation, value-added services, and opening new opportunities in the research process.

Currently there are existing commercial academic search systems, such as [[Google Scholar]], which provide search and access level services, but do not support programmable machine access to the content, for example with the use of an [[Application programming interface|API]] or data dumps. This limits the further reuse of the open access content, for example, with regards to [[Text mining|text and data mining]]. Taking into consideration that there are three access levels to content: 1. access at the granularity of papers, 2. analytical access and granularity of collections and 3. programmable machine access to data&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Knoth| first = Petr | title = CORE: Three Access Levels to Underpin Open Access | journal = D-Lib Magazine| url = http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html| volume = 1 | number = 11/12 | date = December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the programmable machine access is the main feature that distinguishes CORE from [[Google Scholar]] and [[Microsoft Academic Search]].

==History==
The first version of CORE was created in 2011 by [[Petr Knoth]] with the aim to make it easier to access and [[text mining|text mine]] very large amounts of research publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = OUs full text search system makes huge leaps in widening access to academic papers| url = http://news.kmi.open.ac.uk/rostra/news.php?r=11&amp;t=2&amp;id=18463=KMi| date = 24 October 2012| accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the aggregation was first demonstrated by developing a [[recommender system|content recommendation system]] for research papers, following the ideas of literature-based discovery introduced by [[Don R. Swanson]]. Since its start, CORE has received financial support from a range of funders including [[Jisc]] and the [[European Commission]]. Although CORE aggregates from across the world, it has the status of the UK's national aggregator of [[open access]] content, aggregating [[metadata]] and full-text outputs from both UK publishers' databases as well as institutional and subject repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CORE melds UK repositories| newspaper= Times of Higher Education | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/417751.article| date = 13 October 2011| accessdate = 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = UK’s first open access full-text search engine to aid research| publisher=The Research Centre | url = http://www.theresearchcentre.co.uk/feedstory/uk-s-open-access-full-text-search-engine-aid-research| date = 3 October 2011| accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service operates as a one step search tool for UK's [[open access]] research outputs, facilitating easy discoverability, use and reuse. The importance of the service has been widely recognised by [[Jisc]], which suggested that CORE should preserve the required resources to sustain its operation and explore an international sustainability model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Neil | last = Jacobs | first2 = Nicky| last2 = Ferguson | title = Bringing the UK's open access research together: Barriers on the Berlin road to open access| year = 2014| publisher= Jisc | url = http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5570/1/JISC_REPORT_open_mirror_090514_FINAL_WEB.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
CORE is now one of the Repository Shared Services projects, along with [[SHERPA (organisation)|Sherpa Services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/| title= SHERPA Services | accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRUS-UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.irus.mimas.ac.uk/| title= IRUS UK| accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jisc Publications Router&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url        = http://broker.edina.ac.uk/| title = Jisc Publications Router| accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[OpenDOAR]].

==Programmable access to CORE data==
CORE data can be accessed through an [[API]] or downloaded as a pre-processed and semantically enriched [https://core.ac.uk/services data dump].

==Searching CORE==
CORE provides searchable access to a collection of over 125 millions of [[open access]] harvested research outputs. All outputs can be accessed and downloaded free of cost and have limited re-use restrictions. One can search the CORE content using a [[faceted search]]. CORE also provides a cross-repository content [[Recommender system|recommendation system]] based on full-texts. The collection of the harvested outputs is available either by looking at the latest additions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse/latest| title= CORE Latest Additions| accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by browsing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse| title= CORE Browsing | accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collection at the date of harvesting.
The CORE search engine has been selected as one of the top 10 search engines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Ten Search Engines for researchers that go beyond Google| series= Jisc Inform| url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/inform/inform37/SearchingBeyondGoogle.html| date = Summer 2013 | accessdate = 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for open access research, facilitating access to academic papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OU widens access to academic papers| url = http://www.openuniversity.edu/news-blog/news/ou-widens-access-to-academic-papers| accessdate = 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Else	| first = Holly | title = ‘Dismal’ start for Access to Research initiative | newspaper = Times Higher Education | date = 14 August 2014  | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/dismal-start-for-access-to-research-initiative/2015157.article| accessdate = 15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CORE ranks second among the most useful databases of searching electronic [[thesis]] and dissertations (ETDs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Top 100 Thesis and Dissertations on the Web| publisher= OnlinePhDProgram | url = http://onlinephdprogram.org/thesis-dissertation/| accessdate = 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical use of CORE data==
The availability of data aggregated and enriched by CORE provides opportunities for the development of new analytical services for research literature. These can be used, for example, to monitor growth and trends in research, validate compliance with [[open access mandate]]s and to develop new automatic metrics for evaluating research excellence.

==Applications==
CORE offers eight applications:
*CORE API, provides an access point for those who want to develop applications making use of CORE's large collection of Open Access content. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#api| title= CORE API|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CORE Dataset, enables the accessibility of the data aggregated from repositories by CORE and allows their further manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#dataset | title= CORE Dataset|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CORE Recommender, can link the institutional repository with the CORE service and it will recommend semantically related resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#recommender| title= CORE Recommender|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CORE Repository Dashboard, is a tool designed specifically for repository managers or research output administrators. The aim of the Repository Dashboard is to provide control over the aggregated content and help in the management and validation of the repository collections and services. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#dashboard | title= CORE Repository Dashboard|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1089">'''Demographic marketers''' use [[demographics]] in [[marketing research]], and the assessment of the changing trends of [[consumer behavior]]. Demographics can be called a science and demographic marketers can be called scientists. A demographic is used to describe individuals who are from a particular area. It can also be used to describe individuals who would rely on purchasing a particular product or service. Using demographics, a [[marketing manager]] can try to grasp what certain people think and what they are willing to buy.

By understanding how various characteristics of the population reflect their tastes, demographic marketers get an idea of the probability of the sales returns of a launched product in a given area. For any type of business, knowing who the [[customers]] are most likely to be through [[demographic analysis]] will make it easier to market effectively.

The son of a [[tailor]], Finlayson, is the most successful black businessman in the [[Bahamas]]. Finlayson owns more than half the businesses on Bay Street, the Bahamas’ leading shopping street.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.thenassauguardian.com/business/355178594683198.php Garet 'Tiger' Finlayson: Outstanding Black Bahamian Businessman Up Close and Personal, Nassau Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, Bay Street was wholly owned by white business merchants known as the [[Bay Street Boys]].

Finlayson owns leading Bahamian businesses Solomon Mines (luxury retail goods), Burns House and Butler &amp; Sands ([[liquor store]]s). Over the years, Finlayson’s business concerns have included [[car dealerships]], [[hotels]], and [[furniture]], office products and [[restaurant]] businesses.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

Finlayson’s recent acquisition of Solomon Mines, however, has been reportedly less than successful with the closing of four of 11 Bay Street shops,&lt;ref name="tamed"&gt;[http://www.bahamasb2b.com/news/story.php?title=Tiger-Tamed-on-Bay-Street-1 Tiger Tamed on Bay Street, bahamasb2b.com]&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with a downturn in the street's fortunes.

A [[philanthropist]], Finlayson has donated millions of dollars in [[scholarships]], to allow young people to attend university, something Finlayson himself never did.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

In 1999, Finlayson was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for services to the economic growth and development of the Bahamas.&lt;ref name="obe"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/queens_birthday_honours/366655.stm  Commonwealth Honours, BBC News Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Guy Fairfax''' (died 1495), was an [[Judge#England and Wales|English judge]].

Fairfax was of a [[Yorkshire]] family, and third son of Richard Fairfax of Walton,&lt;ref&gt;There are two places in Yorkshire called [[Walton (disambiguation)|Walton]]{{snd}}[[Walton, Leeds]] and [[Walton, Wakefield]]. The latter of those places was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]]; and is the site of [[Walton Hall, West Yorkshire|Walton Hall]], a stately home built on the site of a former moated mediaeval hall. That is suggestive but not decisive evidence of where Thomas Fairfax lived.&lt;/ref&gt; by his wife, Anastasia, daughter of John Carthorpe. He is mentioned&lt;ref&gt;Rot. Parl. iv. 164&lt;/ref&gt; in 1421 as seised of the manor of [[Hameldene]], being then very young. From his father he inherited the manor of [[Steeton, West Yorkshire|Steeton]] in Yorkshire, where he built a castle. At first he seems to have been occupied with purely local business. He was in the commission of array for the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] in 1435, and in 1460 was commissioned to inquire what lands there were in that riding belonging to [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, duke of York]], who had been attainted in the previous [[Parliament of England|parliament]].

One of his colleagues was Sir William Plumpton, whose counsel he afterwards was in 1469. He first appears in the year-books in [[Michaelmas]] 1463 as a [[Serjeant-at-law|serjeant]] and member of [[Gray's Inn]]. On 28 April 1468 he was appointed [[Serjeant-at-law#King's Serjeants|King's serjeant]], and in 1476 became [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[York]]. He was raised to a judgeship of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's bench]] and is first mentioned as a judge in [[Trinity term]] (around mid April to end of June) 1477. In this office he won an honourable reputation, and on 8 October 1482 he received a grant of a hundred [[Merk (coin)|merks]] yearly in addition to his salary. He was continued in his judgeship on each subsequent [[Demise of the Crown]], and under [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] became [[chief justice]] of [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;(Grants of Edward V, 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1495. By his wife, Margaret, a daughter of Sir [[William Ryther]], he had six children, four sons (the eldest, William, a [[Court of Common Pleas (England)#Justices|Judge of the Common Pleas]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) and two daughters.

'''Jalan M.H. Thamrin''' or '''Jalan Thamrin''' ('''M.H. Thamrin Road''' or '''Thamrin Road''') is a major thoroughfare in Jakarta. The road is located at the center of Jakarta, running from [[Selamat Datang Monument|Bundaran HI]] at the south end to the roundabout near [[Arjuna Wijaya Statue]] at the north end. Developed in the 1950s, the road was a landmark of post-colonial Indonesia and continue to have a prominent importance in Jakarta.

==Description==
Thamrin Road is classified as a secondary arterial road in Jakarta. 

The road passes through five urban administrative villages:
*[[Gambir, Gambir]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Kebon Sirih, Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Gondangdia, Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Menteng, Menteng]], [[Central Jakarta]]
*[[Kebon Melati, Tanah Abang]], [[Central Jakarta]]

Thamrin Road is closed to traffic every Sunday from 6:00 until 11:00 as part of [[Car-Free Days|Jakarta Car Free Days]] campaign.

==History==
===Before Thamrin Road===
The road that would become Thamrin Road first appear around late 1910s as a small lane running from Koningsplein West (now Medan Merdeka Barat) to Kebon Sirih. This lane was known as Gang Timboel.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}} Prominent landmark near this small lane was a 19th-century Armenian Church for the [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian community]] of Batavia.&lt;ref name="armenianindien"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imexbo.nl/armenen-in-nederlandsch-indie.html |title=De Armeniërs, een volk waar ik deels van afstam. |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=imexbo.nl |publisher=imexbo.nl |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church has been demolished. The former location of the Armenian Church is the green within the complex of Bank Indonesia.

===1950s Kebayoran Baru===
The development of the suburb [[Kebayoran Baru|Kebayoran]] in 1949 raised the need to link the suburb with the city center of Jakarta, and thus work on a new "highway" began in the same year. The northern half of this new highway received the name Jalan M.H. Thamrin by January 1951, after Indonesian [[National Hero of Indonesia|National Hero]] [[Mohammad Husni Thamrin]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}} To avoid the occupation of the newly opened lands by illegal squatters - a major problem at the time - the government sold these lands cheaply to those who committed to build on it within three to six months. Despite this, time extensions had to be granted because buyers could not arrange finance or procure building materials.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=103}} 

Among the early projects situated in Thamrin Road were [[Sarinah|Sarinah Department Store]], Bank Dagang Negara building (now Wisma Mandiri), Ministry of Religion building, [[Wisma Nusantara]], [[Hotel Indonesia]] and the prominent [[Selamat Datang Monument|Bundaran Hotel Indonesia]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=103}} Thamrin Road was largely completed by 1953.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}}

===1962 Asian Games expansion===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht over de Jalan Thamrin en Jakarta TMnr 20018022.jpg|thumb|right|View of the southern half of Thamrin Road from Hotel Kartika Plaza in the 1970s.]] 
With the arrival of the [[1962 Asian Games]], President [[Sukarno]] imagined the VIP visitors for the Asian Games arriving at [[Kemayoran Airport]], drove along Thamrin Road, be greeted by the [[Selamat Datang Monument|Welcome Monument]] and stayed at [[Hotel Indonesia]]. For the Games itself, the same VIP visitors would be driven along [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman|Sudirman Road]] over the [[Semanggi Interchange|Semanggi cloverleaf bridge]] into the newly-opened [[Gelora Bung Karno Stadium|Gelora Bung Karno sports complex]] where the competitions would take place.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=99}} For the purpose of the game, both Thamrin and Sudirman Road were widened in the early 1960s.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=102}} A regulation was also established which requires buildings along Thamrin Road to be minimum five-stories-high. This was difficult to achieve due to lack of funding and commercial building expertise at that time, and the fact that there were already several two-story government buildings along Thamrin Road.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=103}}

In the beginning of 1970s, Thamrin Road was already a major thoroughfare of Jakarta as envisaged by Sukarno. Buildings reached a minimum height of five stories e.g. ICA building (later the United Nations), Hotel Asoka, the Australian Embassy, and the state-owned developer Pembangunan Perumahan. Sudirman Road was still relatively devoid of development during the early 1970s compare with Thamrin Road, with the exception of the [[Gelora Bung Karno]] sports complex.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=21}} 

Several parades were enacted along the major thoroughfare, including Jakarta's anniversary parade and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Independence Day]] parade.

===TransJakarta===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Jalan Thamrin TMnr 20018355.jpg|thumb|right|Thamrin Road in 1993 before the introduction of [[TransJakarta]] [[bus rapid transit|BRT]].]]
Up until the 2000s, Thamrin Road consisted of four [[carriageway]]s consisting of [[local-express lanes]], 3 lanes for the express lane and 2 lanes for the local lane. With the introduction of [[TransJakarta]] [[bus rapid transit|BRT]] in 2004, one of the lane of the express lanes was converted into a dedicated lane for the BRT. Eventually, Thamrin Road was made a [[dual carriageway]] by removing the separator of the local and express lanes.

===Motorcycle===
The Jakarta administration in December 2014 introduced a ban on motorcycles from using Jalan Thamrin and the adjoining Jalan Medan Merdeka Barat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Folmer|title=City Revised Motorcycle Ban Passing Regulation on Jalan Thamrin|url=http://www.beritajakarta.id/en/read/5350/city-revised-motorcycle-ban-passing-regulation-on-jalan-thamrin|accessdate=4 August 2017|publisher=Beritajakarta.id|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban was reverted by governor [[Anies Baswedan]].

==Transportation==
There are three stations for the [[TransJakarta]] busway along Jalan MH Thamrin, mainly serving for [[TransJakarta Corridors|Route 1]]. They are:
* Tosari ICBC, close to [[Grand Indonesia Shopping Town]], in front of UOB Plaza and The City Tower.
* Sarinah, in front of [[Sarinah]], Gedung [[Badan Pengawas Pemilihan Umum]] and [[Menara Eksekutif]].
* Bank Indonesia, in front of [[Bank Indonesia]] and Indosurya Center.

"Bunderan Hotel Indonesia" station was previously available as a stop, but was removed for the construction of the upcoming [[Jakarta MRT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pradewo |first1=Bintang |title=Proyek MRT, Halte TransJakarta Bundaran HI Ditutup   Artikel ini telah tayang di Tribunnews.com dengan judul Proyek MRT, Halte TransJakarta Bundaran HI Ditutup, http://www.tribunnews.com/metropolitan/2014/04/07/proyek-mrt-halte-transjakarta-bundaran-hi-ditutup.

'''Johan Petter Johansson''' (December 12, 1853 &amp;ndash; August 25, 1943), sometimes known as '''JP''', was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[inventor]] and [[industrialist]]. He invented a modern [[adjustable spanner]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bahco.com/en/about/|title=About Us {{!}} BAHCO|website=www.bahco.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (patents in 1891 and 11 May 1892). He obtained over 100 patents in total.

He was born in [[Vårgårda]] in western Sweden, the oldest of six children in a [[croft (land)|crofter]]'s family. His was first employed as an assistant operator of a [[steam engine]] at a local [[peat]] factory. He left Vårgårda at age 19, in 1873, for [[Motala]] to work as a [[navvy]]. Following [[military]] service in 1874, he moved to [[Eskilstuna]] where he worked for the [[Bolinder-Munktell]] factory, and in 1878 he moved to [[Västerås]] where he found employment at a mechanical [[workshop]]. Following that, he worked as a [[blacksmith]] at a nearby farm.

At this time, he had made a decision to leave Sweden for the [[United States]]. This never happened; he was instead offered a more esteemed job by his former employer Munktells, and the offer changed his mind.

He eventually decided to start his own business and, in 1886, moved to [[Enköping]] where he started ''Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad'' (the Mechanical Workshop of Enköping) which quickly became a successful venture. It was during the years in his workshop that he invented the [[adjustable spanner]] and the [[plumber wrench]]. In 1890, [[B.A. Hjorth &amp; Company]] agreed to distribute his tools worldwide under the "[[Bahco]]" trademark. The Bahco tools became greatly successful, and the company is still in operation and has manufactured over 100 million wrenches to date.

Johansson transferred the then-large enterprise to his son, Hannes Brynge, and the B.A. Hjorth &amp; Company in 1916. He started experimenting with electrical armature and in 1919 opened a new factory, Triplex&lt;!-- this is the building type --&gt;, which manufactured electrical [[pendulum]]s and various devices.

He died 89 years old after having been productive for the most of his life.

Deel 1] (Dutch) Johannes Enschedé (2)&lt;/ref&gt; was a Haarlem [[regent]] and collector.

==Biography==
He was the grandson of the founder of the [[Joh. Enschedé]] company, and one of the first members of the ''[[Dutch Society of Science]]'' and the ''[[Teylers Second Society]]''. He was a regent of the [[St. Elisabeth Gasthuis, Haarlem|St. Elizabeth's-Gasthuis]] and the [[Hofje van Staats]] en Noblet. Johannes was the son of [[Johannes Enschedé (1708-1780)]] and the brother of Jacobus and Abraham. He married [[Johanna Elisabeth Swaving]] and was the father of [[Johannes Enschedé III]] and Christiaan Justus (the father of [[Adriaan Justus Enschedé]]).

His father was a collector of [[Costeriana]] and had statues of Coster and [[Hadrianus Junius]], Coster's biographer, placed in the garden of his home, adjacent to the typesetter's workshop in 1768. An engraving by [[Cornelis van Noorde]] shows the workshop and the statues. Enschedé Jr. continued his father's collection of Costeriana and also added his love of Greek and Latin books.  He died relatively young, and his wife succeeded him in his role leading the company. Under her influence the day-to-day operations were split into three divisions; the newspaper, the type foundry, and the bible publishing. This "triumvirate" lasted three generations.

'''John Anderson''' (1747–1820) was a Scottish businessman and entrepreneur. He was a commercial agent in New York and later a business owner in Cork. His business played a pivotal role in creating infrastructure that connected Dublin to Cork. Anderson purchased land in [[Fermoy]] that was later used as a military complex. 

==Career==
Anderson was born into a poor family at Portland near Dumfries, Scotland and moved to [[Glasgow]] in 1784. He later settled in Cork City, at that time the major provisioning centre on the Atlantic Coast.  During the American wars he earned considerable sums as a commercial agent in New York, and made extensive land purchases in the Cork area.

His Cork enterprise was based at [[Lapp's Island]], and his business acumen was recognised as he grew rapidly in fortune and was appointed to the city's committee of merchants.  He was made a Freeman of the city in 1787.  Among his business interests was a malting and warehouse complex at [[Ballinacurra, County Cork|Ballinacurra]] on Cork Harbour in partnership with John Lapp, in the 1780s.  In common with many Cork merchants he was in favour of union with Great Britain in 1800.  Anderson's Quay in Cork is called after him.  He married a Miss Semple and had two daughters and two sons, one of whom, [[Sir James Caleb Anderson, 1st Baronet|James Caleb Anderson]] (1782–1861), was a noted experimenter with steam-driven road vehicles.

His fortunes suffered a series of reversals with the fall in the value of land after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and he lost over £30,000 in a Welsh mining venture.  He had been conducting banking business and with the economic downturn his bank collapsed in 1816.

===Development of roads and coaching===
Anderson secured the equivalent of a government franchise to provide a mail service from [[Dublin]] to Cork.  This involved the building of an extensive infrastructure of roads, bridges, inns and [[stage coach]] stations. By 1789 he was the dominant partner in the Dublin–Cork turnpike and mail line, which was extended to Limerick in 1793.  Its paramount achievement was getting from Dublin to Cork within 24 hours, the first Royal Mail arriving in Cork 8 July 1789.

===Founding of Fermoy===
Anderson purchased lands in the [[Fermoy]] area in 1791 and responded to a British government demand for military barracks by offering to build to their order in Fermoy.  The first barracks was for 1400 troop and 100 horses, later increased to a total of 3300 men.  Soon a vast military complex with workshops and ancillary services together with coach workshops were functioning.

'''Jacobus Petrus "Koos" Bekker''' (born 14 December 1952) is chairman of leading emerging markets media group [[Naspers]].&lt;ref name=Naspers&gt;{{cite web|title=About Naspers, Non-Executive Directors|url=http://www.naspers.com/about#Non-Executive|website=Naspers|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-19/south-african-bekker-becomes-billionaire-with-china-media&lt;/ref&gt;
The company operates in 130 countries and is listed on the London and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges, and has the largest market capitalization of any media company outside the US and China.

==Early life==
Koos Bekker was born in [[Potchefstroom]], South Africa on 14 December 1952.  Bekker received his school education from Hoër Volkskool Heidelberg and completed degrees from [[Stellenbosch University]] in Law and Literature and [[Wits University]] in Law. During his studies in Stellenbosch he was a hostel boarder of Eendrag Manskoshuis.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

==Career==
After a few years in advertising he read an MBA degree at [[Columbia Business School]], graduating in 1984.  As a result of a project paper, he, and a few young colleagues founded one of the first two pay television services outside the US.  [[M-Net]] and its sister companies like Multichoice eventually expanded to 48 countries across Africa. In the 1990s, he was a founding director of mobile communication company [[MTN Group|MTN]].&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=82609080&amp;privcapId=35248158|title=Koos Bekker: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 Bekker became CEO of Naspers, one of the initial investors in the M-Net/Multichoice group.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}   Naspers bought out the other shareholders.  During his tenure, the market capitalization of Naspers grew from about $1.2 billion to $45 billion.  His compensation package was unusual in that for fifteen years as CEO he earned no salary, bonus or perks.  He was compensated solely via stock option grants that vested over time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Foreign investments==
Under Bekker, Naspers invested in pay television, mobile telephony and various internet services.  Geographically the group spans Europe, Africa, Latin America, China, India, Russia and various smaller countries.

[[PepsiCo]] has produced a number of variations on its primary [[cola]], [[Pepsi]], over the years, including the following:

==Sodas==
{{Repetition|date=August 2008}}
*'''[[Pepsi]]''': [[PepsiCo]]'s signature cola flavor and its namesake cola.
*'''[[Caffeine-Free Pepsi|Pepsi Free]]''': Introduced in 1982 by PepsiCo as the first major-brand caffeine-free cola and is today sold as [[Caffeine-Free Pepsi]] and [[Caffeine-Free Pepsi|Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi]].
*'''[[Pepsi Wild Cherry]]''': Introduced in 1988, it is cherry flavored cola. Known as Wild Cherry Pepsi until 2005. It was named Wild Cherry to not be confused with Coke's Cherry variation. Available nationally in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Russia]].
*'''[[Crystal Pepsi]]''': the Clear version of cola; introduced in 1992 and sold until 1993, it returned in 2015 as part of a limited sweepstakes promotion, and has been re-released several times since.
**'''Crystal from Pepsi''': Discontinued citrus/cola hybrid; reformulation of Crystal Pepsi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/pepsi-sees-citrus-appeal-crystal/90890/|title=PEPSI SEES CITRUS APPEAL IN ITS CRYSTAL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Pepsi Clear''': Clear Pepsi released in Mexico as a limited edition during Christmas 2005, the Mexican equivalent of Crystal Pepsi.
*'''Pepsi AM''': Contains more [[caffeine]] than a regular Pepsi and marketed as a morning drink. Introduced in 1989 and discontinued in 1990.
*'''Pepsi Fresh''': Made only for summer 2007.{{Specify|date=March 2010}}
*'''Pepsi X''' - 2012 release (Dragon Fruit Cola) Marketed from X Factor television show.
*'''Pepsi Candy''': Sold in [[Canada]] in 1999 in the Spring as a sweeter version with a fruity taste.
*'''[[Pepsi Raw]]''': "a new cola made with only natural ingredients", released in select markets in 2009 and discontinued along with its variant Pepsi Raw in 2011.
*'''[[Pepsi Blue]]''': A blue colored fruity soda (described as a "Berry Cola Fusion"). Given a huge marketing push, often considered a major flop on the order of [[New Coke]]. No longer produced. In Iceland, Pepsi Blue was sold for a brief period of time during the winter of 2003/2004, and in India during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. It was sold for a longer period in [[Austria]], and is still available in some parts of [[Mexico]]. It is also still available in [[Indonesia]]. It was also sold in the Philippines for a limited time only, usually, it appears during Christmas season. Likewise, it was sold for a limited time in Australia, [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], [[Finland]], and [[Romania]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*'''Pepsi Gold''': Limited edition gold colored variant as part of a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2007]] promotion. It had a hint of ginger, but nowhere near the spice level of Pepsi Red, and was sold in Southeast Asia, Central Europe, Finland, Russia, [[Turkey]], and The Middle East. Re-released as Pepsi Cheer for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].
*'''Pepsi Holiday Spice''': a limited edition variety which the company began selling November 1, 2004 in the U.S. and Canada for an eight-week period, and again in the 2006 Christmas season. It is flavored with a seasonal finish of [[cinnamon]], somewhat similar to the Swedish [[Julmust]].
**'''Christmas Pepsi:''' Almost identical to Pepsi Holiday Spice, with nutmeg and cocoa added to the ingredients list, and was marketed over the 2007 and 2008 Christmas seasons.
*'''Pepsi Kona''', a coffee-flavored cola which was test-marketed on the East Coast of the USA.
*'''Lemon Pepsi''': Limited Edition to promote NFL kickoff 2008, same taste as Pepsi Twist

'''Llanymynech Heritage Area''' is an historic former [[lime kiln]], [[quarry]] and industrial site near the village of [[Llanymynech]], Shropshire in the [[Welsh Marches]]. The site is adjacent to the [[A483 road]] and close to the [[Montgomery Canal]]. It is about {{convert|6|mi|0}} south of [[Oswestry]] on the English side of the border, and about {{convert|9|mi|0}} north of the [[Powys]] town of [[Welshpool]].

== History and significance ==

This is a nationally significant industrial heritage area, containing one of only three remaining [[Hoffmann kiln]]s in the country.&lt;ref name="shropshire"&gt;{{cite web|author=web.manager@shropshire.gov.uk |url=http://www.shropshire.gov.uk/outdoor-recreation/parks-and-countryside-sites/llanymynech-heritage-area/ |title=Llanymynech Heritage Area – Shropshire Council |publisher=Shropshire.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It provides key insights into industrial archaeology, as it was a major centre of the [[Lime (material)|lime]] industry until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="shropshire" /&gt; It is not known when the lime industry started here, but it may date back to [[medieval]] times or possibly earlier. The first reference to the site is on a map from 1753. Evidence of early settlement locally includes a prehistoric hill fort on Llanmynech HIll, while [[Offa's Dyke]] runs close to the site on the western perimeter. The area also has a long history of industrial activity, including copper and lead mining dating back to at least the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].&lt;ref name="cpat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/llanymyn/llanym.htm |title=Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust – Projects – Recent projects – Llanymynech |publisher=Cpat.org.uk |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the site ==

Prior to the opening of the Montgomery Canal (then known as the [[Ellesmere Canal]]) in 1796, limestone quarrying was undertaken on the site on a relatively small scale, although lime kilns for lime burning appear to have been within the quarry from at least 1753. In 1806 a tramway and incline was constructed to transport limestone from the quarry to a new wharf on the canal. A second tramway was constructed to the east of the site sometime between 1807–1837 and this became the main transport route, remaining in use until the closure of the quarry in 1914.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;

The 1863 opening of the [[Llanfyllin branch]] line, part of [[Cambrian Railways]], had a major impact on the quarry, enabling much faster transportation of limestone and opening up new potential markets. Additional track and sidings were built along with two [[Lime_kiln#Types_of_kiln|draw kilns]] – located to the west of the Hoffman kiln. Designed for continuous operation and built after 1874, these two kilns were abandoned by 1900.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;

The Hoffman kiln was the last major development on the site and is believed to have been built around 1900, along with additional tramways and rail track. The kiln, which is exceptionally well preserved, measures around {{convert|44.8|xx|17.5|m|ft}} and has two tunnel vaults entered through 14 round-headed arches. The chimney, a local landmark, stands on a plinth and is around {{convert|42.5|m|0}} high.&lt;ref name="cpat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/grant-aided-properties/hoffman-kiln-chimney-and-draw-kiln-llanymynech-sy22-6jx/ |title=Hoffman Kiln Chimney and Draw Kiln, Llanymynech |publisher=English Heritage |date=12 February 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration and community project ==

A restoration project ran from 2006–2009, with funding from both the Heritage Lottery Fund and [[English Heritage]]. Additional financial support also came from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and project partners, with the aim to conserve the site for visitors and educational purposes.&lt;ref name="shropshire" /&gt;

As part of the project, an archaeological investigation was carried out.&lt;ref name="invest"&gt; Discovering Shropshire's History [http://www.shropshirehistory.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/theme:20091009142647 "Archaeological investigations at the Llanymynech Limeworks Heritage Site in 2006-7"] Date retrieved: 1 August 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; Its main aim was to gather information about key features of the site – particularly the location of former tramways, ground surfaces and turntable track-beds.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt;

A local community project also received funding from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], highlighting the importance of the area through initiatives including:
* Commissioning a sculpture, information boards, signage and leaflets
* Providing picnic benches and seating
* Volunteer research visit, wharf clearance, tours and opening of the canalside stable block.
* Creating a website and producing a social history archive.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;Llanymynech Community Project [http://www.llanymynech.org.uk/html/community_project.html "Community Project"]. Date retrieved: 1 August 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;
== Artefacts from the site ==

Some artefacts discovered at the site in recent years are on display at Oswestry Town Museum. These range from tools and a quarryman's boot to a tramway [[Railroad tie|sleeper]], [[Railway coupling|couplings]] and a [[Pulley|pulley wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oswestrytownmuseum.co.uk/index.php/exploring-the-museum/llanymynech-limeworks/ |title=Llanymynech Limeworks |publisher=Oswestry Town Museum |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walking Activities ==
This area contains a variety of short or long walks with routes leading passed lime kilns, woodland, canals, old railways, and grazed pastures.&lt;ref name="shropshire"/&gt; Along these routes are various information panels and sculptures to inform you about the area, some of these pathways are rough and so suitable footwear is recommended.&lt;ref name="shropshire"/&gt;

'''Miklós Hagyó''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] pronunciation: [[Help:IPA for Hungarian|hɒɟoː mikloːʃ]]; born July 20, 1967) is a Hungarian [[entrepreneur]] and [[politician]], a former [[deputy mayor]] of Budapest and a former member of the [[Hungarian parliament]].  From 1998 until 2010, Hagyó was active in the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite news|last=Nagy|first=György B.|title=Hagyó Miklós tündöklése és bukása|url=http://www.hetek.hu/belfold/201002/hagyo_miklos_tundoklese_es_bukasa|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=Hetek|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|April 2010 elections]], when Hagyó lost his seat, he was arrested on suspicion of [[extortion]] and [[breach of fiduciary responsibility]].&lt;ref name=Balogh&gt;{{cite web|last=Balogh|first=Eva S.|title=A Botched-Up Show Trial|url=http://hungarianspectrum.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/a-botched-up-show-trial-in-hungary/|work=Hungarian Spectrum|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[trial]] against Hagyó and 14 other suspects is currently underway in [[Kecskemét]].

== Education ==

In 1989, Hagyó earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Product Engineering]] from the former Budapest University of Horticulture and Food Industry in [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]]. After the undergraduate studies, he relocated to the university's Budapest campus in pursuit of an [[advanced degree]] in [[Food Engineering]] from the Department of Economics.&lt;ref name="Szilagyi; Borsodi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Szilagyi, Richard;|first=Borsodi, Attila|title=Hagyó felemelkedése és bukása|url=http://mno.hu/migr_1834/hagyo_felemelkedese_es_bukasa-251769|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=MNO|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagyó claimed that he subsequently pursued doctoral work in the subject matter, but he was forced to abandon the academic project due to "political and personal life difficulties".&lt;ref name="Hagyo Testimony"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagyo|first=Miklos|title=Testimony of Miklos Hagyo I. accused at Kecskemet Tribunal No.1.B.73/2012|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/Testimony_of_Miklos_Hagyo_REVISED.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=22 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagyó did however co-author a published scientific investigation into the "conditions of the food retail trade units in Hungary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakner|first=Z.|author2=Hagyo, M. |author3=Hajdu, I. |title=Óriások között.

== Career ==

=== Private Sector ===

Resulting from the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989, and the subsequent transition to a [[market economy]], [[Hungary]] saw a significant increase in [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and trade after 1991.&lt;ref name=Factbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungary|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hu.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking advantage of that, Hagyó began working in 1992 for [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley]]'s Hungarian operation, Hungaria. After working his way into an exclusive regional distribution position, Hagyó became involved in many [[Start-up company|start-up]] food distribution companies. According to him, he enjoyed financial growth and professional success "thanks to the [post-Soviet] economic boom." &lt;ref name="Szilagyi; Borsodi" /&gt;

=== Politics ===

In 1998, Hagyó became a member of the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]], citing [[Gyula Horn]]'s "personality and role" as his attraction toward [[politics]].&lt;ref name="Hagyo Testimony" /&gt;

Four years later, Hagyó was one of 178 [[socialists]] elected to the [[National Assembly]], thus granting him the title [[Member of Parliament]]. Thereafter he served as the party's president of district XII in [[Budapest]], which placed him on the party's national board.&lt;ref name="Hagyo Testimony" /&gt; At various moments between July 2002 until May 2006, Hagyó was active in various [[parliamentary committee]]s: Joint EU Institutions Committee, Regional Development Committee, Environmental Committee, and Foreign Affairs Committee.&lt;ref name="Orszag Haza"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hagyo Miklos|url=http://www.parlament.hu/internet/plsql/ogy_kpv.kepv_adat?p_azon=h023|work=Az Orszag Haza|publisher=parlament.hu|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during that time, he delivered three speeches in [[Hungarian Parliament|Parliament]], and he submitted a total of 55 independent and non autonomous [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]].&lt;ref name="Orszag Haza" /&gt;

In 2005, acting as the party's chairman for nationwide charitable activities, he and Dr. Lajos Oláh organized Hope for [[Transylvania]]. With the help of the [[Hungarian Red Cross]], they collected and delivered food, medicine, tents, blankets, and other emergency supplies to residents in the severely flooded region.&lt;ref name="Debreceni InfoPortál"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sikerrel zárult az MSZP 'Reménysugár Erdélyért' akciója|url=http://www.dip.hu/index.php?action=cikk&amp;id=13499|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Debreceni InfoPortál|date=22 December 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he helped secure substantial funds from the Hungarian Red Cross in an effort to transport many of the victims to [[Hungary]] while the damaged communities were restored.&lt;ref name="MTV - Archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Az MSZP-s önkormányzatok székelyföldi gyerekeket látnak vendégül|url=http://www.tvarchivum.hu/?id=57658|publisher=MTV - Archive|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the social unrest of a [[2006 protests in Hungary|2006 scandal]] involving former [[Socialist]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]], many thought that opposing [[Fidesz]] representatives would oust the socialists from their [[Parliamentary seat|seats]] in [[Budapest]].  Despite that, the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]]-[[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist]] coalition incumbent [[Gábor Demszky]] was re-elected.  In addition to holding his parliamentary position, Hagyó was appointed as [[Deputy Mayor]] of [[Budapest]] on December 14, 2006.&lt;ref name="Hagyo Testimony" /&gt; As Deputy Mayor, Hagyó wield political oversight over the city's urban and asset management responsibilities.

During his second parliamentary term, Hagyó was active in the following committees between May 2006 and June 2007: Economic and Information Technology Commission, the Commission's Energy Subcommittee and the Enterprise Research and Development Subcommittee.&lt;ref name="Orszag Haza" /&gt; Also during that allotted time, he made three speeches to Parliament, and he submitted a total of 15 independent and joint motions.&lt;ref name="Orszag Haza" /&gt;

As a member of the [[Hungarian Olympic Committee]], Hagyó was elected President of the Hungarian [[synchronised swimming|Synchronized Swimming]] Association (MSZSZ) in 2007 after the resignation of the previous president, Csaba Haranghy.&lt;ref name=MOB&gt;{{cite web|title=FŐPOLGÁRMESTER–HELYETTES A SZINKRONÚSZÓ - ALSZÖVETSÉG ELNÖKE|url=http://mob.hu/content/index/id/74728|work=mob.hu|publisher=Magyar Olimpiai Bizottság|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, MSZSZ Secretary General Laszló Szimandl stated in an interview:

{{quote|Mr. Miklós Hagyó greatly helped over the last two years...He provided the financial backing, thanks to which we were able to provide a coach from abroad for training sessions, and were able to organize professional training camps for our national team. We finally had the background support for our professional sport achievements.'''&lt;ref name=stop.hu&gt;{{cite news|title=Hagyó Miklós az elmúlt két évben nagyon sokat segített|url=http://www.stop.hu/sport/hagyo-miklos-az-elmult-ket-evben-nagyon-sokat-segitett/609913/|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=stop.hu|date=11 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224134705/http://www.stop.hu/sport/hagyo-miklos-az-elmult-ket-evben-nagyon-sokat-segitett/609913/#|archive-date=2015-02-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At that time, Hagyó was forced to resign from the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|socialist party]] and its associated position.  He therefore was unable to remain the president of the [[synchronized swimming]] association.

According to [[Corporate video|promotional videos]],&lt;ref name="Budapest, I love you"&gt;{{cite web|title=Budapest, I love you like this!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apti8vL85Cc|publisher=Dosszie Hagyo|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; his pride of his [[Jászberény]] [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]&lt;ref name="Farm to Fame"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawking|first=Ben|title=From the Farm to Fame - Who is Mr. Miklos Hagyo?|url=http://thehagyocase.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/from-the-farm-to-fame-who-is-mr-hagyo-miklos/|work=The Hagyo Case|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - an ethnically mixed community due to historical wars - and his recognition of [[Romani people|Roma]] soldiers,&lt;ref name="Múltikor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Az 1848-1849-es szabadságharc zsidó és roma hőseire emlékeztek|url=http://www.mult-kor.hu/cikk.php?id=20079|work=Múlti-kor történelmi portál|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagyó is a supporter of [[ethnic diversity]].  During a March 2008 speech recognizing the efforts of [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848 revolution]], Hagyó reminded his Hungarian audience that the history of the [[Serbs]], the [[Croatians]], and the [[Poles]] are regrettably more known than that of the [[Romany soldiers|Romany]] soldiers.&lt;ref name="Múltikor" /&gt;

Responding to the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]], Hagyó signed a denunciatory petition to promote Hungarian political support for the [[Tibetans]].  While doing so, he urged all politician to come forth with support despite [[political affiliation]].  Moreover, Hagyó stated:

{{quote|We do not consider it desirable to [[boycott]] the [[Olympic Games]] and vehemently reject any initiative of any country to boycott them, and we object to any country’s decision to forbid its athletes to attend the Games. However, the week’s ongoing events should make every responsibly thinking person consider protesting [[China]]’s behavior with regards to the [[Tibetans]]. Even though the Tibetan issue of [[Dictatorship|dictatorial governance]] overshadows the Olympic Games, I sincerely hope that the scheduled summer Games will in no way be compromised, and that the Olympic Games, which bring a message of bravery and friendship, will bring peace and equality to all.'''&lt;ref name=HirExtra&gt;{{cite news|title=Hagyó Miklós bojkottál|url=http://www.hirextra.hu/2008/04/01/hagyo-miklos-bojkottal/|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=HírExtra|date=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Budapest Transit Authority (BKV) ===

In 2009, BKV was investigated by city's police and the State Audit Office of Hungary because of an employee severance payment controversy.&lt;ref name="Turmoil on the Transportation Front"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turmoil on the Transportation Front|url=http://hagyofiles.blogspot.hu/2012/12/turmoil-on-transportation-front.html|work=Hagyo Files|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of BKV's upper management were interrogated concerning possible involvement.

Former BKV chief executive office Zsolt Balogh gave an interview to the daily newspaper ''[[Magyar Nemzet]]'' (Hungarian National) on March 6, 2010&lt;ref name="Balogh Magyar Nemzet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Csermely|first=Peter|title=I Handed Over the Money in a Nokia Box to Hagyo|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/Magyar_Nemzet_Eng_REVISED.pdf|work=Magyar Nemzet|accessdate=24 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a separate interview the following day to [[HírTV]].&lt;ref name="Balogh HirTV Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=HírTv Interview with Zsolt Balogh|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/HirTv_ENG_REVISED.pdf|work=HírTv|accessdate=24 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the interviews, Balogh publicly accused Hagyó of [[extortion]] and [[Breach of fiduciary duties|breach of fiduciary duty]].  According to the accuser, he entered Hagyó's office "in late September, early October 2007"&lt;ref name="Balogh Magyar Nemzet" /&gt;  as the freshly promoted [[chief technology officer]]. Then and there, Balogh claimed, Hagyó dictated that Balogh must "be hard, because things must be done here, and who doesn't do it" will receive no mercy, and the throat "must be cut."&lt;ref name="Balogh Magyar Nemzet" /&gt;

In the same two interviews, Balogh alleged that during a later meeting in [[Gödöllő]], Hagyó demanded from Balogh an annual "membership fee" of 15 million [[forints]] which would need to be paid directly to Hagyó.&lt;ref name="Balogh HirTV Interview" /&gt; Balogh admitted that the following day he obliged to the demand. In the March 6th interview, Balogh stated that he met Hagyó in the office of Ottó Lelovics, former [[public relations]] and communication consultant to BKV. Then and there he passed 15 million forints to Hagyó.  Balogh stated that he knew "15 million fits in a [[Nokia]] box," so he hid the [[money]] inside a Nokia box designed for mobile phone packaging.&lt;ref name="Balogh Magyar Nemzet" /&gt; As a result, this [[scandal]] has become known as the "Nokia Box Case" or the "Magic Box Case."

On March 7, 2010 the online Hungarian news site ''[[Index.hu]]'' reported that Hagyó resigned from his local and national positions in the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref name="Index - Hagyo Leaves Party"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hagyó Miklós felfüggesztette párttagságát|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2010/03/07/hagyo_miklos_felfuggesztette_parttagsagat/|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=Index|date=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, the party's [[spokesman]], [[István Nyakó]], stated that the accusations had "not been about the truth."&lt;ref name="Index - Hagyo Leaves Party" /&gt; Nyakó also explained that other [[socialist]] [[politicians]] did not want the scandal to hinder the party in the upcoming [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 elections]].&lt;ref name="Index - Hagyo Leaves Party" /&gt;

Immediately following the change of [[government]] on May 14, 2010, Hagyó was detained by police.&lt;ref name="Police hold Hagyo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police hold ex-deputy mayor Hagyo|url=http://www.politics.hu/20100517/police-hold-exdeputy-mayor-hagyo/|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[bribery]] accusations from Balogh, police suspected him of instructing former BKV managing director Attila Antal of concluding an unnecessary [[contract]] with [http://www.aam.hu/hu/fooldal/ AAM] and misappropriating funds related to the suburban railway line [[HÉV]] passenger information supply system.&lt;ref name=Indictment&gt;{{cite web|title=Vádirat (Indictment)|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/CENTRAL_INVESTIGATING_CHIEF_PROSECUTOR_revised1.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|publisher=Central Investigating Chief Prosecutor's Office|accessdate=25 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pretrial Detention ==

On May 26, 2010 Hagyó was incarcerated at the Budapest Penitentiary in spite of numerous appeals from Hagyó's lawyer, András Kádár, who argued that his client suffered from numerous illnesses and no evidence supported the stringent measure.&lt;ref name="Pretrial detention order"&gt;{{cite web|last=Szivos|first=Maria|title=The Metropolitan Court as second instance court 30.AJC.1355/2010/02.|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/7_ENG_REVISED.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=25 April 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signatory judge, Mária Szívós, cited the necessity of the coercive measure as prevention from suspect collusion&lt;ref name="Pretrial detention order" /&gt;  and prevention from Hagyó fleeing the country.&lt;ref name="Police hold Hagyo" /&gt;  Prior to this, Hagyó communicated via his lawyer, András Kádár, willingness to cooperate in the ongoing investigation.&lt;ref name="Cooperation Letter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kadar|first=Andras|title=Letter From Kadar to Colonel Mihály Bezsenyi|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/elso_oldal_ENG.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=25 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagyó's initial release date was June 17, 2010.&lt;ref name="Pretrial detention order" /&gt; The prosecution repeatedly proposed sentence extensions, which were approved by the Pest Central District Court and confirmed by the Municipal Court.&lt;ref name="Jail Extension"&gt;{{cite web|last=Keresztes|first=Imre|title=Inv. 477/2010. (Proposal for Extension of Pretrial Detention From Chief Prosecutor Imre Keresztes to Pest Central District Court)|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/22_ENG_REVISED.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=25 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044220/http://hagyomiklos.com/files/22_ENG_REVISED.pdf#|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagyó was released from [[prison]] into house arrest on February 13, 2011, and he remained on house arrest until June 8, 2011.&lt;ref name=Indictment /&gt;

On September 6, 2010, 11 days before his [[pretrial detention]] circumstance would again be extended via order 28.AJC.No.1850/2010/2.,&lt;ref name="Jail Extension" /&gt; Hagyó and Kádár filed application no.52624/10 with the [[European Court of Human Rights]].  In the application, they complained against validity of the pretrial detention and numerous prison conditions under [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 5]] § 1 (c), [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 5]] § 4 in conjunction with [[European Convention on Human Rights|Article 13]], [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]], and [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] in conjunction with [[European Convention on Human Rights|Article 13]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].  On April 23, 2013 the Court announced its decision, and in doing so they found the Hungarian judicial system to be in violation of the articles associated with the complaint.

While supporters of Hagyó's detainment agreed that the alleged [[mafia boss]] needed to be detained before administering further damage,&lt;ref name="XpatLoop - Mafia Boss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hagyo Indicted As Budapest Transport Company "Mafia Boss"|url=http://www.xpatloop.com/news/70615|work=XpatLoop.com|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[judicial process]] through which the decisions were made to imprison Hagyó received much criticism.  A Hungarian [[law]] student used the detainment and the subsequent trial as [[case studies]], focusing on the issue of basic rights established by the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]].&lt;ref name="Eva Kadar - Basic Rights"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kádár|first=Éva|title=BKV-ügy – a törvényes bírósághoz való jog hatálya alól is kiemelve?|url=http://www.jogiforum.hu/files/publikaciok/kadar_eva__bkv_ugy_a_tovenyes_birosaghoz_valo_jog_hataly_alol_is_kiemelve%5Bjogi_forum%5D.pdf|work=www.jogiforum.hu|publisher=Jogi Fórum Publikáció|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main points of contention were the prosecution's and court's unwillingness to allow neither Hagyó nor his lawyer access to the evidence&lt;ref name="Eva Kadar - Basic Rights" /&gt; which, according to the former bodies, necessitated an extended pretrial detention, especially when Hagyó suffered from deteriorating health.&lt;ref name="Prison Hospital Letter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Toma|first=Dr. Albert|title=59-63-52/2010.

As Hagyó was a young and popular socialist politician, some speculate that the detention and the trial have political, rather than criminal, motivations.  This speculation stems from bloggers,&lt;ref name=Balogh /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben Hawking - Show Trial in Hungary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawking|first=Ben|title=A Show Trial n Hungary|url=http://thehagyocase.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/a-show-trial-in-hungary/|work=thehagyocase.wordpress.com|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagyo Files - Indictment Manipulation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice or No Justice: The Prosecution Manipulates the Indictment, Again|url=http://hagyofiles.blogspot.hu/2013/03/justice-or-no-justice-prosecution.html|work=Hagyo Files|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; academics,&lt;ref name="Eva Kadar - Basic Rights" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheppele - Let's Pick Judges"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/first-lets-pick-all-the-judges/|title=First, Let's Pick All The Judges|last=Scheppele|first=Kim Lane|date=10 March 2012|work=|newspaper=New York Times|author-link=Kim Lane Scheppele|via=|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalists.&lt;ref name="Nepszava - Csatat Nyert Hagyo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Csatát nyert Hagyó|url=http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=640105|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=Népszava Online|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forgery Accusations ===

While serving his pretrial detention at the Budapest Penitentiary, Miklós Hagyó, with legal oversight from Dr. Viktor Géza Szűcs, empowered his common-law wife to act on his behalf with regards to Hagyó's company, WIRTASS Trade and Service, LLC. on August 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="Procuration Doc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagyo, Miklos;|first=Szucs, Viktor|title=Procuration|url=http://www.hagyomiklos.com/files/2_1ENG.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=23 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving the authorization of the trial's prosecutor, the document was sent along with a letter from Hagyó's common-law wife to Brigader-General Csaba Boglyasovszky, the principal administrator of the Venyige Street Penal Enforcement Institution.&lt;ref name="Common-Law Wife Visitation Request"&gt;{{cite web|title=Request in the Matter of Extraordinary Visitation|url=http://www.hagyomiklos.com/files/4_1ENG.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=23 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, Hagyó's partner states that the new situation would require extraordinary visitation rights.

In her request dated August 17, 2010 she states that "I would also like to record, that the actual mutual confidence alone is not sufficient to provide [for WIRTASS LLC.] adequate, objective and rational basis for decision making."&lt;ref name="Common-Law Wife Visitation Request" /&gt;   She therefore requested rights for two separate visitations per month to be "at pre-announced times in accordance with the house rules of the penal enforcement institution."&lt;ref name="Common-Law Wife Visitation Request" /&gt; Principal Administrator Csaba Boglyasovszky positively replied to the request on August 19, 2010 and granted her a visitation on the 26th of August, 2010.&lt;ref name="XO Visitation Rights Granted"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coverage: #6486 D.001.|url=http://www.hagyomiklos.com/files/4_2ENG.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=23 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, Boglyasovszky stated, "Referring to the letter dated on the 17th of August 2010. I inform you that for visiting Miklós Hagyó detainee, to you as the legal representative is allowed."&lt;ref name="XO Visitation Rights Granted" /&gt;

Prior to that, the television show Célpont aired by HírTV on March 21, 2010 allegedly showed material which were damaging to Miklós Hagyó and his partner.&lt;ref name="Slander Suit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forgery Accusation: What Exactly Happened?|url=http://www.hagyomiklos.com/?q=en/node/31|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Hagyó filed a lawsuit against HírTV within the Budapest Regional Court.&lt;ref name="Slander Suit" /&gt; On August 6, 2010 Hagyó and Dr. Viktor Szűcs signed a document which granted Hagyó's common-law wife to act as his legal representative in the slander lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Slander Suit Law Reps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Procuration|url=http://www.hagyomiklos.com/files/2_2ENG.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=23 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagyó presented this authorization to the prison via his counselor on September 2, 2010.&lt;ref name="Slander Suit" /&gt; 
The prosecution observed this and the fact that Hagyó's common-law wife lacked the necessary legal qualifications.  They therefore filed misdemeanor foregery charges against Hagyó, his partner, and Dr. Szűcs.&lt;ref name="Slander Suit" /&gt;

All three persons were cleared of the charges by the Pest District Central Court on January 16, 2012.&lt;ref name="Forgery Verdict"&gt;{{cite web|last=Német|first=Dr. Leona Judit|title=Verdict: No. 6.B.35649/2011/11.|url=http://hagyomiklos.com/files/10_a_ENG_REVISED.pdf|work=hagyomiklos.com|accessdate=23 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The trial ==

The trial of Miklós Hagyó and 14 other defendants is currently underway. It began in June 2012 at the [[Kecskemét]] Tribunal in the city of Kecskemét.&lt;ref name="XpatLoop - Mafia Boss" /&gt;

Trial 1.B.73/2012&lt;ref name="Resolution of Court Appointment"&gt;{{cite web|title=21/2012. (II. 16.) OBHE számú határozat bíróság kijelöléséről [OBHE No. 21/2012. (II. 16.), Resolution of Court Appointment]|url=http://www.birosag.hu/sites/default/files/allomanyok/obh/eljaro_bir/szabalyzat_hatarozat/21_2012_obh_hatarozat11.pdf|work=www.birosag.hu|publisher=Országos Bírósági Hivatal Elnöke (Chairman of the National Judicial Office)|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hagyó Miklós és társai ellen bűnszervezetben elkövetett hűtlen kezelés bűntette és más bűncselekmények
''miatt ''(Against Miklós Hagyó and Others Who Perpetrated Organized Crimes of Misappropriation of Funds and Other Crimes), like the pretrial detention circumstances, has been shrouded in controversy.  Apart from the speculative political nature of the case, red flags were raised when the trial was transferred from the Budapest Metropolitan Tribunal to the Kecskemét Tribunal.

The trial transfer was permitted under a temporary provision relating to the Act XIX. of 1998. (Criminal Proceedings) and Act LXXXIX. of 2011. (accelerating criminal justice).&lt;ref name="4th Amendment: Analysis of Consequences"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Amendment of the Basic Law: analysis of the consequences|url=http://www.riskandforecast.com/post/flash-report/the-fourth-amendment-of-the-basic-law-analysis-of-the-consequences_795.html|work=www.riskandforecast.com|publisher=Political Capital|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miklós Hagyó’s case has already been used by the politic in Hungary three times: the former politician was the symbol of corruption both in the national and the local elections in 2010. The only basis was a confession of a witness which was withdrawn since then. CÖF, the “civil” organization attached to the administration “advertised” the left-wing before the national elections of 2014 with posters in which Hagyó as a criminal was illustrated in the company of former prime ministers and party chairmen. There is no doubt that Hagyó’s case shall be used during the local elections in autumn. Furthermore, the restarted trial before the Kecskemét Tribunal will not give a quick end for sure since it is a very complex case indeed. Supposedly the right-wing will use Hagyó’s case even in the national elections of 2018 to blacken the political counter-party.

We do not know how the court considers but it is a fact that Zsolt Balogh eventually withdrew his confession in October, 2012. “I am not a hero. I did not want anything else but to go home” – he confessed the reason why he gave an interview to Magyar Nemzet daily and HÍR TV, the home media of FIDESZ. As he told the court he was forced by the police to tell stories about the NOKIA box in order to remain at large.

== Personal life ==
He is married. His wife is Beáta Csecserits. They have a daughter, Dorina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20030207hagyo.html Hagyó Miklós vagyonnyilatkozata - 2003. február]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagyó completed the pilgrimage on [[Way of St. James|El Camino de Santiago]].&lt;ref name="El Camino Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Video Clip from RTL: Hagyó and the Trip on El Camino|url=http://thehagyocase.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/a-video-clip-from-rtl-hagyo-and-the-trip-on-el-camino/|work=hagyocase.wordpress.com|publisher=RTL|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolaos Koklonis''' is a Greek entrepreneur and businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tff.gr/gossip/arthro/gnostoi_ellines_glitosan_para_trixa_to_makeleio_tou_reina_stin_konstantinoupoli-130702496/  Γνωστοί Έλληνες γλίτωσαν παρά τρίχα το μακελειό του Reina στην Κωνσταντινούπολη]&lt;/ref&gt; He is most known for being the founder of AirFastTickets and YoTrip.

== Career ==
After completing Business Administration from [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] in 2002, Koklonis worked as a risk manager at [[Société Générale]] for several years. In 2009, he had to book a plane ticket to [[Berlin]], which he found very difficult and frustrating. On his way back to [[Greece]] from the trip, he began planning on launching an online travel agency. Soon afterwards, he founded AirFastTickets with an initial capital of  €100,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140123006267/en/AirFastTickets-Offers-Justin-Bieber-Flight  AirFastTickets Offers Justin Bieber Flight out of US]&lt;/ref&gt; The company bought tickets in bulk from scheduled flights and then sold the tickets at discounted prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eturbonews.com/28370/airfastticketscom-greek-company-shows-right-way  Airfasttickets.com, a Greek company shows the right way]&lt;/ref&gt; AirFastTickets partnered with Groupon, which allowed it to sell a huge quantity of tickets with low marketing costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emea.gr/nikos-koklonis-interview/493115/493115/ Νίκος Κοκλώνης: "Η άνοδος και η πτώση του 'Bαρώνου'"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company opened its [[London]] office in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argophilia.com/news/airfasttickets-opens-london/25369/  Airfasttickets Opens London Office]&lt;/ref&gt; and its office in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/03/28/airfast-gay-themed-ad-upsets-many/#sthash.lmGbUZ9x.dpuf AirFast Gay-Themed Ad Upsets Many]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the extremely low prices the company offered for tickets, many Greek electronic travel agencies filed lawsuits against AirFastTickets for unfair competition practices. In 2013, the company was awarded for the most rapidly developed SME by the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/07/02/airfasttickets-greece-uk-usa/#sthash.fWbEQWCE.dpuf The Curious Case of Airfasttickets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piraeuspress.gr/piraeus/dimos-peiraia/23179/dynamiko-come-back-sthn-ellhnikh-agora-apo-ton-mr-airfasttickets-niko-koklwnh  Δυναμικό come back στην ελληνική αγορά από τον Mr Airfasttickets Νίκο Κοκλώνη!]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the company was in the news for offering [[Justin Bieber]] free tickets to travel anywhere outside the US due to Bieber's issues with the US authorities including a DUI. The company also offered free to tickets to him for as long as he stayed out of the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140123006267/en/AirFastTickets-Offers-Justin-Bieber-Flight AirFastTickets Offers Justin Bieber Flight out of US]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naughtygossip.com/please-leave/justin-bieber-offered-free-flight-to-leave-the-u-s-permanently-read-the-private-letter JUSTIN BIEBER OFFERED FREE FLIGHT TO LEAVE THE U.S. PERMANENTLY! – READ THE PRIVATE LETTER]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increased volume of sales and the high cost of developing a software, Koklonis defaulted on €45 million payment to [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]. In 2014, IATA closed the UK subsidiary of the company as well as the Greek office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protothema.gr/life-style/Gossip/article/615051/nikos-koklonis-xodepsa-ston-padelidi-40000-euro-se-ena-vradu/ Νίκος Κοκλώνης: «Ξόδεψα στον Παντελίδη 40.000 ευρώ σε ένα βράδυ»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/160956/article/ekathimerini/business/greek-owned-airfasttickets-put-in-default-by-iata  Greek-owned AirFastTickets put in default by IATA]&lt;/ref&gt; Koklonis began discussions with IATA and said that the company would clear its payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://machiavelli.gr/sports/29-english-news/2687-airfasttickets-in-discussions-with-iata-after-14m-default Airfasttickets in discussions with Iata after €14m default]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the company entered bankruptcy and was liquidated in October.

'''Predictive Buying''' is the name of the industry dedicated to algorithmic [[Consumer behaviour|consumer analytics]] yielding future buying patterns. The primary nature of [[data mining]],&lt;ref&gt;Kantardzic, Mehmed (2003). Data Mining: Concepts, Models, Methods, and Algorithms. John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-22852-4}}. OCLC 50055336&lt;/ref&gt; analysis and [[extrapolation]] have their roots in [[game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Fudenberg, Drew; Tirole, Jean (1991), Game theory, MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-06141-4}} .&lt;/ref&gt; [[rule of inference]]&lt;ref&gt;Boolos, George; Burgess, John; Jeffrey, Richard C. (2007). Computability and logic. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[regression analysis|regression]] models.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Kutner, C. J. Nachtsheim, and J. Neter (2004), "Applied Linear Regression Models", 4th ed., McGraw-Hill/Irwin, Boston&lt;/ref&gt;  Predictive Buying is an integration of [[predictive analytics]]&lt;ref&gt;Agresti, Alan (2002). Categorical Data Analysis. Hoboken: John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-36093-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the methods of [[permission marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, David Meerman (2007). The new rules of marketing and PR how to use news releases, blogs, podcasts, [[viral marketing]] and online media to reach your buyers directly. Hoboken, N.J.: J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.. p. 162. {{ISBN|978-0-470-11345-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
While [[direct marketing]] and content-relevant ads have expanded the personalized nature of individual consumer's experiences and communication with businesses,&lt;ref&gt;O'guinn, Thomas (2008). Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion. Oxford Oxfordshire: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; predictive buying intelligence bridges between consumers and the products they want. Even if the consumer does not know of a product's existence, predictive buying technology can, through an analysis of the consumer's interactions, purchase history and other factors, bring that product to the consumer’s attention.

==Limitations==
While many products are relevant, there will never be a perfect match every time, just as there isn’t always a perfect match with human intelligence when buying a product. This condition is especially true when the predictive buying analysis is based on [[limited data]] sets.

==The future==
The future for predictive buying however is unlikely to be impeded by limited data sets.  Trends in increased internet usage, the widespread popularity of [[social media]] and the data which can be obtained from an online merchant's [[website optimization]] analysis add daily to the diversity of data sources which can be mined, analyzed and extrapolated to accurately predict the products an individual is willing to purchase. Data sets are dramatically augmented when consumers give permission&lt;ref&gt;Godin, Seth (1999). Permission Marketing: turning strangers into friends, and friends into customers. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0-684-85636-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to examine the content of all of their related social media,&lt;ref&gt;V. Buskens, “Social networks and trust,” in The Netherlands:Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; trusting the exchange will provide for a better purchasing experience.&lt;ref&gt;U. Kuter and J. Golbeck, “Sunny: A new algorithm for trust inference in social networks using probabilistic confidence models,” in AAAI, 2007,&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Predictive buying is an applied derivative of [[Artificial Intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;John R. Davies, Stephen V. Coggeshall, Roger D. Jones, and Daniel Schutzer, "Intelligent Security Systems," in Freedman, Roy S., Flein, Robert A., and Lederman, Jess, Editors (1995). Artificial Intelligence in the Capital Markets. Chicago: Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; which may have some of its earliest roots manifest in Greek mythology.  Consider [[Hephaestus]] and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] which used the concept of intelligent robots (such as [[Talos]]). Through the years, there have been many advances in the philosophy of intelligent programming, but in 1945, [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, William (1992), Prisoner's Dilemma: John von Neumann, Game Theory and the Puzzle of the Bomb, Anchor, {{ISBN|978-0-385-41580-4}} . A general history of game theory and game theoreticians.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] introduced the [[Game Theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1982), Evolution and the theory of games, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28884-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced artificial intelligence. [[Vannevar Bush]] followed up later that year with an article in July 1945 in [[The Atlantic Monthly]] titled [[As We May Think]] focusing on a vision of future computers assisting humans in many activities.

It wasn’t until 1951 that the first AI programs were actually written by [[Christopher Strachey]] and [[Dietrich Prinz]] to run on the [[Ferranti Mark1]] machine of the [[University of Manchester]] to play checkers and chess.

In the 1990s [[data mining]] became a key development which eventually led to [[behavior-based robotics]], such as with [[Polly (robot)|Polly]], the first robot to navigate using vision and operate at animal-like speeds.

In 2005, [[recommendation technology]] based on [[Website visitor tracking|tracking web activity]] or media usage brought [[artificial intelligence]] to marketing.

'''Protais Zigiranyirazo''' (born 1938?) commonly known as '''Monsieur Zed''' ("Mr. Z"), is a [[Rwanda]]n businessman and politician.  He is the former governor of [[Ruhengeri]] prefecture in northwestern Rwanda.  He has also been accused of collaborating in the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 Rwandan genocide]] and the 1985 murder of [[Dian Fossey]].

Between 1974 and 1989 Zigiranyirazo served as governor of [[Ruhengeri]].  An ethnic [[Hutu]], he was well-connected to the Hutu establishment of politicians, businessmen and military officers which then controlled Rwanda: he is the brother of [[Agathe Habyarimana|Agathe Kanziga]], wife of the late Rwandan president [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], whose assassination on 6 April 1994 precipitated the events leading to the [[genocide]].

In 1989 he resigned his position as prefect to study at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] (UQAM) in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.  He was expelled from UQAM and from Canada in 1993 after being convicted of uttering death threats against two [[Tutsi]] refugees in Montreal, who "accused him of participating in the planning of ethnic massacres." &lt;ref name=globeandmail19940713a&gt;{{cite news

== Genocide allegations ==

Zigiranyirazo returned to Rwanda following his expulsion from Canada.  The Office of the Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) has accused him of committing several crimes during the months of the genocide in 1994.  Specifically, ICTR alleges that Zigiranyirazo "ordered or authorized roadblocks to be established in direct proximity to each of his three residences ... knowing and intending that they would be used in the campaign of extermination and killing."

Further "Protais Zigiranyirazo further instructed men at the roadblock to kill all [[Tutsi]] that attempted to pass through. Shortly thereafter, and on a continuing basis, soldiers and ''[[Interahamwe]]'' killed a number of people in their homes and killed people identified as Tutsi that attempted to pass through the roadblock."

==Arrest and court appearances==
From sometime after 1994 until July 2001 Zigiranyirazo resided in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].  On 21 July 2001 he was arrested in a [[Brussels airport]]  and seeking asylum in [[Belgium]].  On 4 October 2001 the Belgian government handed him over to the [[ICTR]].

On his initial appearance before the court in October 2001 he was charged with two counts of crimes against humanity.  The indictment against him was, however, amended pending his second appearance on 25 November 2003.  The amended indictment accuses him of committing genocide against Tutsis between April and July 1994 in [[Kigali]] and [[Gisenyi]]. Trial Chamber III composed of Judges Inés Mónica Weinberg de Roca, Khalida Rachid Khan and Lee Gacuiga Muthoga, on Thursday 18 December 2008, convicted Protais Zigiranyirazo of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment. Credit was given to him for time spent in prison. The verdict was overturned by the Appeal chamber of the ICTR who acquitted him of all charges on 16 November 2009, ordering the immediate release of Mr Zigiranyirazo and citing that the court has made serious errors in the initial judgement.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://unictr.org/Portals/0/Case%5CEnglish%5CZigiranyirazo%5Cdecisions%5C091116.pdf PROTAIS ZIGIRANYIRAZO v. THE PROSECUTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zigiranyirazo's acquittal, which was partly based on the fact that he was not found to have engaged in "genocide planning," has been criticized for giving credence to denial that the Rwandan genocide was planned by its perpetrators.

Based on records, Protais Zigiranyirazo resigned and abandoned politics in 1989 and since then, he has never been involved in political activities which has influenced the acquittal decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1869">A '''quasi-corporation''' is&lt;ref&gt;https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2225&lt;/ref&gt; an entity that exercises some of the functions of a [[company (law)|corporation]], but has not been granted [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] by [[statute]]. For example, a public corporation with limited authority and powers such as a county or school district is a quasi-corporation. In the [[United States]], such entities are often referred to as ''quasi-municipal corporations''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A quasi corporation is a business which has operated as a corporation without completing the legal requirements, often in the period just before formal incorporation. It is a corporation formed with good faith intent but lacking a formality.

It is also a corporation consisting of a person or body of persons invested with some of the qualities of an artificial person, though not expressly incorporated, esp. the official of certain municipal divisions such as counties, schools districts, and the towns of some states of the United States, certain church officials, as a churchwarden, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/q/quasi-corporation/|title=Quasi Corporation Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of quasi public corporations include the following:

* Sallie Mae
* Fannie Mae
* Communications Satellite Corporation (“COMSAT”)
* U.S. Postal Service &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.upcounsel.com/quasi-public-corporation|title=Quasi Public Corporation: Everything You Need to Know|website=UpCounsel|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''Russ Building''' is a [[Neo-Gothic]] office tower located in the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The {{Convert|133|m|adj=on}} building was completed in 1927 and had 32 [[Storey|floor]]s as well as the city's first indoor parking garage. It was the tallest building in San Francisco from 1927 to 1964 and one of the most prominent, along with its {{Convert|133|m|adj=on}} "twin", the [[PacBell Building]] to the south.&lt;ref name="EMP1"/&gt;

Upon completion, the building was iconic enough that ''Architect and Engineer'' wrote, “In nearly every large city there is one building that because of its size, beauty of architectural design and character of its use and occupancy, has come to typify the city itself ... Today the Russ Building takes this place in San Francisco. By its size and location and by the character of its tenants the building becomes indeed—'The Center of Western Progress'.”&lt;ref name=corbett&gt;{{cite book | last=Corbett | first=Michael R  | title=Splendid survivors: San Francisco's downtown architectural heritage | location=San Francisco | publisher=California Living Books | year=1979 | isbn=978-0-89395-031-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Manhattanization]] from 1960 to 1990 has shrouded the tower in a shell of skyscrapers, removing the tower's prominence.

The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s architecture critic John King described the Russ Building as "the embodiment of [[Jazz Age]] romance, a full block of ornate Gothic-flavored masonry that ascends in jagged stages from Montgomery Street with a leap and then a scramble to a central crown".&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cityscapes 2: Reading the Architecture of San Francisco|last=King|first=John|publisher=Heyday|year=2015|isbn=9781597143141|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower is a [[California Historical Landmark]].&lt;ref name="EMP1" /&gt;

Until the emergence of [[Sand Hill Road]] in the 1980s, many of the largest [[venture capital]] firms held offices in the Russ Building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''''The Progressive Populist''''' is a magazine in tabloid newspaper format published twice monthly. Founded in 1995, the magazine is based in [[Storm Lake, Iowa]], with editorial offices in [[Manchaca, Texas]]. The editor is James M. Cullen, managing editor is Art Cullen and the publisher is John Cullen.

The magazine labels itself as "A Journal from America's Heartland."&lt;ref&gt;[http://populist.com Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with political and economic topics of interest to "workers, small businesses, and family farmers and ranchers"; according to its "About" page, the journal "report[s] on issues of interest to the middle class of America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populist.com/about.html "Who We Are", ''The Progressive Populist''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine publishes original and syndicated columns of progressive journalists and pundits. 

Since October 31, 2010, The Progressive Populist also has had a partnership with Vicki Nikolaidis to produce an Internet radio show via [[Blogtalkradio]]. For the first two editions of the program, held on October 31 and November 11, the show was called ''The Progressive Politics Show'' and was hosted on Asnycnow Radio One.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asnycnowradio.wordpress.com/online-features/progressive Show Synopsis under Asnycnow tenure]&lt;/ref&gt; The show was renamed ''Talking Progressive Politics'' and moved to the Populist's BTR service since November 17, 2010. &lt;ref&gt; [http://blogtalkradio.com/talkingprogressivepolitics Official Radio Show] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003161329/http://www.blogtalkradio.com/talkingprogressivepolitics |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogtalkradio.com/talkingprogressivepolitics Talking Progressive Politics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003161329/http://www.blogtalkradio.com/talkingprogressivepolitics |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The final show associated with the ''Populist'' aired on January 5, 2012, and the show continued until its final broadcast on February 2, 2012. The show has since been canceled.  All past broadcasts have been pulled from Blogtalkradio and Vicki Nikolaidis has moved on to the ''Politics Daily'' show with BostonRed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14458">In [[Canada]], [[trade secret]]s are generally considered to include information set out, contained or embodied in, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, plan, compilation, computer program, method, technique, process, product, device or mechanism; it may be information of any sort; an idea of a scientific nature, or of a literary nature, as long as they grant an economical advantage to the business and improve its value.{{sfn|Turner|1962|p=4}} Additionally, there must be some element of secrecy. Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be the subject-matter of a trade secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vaver|first= David|date= 1981|title= Civil Liability for Taking or Using Trade Secrets in Canada|url= |journal= Canadian Business Law Journal|publisher= |volume= 5|issue= 1|page= 255|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
[[Trade secrets]] are a type of [[intellectual property]] that consists of certain [[information]], [[expertise]] or [[knowhow]] that has been developed or acquired by firms. This knowledge frequently gives firms their competitive edge in the market and it has to be kept as a secret.

In Canada any information that a firm or its employees produces or acquires for the purpose of the firm’s business can constitute confidential information that courts are willing to protect. All that is required is that the creator of the information “has used his brain and thus produced a result which can be produced by somebody who goes through the same process”.&lt;ref&gt;''Salman Engineering Co. Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Co. Ltd.'' (1948), [1963] 3 All E.R. 413 at 415 (C.A.).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Seager v. Copydex Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;''Seager Limited v Copydex Limited'', [1967] 2 All ER 415&lt;/ref&gt; courts will even act to protect a comparatively underdeveloped idea from misappropriation. However, information may stop being confidential and confident may be released from its obligations of confidence if the information subject to confidence is later publicly disclosed by the confider or a third party.

== Trade Secrets vs. Confidential Information ==
With one exception in the field of employer-employee relations, there is no recognized distinction in Canada between the rights and remedies afforded to [[trade secrets]] as opposed to mere [[confidential information]]. In the field of employer-employee relationships, the British case ''Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler'', which has been cited with approval by several Canadian courts, has drawn a distinction between the two.{{sfn|Belmore|Sartorio|2000|p=10}}

==Allocation of powers under the Constitution==
Under the ''[[Constitution Act 1867]]'', the exclusive Legislative Authority of the [[Parliament of Canada]] extends to most areas of intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and copyrights;&lt;ref&gt;Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 91(2), 91(22) and 91(23).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the provincial government has exclusive authority to legislate on matters related to [[property and civil rights]].  The federal Parliament also has exclusive jurisdiction to create offences under its criminal law power.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 91(29).&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, the federal ''[[Canadian trade-mark law|Trade-marks Act]]'' prohibited anyone from "do[ing] any other act or adopt[ing] any other business practice contrary to honest industrial or commercial usage in Canada,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =Trade-marks Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =T-13|section =7|subsection = e|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-7-20021231.html}} (now repealed)&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered to include the taking of trade secrets.{{sfn|Vaver|1981|p=265}} However, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[MacDonald v. Vapor Canada Ltd.]]'' that the provisions encroached on the provinces' authority over [[property and civil rights]] and could not be upheld under the federal [[trade and commerce]] power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=MacDonald et al. v. Vapor Canada Ltd.|link=MacDonald v. Vapor Canada Ltd.|year=1976|court=scc|num=181|format=canlii|pinpoint=pp. 172{{endash}}173|parallelcite=[1977] 2 SCR 134|date=1976-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the regulation of trade secrets as a civil matter falls under provincial jurisdiction.

==Civil Legal Framework==

=== Uniform Trade Secrets Act ===
The ''Uniform Trade Secrets Act'', adopted by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada in 1989, would provide civil remedies for the breach of trade secrets.  That Uniform Act defines "trade secrets" as follows:

{{quotation|
1(1) In this Act...

"trade secret" means any information that
:(a) is, or may be, used in a trade or business,
:(b) is not generally known in that trade or business,
:(c) has economic value because it is not generally known, and
:(d) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to prevent it from becoming generally known.

(2) For the purposes of the definition trade secret "information" includes information set out, contained or embodied in, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, plan, compilation, computer program, method, technique, process, product, device or mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Uniform Trade Secrets Act|date = 1989|url = http://www.ulcc.ca/en/uniform-acts-new-order/older-uniform-acts/537-josetta-1-en-gb/uniform-actsa/trade-secrets-act/730-uniform-trade-secrets-act-1989|publisher = Uniform Law Conference of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

To date, the Uniform Act has not been enacted into law by any of the Legislatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Table III: Uniform Acts Adopted before 2000, Showing the Jurisdictions that Have Enacted Them in Whole or in Part, with or without Modifications, or in Which Provisions Similar in Effect Are in Force|url = http://www.ulcc.ca/en/general-info-status/other-implementation-tables/2129-table-iii-pre-2000-uniform-acts-enacted-by-statute|at=p. 11|publisher = Uniform Law Conference of Canada|date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the definition has been incorporated in the federal ''[[Security of Information Act]]''.&lt;ref name = "SIA19"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =Security of Information Act|abbr =RSC|year =1985|chapter =O-5|section =19|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-5/section-19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Remedial Relief - Common Law Provinces===

In all the provinces but Quebec, trade secrets are governed by the common law, ultimately derived from the English common law as interpreted and applied in Canada. The Canadian definition of trade secret is based on Canadian case law and doctrine, and also draws on American and English case law.{{sfn|Thorburn|Fairbairn|1998|loc = para. 3:1200 and 3:2100}} In ''[[Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that a breach of confidence action is ''[[sui generis]]'' and the courts may rely on all three traditional jurisdictional bases for action (contract, equity and property) to enforce the policy of the law that confidences are to be respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.|link=Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.|year=1989|court=scc|num=34|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1989] 2 SCR 574|date=1989-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law, there are essentially five types of [[civil action]] that a [[trade secret]] holder can rely on to seek protection of its trade secrets before a court of justice:

#breach of contract (expressed or implied provision),
#breach of confidence,
#breach of fiduciary duty,
#unjust enrichment and
#wrongful interference with the contractual relations of others.{{sfn|Thorburn|Fairbairn|1998|loc = para. 5:1100}}

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] stated in ''Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.'' that all these types of actions coexist in the Canadian judicial system and remain available to the trade secret holder.&lt;ref&gt;''Cadbury Schweppes'', at pp. 40{{endash}}48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Remedial Relief - Quebec ===
In Quebec, trade secrets are governed by provisions under the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''.  An action for breach of [[trade secrets]] or confidential business information generally arises either from a contractual liability action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1458}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the absence of a contract, from a civil liability action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Code'' deals specifically with [[trade secrets]] in one article that provides for a defense where disclosing the secret is in the public interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1472}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in one that describes how a loss resulting from disclosure is to be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1612}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of its provisions define the concept of trade secret.

The [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] has ruled in ''Continental Casualty Company v. Combined Insurance Company'' that those who own [[trade secrets]] (''secrets de commerce'') are entitled to seek protection and that [[Quebec]] courts are competent to grant remedies in the case the plaintiff can evidence its ownership of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Continental Casualty Company v. Combined Insurance Company'' (1967) B.R. 814 at p.819.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contractual Sanctions ===
Two important forms of contract used by employers in Canada to protect their [[trade secrets]] and confidential information are [[non-disclosure agreements]] and [[non-competition agreements]], which are also known as [[confidentiality agreements]] and [[restrictive covenants]].{{sfn|Belmore|Sartorio|2000|p=10}}

According to ''Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler'', ex-employees, post-termination, may use their general skills and knowledge anywhere but they may not use or divulge their former employer’s trade secrets. Exceptionally, ex-employers may also be able to enjoin a former employee’s use of non-trade secret information where that information has been obtained from records which qualify as trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;''Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Flower'', [1986] 1 All E.R. 617 (CA).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''International Tools Ltd. v. Kollar'', in Canada the length of a [[permanent injunction]] to force a defendant to cease using the plaintiff’s information should not normally extend beyond the time that the plaintiff’s trade secrets remains a secret which is exclusively known to the plaintiff and its confidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=International Tools Ltd. v. Kollar et al.|link=|year=1968|court=onca|num=224|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 393|parallelcite=67 DLR (2d) 386|date=1968-01-29|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.]]'' Justice Binnie concluded that the form of relief for breach of confidence was “dictated by the facts of the case rather than strict jurisdictional or doctrinal considerations”.&lt;ref name = "Cadbury"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.|link=Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.|year=1999|court=scc|num=705|format=canlii|pinpoint=pp. 160{{endash}}161|parallelcite=[1999] 1 SCR 142|date=1999-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that “whether a breach of contract in a particular case has a contractual, tortuous, proprietary or trust flavour goes to the appropriateness of particular equitable remedy but does not limit the court’s jurisdiction to grant it”.&lt;ref name = "Cadbury"/&gt;

== Criminal Sanctions ==
In ''R. v. Stewart'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R. v. Stewart|link=|year=1988|court=scc|num=86|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1988] 1 SCR 963|date=1988-05-26|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that the taking of confidential information cannot form the basis of a charge of theft&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c C‑34, s 283 (now found at [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-322.html#h-95 ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 322]).&lt;/ref&gt; under the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'', but it could in certain circumstances form one for [[fraud]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c C-34, s 338;  now found at [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-380.html#h-105 ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1984, c C-46, s 380].&lt;/ref&gt;

:* while theft encompasses the taking or conversion of "anything whether animate or inanimate," the Court held that "anything" must still be property of some sort, capable of being "taken or converted in a way that deprives the owner of his proprietary interest in some way." Confidential information, by its very nature, "cannot be converted, not because it is an intangible, but because, save very exceptional far‑fetched circumstances, the owner would never be deprived of it."&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Stewart'', par. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
:* on the other hand, the concept of "defraud" is established under current jurisprudence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R. v. Olan et al.|link=|year=1978|court=scc|num=9|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1978] 2 SCR 1175|date=1978-05-30|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by proving a dishonest deprivation "of any property, money or valuable security or any service." This is satisfied upon proof of a risk of prejudice to the victim's economic interests; actual economic loss is not essential. Accordingly, deprivation of confidential information falls within the definition of fraud where it is in the nature of a [[trade secret]] or copyrighted material that has commercial value.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Stewart'', par. 45{{endash}}48&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament has since amended the ''[[Security of Information Act]]'' to provide that it is an offence to:

:* communicate a trade secret to another person, group or organization; or
:* obtain, retain, alter or destroy a trade secret,

for the benefit of a foreign economic entity, and to the detriment of Canada’s economic interests, international relations or national defence or national security.&lt;ref name = "SIA19"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8165">'''Uninsured employer''' in the United States is a term to identify an employer of workers under circumstances where there is no form of insurance in place to provide certain benefits to those workers.  More specifically, it is a term used in [[Workers' compensation|workers’ compensation]] law to identify an employer who does not have some form of worker’s compensation [[insurance]] or [[self-insurance]] coverage in effect at the time of, or during the time of, a claimed injury.

All States require that employers provide injury benefits coverage to their employees. These benefits are called workers’ compensation insurance coverage.  This kind of coverage is to be distinguished from [[Legal liability|liability]] coverage, which covers the premises and the owner/occupier of the space from claims made by non-employees for injuries on the premises. It is also to be distinguished from [[health insurance]], which covers only medical bills for non-work incurred conditions.

Protection can be accomplished through a traditional insurance policy for workers’ compensation coverage. Coverage can also be accomplished by way of compliance with various State self-insurance laws (usually reserved for larger employers) requiring substantial [[Surety bond|bonding]] and self-funding.  For example, public agencies are usually permissibly self-insured.

When the employer has no specific insurance, or arrangement for the provision of workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees, the employer is then referred to as an uninsured employer.

==Criminal law as per state ==
This status is highly negative one in most States and often deemed a crime under State law. When there are no funds available to cover the benefits, and resulting bills for such benefits, the State usually steps in and provides the funding; hence the State’s interest in making the failure to have coverage both legally and financially painful. Most often this involves complete repayment to the State, fines, penalties, business closure, and the loss of legal defenses.  The seriousness of the status by the uninsured employer is often underestimated due to unfamiliarity with the system and the belief that, like automobile uninsured motorist law, a quick settlement can be made by the uninsured for a modest amount to end the process.  This is contrary to State law and recent studies in California have shown that for 2009 average claim cost is upwards of $60,000 and continually rising.

==State-based uninsured employers fund==
Most often US states set aside fund to pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/wc/insurance/uef_info_doc.htm | title = Worker's Compensation: Uninsured Employers Fund | publisher = Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples:

===California Uninsured Employers Fund===
Two special funds pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/claims.html | title = Division of Workers' Compensation - Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund (UEBTF) &amp; Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIBTF) | publisher = California Department of Industrial Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Claims are paid from the Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund (UEBTF) when illegally uninsured employers fail to pay workers' compensation benefits awarded to their injured employees by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. The UEBTF is funded by a small tax on every Workers' Compensation policy that is written, and the UEBTF typically places liens on assets of the uninsured employers until the debt is repaid.  To do so, a Special Notice of Lawsuit must be properly served upon the uninsured employer to give the UEBTF legal jurisdiction for the recovery.
* The Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIBTF) is a source of additional compensation to injured workers who already had a disability or impairment at the time of injury. For benefits to be paid from the SIBTF, the combined effect of the injury and the previous disability or impairment must result in a permanent disability of at least 70 percent. The fund enables employers to hire disabled workers without fear of being held liable for the effects of previous disabilities or impairments. SIBTF benefit checks are issued to injured workers by the SIBTF Claims Unit after benefits are awarded by the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.

===New York Uninsured Employers Fund===
* If an employee is hurt when there is no workers' compensation policy in effect and that employee chooses to file a workers' compensation claim, the employer will be liable for the actual cost of medical care and compensation payments, in addition to penalties. If a corporation has failed to secure workers' compensation coverage, the president, secretary and treasurer of a corporation are personally liable for the medical care, compensation payments, penalties and possible criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/Employers/UEF.jsp | title = Workers' Compensation Coverage: Uninsured Employers Fund | publisher = New York State Workers' Compensation Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York State Workers' Compensation Board's Bureau of Compliance oversees uninsured claims. The Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF) is the funding mechanism for compensation and medical payments to injured employees whose employer was not properly insured at the time of the accident.

==Risks to an uninsured employer==
The risks to an uninsured employer are many, and can threaten the continued existence and viability of the firm. These risks include:

# Possibility of business closure
# Large fines imposed by the California Labor Commissioner ($2,000-$10,000 per Employee)
# Presumption of negligence
# Exposure to [[civil suit]]s by injured workers
# [[Criminal conviction]] and personal fines
# Imposition of a 10% surcharge in addition to the disability claim, plus attorney fees for the worker

==Dealing with problems==
While an uninsured employer does face a real problem, such as a prospective fine, prosecution, or employee injury, or is actually sued, there are steps the employer can take to minimize the consequences. Several established law firms can represent the employer in all administrative hearings and appeals, and advise the employer how to proceed. The goal for the uninsured employer is not only to achieve resolution to the immediate problem, but also to protect the assets of the firm, and to reach an accommodation with the regulatory agencies that enables the company to go forward in compliance with the law. The Uninsured Employer Benefit Trust Fund in CA does not have funding or staff to mitigate the value of an uninsured claim.  UEBTF merely pays the claim and all costs as claimed by the Applicant/Plaintiff, and assesses the cost against the uninsured employer.  If legal counsel is retained by the uninsured employer, there is at least opportunity to mitigate the value/reimbursement to UEBTF. Additionally, legal counsel can sometimes mitigate the administrative penalties, and negotiate repayment plans that allow the business to continue.
