'''Alkali salts''' or '''basic salts''' are salts that are the product of the [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] of a [[Base (chemistry)#Strong bases|strong base]] and a [[Acid strength#Weak acids in water|weak acid]].

Rather than being neutral (as some other [[salt (chemistry)|salts]]), alkali salts are [[base (chemistry)|bases]] as their name suggests. What makes these compounds basic is that the conjugate base from the weak acid hydrolyzes to form a basic solution. In [[sodium carbonate]], for example, the [[carbonate]] from the [[carbonic acid]] [[hydrolyze]]s to form a basic solution. The chloride from the [[hydrochloric acid]] in [[sodium chloride]] does not hydrolyze, though, so sodium chloride is not basic.

The difference between a basic salt and an alkali is that an alkali is the soluble hydroxide compound of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. A basic salt is any salt that hydrolyzes to form a basic solution. 

Another definition of a basic salt would be a salt that contains amounts of both hydroxide and other anions. [[White lead]] is an example. It is basic lead carbonate, or lead carbonate hydroxide. 

These materials are known for their high levels of dissolution in polar solvents.

These salts are insoluble and are obtained through [[precipitation reaction]]s.

==Examples==
*[[Sodium carbonate]]
*[[Sodium acetate]]
*[[Potassium cyanide]]
*[[Sodium sulfide]]
*[[Sodium bicarbonate]]

==Alkaline salts==
'Alkaline salts' are often the major component of alkaline [[dishwasher#Detergent|dishwasher detergent]] powders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4259199.html&lt;/ref&gt;

These salts may include:
*[[Sodium metasilicate|alkali metasilicates]]
*[[Sodium hydroxide|alkali metal hydroxides]]
*[[Sodium carbonate]]
*[[Sodium Bicarbonate]]

Examples of other strongly alkaline salts, include:
*[[Sodium percarbonate]]
*[[Sodium persilicate]] (?)
*[[Potassium metabisulfite]]

The '''Beriev A-60''' is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/Russian [[airborne laser]] [[laboratory]] aircraft based on the [[Ilyushin Il-76|Ilyushin Il-76MD]] transport.

In the 1970s a special aviation complex was established by the Soviets at Taganrog machine-building factory to develop airborne [[laser]] technology for the Soviet military.

In 1977 Beriev OKB started the design of a flying laboratory designated '1А'. The  purpose was to solve the complex scientific and engineering problems regarding the creation of an airborne laser and also to facilitate research on the distribution of beams in the top layers of an atmosphere. Work on this topic occurred with wide cooperation between the enterprises and the scientific organizations of the USSR, but the basic partner OKB was TSKB Almaz headed by B.V.Bunkin.

==Design and development==
The [[Il-76MD]] was selected as the base aircraft for the flying laboratory. To accommodate the laser many changes were made to the basic IL-76 design, which drastically changed the appearance of the plane.

* In front, instead of the regular nosecone, it was fitted with a steerable beam director turret for targeting [[lidar]] (years later, Boeing used a similar concept in the [[YAL-1]] test platform, although for the main laser, not targeting).
* A large retractable dorsal turret was installed for main laser firing, as engineers found it impossible to fit the main laser aiming optics into the nosecone turret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airwar.ru/enc/other/a60.html A-60 description]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two large nacelles were installed along the lower edge of the fuselage. One housed the [[turbo generator]]s used to power the laser, and another replaced the "chin" cabin, housing the targeting lidar's [[Auxiliary power unit|APU]].
* The rear cargo doors were removed, although the ramp was retained, as it was a structural element.
* The tail gunner position was removed.

The problem of accommodating the laser gun was therefore solved and it did not spoil the aerodynamics of the base aircraft. The laser system was 1 MW, created by one of the branches of the Institute of Atomic Energy, [[Kurchatov Institute|Kurchatov]]. This carbon dioxide laser was developed for installation on the IL-76.

The '1A' flying laboratory first flew on 19 August 1981 under E.A. Lakhmostov.

On 29 August 1991, the crew led by test pilot V.P. Demyanovski flew the second flying laboratory which received the name '1А2' СССР-86879. A new variant of a laser system was installed as a result of tests on '1А'.

Apparently, after being mothballed for more than 15 years, the project was recently (May 2009) reactivated, according to the eyewitness accounts about an A-60 spotted flying in the [[Rostov on Don]] and [[Taganrog]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legatus-minor.livejournal.com/1195148.html Picture of A-60 flying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209054234/http://legatus-minor.livejournal.com/1195148.html |date=9 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now parked at Taganrog airport.  47°11'53.92"N  38°51'46.05"E

Russia has developed a military airborne laser mounted in a A-60, designated 1LK222 [[Sokol Eshelon]]. The second A-60 laboratory can be seen at this reference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royfc.com/acft_news_old_aug3.html#20aug&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20100922/160685196.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sputniknews.com/military/201802251061979166-russia-creates-airborne-antisatellite-laser/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">In [[chemistry]], '''bond energy''' (''E'') or '''bond enthalpy''' (''H'') is the measure of '''bond strength''' in a [[chemical bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{JerryMarch}}&lt;/ref&gt; IUPAC defines bond energy as the average value of the gas-phase bond dissociation energies (usually at a temperature of 298&amp;nbsp;K) for all bonds of the same type within the same chemical species. For example, the [[carbon]]–[[hydrogen]] bond energy in [[methane]] ''H''(C–H) is the [[enthalpy]] change involved with breaking up one molecule of methane into a carbon atom and four hydrogen [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]]s, divided by 4. Tabulated bond energies are generally values of bond energies averaged over a number of selected typical chemical species containing that type of bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Bond energy (mean bond energy)|file=B00701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond energy (''E'') or bond enthalpy (''H'') should not be confused with [[bond-dissociation energy]]. Bond energy is the average of all the bond-dissociation energies in a molecule, and will show a different value for a given bond than the bond-dissociation energy would. This is because the energy required to break a single bond in a specific molecule differs for each bond in that molecule. For example, methane has four C–H bonds and the bond-dissociation energies are 435&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol for ''D''(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–H), 444&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol for ''D''(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–H), 444&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol for ''D''(CH–H) and 339&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol for ''D''(C–H). Their average, and hence the bond energy, is 414&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, even though not a single bond required specifically 414&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol to be broken.

==Bond energy–distance correlation==
Bond strength (energy) can be directly related to the [[bond length]] and bond distance. Therefore, we can use the [[metallic bonding#Metallic radius|metallic radius]], [[ionic radius]], or [[covalent radius]] of each atom in a molecule to determine the bond strength. For example, the ''covalent'' radius of [[boron]] is estimated at 83.0&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]], but the bond length of B–B in B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is 175&amp;nbsp;pm, a significantly larger value. This would indicate that the bond between the two boron atoms is a rather ''weak'' single bond. In another example, the metallic radius of [[rhenium]] is 137.5&amp;nbsp;pm, with a Re–Re bond length of 224&amp;nbsp;pm in the compound Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. From this data, we can conclude that the bond is a very strong bond or a [[quadruple bond]]. This method of determination is most useful for covalently bonded compounds.{{Ref|Alcock}}

==Factors affecting ionic bond energy==
There are several contributing factors but usually the most important is the difference in the [[electronegativity]] of the two atoms bonding together.

A '''bubble''' is a [[:wikt:globule|globule]] of one substance in another, usually [[gas]] in a [[liquid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcWLcDtwI3YC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=A+bubble+is++one+substance+in+another,+usually+gas+in+a+liquid.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQmsy8neTUAhUj6oMKHXmQDiAQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20bubble%20is%20%20one%20substance%20in%20another,%20usually%20gas%20in%20a%20liquid.&amp;f=false|title=The Motion of Bubbles and Drops in Reduced Gravity|last=Subramanian|first=R. Shankar|last2=Balasubramaniam|first2=R.|date=2001-04-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521496056|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Due to the [[Marangoni effect]], bubbles may remain intact when they reach the surface of the immersive substance.

==Common examples==
Bubbles are seen in many places in everyday life, for example:
* As spontaneous [[nucleation]] of supersaturated [[carbon dioxide]] in [[soft drink]]s
* As [[water vapor]] in boiling water
* As [[air]] mixed into agitated water, such as below a waterfall
* As [[sea foam]]
* As a [[soap bubble]]
* As given off in chemical reactions, e.g., baking soda + vinegar
* As a gas trapped in [[glass]] during its manufacture
* An air bubble in a solution of [[fluorescein]] and water (or alcohol) is the essential part of a [[spirit level]]

==Physics and chemistry==
Bubbles form, and coalesce, into globular shapes, because those shapes are at a lower energy state. For the physics and chemistry behind it, see [[nucleation]].

===Appearance===
Bubbles are visible because they have a different [[refractive index]] (RI) than the surrounding substance. For example, the RI of air is approximately 1.0003 and the RI of water is approximately 1.333. [[Snell's Law]] describes how electromagnetic waves change direction at the interface between two mediums with different IR; thus bubbles can be identified from the accompanying [[refraction]] and [[internal reflection]] even though both the immersed and immersing mediums are transparent.

The above explanation only holds for bubbles of one medium submerged in another medium (e.g. bubbles of gas in a soft drink); the volume of a [[membrane bubble]] (e.g. soap bubble) will not distort light very much, and one can only see a membrane bubble due to [[thin-film diffraction]] and [[Specular reflection|reflection]].

===Applications===
Nucleation can be intentionally induced, for example to create a [[bubblegram]] in a solid.

In medical [[ultrasound]] imaging, small encapsulated bubbles called [[Contrast-enhanced ultrasound|contrast agent]] are used to enhance the contrast.

In thermal [[Inkjet printer|inkjet]] printing, vapor bubbles are used as actuators. They are occasionally used in other [[microfluidics]] applications as actuators.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Dijkink, J. P. van der Dennen, C. D. Ohl, [[Andrea Prosperetti|A. Prosperetti]],''The ‘acoustic scallop’: a bubble-powered actuator'', J. Micromech. Microeng. '''16''' 1653 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The violent collapse of bubbles ([[cavitation]]) near solid surfaces and the resulting impinging jet constitute the mechanism used in [[Ultrasound#Ultrasonic_cleaning|ultrasonic cleaning]]. The same effect, but on a larger scale, is used in focused energy weapons such as the [[bazooka]] and the [[torpedo]]. [[Pistol shrimp]] also use a collapsing cavitation bubble as a weapon. The same effect is used to treat [[kidney stones]] in a [[lithotripter]]. Marine mammals such as [[dolphins]] and [[whales]] use bubbles for entertainment or as hunting tools. [[Aeration|Aerators]] cause dissolution of gas in the liquid by injecting bubbles.

[[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] and [[metallurgy|metallurgic]] [[engineer]]s rely on bubbles for operations such as distillation, absorption, flotation and spray drying. The complex processes involved often require consideration for mass and heat transfer, and are modelled using [[fluid dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|title=Bubbles, Drops and Particles|year=1978|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-486-44580-1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[star-nosed mole]] and the [[American water shrew]] can smell underwater by rapidly breathing through their nostrils and creating a bubble. &lt;ref&gt; {{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10834-starnosed-mole-can-sniff-underwater-videos-reveal.html#.Uqyu-_RDuSo|title=Star-nosed mole can sniff underwater, videos reveal|author=Roxanne Khamsi}} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulsation ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Drop (liquid)]] --&gt;
When bubbles are disturbed, they pulsate (that is, they [[oscillate]] in size) at their [[natural frequency]].  Large bubbles (negligible [[surface tension]] and [[thermal conductivity]]) undergo [[adiabatic]] pulsations, which means that no heat is transferred either from the liquid to the gas or vice versa. The natural frequency of such bubbles is determined by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;Minnaert, Marcel, On musical air-bubbles and the sounds of running water, Phil. Mag. 16, 235-248 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;Leighton, Timothy G., The Acoustic Bubble (Academic, London, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_0 = {1 \over 2 \pi R_0}\sqrt{3 \gamma p_0 \over \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heat capacity ratio|specific heat ratio]] of the gas
* &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[steady state]] radius
* &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is the steady state [[pressure]]
* &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] [[density]] of the surrounding liquid

Smaller bubbles undergo [[isothermal]] pulsations.  The corresponding equation for small bubbles of surface tension σ (and negligible liquid [[viscosity]]) is&lt;ref name="Leighton"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_0 = {1 \over 2 \pi R_0}\sqrt{{3 p_0 \over \rho}+{4 \sigma \over \rho R_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Excited bubbles trapped underwater are the major source of liquid [[sound]]s, such as inside our knuckles during knuckle cracking, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran Suja|first=V.|last2=Barakat|first2=A.

==Physiology and medicine==
Injury by bubble formation and growth in body tissues is the mechanism of [[decompression sickness]], which occurs when supersaturated dissolved inert gases leave solution as bubbles during [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]]. The damage can be due to mechanical deformation of tissues due to bubble growth in situ, or by blocking blood vessels where the bubble has lodged.

[[Arterial gas embolism]] can occur when a gas bubble is introduced to the circulatory system and it lodges in a blood vessel which is too small for it to pass through under the available pressure difference. This can occur as a result of [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]] after hyperbaric exposure, a [[Barotrauma|lung overexpansion injury]], during [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid administration]], or during [[surgery]].

A '''carbon pricing scheme in Australia''', commonly dubbed by its critics as a "[[carbon tax]]", was introduced by the [[Gillard Government|Gillard Labor Government]] in 2011 as the ''[[Clean Energy Act 2011]]'' which came into effect on 1 July 2012. As a result of being in place for such a short time, and because the then Opposition leader [[Tony Abbott]] indicated he intended to repeal "the carbon tax", regulated organisations responded in a rather tepid and informal manner, with very few investments in emissions reductions being made.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development? How Policy Uncertainty Affects Organizational Responses to Flexible Environmental Regulations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12188/full|journal=British Journal of Management|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12188|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was repealed on 17 July 2014, backdated to 1 July 2014. In its place the [[Abbott Government]] set up the Emission Reduction Fund in December 2014.

The [[carbon price]] was part of a broad energy reform package called the Clean Energy Futures Plan, which aimed to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions in Australia by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2000 levels by 2050. The plan set out to achieve these targets by encouraging Australia's largest emitters to increase energy efficiency and invest in [[sustainable energy]]. The scheme was administered by the [[Clean Energy Regulator]]. Compensation to industry and households was funded by the revenue derived from the charge. The scheme required entities which emit over 25,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] [[greenhouse gases]] per year, and which were not in the transport or agriculture sectors, to obtain emissions permits, called carbon units. Carbon units were either purchased from the government or issued free as part of industry assistance measures. As part of the scheme, personal [[income tax]] was reduced for those earning less than $80,000 per year and the tax-free threshold was increased from $6,000 to $18,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia | house=House of Representatives | date=12 October 2011 | page=11607 |speaker=[[Julia Gillard]] |position= Prime Minister }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the price of a permit for one tonne of carbon was fixed at $23 for the 2012–13 financial year, with unlimited permits being available from the government. The fixed price rose to $24.15 for 2013–14. The government had announced that the scheme was part of a transition to an [[emissions trading scheme]] in 2014–15, where the available permits will be limited in line with a pollution cap. The scheme primarily applied to electricity generators and industrial sectors. It did not apply to road transport and agriculture. The [[Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency]] stated that in June 2013 only 260 entities were subject to the scheme,&lt;ref name=etspolicy&gt;{{cite web|last=Department of Climate Change|title=Starting Emissions  Trading on 1 July 2014 Policy Summary|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/sites/climatechange/files/files/reducing-carbon/carbon-pricing-policy/cef-policy-summary-moving-ets.PDF|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which approximately 185 were liable to pay for carbon units. Domestic aviation did not face the carbon price scheme per se, but was subject to an additional fuel excise levy of approximately 6 cents per litre.

In February 2012, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that Clean Energy Future carbon price scheme had not deterred new investment in the coal industry, as spending on exploration had increased by 62% in 2010-2011, more than any other mineral commodity. The government agency Geoscience Australia reported that investment in coal prospecting reached $520 million in 2010-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2006 the [[Stern Review]] on the effect of climate change on the world's economy was released for the British government. This report recommended a range of measures including [[ecotax]]es to address the [[market failure]] represented by climate change with the least amount of economic and social disruption. In response to this report and subsequent pressure from the [[Kim Beazley]] led Labor opposition, in December 2006 the [[Howard Government]] established the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading, chaired by Peter Shergold, to advise on the implementation of an [[Emissions trading|emissions trading scheme]] (ETS) in Australia.&lt;ref name=AE10&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rudd government Australian Commonwealth administration 2007 – 2010|year=2010|publisher=ANU E Press|location=Acton, A.C.T.|isbn=9781921862076|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/The+Rudd+Government%3A+Australian+Commonwealth+Administration+%092007+-+2010/5091/upfront.xhtml|editor=Chris Aulich and Mark Evans|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prime Ministers Task Group on Emissions Trading - Final Report |url=https://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/72614/20070601-0000/www.pmc.gov.au/publications/emissions/index.html |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, Kevin Rudd called for a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60% before 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/rule-of-reckless-vows/story-e6frg6zo-1111118413753?from=public_rss|title=Rule of reckless vows|author=Peter Van Onselen|journal=[[The Australian]]|date=27 December 2008|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the incumbent [[Howard Government]] and the [[Kevin Rudd|Rudd]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] opposition promised to implement an [[emissions trading scheme]] (ETS) before the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. Following the release of the final Shergold report, the Howard government committed to introduce an ETS in June 2007.&lt;ref name=smh070603&gt;{{cite news|title=PM puts off emissions target|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/pm-puts-off-emissions-target/2007/06/03/1180809318103.html|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=3 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Age070603&gt;{{cite news|title=Emissions reduction target next year: PM|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Emissions-reduction-target-next-year-PM/2007/06/03/1180809318123.html|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=3 June 2007|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Going into the 2007 federal election, the Labor opposition party presented itself as a "pro-climate" alternative to the Government, with [[Kevin Rudd]], who had by then deposed Beazley as leader, famously describing climate change as "the great moral challenge of our generation". Labor differentiated itself from the government by promising an ETS with an earlier start date of 2010 rather than the 2012 timeframe advocated by Howard. It also promised ratification of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], investment in clean coal and renewable energy, and slightly more aggressive targets for renewable energy.&lt;ref name=AE10 /&gt;

Labor won the election on 24 November 2007, and on 3 December 2007 the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] signed the ratification of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] at the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]. By ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, Australia committed to keeping emissions to no more than 108% of its 1990 emissions level by 2012. Australia's ratification came into effect on 11 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/kyoto.aspx Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Kyoto Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Rudd Government|Rudd government]] began negotiating the passage of an ETS through the Parliament. The Opposition led by [[Brendan Nelson]] called for the vote on the government's ETS be delayed until after the United Nations [[Copenhagen Climate Conference|climate change summit in Copenhagen]] in December 2009. Prime Minister Rudd said in response that it would be  "an act of absolute political cowardice, an absolute failure of leadership not to act on climate change until other nations had done so" and the government pursued the early introduction of the Scheme.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2885204.htm |title=The 7.30 Report |publisher=ABC |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2008, the Rudd Government released a [[green paper]] for its [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] (CPRS) (also known as Australia's ETS), outlining the intended design of the scheme. The CPRS was criticised by those who were both for and against action to mitigate climate change. Environmental lobby groups protested that the emissions reductions targets were too low, and that the level of assistance to polluters was too high. Industry and business lobby groups however argued for more permits and assistance to offset the economic impacts of the scheme on many enterprises, particularly given the context of the [[global financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=AE10 /&gt; [[Malcolm Turnbull]] became the new Liberal Opposition Leader on 18 September 2008. On 30 September 2008, the [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]], commissioned in April 2007 by Rudd when he was leader of the Opposition, released its final report. Garnaut recommended a price between $20 and $30 per tonne of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) equivalent with a rise of 4% each year.&lt;ref name="kpup6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://garnautreview.org.au/update-2011/update-papers/up6-key-points.html |title=Key points: Update Paper 6: Carbon pricing and reducing Australia's emissions |author= |date=17 March 2011 |work=Garnaut Climate Change Review |accessdate=15 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed [[white paper]] on the CPRS was released on 15 December 2008.

Unable to secure the support of the [[Australian Greens]] for their preferred model, the government entered negotiations with Turnbull, and in the lead up to the Copenhagen Conference, presented an amended CPRS scheme, with the support of Turnbull. The Turnbull-led Opposition supported the CPRS scheme in principle, although at times over 2009 they indicated disagreement with various details including the timing of implementation of the scheme, timing of the vote on the relevant legislation and on the level of assistance to be provided to polluting industries. The Opposition was able to negotiate greater compensation for polluters affected by the scheme in November 2009.&lt;ref name=AE10 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/coalition-to-amend-ets-to-aid-business-20090915-fp21.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Coalition to amend ETS 'to aid business' | date=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the Senate was due to vote on the carbon bills, on 1 December 2009 [[Tony Abbott]] replaced Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Sha09&gt;{{cite news|last=Shanahan|first=Dennis|title=Tony Abbott to demand Liberal leadership spill|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/malcolm-turnbull-denies-being-asked-to-step-down-by-julie-bishop/story-e6frgczf-1225804570331|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The Australian|date=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot immediately called a secret ballot on support for the ETS among coalition MPs, which was overwhelmingly rejected.&lt;ref name=Coo09&gt;{{cite news|last=Coorey|first=Phillip|title=Shock result as Abbott wins Liberal leadership by one vote ...

Abbott described Labor's ETS plan as a 'Great big tax on everything'. The Copenhagen Conference was unsuccessful in advancing international agreement.

Abbott announced a new Coalition policy on carbon emission reduction in February 2010, which committed the Coalition to a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020. Abbott proposed the creation of an 'emissions reduction fund' to provide 'direct' incentives to industry and farmers to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mclennan |first=David |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/abbott-announces-emissions-plan/1740219.aspx |title=Abbott announces emissions plan – Local News – News – General |publisher=The Canberra Times |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206014003/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/abbott-announces-emissions-plan/1740219.aspx |archivedate=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, Rudd deferred attempts to advance the scheme to at least 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillham |first=Alexis |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/kevin-rudd-delays-plans-for-emissions-trading-scheme-until-2013/story-e6frf7jo-1225859004903 |title=Kevin Rudd delays plans for emissions trading scheme until 2013 |publisher=Herald Sun |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; opting not to present the legislation to the Senate a second time, creating a trigger for a [[double dissolution]] election. In June 2010, [[Julia Gillard]] replaced Rudd as leader of the Labor Party and became Prime Minister. Factional leader and key Gillard supporter [[Bill Shorten]]  said that the sudden announcement of change of policy on the ETS was a factor that had contributed to a collapse in support for Rudd's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2933046.htm |title=The Gillard Coup &amp;#124; Q&amp;A &amp;#124; ABC TV |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards Gillard called a [[Australian federal election, 2010|federal election]] for 21 August 2010. During the election campaign Gillard stated that she supported a price on carbon emissions and that she would prosecute the case for action for as long as she needed to win community support.&lt;ref name="jgcpp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillards-carbon-price-promise/story-fn59niix-1225907522983 |title=Julia Gillard's carbon price promise |author=Paul Kelly &amp; Dennis Shanahan |accessdate=25 February 2013 |date=20 August 2010 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also indicated that she would not introduce carbon pricing until there was a sufficient consensus on the issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/gillard-cautious-on-climate-change-20100624-z2sr.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=24 June 2010 |title=Gillard cautious on climate change}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she specifically ruled out the introduction of a "carbon tax".&lt;ref name="jgcpp"/&gt;

The result of the election left Australia with its first [[hung parliament]] in 70 years. To form a majority in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] both of the major parties needed to acquire the support of [[cross-bencher]]s, including the [[Australian Greens|Greens]]. After two weeks of negotiations Gillard had enough support to gain a majority including the support of the Greens and their single MP in the House, [[Adam Bandt]]. Gillard, therefore, remained Prime Minister and Abbott remained in Opposition. One of the conditions for Greens support was that the formation of a cross-party parliamentary committee to determine policy on climate change. Gillard honoured that agreement and on 27 September 2010 the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee (MPCCC) was formed, its terms of reference including that it was to report to Cabinet on ways to introduce a carbon price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-01/greens-labor-seal-deal/966044 |date=1 September 2010 |title=Greens, Labor seal deal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmeccc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/en/minister/greg-combet/2010/media-releases/September/mr20100927.aspx |title=Prime Minister establishes Climate Change Committee |author=Greg Combet &amp; Jula Gillard |date=27 September 2010 |work=Joint media release |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=14 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPCCC agreed on the introduction of a fixed carbon price commencing 1 July 2012, transitioning to a flexible-price cap-and-trade ETS on 1 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/en/government/initiatives/mpccc/resources/~/media/government/initiatives/mpccc/MPCCC_Clean-energy_agreement-20110710-PDF.pdf |title=Multi-party climate change committee clean energy agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the price of permits is fixed and the quantity unlimited i.e. there is no cap; the scheme thus functions similarly, and is popularly referred to as a tax.

In February 2011, the government proposed the [[Clean Energy Bill 2011|Clean Energy Bill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/24/3147523.htm |last=Leslie |first=Tim |newspaper=ABC News |date= 24 February 2011 |title=Gillard unveils Carbon Price Details}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/pm-gambles-on-carbon-tax-slug/story-e6frf7l6-1226011659564 |title=Tony Abbott calls for election on carbon tax | newspaper=Herald Sun |last=Hudson |first=Phillip |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Party vowed to overturn the bill if it was elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/opposition-vows-to-repeal-carbon-tax-20111002-1l3dl.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2 October 2011 |title=Opposition vows to repeal carbon tax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gillard Government]] had asked the [[Productivity Commission]] to report on the steps taken by eight major economies to address climate change. In June 2011, the report found that more than 1,000 climate policies were already enacted across the globe.&lt;ref name="pcbcp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/productivity-commission-backs-carbon-pricing-20110609-1fu2j.html |title=Productivity Commission backs carbon pricing |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=9 June 2011 |work=BusinessDay |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcbg"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-06-09/productivity-commission-backs-gillard-on-climate/2752638 |title=Productivity Commission backs Gillard on climate |author=Jeremy Thompson |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=9 June 2011 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also supported a market-based carbon price as being the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions.&lt;ref name="pcbg"/&gt; The report's findings were one of the major reasons that support for the carbon tax was provided by independent [[Tony Windsor]].&lt;ref name="pcbg" /&gt; Windsor made it clear that he would not support the clean energy legislation if it included a carbon tax on transport fuels.&lt;ref name="wshs"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/windsor-says-hell-stop-carbon-plans-if-greens-go-too-far-20110227-1ba0w.html |title=Windsor says he'll stop carbon plans if Greens go too far |author=Phillip Coorey |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=28 February 2011 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not want to penalise people who lived in rural areas, where there was no public transport as an alternative to private vehicles.

The Clean Energy Plan was released on 10 July 2011.&lt;ref name="capr"/&gt; The [[Clean Energy Bill 2011]] passed the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in October 2011 and the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in November 2011 and was thus brought into law.&lt;ref name="ctggl"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/carbon-tax-gets-green-light-in-senate-20111108-1n4rp.html |title=Carbon tax gets green light in Senate |accessdate=14 June 2012 |date=8 November 2011 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/carbon-tax-bills-pass-lower-house-of-federal-parliament/story-fn7x8me2-1226164570957|title=Carbon tax bills pass lower house of federal Parliament |first=Matt |last=Johnston |publisher=Herald Sun |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2012 the Australian Federal government introduced a carbon price scheme. To offset the impact of the tax on some sectors of society, the government reduced income tax (by increasing the tax-free threshold) and increased pensions and welfare payments slightly to cover expected price increases, as well as introducing compensation for some affected industries. On 17 July 2014, a report by the [[Australian National University]] estimated that the Australian scheme had cut carbon emissions by as much as 17 million tonnes, the biggest annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 24 years of records in 2013 as the carbon tax helped drive a large drop in pollution from the electricity sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peter|first1=Hannam|title=Carbon price helped curb emissions, ANU study finds|url=https://www.theguardian.com.au/story/2423463/carbon-price-helped-curb-emissions-anu-study-finds/?cs=8|website=The Guardian|accessdate=17 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726141918/http://www.theguardian.com.au/story/2423463/carbon-price-helped-curb-emissions-anu-study-finds/?cs=8#|archive-date=26 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2014, the [[Abbott Government]] passed repeal legislation through the Senate to abolish the carbon pricing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Lisa|title=Carbon tax is gone: Repeal bills pass the Senate|url=https://www.theguardian.com.au/story/2423819/carbon-tax-is-gone-repeal-bills-pass-the-senate/?cs=8|website=The Guardian|accessdate=17 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726140128/http://www.theguardian.com.au/story/2423819/carbon-tax-is-gone-repeal-bills-pass-the-senate/?cs=8#|archive-date=26 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place the government set up the [[Emission Reduction Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction-fund Emissions Reduction Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; paid by taxpayers from consolidated revenue, which according to RepuTex, a markets consultancy, estimated the government’s main climate policy may only meet a third of the emissions reduction challenge if Australia is to cut 2000 levels by 5% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald, 05/05/2015, [http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fall-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-biggest-in-24-years-20140613-zs7be.html?login_token=e9BZ92STkeChshMYUgug069g0sV661R3WloGQxkTNliYxdfEJ91pcm04WU9yWs6sCKtRYV79U_tefG7Paop8OA1843162&amp;member_token=kUX3or4kwGt0qwyXVBx1IqoNWACq9CuueN61oXgfx-I5y35vBmua3qhoDeLsg0DNqRk2cYraV--SRD16vTaT4Q1843162&amp;expiry=1462433874 Fall in greenhouse gas emissions biggest in 24 years]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and covered emissions==
The carbon price came into effect on 1 July 2012 and applied to direct emissions from a facility (scope-1 emissions), and not to indirect emissions (scope-2 emissions). The scheme only applied to facilities which emit more than 25,000 tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e]] per year, and did not apply to [[agriculture in Australia|agriculture]] or to transport fuels. The carbon price was set at [[AUD]]$23 per tonne of emitted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e on selected fossil fuels consumed by major industrial emitters and government bodies such as councils.

Agricultural emissions were exempt due to difficulty in tracking emissions and the related complexity of administering such a scheme.&lt;ref name="fatct"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-15/carbon-tax-farmers/2795816 |title=Farming and the carbon tax: what's in store? |author=Sarah Collerton |accessdate=14 June 2012 |date=14 February 2012 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Households and business use of light vehicles did not incur a carbon price. However, changes to the fuel tax regime were proposed to effectively impose a carbon tax on business liquid and gaseous fuel emissions.

In effect, the scope of the scheme meant that only a small number of large electricity generators and larger industrial plants were subject to the carbon price scheme. The tax was payable by surrendering carbon units, which had been either purchased (at $20 per tonne in 2012–13) or acquired free under an industry assistance program. The pricing mechanism was expected to cover 60% of Australia's carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="atm"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Carbon-Pricing-Mechanism/About-the-Mechanism/Pages/default.aspx |title=About the mechanism |accessdate=14 June 2012 |date= 14 May 2012 |publisher=Clean Energy Regulator }}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of each company's annual obligation were to be paid by 15 June each year with the remaining 25% by the following 1 February.

The [[Climate Change Authority]], a statutory agency, was created to advise the government on the setting of carbon pollution caps, to conduct periodic reviews of the carbon pricing process, and to report on progress towards meeting national targets.&lt;ref name="cca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/en/government/clean-energy-future/authority.aspx |title=Climate Change Authority |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pollution caps were to form the basis for the cap-and-trade structure to commence in 2015.

==Industry assistance programs==
The Government ran several major ‘Industry Assistance’ programs to reduce the impact of carbon tax for the 185 affected companies.  These have the effect of significantly reducing the actual carbon tax raised.

===Jobs and Competitiveness Program===
The ‘Jobs and Competitiveness Program’ was for the non-electricity sector and was targeted at the ‘emissions-intensive trade-exposed’ activities – that is, companies which emitted a lot of CO2 and were exposed to imports or who trade internationally. There was a list of 48 trade-exposed activities, including business such as steel making, alumina refining, cement making and similar activities.

Depending on whether a company was ‘highly’ or ‘moderately’ emissions intensive, it received 94.5% or 66% of ‘average industry carbon costs’ supplied as free carbon units.

Overall in 2012–13 under the ‘Jobs and Competitiveness Program’, there were 104 million free carbon units issued to 123 applicants, valued at approximately $2.4 billion. The fifteen largest recipients of free carbon units in 2012–13, with related companies grouped together where identifiable, were:

To put this into context, the LEPID list indicated that the total amount of carbon units to be surrendered would be 283 million units for 2012–13.  37% of these were awarded for free under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program.

===Coal Fired Generation Assistance===
Under the ‘Coal Fired Generation Assistance’ for coal-based electricity generating companies the Government gave out 42 million of free carbon units each year, valued at almost $5 billion. These were only issued to the generators with the highest amount of [[CO2 emission]] intensity, above 1.0 tonne of CO2 per MWh of energy. These were primarily the [[brown coal]]-fired generators in Victoria's Latrobe Valley

The free units were shared according to their size and the amount of CO2 produced compared to a more efficient black coal-fired power station. The list of companies which received the free units was published by the Clean Energy Regulator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Carbon-Pricing-Mechanism/Industry-Assistance/coal-fired-generators/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Nine power stations qualified – the big four brown coal plants in Victoria, and five other much smaller plants. The four big brown coal plants in Victoria received the majority share of free carbon units, around 37 million of the 42 million free carbon units in September each year.

With an average emissions intensity of 1.3, that effectively meant there was no carbon tax on the first 20 TWh (or approximately 50%) they collectively produced each year.

===Steel Transformation Plan package===
The Steel Transformation Plan was a $500 million package for Australia's two steelmakers. In 2012, payments of $160 million were made, $200 M to BlueScope and $70 M to OneSteel.

==Effect of the carbon tax==

===Reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases===
Because the Australian carbon tax does not apply to all fossil fuels usage, it only had an effect on some of the emitters of greenhouse gases. Among those emitters to which it applied, emissions were significantly lower after introduction of the tax. According to the Investor Group on Climate Change, emissions from companies subject to the tax went down 7% with the introduction of the tax, and the tax was "the major contributor" to this reduction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/07/carbon-taxed-companies-cut-emissions-by-7-in-past-year-investor-group-says&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing growth in greenhouse emissions===
Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased by 0.3% in the first six months of the Carbon Tax to December 2012 to 276.5 Mt CO2 equiv,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatechange.gov.au/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-measurement-and-reporting/tracking-australias-greenhouse-gas-emissio-0/quarterly-update-australias-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-december-2012&lt;/ref&gt; while Australia's [[gross domestic product]] grew at a rate of 2.5% per annum.

Greenhouse emissions from stationary energy (excluding electricity) and transport grew by 4% in the first six months of the carbon tax to December 2012.

However, there is a five-year trend for emissions from the electricity generation sector in Australia to decline.  Electricity emissions peaked at 38% of the national total in September quarter 2008, coinciding with the start of the Global Financial Crisis.  In December 2012, electricity emissions were just 33% of national emissions.  The decline is due partly to an almost 6% reduction in electricity demand in the National Electricity market since 2008.  This fall in electricity demand followed:·        
* Retail electricity prices rising by approximately 80% over the past five years; ·        
* Reduced economic activity and closure of the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter in mid-2012; and·        
* A burst in residential solar PV generation following generous State Government incentives, now all curtailed.
Other factors contributing to the five-year fall in greenhouse emissions from the electricity sector are:·        
* An increase in wind generation supported by the Renewable Energy Target subsidies; and·        
* Fuel switching from coal to gas.
The Australian Government said in July 2013 that the carbon tax was a factor in reducing the emissions intensity in the National Electricity Market from 0.92 t of CO2 per MWh to 0.87 in the 11 months following its introduction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/one-year-on.pdf{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the carbon tax was introduced, wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity market have increased significantly.  The Energy Users Association of Australia in its June 2013 paper said that electricity generators have been able to pass through more than 100% of the cost of the carbon tax''. “If the outcomes observed in the spot market persist then it can be unequivocally concluded that both fossil fuel generators and renewable generators will have gained as a result of emission pricing, at users’ expense. Surely this is not what was intended."''&lt;ref name=euaa /&gt;

===Alternative explanations of emissions reductions===

'''Frontier Economics''' said the reduction in emissions from the electricity sector in the first year of the carbon tax was ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'largely explained by factors unrelated to the carbon tax'.&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' &lt;ref name=frontier1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=frontier2 /&gt;

The '''Energy Users Association of Australia''' (EUAA) said in June 2013 "''we suggest that it cannot be said that pricing emissions has reduced emissions in stationary energy to any meaningful extent''" &lt;ref name="euaa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact of Emission Prices on Electricity Prices in the NEM|url=http://www.euaa.com.au/2013/06/euaa-report-impact-of-emission-prices-on-electricity-prices-in-the-nem/|publisher=Energy Users Association of Australia (EUAA)|accessdate=24 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223124302/http://www.euaa.com.au/2013/06/euaa-report-impact-of-emission-prices-on-electricity-prices-in-the-nem/#|archive-date=23 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significant announcements which have, or may have, relevance to the carbon tax===
'''AGL '''– In relation to its purchase of the Loy Yang brown coal fired power station in 2012, one of the single largest emitters of CO2 in Australia states  “''On the supply side of the business, the most  significant strategic development was the decision to buy the Loy Yang A power station.&amp;nbsp;... The Board also recognised that coal fired generation would be required for decades to come if the demand from Australian households and businesses for electricity was to continue to be satisfied” ''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agl.com.au/~/media/AGL/About%20AGL/Documents/Media%20Center/ASX%20and%20Media%20Releases/2012/September/ASX%20-%20Annual%20Report%202012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investments as a result of carbon tax===
David Kassulke, the manager of AJ Bush &amp; Sons, expressed grave concerns over the carbon tax during the lead up to its implementation. However, he now says the carbon tax has had a positive impact on the business. The company expects to cut carbon emissions from 85,000 to 30,000 tonnes per year with the construction of a new biogas plant in 2013.

"The end result of the introduction of the new biogas technology will not only be a saving of millions of dollars in energy and carbon costs, but also an opportunity for the company to be positioned at the cutting edge of renewable energy technology in the rendering industry, Mr Kassulke said."

“The (biogas technology) investment is a good way to modernise and will dramatically reduce our emissions."

“It will mean that we will reduce our emissions to the point where we will no longer be a big polluter any more."

“What the imposition of the carbon tax has done is make industry take stock of what it is currently doing and has forced it to look at doing things in a better way."

“It means companies are now looking at ways to use less energy which equates to less cost and a subsequent reduction in the tax that is being levied.“That has been the intention of the tax and clearly from that perspective it is working and working well.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beaudeserttimes.com.au/beaudesert/215-carbon-tax-turnaround# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722204116/http://beaudeserttimes.com.au/beaudesert/215-carbon-tax-turnaround# |archive-date=22 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and industry response==
{{update|section|date=March 2014}}
The introduction of a carbon price in Australia was controversial. The day before the 2010 federal election, Prime Minister, Julia Gillard sent out a message regarding carbon pricing, stating "I don't rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a market-based mechanism." However the article also articulated her position on that term of government. "While any carbon price would not be triggered until after the 2013 election... She would legislate the carbon price next term if sufficient consensus existed",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillards-carbon-price-promise/story-fn59niix-1225907522983 | work=The Australian | title=Julia Gillard's carbon price promise | date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal opposition accused the government of breaking an election promise to not introduce a carbon tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abbott moves to censure Gillard|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/abbott-moves-to-censure-gillard/story-e6frfku9-1226451890103|publisher=news.com.au|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Gillard responded to these accusations by saying that circumstances changed following the 2010 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yes, I vowed no carbon tax – Julia Gillard|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-old/yes-i-vowed-no-carbon-tax-julia-gillard/story-e6frfkvr-1226012683197|publisher=news.com.au|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Joe|title=Julia Gillard fends off accusations she has broken a promise on climate tax|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/julia-gillard-fends-off-accusations-she-has-broken-a-promise-on-a-climate-tax/story-e6frg6xf-1226011792834|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=The Australian|date=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then opposition leader Tony Abbott criticised the carbon pricing policy on economic grounds referring to it as "toxic" and likening it to an octopus embracing the whole of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Vittorio|title=Tony Abbott Describes Carbon Tax as an Octopus Embracing Australian Economy|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/388909/20120928/tony-abbott-describes-carbon-tax-octopus-embracing.htm#.UNoj_rQ-on8|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pledged to repeal the tax after the 18 clean energy bills passed through the House of Representatives and stated that the next election would be a referendum on the "carbon tax".&lt;ref name="tambp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/carbon-tax/green-light-for-carbon-tax-red-flag-for-industry/story-fn99tjf2-1226164561315 |title=Tony Abbott makes a 'blood pledge' to repeal carbon tax after it passes lower house |author=Ben Packham and Lanai Vasek |accessdate=15 June 2012 |date=12 October 2011 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=Phillip|title=MPs concerned that Tony Abbott's carbon tax tactics have ‘run out of puff'|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/mps-concerned-that-tony-abbotts-carbon-tax-tactics-have-run-out-of-puff/story-e6frf7jo-1226505623223|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition (and since the 2013 election the Abbott government) proposed an alternative "direct-action" carbon emissions reduction scheme.

Emissions figures from the 2010–11 financial year suggest the electricity generation sector may be due to pay around $3.9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="pff"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/power-firms-face-4bn-carbon-slug/story-e6frg6xf-1226284526281 |title=Power firms face $4bn carbon slug |author=Sid Maher |accessdate=17 June 2012 |date=29 February 2012 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loans have been made available so that electricity generators can purchase carbon permits.

Modelling undertaken by the [[Virgin Australia]] airline calculated that the average increase per flight would be $3. They responded by implementing a surcharge of between $1.00 and $5.00 to a one-way flight starting in July 2012.&lt;ref name="vlf"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/virgin-lifts-fares-to-cover-carbon-tax-20120228-1u0jc.html |title=Virgin lifts fares to cover carbon tax |author=Matt O'Sullivan |accessdate=17 June 2012 |date=28 February 2012 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qantas]] is raising its ticket prices by between $1.50 and $5.50.

In a survey conducted by the Economic Society of Australia, 60% of economists thought the carbon pricing proposal was sound economic policy, while 25% disagreed.&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/economists-slam-abbotts-carbon-plans-20110713-1hd3d.html |title=Economists slam Abbott's carbon plans |author= |accessdate=15 June 2012 |date=13 July 2011|work=theage.com.au |publisher=Fairfax Media |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of public protests both in support of and against the carbon price (or tax) have been held in the run up to its introduction. These include the [[No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics]] rallies and [[Say Yes demonstrations]].

===Compensation===
Because carbon pricing would indirectly flow through to consumers, the Australian government implemented household assistance measures.

The measures included changes to [[Income tax in Australia|income tax]]: the tax-free threshold increased from $6,000 to $18,200 on 1 July 2012, and was scheduled to rise to $19,400 from 1 July 2015.&lt;ref name="itof"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/its-official-australia-has-a-carbon-tax/story-e6freuy9-1226188707768 |title=It's official, Australia has a carbon tax |author=Alison Rehn |accessdate=14 June 2012 |date=8 November 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes meant those earning less than $20,000 received a tax cut with those earning up to $5,000 receiving the greatest tax reduction.&lt;ref name="ctmb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cef-wwga"&gt;{{cite web

Other steps included direct payments into bank accounts beginning in May 2012.&lt;ref name="cta"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-14/coalition-takes-aim-at-household-assistance-ads/4010884 |title=Coalition takes aim at household assistance ads |accessdate=14 June 2012 |date=15 May 2012 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The payments, called the Clean Energy Advance, were targeted at low- and middle-income households.&lt;ref name="cea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/clean-energy-advance |title=Clean Energy Advance |publisher=Department of Human Services |accessdate=14 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074327/http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/Centrelink/clean-energy-advance# |archive-date=11 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some industries received direct compensation. As part of the Energy Security Fund, $1&amp;nbsp;billion was promised to highly emissions-intensive coal-fired generators.&lt;ref name="esf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/energy-security-fund-cash-payments.aspx |title=Energy Security Fund |publisher=Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency |accessdate=15 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of that funding was intended for coal-fired power generators in Victoria.&lt;ref name="vps"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/victorian-power-stations-carbon-tax-045629903.html |title=Victorian power stations get carbon tax compensation |accessdate=15 June 2012 |date=30 March 2012 |work=[[Yahoo!

===Emissions reduction===
Six months after the introduction of carbon pricing the Department of Climate Change and Renewable Energy reported a 9% decrease in emissions from electricity generators.&lt;ref name="9pc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-11/carbon-tax-emissions-drop/4512782 |title=9pc drop in emissions from power generators |accessdate=11 February 2013 |date=11 February 2013 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine months after the introduction of the pricing scheme, Australia's emissions of carbon dioxide due to electricity generation fell to a 10-year low, with coal generation down 6% from 2008 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2013/4/12/renewable-energy/australian-co2-emissions-hit-10-year-low |title=Australian CO2 emissions hit 10-year low |author=AAP | accessdate= 17 April 2013| date=12 April 2012 |publisher=Business Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal==
Heading into the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 Australian federal election]], the Liberal Party platform included the removal of the 'Carbon Tax', claiming that the election was in effect a referendum on carbon pricing in Australia. The incoming Liberal Government placed removing the carbon pricing scheme at the head of its legislative program.

The carbon tax repeal legislation received Royal Assent on 17 July 2014 and the bills which were part of the package became law, with effect from 1 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/repealing-carbon-tax Repealing the Carbon Tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crown molding''' encapsulates a large family of [[Molding (decorative)|molding]]s which are designed to gracefully flare out to a finished top edge. Crown molding is generally used for capping walls, [[pilaster]]s, and [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]], and is used extensively in the creation of interior and exterior [[cornice]] assemblies and door and window hoods. .

In recent times, crown moldings have generally made their appearance as mostly decorated [[plaster]] or [[wood]]en trim where walls meet [[ceiling]]s.

== Installation ==
Crown molding is typically applied along the seams where ceiling meets wall.  Usually it is not placed flush against the wall nor against the ceiling.  Instead, when viewed from the molding's end (or as a cross-section), it, the ceiling, and the wall form a "hollow" triangle.  This adds a difficulty to the installation process, namely the need for complex cuts to form corners where two walls meet.  

There are two common ways to fashion inside corners.  One is to use a [[miter saw|compound miter saw]] to cut the ends of the corner pieces along two axes simultaneously.  The other, called [[Coping (joinery)|coping]], is a two step process, first to cut a simple miter and then to use a [[coping saw]] to undercut the miters.

Many different companies now manufacture crown molding in materials such as plastic and foam. These typically are offered with corner blocks, and are popular with [[Do it yourself|DIY]] [[home improvement]] enthusiasts.

The use of a coped joint for interior corners saves the trouble of having to determine and cut the exact inside degree measurement, since most corners are not exactly 90/45 degrees. Outside corners must be mitered, and care must be taken in measuring and cutting, since not all outside corners measure true. If the angle is not exactly 45/22.5 degrees, a corner measuring device or piece of scrap crown molding may be used to obtain the right measurement before the final cut is made.

== Angle calculations ==
 
Fitting crown molding requires a cut at the correct combination of miter angle and bevel angle.  The calculation of these angles is affected by two variables: (1) the spring angle (or crown angle, typically sold in 45 degree and 38 degree formats), and (2) the wall angle.

Pre-calculated crown molding tables or software can be used to facilitate the determination of the correct angles.  Given the spring angle and the wall angle, the formulas used to calculate the miter angle and the bevel angle are:

* Miter angle &lt;math&gt;= \arctan\left(\frac{\sin{(\text{spring angle})}}{\tan{(\text{wall angle/2})}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Bevel]] angle &lt;math&gt;= \arcsin\left(\cos{(\text{spring angle})} * \cos{(\text{wall angle/2})}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

An '''electrical grid''' is an interconnected network for delivering [[electricity]] from producers to consumers. It consists of

* Generating stations that produce electrical power
* [[high voltage transmission line]]s that carry [[power (physics)|power]] from distant sources to demand centers
* Distribution lines that connect individual [[customer]]s.&lt;ref name="Overview of Electrical Power System"&gt;Kaplan, S. M. (2009). Smart Grid. Electrical Power Transmission: Background and Policy Issues. The Capital.Net, Government Series. Pp. 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Power station]]s may be located near a [[fuel]] source, at a [[hydroelectric dam|dam]] site (to take advantage of [[renewable energy]] sources), and are often located away from heavily populated areas. The electric power which is generated is stepped up to a higher [[voltage]] at which it connects to the [[electric power transmission]] net.

The bulk power transmission network will move the power long distances, sometimes across international boundaries, until it reaches its wholesale customer (usually the company that owns the local [[electric power distribution]] network).

On arrival at a [[electrical substation|substation]], the power will be stepped down from a transmission level voltage to a distribution level voltage. As it exits the substation, it enters the distribution wiring. Finally, upon arrival at the service location, the power is stepped down again from the distribution voltage to the required service voltage(s).

Electrical grids vary in size from covering a single building through ''national grids'' which cover whole countries, to ''transnational grids'' which can cross continents.

Although electrical grids are wide spread, 1.4 billion people are not connected to an electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2016-04-01|title=Energy: The missing link in globalization|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296486356|journal="Energy Research &amp; Social Science"|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2016.01.009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205000937/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296486356|archivedate=2018-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical grids can be prone to malicious intrusion or attack; thus, there is a need for [[electric grid security]]. Also as electric grids modernize and introduce computers, cyber threats also start to become a security risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/constancedouris/2018/01/16/as-cyber-threats-to-the-electric-grid-rise-utilities-regulators-seek-solutions/#59aa786a343e|title=As Cyber Threats To The Electric Grid Rise, Utilities And Regulators Seek Solutions|last=Douris|first=Constance|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early electric energy was produced near the device or service requiring that energy. In the 1880s, electricity competed with steam, hydraulics, and especially [[coal gas]]. Coal gas was first produced on customer's premises but later evolved into [[gasification]] plants that enjoyed [[economies of scale]]. In the industrialized world, cities had networks of piped gas, used for lighting. But gas lamps produced poor light, wasted heat, made rooms hot and smoky, and gave off [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]]. In the 1880s electric lighting soon became advantageous compared to gas lighting.

[[Electric utility]] companies took advantage of economies of scale and moved to centralized power generation, distribution, and system management.&lt;ref name="Distributed Generation"&gt;Borberly, A. and Kreider, J. F. (2001). Distributed Generation: The Power Paradigm for the New Millennium. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. 400 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; With long distance power transmission it became possible to interconnect stations to balance load and improve load factors.

In the United Kingdom, [[Charles Merz]], of the [[Merz &amp; McLellan]] consulting partnership, built the [[Neptune Bank Power Station]] near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/enquiries/energy/evidence/ShawA1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Kelvin to Weir, and on to GB SYS 2005|date=29 September 2005|author=Mr Alan Shaw|publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304090015/http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/enquiries/energy/evidence/ShawA1.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nnouk.com/survey/survey-utilities.shtml |title=Survey of Belford 1995 |publisher=North Northumberland Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merz was appointed head of a Parliamentary Committee and his findings led to the Williamson Report of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity Supply Bill of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system. The Electricity (Supply) Act of 1926 led to the setting up of the National Grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-places_collections/w-collections-main/w-collections-highlights/w-collections-lighting-electricity.html |title=Lighting by electricity |publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091025/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-places_collections/w-collections-main/w-collections-highlights/w-collections-lighting-electricity.html |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Electricity Board]] standardized the nation's electricity supply and established the first synchronized AC grid, running at 132 kilovolts and 50 [[Hertz]]. This started operating as a national system, the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]], in 1938.

In the United States in the 1920s, utilities formed joint-operations to share peak load coverage and backup power. In 1934, with the passage of the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act]] (USA), electric utilities were recognized as [[public good]]s of importance and were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations. The [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] required transmission line owners to allow electric generation companies open access to their network&lt;ref name="Distributed Generation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Electric Power Planning"&gt;Mazer, A. (2007). Electric Power Planning for Regulated and Deregulated Markets. John, Wiley, and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ. 313pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to a restructuring of how the electric industry operated in an effort to create competition in power generation. No longer were electric utilities built as vertical monopolies, where generation, transmission and distribution were handled by a single company. Now, the three stages could be split among various companies, in an effort to provide fair accessibility to high voltage transmission.&lt;ref name="History of Electric Power Systems "/&gt;{{rp|21}} The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] allowed incentives and loan guarantees for alternative energy production and advance innovative technologies that avoided greenhouse emissions.

In France, [[electrification]] began in the 1900s, with 700 [[Communes of France|communes]] in 1919, and 36,528 in 1938. At the same time, the nearby networks began to interconnect: Paris in 1907 at 12 kV, the Pyrénées in 1923 at 150 kV, and finally almost all of the country interconnected in 1938 at 220 kV. By 1946, the grid is the world's most dense. That year that state nationalised the industry, by uniting the private companies as [[Électricité de France]]. The frequency was standardised at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, and the 225 kV network replaces 110 and 120. From 1956, service voltage is standardised at 220 / 380 V, replacing the previous 127/220 V. During the 1970s, the 400 kV network, the new European standard, was implemented.

===Voltage ===
Grids are designed to supply voltages at largely constant amplitudes. This has to be achieved with varying demand, variable [[reactive power|reactive]] loads, and even nonlinear loads, with electricity provided by generators and distribution and transmission equipment that are not perfectly reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789812871152-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1466523-p176786301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508085728/https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789812871152-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1466523-p176786301 |archivedate=2018-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often grids use [[tap changer]]s on transformers near to the consumers to adjust the voltage and keep it within specification.

===Topologies===
{{Contradicts other|date=May 2009|1=Electric power distribution}}

Transmission networks are complex with redundant pathways.  For example, see the map of the United States' (right) high-voltage transmission network.

[[File:A network diagram of the 'nesta case1354 pegase high voltage' electrical power system.png|upright=1.65|thumb|Network diagram of a high voltage transmission system, showing the interconnection between the different voltage levels. This diagram depicts the electrical structure &lt;ref name="CuffeKeane2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuffe|first1=Paul|last2=Keane|first2=Andrew|title=Visualizing the Electrical Structure of Power Systems|journal=IEEE Systems Journal|volume=11|issue=3|year=2017|pages=1810–1821|issn=1932-8184|doi=10.1109/JSYST.2015.2427994}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the network, rather than its physical geography.]]

The structure, or "[[Network topology|topology]]" of a grid can vary depending on the constraints of budget, requirements for system reliability, and the load and generation characteristics.  The physical layout is often forced by what land is available and its geology.  Distribution networks are divided into two types, radial or network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdelhay A. Sallam|author2=Om P. Malik|last-author-amp=yes|title=Electric Distribution Systems|year=May 2011|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press|isbn=9780470276822|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest topology for a distribution or transmission grid is a ''radial'' structure.  This is a ''tree'' shape where power from a large supply radiates out into progressively lower voltage lines until the destination homes and businesses are reached. However, single failures can take out entire branches of the tree.

Most transmission grids offer the reliability that more complex ''mesh networks'' provide. The expense of mesh topologies restrict their application to transmission and medium voltage distribution grids.  Redundancy allows line failures to occur and power is simply rerouted while workmen repair the damaged and deactivated line.

Other topologies used are ''looped'' systems found in Europe and ''tied ring'' networks.

{{Globalize|date=February 2010}}
In cities and towns of North America, the grid tends to follow the classic ''radially fed'' design. A substation receives its power from the transmission network, the power is stepped down with a transformer and sent to a [[busbar|bus]] from which feeders fan out in all directions across the countryside. These feeders carry [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase power]], and tend to follow the major streets near the substation. As the distance from the substation grows, the fanout continues as smaller laterals spread out to cover areas missed by the feeders. This tree-like structure grows outward from the substation, but for reliability reasons, usually contains at least one unused backup connection to a nearby substation. This connection can be enabled in case of an emergency, so that a portion of a substation's service territory can be alternatively fed by another substation.

===Synchronous grid===
A synchronous grid or an "interconnection" is a group of distribution areas all operating with [[three phase]] [[alternating current]] (AC) frequencies synchronized (so that peaks occur at virtually the same time).  This allows transmission of AC power throughout the area, connecting a large number of electricity generators and consumers and potentially enabling more efficient electricity markets and redundant generation.  Interconnection maps are shown of North America (right) and Europe (below left).

A large failure in one part of the grid - unless quickly compensated for - can cause current to re-route itself to flow from the remaining generators to consumers over transmission lines of insufficient capacity, causing further failures.  One downside to a widely connected grid is thus the possibility of [[cascading failure]] and widespread [[power outage]].  A central authority is usually designated to facilitate communication and develop protocols to maintain a stable grid.  For example, the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] gained binding powers in the United States in 2006, and has advisory powers in the applicable parts of Canada and Mexico.  The U.S. government has also designated [[National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor]]s, where it believes transmission bottlenecks have developed.

Some areas, for example rural communities in [[Alaska]], do not operate on a large grid, relying instead on local diesel generators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_profile_of_Alaska,_United_States Energy profile of Alaska, United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727203147/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_profile_of_Alaska,_United_States |date=2009-07-27 }}, Editor: Cutler J. Cleveland, Last Updated: July 30, 2008 - Encyclopedia of Earth&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency===
An entire synchronous grid runs at the same frequency. Where interconnection to a neighboring grid, operating at a different frequency, is required, a frequency converter is required. [[High voltage direct current]] links can connect two grids that operate at different frequencies or that are not maintaining synchronism.

In a synchronous grid all the generators must run at the same [[Utility frequency|frequency]], and must stay very nearly in phase with each other and the grid. For rotating generators, a local [[Governor (device)|governor]] regulates the driving torque, maintaining constant speed as loading changes. [[Droop speed control]] ensures that multiple parallel generators share load changes in proportion to their rating.   Generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid, because energy is consumed as it is produced.  Energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators.

Small deviations from the nominal system frequency are very important in regulating individual generators and assessing the equilibrium of the grid as a whole. When the grid is heavily loaded, the frequency slows, and governors adjust their generators so that more power is output ([[droop speed control]]). When the grid is lightly loaded the grid frequency runs above the nominal frequency, and this is taken as an indication by [[Automatic Generation Control]] systems across the network that generators should reduce their output.

In addition, there's often central control, which can change the parameters of the AGC systems over timescales of a minute or longer to further adjust the regional network flows and the operating frequency of the grid.  For timekeeping purposes, over the course of a day the nominal frequency will be allowed to vary so as to balance out momentary deviations and to prevent line-operated clocks from gaining or losing significant time.

[[High-voltage direct current]] lines or [[variable-frequency transformer]]s can be used to connect two alternating current interconnection networks which are not necessarily synchronized with each other.  This provides the benefit of interconnection without the need to synchronize an even wider area.  For example, compare the wide area synchronous grid map of Europe (above left) with the map of HVDC lines (below right).

===Interconnectors===
Electric utilities between regions are many times interconnected for improved economy and reliability. [[Electrical interconnector]]s allow for [[economies of scale]], allowing energy to be purchased from large, efficient sources.  Utilities can draw power from generator reserves from a different region to ensure continuing, reliable power and diversify their loads. Interconnection also allows regions to have access to cheap bulk energy by receiving power from different sources. For example, one region may be producing cheap hydro power during high water seasons, but in low water seasons, another area may be producing cheaper power through wind, allowing both regions to access cheaper energy sources from one another during different times of the year. Neighboring utilities also help others to maintain the overall system frequency and also help manage tie transfers between utility regions.&lt;ref name="History of Electric Power Systems "&gt;.

A ''wide area synchronous grid'' (also called an "''interconnection''" in [[North America]]) is an electrical grid at a regional scale or greater that operates at a synchronized frequency and is electrically tied together during normal system conditions.  These are also known as synchronous zones, the largest of which is the [[synchronous grid of Continental Europe]] (ENTSO-E) with 667&amp;nbsp;[[gigawatts]] (GW) of generation, and the widest region served being that of the [[IPS/UPS]] system serving countries of the former Soviet Union.  Synchronous grids with ample capacity facilitate [[electricity market]] trading across wide areas.  In the ENTSO-E in 2008, over 350,000&amp;nbsp;megawatt hours were sold per day on the [[European Energy Exchange]] (EEX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | url=http://www.eex.com/de/document/39600/20081027_EEX_Market_Monitor_Q3_2008_English.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the interconnects in North America are synchronized at a nominal 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, while those of Europe run at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.  Interconnections can be tied to each other via [[high-voltage direct current]] [[power transmission line]]s (DC ties), or with [[variable-frequency transformer]]s (VFTs), which permit a controlled flow of energy while also functionally isolating the independent AC frequencies of each side.

The benefits of synchronous zones include pooling of generation, resulting in lower generation costs; pooling of load, resulting in significant equalizing effects; common provisioning of reserves, resulting in cheaper primary and secondary reserve power costs; opening of the market, resulting in possibility of long term contracts and short term power exchanges; and mutual assistance in the event of disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

One disadvantage of a wide-area synchronous grid is that problems in one part can have repercussions across the whole grid. For example, in 2018 [[Kosovo]] used more power than it generated due to a row with [[Serbia]], leading to the phase in the whole [[Synchronous grid of Continental Europe]] lagging behind what it should have been. The frequency dropped to 49.996&amp;nbsp;Hz. This caused certain kinds of [[clock]]s to become six minutes slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Serbia, Kosovo power grid row delays European clocks |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/serbia-kosovo-energy/serbia-kosovo-power-grid-row-delays-european-clocks-idUSL5N1QP2FF |agency=Reuters |date=Mar 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microgrid===
{{main|Microgrid}}
A microgrid is a localized group of [[electricity]] sources and loads that normally operates connected to and synchronous with the traditional [[wide area synchronous grid]] (macrogrid), but  can also disconnect to "island mode" &amp;mdash; and function autonomously as physical and/or economic conditions dictate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://building-microgrid.lbl.gov/about-microgrids|title = About Microgrids|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, a microgrid can effectively integrate various sources of [[Distributed generation|distributed generation (DG)]], especially [[Renewable energy|Renewable Energy Sources]] (RES), and can supply emergency power, changing between island and connected modes.

Control and protection are challenges to microgrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7731870/|title=Design and implementation of CCNY DC microgrid testbed - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8249833/|title=Communication Based Control for DC Microgrids - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/23194712/A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Designing_and_Managing_Microgrids A Survey of Techniques for Designing and Managing Microgrids]",  IEEE PES GM 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Super grids===
Various planned and proposed systems to dramatically increase transmission capacity are known as [[super grid|super, or mega grids]].  The promised benefits include enabling the [[renewable energy industry]] to sell electricity to distant markets, the ability to increase usage of intermittent energy sources by balancing them across vast geological regions, and the removal of congestion that prevents electricity markets from flourishing.  Local opposition to siting new lines and the significant cost of these projects are major obstacles to super grids. One study for a European super grid estimates that as much as 750&amp;nbsp;GW of extra transmission capacity would be required- capacity that would be accommodated in increments of 5&amp;nbsp;GW HVDC lines. A recent proposal by Transcanada priced a 1,600-km, 3-GW HVDC line at $3 billion USD and would require a corridor wide. In India, a recent 6&amp;nbsp;GW, 1,850-km proposal was priced at $790 million and would require a wide right of way. With 750&amp;nbsp;GW of new HVDC transmission capacity required for a European super grid, the land and money needed for new transmission lines would be considerable.

==Trends==

===Demand response===
[[Demand response]] is a grid management technique where retail or wholesale customers are requested either electronically or manually to reduce their load.  Currently, transmission grid operators use demand response to request load reduction from major energy users such as industrial plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Aging infrastructure===
Despite the novel institutional arrangements and network designs of the electrical grid, its power delivery infrastructures suffer aging across the developed world. Contributing factors to the current state of the electric grid and its consequences include:
* Aging equipment – older equipment has higher [[failure rate]]s, leading to [[Power outage|customer interruption rates]] affecting the economy and society; also, older assets and facilities lead to higher inspection [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance]] costs and further [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|repair]] and [[Renovation|restoration]] costs.
* Obsolete system layout – older areas require serious additional [[Electrical substation|substation sites]] and [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]] that cannot be obtained in current area and are forced to use existing, insufficient facilities.
* Outdated engineering – traditional tools for [[power delivery]] planning and engineering are ineffective in addressing current problems of aged equipment, obsolete system layouts, and modern deregulated loading levels.
* Old cultural value – [[planning]], [[engineering]], operating of system using concepts and procedures that worked in vertically integrated industry exacerbate the problem under a deregulated industry.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, H. L., Welch, G. V., and Schrieber, R. R. (2001). Aging Power Delivery Infrastructures. Marcel Dekker, Inc. : New York. 551 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;
* One countermeasure against [[cascading failure]]s from exploding high-voltage transformers is [[high-voltage transformer fire barriers]].

===Modernization===
Thirty-seven states plus the District of Columbia took some action to modernize electric grids in the first quarter of 2017, according to the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center. The states did so to make electricity systems "more resilient and interactive". The most common actions that states took were "advanced metering infrastructure deployment" (19 states did this), [[smart grid]] deployment and "time-varying rates for residential customers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/5374-nearly-three-quarters-us-took-steps-toward-grid-modernization-first-quarter-study-finds/|title=Nearly three quarters of US took steps toward grid modernization in first quarter, study finds|last=|first=|date=2017-05-25|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508085733/https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/5374-nearly-three-quarters-us-took-steps-toward-grid-modernization-first-quarter-study-finds/|archivedate=2018-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislatively, in the first quarter of the year 82 relevant bills were introduced in different parts of the United States. At the close of the quarter, most of the bills remained pending. For example, legislators in Hawaii introduced a bill that would create an energy storage [[tax credit]]. In California, the [[California State Senate|state Senate]] had a bill that would "create a new energy storage rebate program".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In August 2018, Advanced Energy Economy (AEE) and [[Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions|Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions Forum]] (CRES Forum) published a [[White paper|policy paper]] that gave five recommendations on ways to modernize the U.S. electric power grid. These recommendations are to streamline the federal permit process for advanced energy projects; encourage grid planners to consider alternatives to investment in transmission; allow energy storage and energy efficiency to compete with additional energy generation; allow large customers to choose their own sources of electricity; and allow utilities and consumers to benefit from cloud computing software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://solarbuildermag.com/news/five-ways-to-modernize-the-u-s-electric-power-grid-via-advanced-energy-economy/|title=Five ways to modernize the U.S. electric power grid via Advanced Energy Economy {{!}} Solar Builder|date=2018-08-06|work=Solar Builder Magazine|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed generation===
With everything interconnected, and open competition occurring in a [[free market economy]], it starts to make sense to allow and even encourage [[distributed generation]] (DG). Smaller generators, usually not owned by the utility, can be brought on-line to help supply the need for power. The smaller generation facility might be a home-owner with excess power from their solar panel or wind turbine. It might be a small office with a diesel generator. These resources can be brought on-line either at the utility's behest, or by owner of the generation in an effort to sell electricity. Many small generators are allowed to sell electricity back to the grid for the same price they would pay to buy it.

As the 21st century progresses, the electric utility industry seeks to take advantage of novel approaches to meet growing energy demand.  Utilities are under pressure to evolve their classic topologies to accommodate [[distributed generation]].  As generation becomes more common from rooftop solar and wind generators, the differences between distribution and transmission grids will continue to blur. In July 2017 the CEO of [[Mercedes-Benz]] said that the energy industry needs to work better with companies from other industries to form a "total ecosystem", to integrate central and [[Distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER) to give customers what they want. The electrical grid was originally constructed so that electricity would flow from power providers to consumers. However, with the introduction of DER, power needs to flow both ways on the electric grid, because customers may have power sources such as solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/efficiency/6694-order-integrate-grid-disparate-industries-need-work-together/|title=In order to integrate the grid, disparate industries need to work together|last=Randolph|first=Kevin|date=2017-07-21|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart grid===
The [[smart grid]] would be an enhancement of the 20th century electrical grid, using two-way communications and distributed so-called intelligent devices. Two-way flows of electricity and information could improve the delivery network. Research is mainly focused on three systems of a smart grid&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the infrastructure system, the management system, and the protection system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6099519 Smart Grid - The New and Improved Power Grid: A Survey]; IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials 2011; X. Fang, S. Misra, G. Xue, and D. Yang; {{doi|10.1109/SURV.2011.101911.00087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The infrastructure system is the energy, information, and communication infrastructure underlying of the smart grid that supports:
* Advanced [[electricity generation]], delivery, and consumption
* Advanced information metering, monitoring, and management
* Advanced communication technologies

A smart grid would allow the power industry to observe and control parts of the system at higher resolution in time and space.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Electric Power Systems "&gt;Alexandra Von Meier (2013). Electrical Engineer 137A: Electric Power Systems. Lecture 2:Introduction to Electric Power Systems, Slide 33.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the purposes of the smart grid is real time information exchange to make operation as efficient as possible. It would allow management of the grid on all time scales from high-frequency switching devices on a microsecond scale, to wind and solar output variations on a minute scale, to the future effects of the carbon emissions generated by power production on a decade scale.

The management system is the subsystem in smart grid that provides advanced management and control services. Most of the existing works aim to improve energy efficiency, demand profile, utility, cost, and emission, based on the infrastructure by using [[optimization]], [[machine learning]], and [[game theory]]. Within the advanced infrastructure framework of smart grid, more and more new management services and applications are expected to emerge and eventually revolutionize consumers' daily lives.

The protection system of a smart grid provides grid reliability analysis, failure protection, and security and privacy protection services. While the additional communication infrastructure of a smart grid provides additional protective and security mechanisms, it also presents a risk of external attack and internal failures. In a report on cyber security of smart grid technology first produced in 2010, and later updated in 2014, the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] pointed out that the ability to collect more data about energy use from customer [[smart meter]]s also raises major privacy concerns, since the information stored at the meter, which is potentially vulnerable to [[data breaches]], can be mined for personal details about customers.&lt;ref&gt;Nunez, Christina (December&amp;nbsp;14, 2012). "[https://relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/news/energy/2012/12/121212-smart-meter-privacy Who’s Watching? Privacy Concerns Persist as Smart Meters Roll Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214548/https://relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/news/energy/2012/12/121212-smart-meter-privacy |date=2018-03-16 }}". ''National Geographic''. nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved 2018-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] and Title XIII of the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] are providing funding to encourage smart grid development. The objective is to enable utilities to better predict their needs, and in some cases involve consumers in a time-of-use tariff. Funds have also been allocated to develop more robust energy control technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 | url = http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?c110:./temp/~c110z6D5F8 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151219182025/http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?c110%3A.%2Ftemp%2F~c110z6D5F8 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2015-12-19 | accessdate = 2007-12-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/6-27-07_US_Electric_Grid_Press_Release.pdf DOE Provides up to $51.8 Million to Modernize the U.S. Electric Grid System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920233040/http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/6-27-07_US_Electric_Grid_Press_Release.pdf |date=2008-09-20 }}, June 27, 2007,  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grid defection===
As there is some resistance in the electric utility sector to the concepts of [[distributed generation]] with various [[renewable energy]] sources and microscale [[cogen]] units, several authors have warned that mass-scale grid defection is possible because consumers can produce electricity using [[off grid]] systems primarily made up of [[solar photovoltaic]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Abhilash Kantamneni, Richelle Winkler, Lucia Gauchia, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/25363058/Emerging_Economic_Viability_of_Grid_Defection_in_a_Northern_Climate_Using_Solar_Hybrid_Systems free open access Emerging economic viability of grid defection in a northern climate using solar hybrid systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105065816/http://www.academia.edu/25363058/Emerging_Economic_Viability_of_Grid_Defection_in_a_Northern_Climate_Using_Solar_Hybrid_Systems |date=2017-11-05 }}.

==Utilities and Oligopoly==
{{See also|oligopoly|microgrid}}
Due to the enormous capital outlays, utilities were a vertically integrated business throughout the 20th century owning the [[power generation]], the (transmission) lines while also managing the bills (commercialization). Nowadays technological progress has enabled individuals and groups to take on the functions that used to be the sole domain of the utility. Adding to the shift is the impact of aging infrastructure on reliability, security and performance factors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/08/22/490932307/aging-and-unstable-the-nations-electrical-grid-is-the-weakest-link?t=1532507208501 Aging And Unstable, The Nation's Electrical Grid Is 'The Weakest Link'.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy in [[Eritrea]] is an [[industry]] lacking in natural resources, though it has plenty of potential.

==Oil and gas==
Oil and gas exploration in the [[Red Sea]] off [[Eritrea]] began in the 1930s. Following independence, the country began awarding production contracts in 1995. However, as of January 2003, Eritrea had no proven reserves of crude oil or natural gas. It also has no known reserves of [[coal]]. As a result, the country, as of 2001, has had no output of oil, natural gas or coal. Petroleum imports and consumption were estimated each at {{convert|4590|oilbbl/d}} in 2002. In 1997, due to high costs, Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to shut down their joint operations at the petroleum refinery at [[Assab]] and import refined petroleum products. The refinery had a capacity of {{convert|18000|oilbbl/d}}.  In 2000 an estimated {{convert|3.2|to|3.3|Moilbbl/d}} of oil were shipped through the [[Bab el-Mandeb]], a narrow waterway between Eritrea, [[Yemen]], and [[Djibouti]] that connects the [[Gulf of Aden]] with the Red Sea.

==Electricity==
As of August 2003, about 80% of the population was without electricity, which was available only in the larger cities and towns, although the government was constructing additional electrical distribution lines. In 2002, net electricity generation was 243&amp;nbsp;GWh, of which 100% came from [[fossil fuel]]s. In the same year, consumption of electricity totaled 226&amp;nbsp;GWh. As of August 2003, Eritrea had about 60&amp;nbsp;MW of diesel-fired generating capacity.

A '''French cleat''' is way of securing a [[Cabinetry|cabinet]], mirror, artwork or other object to a wall.&lt;ref&gt;''Fine Woodworking'', [[Taunton Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[molding (decorative)|molding]] with a 30–45 degree slope used to hang cabinets or other objects.

French cleats can be used in pairs, or with a cleat mounted to the wall and a matching edge cut into the object to be hung.

The wall side of a French cleat can be mounted securely without having to hold the full weight of the [[Cabinetry|cabinet]] while securing it. The cleat will not be seen later, so it does not matter where it is drilled; this means that it can be screwed into [[wall stud]]s relatively independent of the lateral position of the cabinet.
The cleat can be the full length of the cabinet, so it allows supporting the cabinet at least at every stud behind it.
If the wall cleat is left slightly shorter than the cabinet, the cabinet can be shifted left and right slightly after it is hung, for perfect positioning.

Once the cleat is secured to the wall, the cabinet can be simply lifted onto it. Because no fine maneuvering is required, even a relatively heavy cabinet can be hung easily this way.

The bottom of the cabinet can be secured to the wall to be sure that it will not get pushed off the cleat while in use.

A '''gamma ray''' or '''gamma radiation''' (symbol '''γ''' or &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;), is a penetrating [[electromagnetic radiation]] arising from the [[radioactive decay]] of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. It consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest [[photon energy]]. [[Paul Ulrich Villard|Paul Villard]], a French [[chemist]] and [[physicist]], discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying [[radiation]] emitted by [[radium]]. In 1903, [[Ernest Rutherford]] named this radiation ''gamma rays'' based on their relatively strong penetration of [[matter]]; he had previously discovered two less penetrating types of decay radiation, which he named [[alpha particle|alpha rays]] and [[beta particle|beta rays]] in ascending order of penetrating power.

Gamma rays from radioactive decay are in the energy range from a few keV to ~8&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]], corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long lifetimes. The energy spectrum of gamma rays can be used to identify the decaying [[radionuclides]] using [[gamma spectroscopy]]. [[Very-high-energy gamma ray]]s in the 100–1000 [[TeV]] range have been observed from sources such as the [[Cygnus X-3]] [[microquasar]].

Natural sources of gamma rays originating on Earth are mostly as a result of radioactive decay and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with [[cosmic ray]] particles. However there are other rare natural sources, such as [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es, that produce gamma rays from electron action upon the nucleus. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include [[nuclear fission|fission]], such as occurs in [[nuclear reactor]]s, as well as [[high energy physics]] experiments, such as [[pion|neutral pion decay]] and [[nuclear fusion]].

Gamma rays and [[X-rays]] are both electromagnetic radiation and they overlap in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]; so that over a range of energies they cannot be differentiated by detection only. One way to distinguish them is by their origin, and in the case of X-rays, the origin is outside the nucleus due to electron interaction. Terminology varies between scientific disciplines. In [[astrophysics]] gamma rays are conventionally defined as having [[photon energy|photon energies]] above 100&amp;nbsp;[[electron Volt|keV]] and are the subject of [[gamma ray astronomy]], while radiation below 100&amp;nbsp;keV is classified as [[X-rays]] and is the subject of [[X-ray astronomy]]. This convention stems from the early man-made X-rays, which had energies only up to 100 KeV, whereas many gamma rays could go to higher energies. A large fraction of astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere.

Gamma rays are [[ionizing radiation]] and are thus biologically hazardous. Due to their high penetration power, they can damage bone marrow and internal organs. Unlike alpha and beta rays, they pass easily through the body and thus pose a formidable [[radiation protection]] challenge.

==History of discovery==
The first gamma ray source to be discovered was the [[radioactive decay]] process called ''gamma decay''. In this type of decay, an [[excited state|excited]] nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It is now understood that a nuclear [[isomeric transition]], however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Villard]], a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from [[radium]]. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as "radioactivity" by [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type.&lt;ref&gt;P. Villard (1900) [https://books.google.com/books?id=W1oDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1010 "Sur la réflexion et la réfraction des rayons cathodiques et des rayons déviables du radium"], ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 130, pages 1010–1012. See also: P. Villard (1900) [https://books.google.com/books?id=W1oDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1179 "Sur le rayonnement du radium"], ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 130, pages 1178–1179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L'Annunziata|first=Michael F.|title=Radioactivity: introduction and history|publisher=Elsevier BV|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|year=2007|pages=55–58|isbn=978-0-444-52715-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1903, Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays by [[Ernest Rutherford]], who named Villard's rays "gamma rays" by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford named γ rays on page 177 of: E. Rutherford (1903) [https://books.google.com/books?id=otXPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The magnetic and electric deviation of the easily absorbed rays from radium"], ''Philosophical Magazine'', Series 6, vol. 5, no. 26, pages 177–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The "rays" emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not {{em|easily}} deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays.

Gamma rays were first thought to be particles with mass, like alpha and beta rays. Rutherford initially believed that they might be extremely fast beta particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field indicated that they had no charge.&lt;ref name=RaP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/rays_and_particles.html |title=Rays and Particles |publisher=Galileo.phys.virginia.edu |accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be reflected from crystal surfaces, proving that they were electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref name=RaP/&gt; Rutherford and his co-worker [[Edward Andrade]] measured the wavelengths of gamma rays from radium, and found that they were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was eventually recognized as giving them more energy per [[photon]], as soon as the latter term became generally accepted. A gamma decay was then understood to usually emit a gamma photon.

==Sources==
[[File:NASA's Fermi Explores the Early Universe.ogv|thumb|300px|This animation tracks several gamma rays through space and time, from their emission in the jet of a distant [[blazar]] to their arrival in [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi's]] Large Area Telescope (LAT).]]
Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring [[radioisotope]]s such as [[potassium-40]], and also as a secondary radiation from various atmospheric interactions with [[cosmic ray]] particles. Some rare terrestrial natural sources that produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, are [[lightning strike]]s and [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es, which produce high energy emissions from natural high-energy voltages. Gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced. Such electrons produce secondary gamma rays by the mechanisms of [[bremsstrahlung]], inverse [[Compton scattering]] and [[synchrotron radiation]]. A large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include [[nuclear fission|fission]], such as occurs in [[nuclear reactor]]s, as well as [[high energy physics]] experiments, such as [[pion|neutral pion decay]] and [[nuclear fusion]].

A sample of gamma ray-emitting material that is used for irradiating or imaging is known as a gamma source. It is also called a [[radioactive source]], isotope source, or radiation source, though these more general terms also apply to alpha- and beta-emitting devices. Gamma sources are usually sealed to prevent radioactive contamination, and transported in heavy shielding.

===Radioactive decay (gamma decay)===
{{Main|Nuclear isomer}}
Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay, which normally occurs after other forms of decay occur, such as [[alpha decay|alpha]] or [[beta decay|beta]] decay. An excited nucleus can decay by the emission of an [[alpha particle|{{Subatomic particle|alpha}}]] or [[beta particle|{{Subatomic particle|beta}}]] particle. The [[daughter nucleus]] that results is usually left in an excited state. It can then decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon, in a process called gamma decay.

The emission of a gamma ray from an excited nucleus typically requires only 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. Gamma decay may also follow [[nuclear reaction]]s such as [[neutron capture]], [[nuclear fission]], or [[nuclear fusion]]. Gamma decay is also a mode of relaxation of many excited states of atomic nuclei following other types of radioactive decay, such as [[beta decay]], so long as these states possess the necessary component of nuclear [[spin (physics)|spin]]. When high-energy gamma rays, electrons, or protons bombard materials, the excited atoms emit characteristic "secondary" gamma rays, which are products of the creation of excited nuclear states in the bombarded atoms. Such transitions, a form of nuclear gamma [[fluorescence]], form a topic in [[nuclear physics]] called [[gamma spectroscopy]]. Formation of fluorescent gamma rays are a rapid subtype of radioactive gamma decay.

In certain cases, the excited nuclear state that follows the emission of a beta particle or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average, and is termed a [[metastability#Atomic and nuclear physics|metastable]] excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100 to 1000 times longer than the average 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. Such relatively long-lived excited nuclei are termed [[nuclear isomer]]s, and their decays are termed [[isomeric transition]]s. Such nuclei have [[half-life]]s that are more easily measurable, and rare nuclear isomers are able to stay in their excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before emitting a gamma ray. The process of isomeric transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states are often characterized by high [[nuclear spin]], requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition that occurs in only 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. The rate of gamma decay is also slowed when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/ntgd.html Gamma decay review] Accessed Sept. 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

An emitted gamma ray from any type of excited state may transfer its energy directly to any [[electron]]s, but most probably to one of the K shell electrons of the atom, causing it to be ejected from that atom, in a process generally termed the [[photoelectric effect]] (external gamma rays and ultraviolet rays may also cause this effect). The photoelectric effect should not be confused with the [[internal conversion]] process, in which a gamma ray photon is not produced as an intermediate particle (rather, a "virtual gamma ray" may be thought to mediate the process).

====Decay schemes====
[[File:Cobalt-60 Decay Scheme.svg|thumb|Radioactive decay scheme of {{SimpleNuclide2|Cobalt|60}}]]
[[File:60Co gamma spectrum energy.png|thumb|Gamma emission spectrum of cobalt-60]]
One example of gamma ray production due to radionuclide decay is the decay scheme for Cobalt 60, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram. First, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Cobalt|60}} decays to [[excited state|excited]] {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}} by [[beta rays|beta decay]] emission of an electron of 0.31 MeV. Then the excited {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|60}} decays to the ground state (see [[nuclear shell model]]) by emitting gamma rays in succession of 1.17 MeV followed by 1.33 MeV. This path is followed 99.88% of the time:

|}

Another example is the alpha decay of {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|americium|241}} to form {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|neptunium|237}}; which is followed by gamma emission. In some cases, the gamma emission spectrum of the daughter nucleus is quite simple, (e.g. {{SimpleNuclide2|Cobalt|60}}/{{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|60}}) while in other cases, such as with ({{SimpleNuclide2|americium|241}}/{{SimpleNuclide2|neptunium|237}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|iridium|192}}/{{SimpleNuclide2|platinum|192}}), the gamma emission spectrum is complex, revealing that a series of nuclear energy levels exist.

===Particle physics===
Gamma rays are produced in many processes of [[particle physics]]. Typically, gamma rays are the products of [[electrically neutral|neutral]] systems which decay through [[electromagnetic interaction]]s (rather than a [[weak interaction|weak]] or [[strong interaction|strong]] interaction). For example, in an [[electron–positron annihilation]], the usual products are two gamma ray photons. If the annihilating electron and positron are at rest, each of the resulting gamma rays has an energy of ~ 511 [[kiloelectronvolt|keV]] and frequency of ~ {{val|1.24|e=20|u=Hz}}. Similarly, a neutral [[pion]] most often decays into two photons. Many other [[hadron]]s and massive [[boson]]s also decay electromagnetically. High energy physics experiments, such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]], accordingly employ substantial radiation shielding.&lt;ref name=accelerator-prompt-radiation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/313226/lhc-gamma-radiation-from-proton-proton-collisions |title=LHC gamma radiation from proton-proton collisions |publisher=Physics Stack Exchange |date=2017-02-19 |accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[subatomic particle]]s mostly have far shorter wavelengths than atomic nuclei, particle physics gamma rays are generally several orders of magnitude more energetic than nuclear decay gamma rays. Since gamma rays are at the top of the electromagnetic spectrum in terms of energy, all extremely high-energy photons are gamma rays; for example, a photon having the [[Planck energy]] would be a gamma ray.

===Gamma rays from sources other than radioactive decay===
{{Main|Gamma-ray astronomy}}
A few gamma rays in astronomy are known to arise from gamma decay (see discussion of [[SN1987A]]), but most do not.

Photons from astrophysical sources that carry energy in the gamma radiation range are often explicitly called gamma-radiation. In addition to nuclear emissions, they are often produced by sub-atomic particle and particle-photon interactions. Those include [[electron-positron annihilation]], [[neutral pion decay]], [[bremsstrahlung]], inverse [[Compton scattering]], and [[synchrotron radiation]].
[[File:Antimatter Explosions.ogv|thumb|right|200px|The red dots show some of the ~500 terrestrial gamma-ray flashes daily detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope through 2010. Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.]]

====Laboratory sources====
In October 2017, scientists from various European universities proposed a means for sources of GeV photons using lasers as exciters through a controlled interplay between the cascade and anomalous [[radiation trapping|radiative trapping]].&lt;ref name="2017-10-07_PRX"&gt;[https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.041003 Ultrabright GeV Photon Source via Controlled Electromagnetic Cascades in Laser-Dipole Waves], A. Gonoskov et al, [[Physical Review X]], Phys. Rev. X 7, 041003, 2017-10-07&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terrestrial thunderstorms====
Thunderstorms can produce a brief pulse of gamma radiation called a [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]. These gamma rays are thought to be produced by high intensity static electric fields accelerating electrons, which then produce gamma rays by [[bremsstrahlung]] as they collide with and are slowed by atoms in the atmosphere. Gamma rays up to 100 MeV can be emitted by terrestrial thunderstorms, and were discovered by space-borne observatories. This raises the possibility of health risks to passengers and crew on aircraft flying in or near thunderclouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Joseph|author2=David M. Smith|title=Deadly Rays From Clouds|magazine=Scientific American|date=August 2012|volume=307|issue=2|pages=55–59|bibcode=2012SciAm.307b..54D|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0812-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cosmic rays====
Extraterrestrial, high energy gamma rays include the gamma ray background produced when [[cosmic ray]]s (either high speed electrons or protons) collide with ordinary matter, producing pair-production gamma rays at 511 keV. Alternatively, [[bremsstrahlung]] are produced at energies of tens of MeV or more when cosmic ray electrons interact with nuclei of sufficiently high atomic number (see gamma ray image of the Moon at the beginning of this article, for illustration).
[[File:Egret all sky gamma ray map from CGRO spacecraft.png|thumb|300px|right|Image of entire sky in 100 MeV or greater gamma rays as seen by the EGRET instrument aboard the [[CGRO]] spacecraft. Bright spots within the galactic plane are [[pulsar]]s while those above and below the plane are thought to be [[quasar]]s.]]

====Pulsars and magnetars====
The gamma ray sky (see illustration at right) is dominated by the more common and longer-term production of gamma rays that emanate from [[pulsar]]s within the Milky Way. Sources from the rest of the sky are mostly [[quasar]]s. Pulsars are thought to be neutron stars with magnetic fields that produce focused beams of radiation, and are far less energetic, more common, and much nearer sources (typically seen only in our own galaxy) than are [[quasar]]s or the rarer [[gamma-ray burst]] sources of gamma rays. Pulsars have relatively long-lived magnetic fields that produce focused beams of relativistic speed charged particles, which emit gamma rays (bremsstrahlung) when those strike gas or dust in their nearby medium, and are decelerated. This is a similar mechanism to the production of high-energy photons in [[megavoltage]] [[radiation therapy]] machines (see [[bremsstrahlung]]). [[Inverse Compton scattering]], in which charged particles (usually electrons) impart energy to low-energy photons boosting them to higher energy photons. Such impacts of photons on relativistic charged particle beams is another possible mechanism of gamma ray production. Neutron stars with a very high magnetic field ([[magnetar]]s), thought to produce astronomical [[soft gamma repeater]]s, are another relatively long-lived star-powered source of gamma radiation.

====Quasars and active galaxies====
More powerful gamma rays from very distant [[quasar]]s and closer active galaxies are thought to have a gamma ray production source similar to a [[particle accelerator]]. High energy electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to inverse Compton scattering, [[synchrotron radiation]], or bremsstrahlung, are the likely source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of such galaxies provides the power source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting charged particles into beams that emerge from their rotational poles. When those beams interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they produce X-rays and gamma rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with durations of a few weeks, suggesting their relatively small size (less than a few light-weeks across). Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the most commonly visible high intensity sources outside our galaxy. They shine not in bursts (see illustration), but relatively continuously when viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a typical quasar is about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; watts, a small fraction of which is gamma radiation. Much of the rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including radio waves.
[[File:Gamma ray burst.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[hypernova]]. Artist's illustration showing the life of a [[massive star]] as [[nuclear fusion]] converts lighter elements into heavier ones. When fusion no longer generates enough pressure to counteract gravity, the star rapidly collapses to form a [[black hole]]. Theoretically, energy may be released during the collapse along the axis of rotation to form a long duration [[gamma-ray burst]].]]

====Gamma-ray bursts====
The most intense sources of gamma rays, are also the most intense sources of any type of electromagnetic radiation presently known. They are the "long duration burst" sources of gamma rays in astronomy ("long" in this context, meaning a few tens of seconds), and they are rare compared with the sources discussed above. By contrast, "short" [[gamma-ray burst]]s of two seconds or less, which are not associated with supernovae, are thought to produce gamma rays during the collision of pairs of neutron stars, or a neutron star and a [[black hole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/short_burst_oct5.html 2005 NASA announcement of first close study of a short gamma-ray burst].&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''long-duration'' gamma-ray bursts produce a total energy output of about 10&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; joules (as much energy as our [[Sun]] will produce in its entire life-time) but in a period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse [[Compton scattering]] and [[synchrotron radiation]] from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed [[black hole]] created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding [[hypernova]]. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close to the edge of the [[visible universe]].

==Properties==

===Penetration of matter===
{{See also|Radiation protection#Electromagnetic radiation}}
[[File:Alfa beta gamma radiation.svg|300px|thumb|[[Alpha particle|Alpha radiation]] consists of [[helium]] nuclei and is readily stopped by a sheet of paper. [[Beta radiation]], consisting of [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s, is stopped by an aluminum plate, but [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] requires shielding by dense material such as lead or concrete.]]
Due to their penetrating nature, gamma rays require large amounts of shielding mass to reduce them to levels which are not harmful to living cells, in contrast to [[alpha particle]]s, which can be stopped by paper or skin, and [[beta particle]]s, which can be shielded by thin aluminium. Gamma rays are best absorbed by materials with high [[atomic number]]s and high density, which contribute to the total stopping power. Because of this, a lead (high Z) shield is 20–30% better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another low-Z shielding material, such as aluminium, concrete, water, or soil; lead's major advantage is not in lower weight, but rather its compactness due to its higher density. Protective clothing, goggles and respirators can protect from internal contact with or ingestion of alpha or beta emitting particles, but provide no protection from gamma radiation from external sources.

The higher the energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the shielding made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the [[half value layer]] or HVL). For example, gamma rays that require {{nowrap|1 cm}} (0.4″) of [[lead]] to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by {{nowrap|4.1 cm}} of [[granite]] rock, 6&amp;nbsp;cm (2½″) of [[concrete]], or 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3½″) of packed [[soil]]. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. [[Depleted uranium]] is used for shielding in [[industrial radiography#Sources|portable gamma ray sources]], but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, {{clarify |date=August 2018 |reason=This sentence is confusing, as it primarily talks about the properties of the source, then switching to the properties of depleted uranium at the end |text=as portable [[industrial radiography#Radiographic cameras|sources' shape]] resembles a sphere to some extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced by a factor of eight, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk).}} In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a "hot" fuel assembly into the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under water.

===Matter interaction===
[[File:Al-gamma-xs.svg|300px|thumb|The total absorption coefficient of aluminium (atomic number 13) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. As is usual, the photoelectric effect is largest at low energies, Compton scattering dominates at intermediate energies, and pair production dominates at high energies.]]
[[File:Pb-gamma-xs.svg|300px|thumb|The total absorption coefficient of lead (atomic number 82) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. Here, the photoelectric effect dominates at low energy. Above 5 MeV, pair production starts to dominate.]]

When a gamma ray passes through matter, the probability for absorption is proportional to the thickness of the layer, the density of the material, and the absorption cross section of the material. The total absorption shows an [[exponential decay|exponential decrease]] of intensity with distance from the incident surface:
:&lt;math&gt;I(x)= I_0 \cdot e ^{-\mu x}&lt;/math&gt;
where x is the thickness of the material from the incident surface, μ= ''n''σ is the absorption coefficient, measured in cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''n'' the number of atoms per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of the material (atomic density) and σ the absorption [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

As it passes through matter, gamma radiation ionizes via three processes: the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Compton scattering]], and [[pair production]].
*'''[[Photoelectric effect]]''': This describes the case in which a gamma [[photon]] interacts with and transfers its energy to an atomic electron, causing the ejection of that electron from the atom. The kinetic energy of the resulting [[photoelectron]] is equal to the energy of the incident gamma photon minus the energy that originally bound the electron to the atom (binding energy). The photoelectric effect is the dominant energy transfer mechanism for X-ray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50 keV (thousand electron volts), but it is much less important at higher energies.
*'''[[Compton scattering]]''': This is an interaction in which an incident gamma photon loses enough energy to an atomic electron to cause its ejection, with the remainder of the original photon's energy emitted as a new, lower energy gamma photon whose emission direction is different from that of the incident gamma photon, hence the term "scattering". The probability of Compton scattering decreases with increasing photon energy. Compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 keV to 10 MeV. Compton scattering is relatively independent of the [[atomic number]] of the absorbing material, which is why very dense materials like lead are only modestly better shields, on a ''per weight'' basis, than are less dense materials.
*'''[[Pair production]]''': This becomes possible with gamma energies exceeding 1.02 MeV, and becomes important as an absorption mechanism at energies over 5 MeV (see illustration at right, for lead). By interaction with the [[electric field]] of a nucleus, the energy of the incident photon is converted into the mass of an electron-[[positron]] pair. Any gamma energy in excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles (totaling at least 1.02 MeV) appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and in the recoil of the emitting nucleus. At the end of the positron's [[range (particle radiation)|range]], it combines with a free electron, and the two annihilate, and the entire mass of these two is then converted into two gamma photons of at least 0.51 MeV energy each (or higher according to the kinetic energy of the annihilated particles).

The secondary electrons (and/or positrons) produced in any of these three processes frequently have enough energy to produce much [[ionization]] themselves.

Additionally, gamma rays, particularly high energy ones, can interact with atomic nuclei resulting in ejection of particles in [[photodisintegration]], or in some cases, even nuclear fission ([[photofission]]).

===Light interaction===
High-energy (from 80 GeV to ~10 [[electronvolt|TeV]]) gamma rays arriving from far-distant [[quasar]]s are used to estimate the [[extragalactic background light]] in the universe: The highest-energy rays interact more readily with the background light [[photon]]s and thus the density of the background light may be estimated by analyzing the incoming gamma ray spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bock|first=R.

===Gamma spectroscopy===
{{Main|Gamma spectroscopy}}

[[Gamma spectroscopy]] is the study of the energetic transitions in atomic nuclei, which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of gamma rays. As in optical [[spectroscopy]] (see [[Franck–Condon principle|Franck–Condon]] effect) the absorption of gamma rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in a "resonance") when the energy of the gamma ray is the same as that of an energy transition in the nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique of [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]]. In the [[Mössbauer effect]] the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type.

==Uses==
[[File:VACIS Gamma-ray Image with stowaways.GIF|right|thumb|Gamma-ray image of a truck with two stowaways taken with a [[cargo scanning|VACIS]] (vehicle and container imaging system)]]
Gamma rays provide information about some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe; however, they are largely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Instruments aboard high-altitude balloons and satellites missions, such as the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], provide our only view of the universe in gamma rays.

Gamma-induced molecular changes can also be used to alter the properties of [[semi-precious stone]]s, and is often used to change white [[topaz]] into [[blue topaz]].

Non-contact industrial sensors commonly use sources of gamma radiation in refining, mining, chemicals, food, soaps and detergents, and pulp and paper industries, for the measurement of levels, density, and thicknesses. Typically, these use Co-60 or Cs-137 isotopes as the radiation source.

In the US, gamma ray detectors are beginning to be used as part of the [[Container Security Initiative]] (CSI). These machines are advertised to be able to scan 30 containers per hour.

Gamma radiation is often used to kill living organisms, in a process called [[irradiation]]. Applications of this include the sterilization of medical equipment (as an alternative to [[autoclave]]s or chemical means), the removal of decay-causing [[bacteria]] from many foods and the prevention of the sprouting of fruit and vegetables to maintain freshness and flavor.

Despite their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat some types of [[cancer]], since the rays also kill cancer cells. In the procedure called [[gamma knife|gamma-knife]] surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed to the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The beams are aimed from different angles to concentrate the radiation on the growth while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.

Gamma rays are also used for diagnostic purposes in [[nuclear medicine]] in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting [[radioisotope]]s are used. For example, in a [[PET scan]] a radiolabeled sugar called [[fludeoxyglucose]] emits [[positron]]s that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most common gamma emitter used in medical applications is the [[nuclear isomer]] [[technetium-99m]] which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a [[gamma camera]] can be used to form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also [[SPECT]]). Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones via [[bone scan]]).

==Health effects==
{{See also|Sievert}}
Gamma rays cause damage at a cellular level and are penetrating, causing diffuse damage throughout the body. However, they are less ionising than alpha or beta particles, which are less penetrating.

Low levels of gamma rays cause a [[stochastic]] health risk, which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the ''probability'' of cancer induction and genetic damage.&lt;ref&gt;The ICRP says "In the low dose range, below about 100 mSv, it is scientifically plausible to assume that the incidence of cancer or heritable effects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equivalent dose in the relevant organs and tissues" ICRP publication 103 paragraph 64&lt;/ref&gt; High doses produce [[deterministic]] effects, which is the ''severity'' of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen. These effects are compared to the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]] measured by the unit [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body response===
When gamma radiation breaks DNA molecules, a cell may be able to [[DNA repair#DNA repair mechanisms|repair the damaged]] genetic material, within limits. However, a study of Rothkamm and Lobrich has shown that this repair process works well after high-dose exposure but is much slower than in the case of a low-dose exposure.&lt;ref name= "mcuaqz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothkamm|first1=K|last2=Löbrich|first2=M|title=Evidence for a lack of DNA double-strand break repair in human cells exposed to very low x-ray doses|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100|issue=9|pages=5057–62|year=2003|pmid=12679524|pmc=154297|doi=10.1073/pnas.0830918100|bibcode= 2003PNAS..100.5057R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk assessment===
The natural outdoor exposure in [[Great Britain]] ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 µSv/h with significant increase around known nuclear and contaminated sites.&lt;ref&gt;ENVIRONMENT AGENCY UK [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/296709/LIT_8790_34c5c5.PDF Radioactivity in Food and the Environment], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Natural exposure to gamma rays is about 1 to 2 mSv per year, and the average total amount of radiation received in one year per inhabitant in the USA is 3.6 mSv.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation Annex E: Medical radiation exposures – Sources and Effects of Ionizing – 1993, p. 249, New York, UN&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small increase in the dose, due to naturally occurring gamma radiation, around small particles of high atomic number materials in the human body caused by the [[photoelectric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pattison|first1=J. E.|last2=Hugtenburg|first2=R. P.|last3=Green|first3=S.|title=Enhancement of natural background gamma-radiation dose around uranium microparticles in the human body|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=7|pages=603–611|year=2009|doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0300|issue=45|pmc=2842777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, the radiation dose from chest [[radiography]] (about 0.06 mSv) is a fraction of the annual naturally occurring background radiation dose.&lt;ref&gt;US National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements – NCRP Report No. 93 – pp 53–55, 1987. Bethesda, Maryland, USA, NCRP&lt;/ref&gt; A chest CT delivers 5 to 8 mSv. A whole-body [[positron emission tomography|PET]]/CT scan can deliver 14 to 32 mSv depending on the protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/251/1/166.full.pdf |title=PET/CT total radiation dose calculations. |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dose from [[fluoroscopy]] of the stomach is much higher, approximately 50 mSv (14 times the annual background).

An acute full-body equivalent single exposure dose of 1 Sv (1000 mSv) causes slight blood changes, but 2.0–3.5 Sv (2.0–3.5 Gy) causes very severe syndrome of nausea, hair loss, and [[hemorrhaging]], and will cause death in a sizable number of cases—-about 10% to 35% without medical treatment. A dose of 5 Sv&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/lethal-dose-ld.html "Lethal dose"], NRC Glossary (October 18, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; (5 Gy) is considered approximately the [[median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] (lethal dose for 50% of exposed population) for an acute exposure to radiation even with standard medical treatment. A dose higher than 5 Sv (5 Gy) brings an increasing chance of death above 50%. Above 7.5–10 Sv (7.5–10 Gy) to the entire body, even extraordinary treatment, such as bone-marrow transplants, will not prevent the death of the individual exposed (see ''[[Radiation poisoning]]'').{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} (Doses much larger than this may, however, be delivered to selected parts of the body in the course of [[radiation therapy]].)

For low-dose exposure, for example among nuclear workers, who receive an average yearly radiation dose of 19 mSv,{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} &lt;!--annual dose? lifetime dose?--&gt; the risk of dying from cancer (excluding [[leukemia]]) increases by 2 percent. For a dose of 100 mSv, the risk increase is 10 percent. By comparison, risk of dying from cancer was increased by 32 percent for the survivors of the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cardis|first1=E|title=Risk of cancer after low doses of ionising radiation: retrospective cohort study in 15 countries|journal=BMJ|date=9 July 2005|volume=331|issue=7508|pages=77–0|doi=10.1136/bmj.38499.599861.E0|pmid=15987704|pmc=558612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units of measurement and exposure==
The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units:
{{Radiation related quantities}}

The measure of the [[ionization|ionizing]] effect of gamma and X-rays in dry air is called the exposure, for which a legacy unit, the [[Roentgen (unit)|röntgen]] was used from 1928. This has been replaced by [[kerma (physics)|kerma]], now mainly used for instrument calibration purposes but not for received dose effect. The effect of gamma and other ionizing radiation on living tissue is more closely related to the amount of [[energy]] deposited in tissue rather than the ionisation of air, and replacement radiometric units and quantities for [[radiation protection]] have been defined and developed from 1953 onwards. These are:
*The [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), is the SI unit of [[absorbed dose]], which is the amount of radiation energy deposited in the irradiated material. For gamma radiation this is numerically equivalent to [[equivalent dose]] measured by the [[sievert]], which indicates the stochastic biological effect of low levels of radiation on human tissue. The radiation weighting conversion factor from absorbed dose to equivalent dose is 1 for gamma, whereas alpha particles have a factor of 20, reflecting their greater ionising effect on tissue.
*The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the deprecated [[CGS]] unit for absorbed dose and the [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]] is the deprecated [[CGS]] unit of equivalent dose, used mainly in the USA.

==Distinction from X-rays==
{{Nuclear physics}}
[[File:EM Spectrum Properties edit.svg|thumb|300px|In practice, gamma ray energies overlap with the range of X-rays, especially in the higher-frequency region referred to as "hard" X-rays. This depiction follows the older convention of distinguishing by wavelength.]]

The conventional distinction between [[X-ray]]s and gamma rays has changed over time. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by [[X-ray tube]]s almost invariably had a longer [[wavelength]] than the radiation (gamma rays) emitted by [[radioactive]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Dendy"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[photon energy|energy of photons]] is proportional to their frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength, this past distinction between [[X-ray]]s and gamma rays can also be thought of in terms of its energy, with gamma rays considered to be higher energy electromagnetic radiation than are X-rays.

However, since current artificial sources are now able to duplicate any electromagnetic radiation that originates in the nucleus, as well as far higher energies, the wavelengths characteristic of radioactive gamma ray sources vs. other types now completely overlap. Thus, gamma rays are now usually distinguished by their origin: [[X-ray]]s are emitted by definition by [[electron]]s outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the [[nucleus (atomic structure)|nucleus]].&lt;ref name="Dendy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Moon egret.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Moon]] as seen by the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], in gamma rays of greater than 20 MeV. These are produced by [[cosmic ray]] bombardment of its surface. The Sun, which has no similar surface of high [[atomic number]] to act as target for cosmic rays, cannot usually be seen at all at these energies, which are too high to emerge from primary nuclear reactions, such as solar nuclear fusion (though occasionally the Sun produces gamma rays by cyclotron-type mechanisms, during [[solar flare]]s). Gamma rays typically have higher energy than X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/epo/news/gammoon.html |title=CGRO SSC &gt;&gt; EGRET Detection of Gamma Rays from the Moon |publisher=Heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For example, modern high-energy X-rays produced by [[linear particle accelerator|linear accelerators]] for [[megavoltage]] treatment in cancer often have higher energy (4 to 25 MeV) than do most classical gamma rays produced by nuclear [[gamma decay]]. One of the most common gamma ray emitting isotopes used in diagnostic [[nuclear medicine]], [[technetium-99m]], produces gamma radiation of the same energy (140 keV) as that produced by diagnostic X-ray machines, but of significantly lower energy than therapeutic [[photon]]s from linear particle accelerators. In the medical community today, the convention that radiation produced by nuclear decay is the only type referred to as "gamma" radiation is still respected.

Due to this broad overlap in energy ranges, in physics the two types of electromagnetic radiation are now often defined by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons (either in orbitals outside of the nucleus, or while being accelerated to produce [[bremsstrahlung]]-type radiation),&lt;ref&gt;"Bremsstrahlung radiation" is "braking radiation", but "acceleration" is being used here in the specific sense of the ''deflection'' of an electron from its course: {{cite book|last1=Serway|first1=Raymond A|title=College Physics|year=2009|publisher=Brooks Cole|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-03-023798-0|page=876|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus or by means of other [[particle decay]]s or annihilation events. There is no lower limit to the energy of photons produced by nuclear reactions, and thus [[ultraviolet]] or lower energy photons produced by these processes would also be defined as "gamma rays".&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1109–1111|year=1999 |author1=Shaw, R. W. |author2=Young, J. P. |author3=Cooper, S. P. |author4=Webb, O.

However, in physics and astronomy, the converse convention (that all gamma rays are considered to be of nuclear origin) is frequently violated.

In astronomy, higher energy gamma and X-rays are defined by energy, since the processes that produce them may be uncertain and photon energy, not origin, determines the required astronomical detectors needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/how_l2/gamma_detectors.html |title=Gamma-Ray Telescopes &amp; Detectors |publisher=NASA GSFC |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-energy photons occur in nature that are known to be produced by processes other than nuclear decay but are still referred to as gamma radiation. An example is "gamma rays" from lightning discharges at 10 to 20 MeV, and known to be produced by the [[bremsstrahlung]] mechanism.

Another example is [[gamma-ray burst]]s, now known to be produced from processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive decay. This is part and parcel of the general realization that many gamma rays produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or particle annihilation, but rather in non-radioactive processes similar to X-rays.{{clarify|reason=This is confusing. There is not just one manner of production. Electron jumps in atoms, bremstrahlung, or all other mechanisms?|date=July 2016}} Although the gamma rays of astronomy often come from non-radioactive events, a few gamma rays in astronomy are specifically known to originate from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their spectra and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova [[SN 1987A]], which emits an "afterglow" of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly made radioactive [[nickel-56]] and [[cobalt-56]]. Most gamma rays in astronomy, however, arise by other mechanisms.

'''Global [[storm]] activity of 2006''' profiles the major worldwide storms, including [[blizzard]]s, [[ice storms]], and other winter events, from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. [[Winter storm]]s are events in which the dominant varieties of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are forms that only occur at cold [[temperature]]s, such as [[snow]] or [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]], or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are cold enough to allow [[ice]] to form (i.e. [[freezing rain]]). It may be marked by strong [[wind]], [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] (a [[thunderstorm]]), heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], such as [[ice]] ([[winter storm|ice storm]]), or wind transporting some substance through the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (as in a [[dust storm]], [[snowstorm]], [[hail]]storm, etc.). Other major non winter events such as large dust storms, [[Hurricane]]s, [[cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]s, [[gale]]s, [[flooding]] and [[rainstorm]]s are also caused by such phenomena to a lesser or greater existent.

Very rarely, well-defined winter storms may form during the summer, though it would usually have to be an abnormally cold summer, such as the [[Year Without a Summer|Summer of 1816]] in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In many locations in the Northern Hemisphere, the most powerful winter storms usually occur in March and, in regions where temperatures are cold enough, April.

==The events of 2006==

===January===

[[Image:Clare 2006 track.png|thumb|left|175px|The storm's path.]]
Severe Tropical [[Cyclone Clare]] was a moderate strength [[cyclone]] which hit [[Western Australia]] in January 2006. The storm formed as an area of [[low pressure system|low pressure]] in the [[Arafura Sea]], on 4 January 2006, and moved westward. It ultimately peaked at Category 3 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone scale. It moved ashore on the coast of [[Pilbara]] and proceeded inland, dissipating on 10 January. Clare produced winds of {{convert|142|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at [[Karratha]] and triggered widespread torrential rainfall that led to flooding. Following its usage, the name ''Clare'' was retired by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]], and will never be used again for a tropical cyclone in the area affected by it. Ahead of the storm's landfall, local and state officials issued a "red alert" for several locations along the storm's prdicted path. 2,000 people were evacuated in the [[Karratha]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Hoare|title=WA residents brace for Cyclone Clare|date=9 January 2006|publisher=''ABC News'' (Australia)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1544153.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas between Broome and Port Hedland, people were urged to tidy up debris and organise disaster supplies to prepare for the storm.&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|title=WA residents prepare for storm|date=8 January 2006|publisher=''The Sydney Morning Herald''|accessdate=31 January 2010|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/cyclone-approaches-wa/2006/01/08/1136655076878.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January, a broad area of low pressure developed near the coast of Queensland after a monsoonal trough passed through the region. Northeasterly winds flowing into the system quickly increased convection, resulting in heavy rainfall over coastal regions of Queensland. The slow movement of the developing low continued through 26 January before turning northeast in response to a mid-level ridge to the north.&lt;ref name="GPJanuary"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|publisher=Typhoon 2000|date=25 April 2006|accessdate=28 December 2009|title=Monthly Tropical Weather Summary for January 2006|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/garyp_mgtcs/jan06sum.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January, the JTWC began monitoring the system as Tropical Storm 10P&lt;ref name="JTWCJim"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|accessdate=28 December 2009|title=Cyclone 10P Best Track|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/2006/2006s-bsh/bsh102006.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly after, the Bureau of Meteorology classified the storm as a Category 1 cyclone and gave it the name Jim.&lt;ref name="JanSigWX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|year=2006|accessdate=28 December 2008|title=Significant Weather- January 2006|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/public/sigwxsum/sigw0106.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torrential rainfall affected portions of coastal Queensland between 26 and 27 January. In a 24-hour span, {{convert|258|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell in Home Hill, leading to minor flooding. On 28 January, the cyclone brushed [[Flinders Reef]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Willis Island]] and [[Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve|Lihou Reef]], bringing winds up to {{convert|65|km/h}} to all three areas.&lt;ref name="JanSigWX"/&gt;

===February===
{{Main|Cyclone Kate (2006)}}

The TCWC [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] issued a gale warning for a Tropical Low near the northern tip of Cape York Peninsula on February 22. The low moved in an easterly direction. It quickly strengthened and became Tropical Cyclone Kate on the same day. Kate moved eastwards and weakened into a tropical low on February 24. Coastal Queensland was badly hit. In the [[Shire of Noosa]], six surfers sustained serious injuries after wading into turbulent waters. Waves up to {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tossed the six surfers, leaving them with injuries ranging from broken noses and fractured ankles to head wounds from surfboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|work=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=25 February 2006|accessdate=27 December 2009|title=Surfers hurt by wild waves |url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2006/02/25/scd-surfers-hurt-by-wild-waves/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas''' ({{lang-ru|Российский государственный университет нефти и газа имени И. М. Губкина}}) is a university in [[Moscow]]. The university was founded on 17 April 1930 and is named after the geologist [[Ivan Gubkin]]. The university is affectionally known as Kerosinka ({{lang-ru|Керосинка}}), meaning "kerosene stove".

The institute was part of the [[Moscow Geological Exploration Institute]] (MGRI) but later became a separate entity.

During the Soviet period, the university, along with the [[Moscow State University of Railway Engineering]], was known for admitting students of [[Jewish]] origin while other universities unofficially barred [[Jew]]ish students.

Affiliates of the Gubkin institute exist in Orenburg, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan and Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

==Gubkin history==
The history of Gubkin University started in 1930 when the Moscow Academy of Mines was reorganized into six Institutes. Thus the Petroleum Engineering Department of the Academy became the base for the new Moscow Petroleum Institute. The Institute was named in honor of Academician Ivan Gubkin, “who contributed greatly to the foundation of higher education aimed at (of training engineers, needed urgently for the socialist industry”. At this time the young Soviet state was in want of fuel and energy for industrial development. The petroleum industry faced new challenges such as the development of new fields, application of advanced methods of operation, introduction of new production technologies, further development of oil refining technologies and construction of new plants, electrification of the oil industry, as well as the planning, organization and improving the safety of petroleum production.

None of these problems could be solved without significant increase in the number of petroleum engineers and Gubkin Institute became the main base for preparing such specialists.

At the beginning there were only three faculties at the University, namely: Geology and Oil Exploration, Petroleum Engineering and Refining.

The first Rector of the University and the founders of its educational and research schools were Ivan M. Gubkin himself and many famous founders of the Russian (USSR) oil and gas science such as: A.P. Krylov, Yu.A. Kosygin, L.S. Leibenzon, S.S. Nametkin, A.V. Topchiev, I.I. Chernyaev. M.I. Varentsov, N.L. Buslenko, M.A. Kapelyushnikov, M.F. Mirchink, N.S. Nametkin, L.V. Pustovalov, K.A. Chepikov, S.F. Fedorov, G.F. Mirchink, Ya.M. Paushkin; V.I. Isagulyants, L.Sh. Davitashvili; and many others.

Nowadays there are more than ten teaching faculties at Gubkin preparing specialists in almost every field of the petroleum industry: from petroleum geology and engineering to energy economics and trading.
Since the University’s establishment more than 85,000 students have been graduated from Gubkin.

The University is justifiably proud of its alumni working in all leading oil and gas Russian and international companies.

The '''International Energy Forum (IEF)''' is an inter-governmental, non-profit international organisation which aims to foster greater mutual understanding and awareness of common energy interests among its members. The [https://www.ief.org/about-ief/organisation/member-countries.aspx 72 Member Countries] of the Forum are signatories to the [https://www.ief.org/about-ief/ief-charter.aspx IEF Charter], which outlines the framework of the global energy dialogue through this inter-governmental arrangement. 

The IEF is the neutral facilitator of informal, open, informed and continuing global energy dialogue. Recognising their interdependence in the field of energy, the member countries of the IEF co-operate under the neutral framework of the Forum to foster greater mutual understanding and awareness of common energy interests in order to ensure global energy security.

The IEF is unique in that participants not only include [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] and [[OPEC]] countries, but also key international actors such as [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], and [[South Africa]]. The IEF member countries account for more than 90 percent of global oil and gas [[supply and demand]]. 

The Forum's biennial Ministerial Meetings are the world's largest gathering of Energy Ministers. The magnitude and diversity of this engagement is a testament to the position of the IEF as a neutral facilitator and honest broker of solutions in the common interest.

Through the Forum and its associated events, IEF Ministers, their officials, energy industry executives, and other experts engage in a dialogue of increasing importance to global energy security.

The IEF is promoted by a permanent Secretariat based in the Diplomatic Quarter of [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ief.org/about-ief/ief-overview.aspx|title=IEF Overview {{!}} International Energy Forum|website=www.ief.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Energy Forum also coordinates the [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative|Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI)]] which is a concrete outcome of the global energy dialogue.

== Mission statement ==
The International Energy Forum aims to provide a platform for member-states to have access to open discussion and dialogue between countries that make up the global energy market. The Forum aims to gather all aspects of the energy market; producer, consumer and transit states. The goal of the forum is to create better understanding of the market on all sides, and to increase mutual awareness and understanding of existing member states.

== Objectives ==
The fundamental aims of the Forum are: 

* Fostering greater mutual understanding and awareness of common energy interests among its Members;
* Promoting a better understanding of the benefits of stable and transparent energy markets for the health of the world economy, the security of energy supply and demand, and the expansion of global trade and investment in energy resources and technology;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nbd0-oszodUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22International+Energy+Forum%22&amp;ots=MBy890SD_S&amp;sig=sLk0ma-d-DpCCr7pPO26TRc1eH8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22International%20Energy%20Forum%22&amp;f=false|title=Global Energy Governance: The New Rules of the Game|last=Goldthau|first=Andreas|last2=Witte|first2=Jan Martin|date=2010-03-01|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=081570464X|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Identifying and promoting principles and guidelines that enhance energy market transparency, stability and sustainability;

== History ==
The concept of a systematic producer-consumer dialogue emerged in the 1970s as a part of the general reorganisation in the global political and economic order with energy markets transforming the structure within individual countries as well as power balances and relations between countries. In the wake of the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, consumers and producers recognised their joint interest in the stability of the oil market, creating greater awareness, and understanding sensitivities toward each others interests. 

The Gulf War revealed the importance of a concerted and coordinated global response to an adverse supply shock. On October 1, 1990 at the United Nations General Assembly, Venezuelan President, [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] called for an urgent meeting of producers and consumers under the auspices of the United Nations to help the world face the growing uncertainties and politics of the oil market. With the support of French President [[François Mitterrand]], and Norwegian Prime Minister, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland|Gro Brundtland]], political support was gained for the initiation of a Ministerial Seminar of producers and consumers. 

Established in Paris in July 1991, the International Energy Forum was created in order to stabilise the global energy market after the [[1970s energy crisis]], and the [[1980s oil glut]]. One of the main priorities of the Forum was to bring together member-states and private corporations in order to increase awareness of national and international interests, and the workings of the market in order to avoid the instabilities of the previous two decades. 

== Organizations ==
Headquartered in the Diplomatic Quarter of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, The International Energy Forum is a Secretariat organization. The forum is governed by an executive board which is composed of 31 representatives of ministries of the respective member states. The body is lead by Secretary General, Dr. Sun Xiansheng of China. Xiansheng was appointed on August 1st, 2016.

The International Energy Forum Secretariat is to ensure that the Forum is promoting a neutral platform for the exchange of information and views regarding conflicts and the future of the energy industry. Another goal of the executive board is to include both public and private entities in the global energy market in order to bring forth multiple viewpoints to the Forum.

Additional duties that are performed by the Executive Board include organizing all of the Forum's activities. These include all meetings and summits that are put on by the Forum, and also coordinates the Forum's Programme of Work. 

== The Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) ==
IEF Energy Ministers recognized that the exchange and free dissemination of energy market data helps to mitigate uncertainty by improving market transparency and facilitating well-informed decision-making that instils investor conﬁdence, supports market stability and strengthens energy security. The Joint Organisations Data Initiative, coordinated by the IEF since 2005, relies on the combined efforts of the eight JODI partner organisations ([[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Eurostat|EUROSTAT]], [[Gas Exporting Countries Forum|GECF]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], OLADE, [[OPEC]], and [[UNSD]]), and more than 100 national administrations, and industry stakeholders to gather, verify and transmit the ofﬁcial data that populates JODI’s two public databases JODI-Oil and JODI-Gas with key monthly supply and demand indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jodidata.org/news/what-is-jodi-infographic-2017-version|title="What is JODI?"

'''Karol Franciszek Pollak''' (November 15, 1859 – December 17, 1928) was a [[Polish people|Polish]] [[electrotechnician]], [[inventor]] and [[businessman]].

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Sanok]], [[Poland]]. His father was Karol Pollak (1818–80) who was a [[printer (publishing)|printer]], bookseller and publisher, well known in [[Sanok]]. Karol (not to be mistaken with his father) worked in his youth as an [[electrician]] and showed great technical skills in it. In 1883 he was employed in the laboratory of British company "The Patent Utilisation Co". He designed and recorded his first patents in that period. In 1885 he attended [[electrotechnics]] studies at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Royal Polytechnic University in Charlottenburg]].

== Activity ==
In Berlin, Pollak ran electrotechnical factory "G. Wehr Telegraphen-Bau-Anstalt". Later he returned to Britain to commercialize his patents, which were released under anglicised version of his name, "Charles Pollak". In 1886, he became the director of a Paris company of electric tramways of his design. In the meantime he worked on the design of [[Electrochemical cell]]. He was very successful in this topic and it made him famous. Later he founded battery factories in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] and [[Liesing]], [[Austria]]. Many  battery-manufacturing companies have licensed his designs.

In 1899 he founded his own laboratory and proceeded with further research. He obtained 98 patents on his inventions.

In 1922 he returned to [[Poland]], where a year later he founded a factory in [[Biała Krakowska|Biała]], which exists to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.www.hawker.pl/pl/fabryka Fabryka Akumulatorów EnerSys Sp. z o.o]&lt;/ref&gt; The company started under the name of ''Polskie Towarzystwo Akumulatorowe'' and was co-founded by professor and president of [[Poland]], [[Ignacy Mościcki]]. However, Pollak was the first president of this company.

Pollak is sometimes referred as the ''Edison of Poland''. In 1925 he received the title [[Doctor Honoris Causa|doctor honoris causa]] of [[Warsaw Polytechnic|Warsaw University of Technology]].

== Most important inventions ==
[[File:Pollak akumulator.jpg|thumb|150px|Battery constructed by Karol Pollak]]
His numerous inventions also cover other areas, among them: [[electric motor]]s, [[color printing]] device, and a type of [[microphone]]. His main activity was related to [[chemical energy|chemical sources of energy]] - [[galvanic cell]]s and batteries. He obtained a patent for manufacturing [[Lead acid battery|lead-acid batteries]].

[[File:Pollak bridge.png|thumb|250px|Design of full rectifier included in Karol Pollak patent]]
He also has designed [[Rectifier|commutator and electrolytic rectifiers]]. In 1895 he was the first to suggest the use of [[Diode bridge|full bridge diode rectification circuit]],&lt;ref&gt;British patent [https://archive.is/20130807121725/https://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?window=1&amp;space=menu&amp;content=treffer&amp;action=bibdat&amp;docid=GB000189524398A 24398]&lt;/ref&gt; later known by [[Leo Graetz]]. In 1896, Pollak invented the [[electrolytic capacitor]]&lt;ref&gt;German patent [http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=DE000000092564A D.R.P. 92564].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">In [[astronomy]], the '''Kennicutt–Schmidt law''' (or simply '''Schmidt law''') is an empirical relation between the gas density and star formation rate (SFR) in a given region.  The relation was first examined by [[Maarten Schmidt]] in a 1959 paper where he proposed that the SFR surface density scales as some positive power &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the local gas surface density.&lt;ref name="schmidt59" /&gt; i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{SFR} \propto (\Sigma_{gas})^n&lt;/math&gt;.
In general, the SFR surface density &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma_{SFR})&lt;/math&gt; is in units of solar masses per year per square parsec &lt;math&gt;(M_\odot  ~\textrm{ yr}^{-1} \textrm{ pc}^{-2})&lt;/math&gt; and the gas surface density in grams per square parsec &lt;math&gt;(\textrm{g}~\textrm{pc}^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;.  Using an analysis of gaseous helium and young stars in the solar neighborhood, the local density of [[white dwarfs]] and their [[luminosity function]], and the local helium density, Schmidt suggested a value of &lt;math&gt;n \approx 2&lt;/math&gt; (and very likely between 1 and 3). All of the data used were gathered from the Milky Way, and specifically the solar-neighborhood.

In 1989, [[Robert Kennicutt]] found that the H&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; intensities of every galaxy in a sample of 7 could be fit with the Schmidt law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Binney|first1=James|last2=Merrifield|first2=Michael|title=Galactic Astronomy|date=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-02565-0|pages=524|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he examined the connection between gas density and SFR for nearly 100 nearby galaxies to estimate a value of &lt;math&gt;n = 1.4 \pm 0.15&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kennicutt98" /&gt;

The '''Kármán line''', or '''Karman line''', lies at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|100|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} above [[Earth]]'s [[sea level]] and commonly represents the boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/icare-records/100km-altitude-boundary-for-astronautics|title=The 100 km Boundary for Astronautics|author=Dr. S.

The line is named after [[Theodore von Kármán]] (1881–1963), a [[Hungarian American]] [[engineer]] and [[physicist]], who was active primarily in [[aeronautics]] and [[astronautics]]. He was the first person to calculate that the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] around this altitude becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight, since a vehicle at this altitude would have to travel faster than [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] to derive sufficient [[aerodynamic lift]] to support itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Beth Laura| last=O'Leary|date=2009|title=Handbook of space engineering, archaeology, and heritage
|series=Advances in engineering|pages=84|editors=Ann Garrison Darrin| publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=1-4200-8431-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTwIDun4MroC&amp;pg=PA84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The line is approximately at the [[turbopause]], above which atmospheric gasses are not well-mixed.  The [[mesopause]] [[atmospheric temperature]] minimum has been measured to vary from 85 to 100&amp;nbsp;km, which places the line at or near the bottom of the [[thermosphere]]. 

==Kármán's comments==
In the final chapter of his autobiography Kármán addresses the issue of the edge of [[outer space]]:
:Where space begins… can actually be determined by the speed of the space vehicle and its altitude above the earth. Consider, for instance, the record flight of Captain [[Iven Carl Kincheloe Jr.]] in an [[Bell X-2|X-2 rocket plane]]. Kincheloe flew 2000 miles per hour (3,200 km/h) at 126,000 feet (38,500 m), or 24 miles up. At this altitude and speed, [[aerodynamic lift]] still carries 98 per cent of the weight of the plane, and only two per cent is carried by [[centrifugal force]], or Kepler Force, as space scientists call it. But at 300,000 feet (91,440 m) or 57 miles up, this relationship is reversed because there is no longer any air to contribute lift: only centrifugal force prevails. This is certainly a physical boundary, where [[aerodynamics]] stops and [[astronautics]] begins, and so I thought why should it not also be a jurisdictional boundary? [[Andrew G. Haley|Haley]] has kindly called it the Kármán Jurisdictional Line. Below this line space belongs to each country. Above this level there would be free space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore von Kármán]] with Lee Edson (1967) ''The Wind and Beyond'', page 343&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
An atmosphere does not abruptly end at any given height, but becomes progressively thinner with altitude. Also, depending on how the various layers that make up the space around the [[Earth]] are defined (and depending on whether these layers are considered part of the actual atmosphere), the definition of the edge of space could vary considerably: If one were to consider the [[thermosphere]] and [[exosphere]] part of the atmosphere and not of space, one might have to extend the boundary to space to at least {{convert|10,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level. The Kármán line thus is an arbitrary definition based on the following considerations:

An aircraft only stays aloft if it constantly travels forward relative to the air (airspeed is not dependent on speed relative to ground), so that the wings can generate lift. The thinner the air, the faster the plane must go to generate enough lift to stay up.

The amount of lift required at any given point can be calculated by the lift equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lift+force+equation|title = Lift Coefficient|accessdate = 2015-03-14|website = Wolfram Alpha Computational Knowledge Engine|publisher = Wolfram Alpha LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html|title = The Lift Equation|date = 2014-06-12|accessdate = 2015-03-14|website = Glenn Research Center|publisher = [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|editor-last = Benson|editor-first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \tfrac12\rho v^2 S C_L
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''L'' is the [[lift force]]

:''ρ'' is the [[air density]]

:''v'' is the aircraft's [[True airspeed|speed relative to the air]]

:''S'' is the aircraft's [[planform (aeronautics)|wing area]],

:''C''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[lift coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/liftco.html "The Lift Coefficient"]. Glenn Research Center. NASA. Retrieved May 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lift (''L'') generated is directly proportional to the air density (''ρ''). All other factors remaining unchanged, true airspeed (''v'') must increase to compensate for less air density (''ρ'') at higher altitudes.

An [[orbit]]ing spacecraft only stays in the sky if the centrifugal component of its movement around the Earth is enough to balance the downward pull of [[gravity]]. If it goes slower, the pull of gravity gradually makes its altitude decrease. The required speed is called ''[[orbital speed|orbital velocity]],'' and it varies with the height of the orbit. For the [[International Space Station]], or a space shuttle in [[low Earth orbit]], the orbital velocity is about 27,000&amp;nbsp;km per hour (17,000 miles per hour).

For an airplane flying higher and higher, the increasingly thin air provides less and less [[lift (force)|lift]], requiring increasingly higher speed to create enough lift to hold the airplane up. It eventually reaches an altitude where it must fly so fast to generate lift that it reaches orbital velocity. The Kármán line is the altitude where the speed necessary to aerodynamically support the airplane's full weight equals orbital velocity (assuming wing loading of a typical airplane). In practice, supporting full weight wouldn't be necessary to maintain altitude because the curvature of the Earth adds centrifugal lift as the airplane reaches orbital speed. However, the Karman line definition ignores this effect because orbital velocity is implicitly sufficient to maintain any altitude regardless of atmospheric density. The Karman line is therefore the highest altitude at which orbital speed provides sufficient aerodynamic lift to fly in a straight line that doesn't follow the curvature of the Earth's surface.

Above 100 kilometers the air density is about 1/2,200,000 the density on the surface.&lt;ref name=squire2000&gt;{{citation | first=Tom | last=Squire | date=September 27, 2000 | title=U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 | publisher=[[NASA]] | work=Thermal Protection Systems Expert and Material Properties Database | url=http://tpsx.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-perl/alt.pl | accessdate=2011-10-23 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015062917/http://tpsx.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-perl/alt.pl | archivedate=October 15, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Karman line, the air density ρ is such that

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \tfrac12\rho v_0^2 S C_L = mg
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of a circular orbit at the same altitude in vacuum

:''m'' is the mass of the aircraft

:''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity.

Although the calculated altitude was not exactly 100 km, Kármán proposed that 100 km be the designated boundary to space, because the round number is more memorable, and the calculated altitude varies minutely as certain parameters are varied. An international committee recommended the 100 km line to the FAI, and upon adoption, it became widely accepted as the boundary to space for many purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Schneider walks the Walk [A word about the definition of space]|date=2005-10-21|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/stories/2005/102105_Schneider.html|publisher=''[[NASA]]''|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still no international legal definition of the demarcation between a country's air space and outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NR7mFXCB-wgC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=legal+boundary+of+space&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Q56qiINocX&amp;sig=bP5Ye5YBYytJpikkfp-lUznLJUk&amp;hl=en ''International Law: A Dictionary''], by Boleslaw Adam Boczek; Scarecrow Press, 2005; page 239: "The issue whether it is possible or useful to establish a legal boundary between airspace and outer space has been debated in the doctrine for quite a long time.  . . .  no agreement exists on a fixed airspace – outer space boundary . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hurdle to strictly defining the boundary to space is the dynamic nature of Earth's atmosphere. For example, at an altitude of {{convert|1,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the atmosphere's density can vary by a factor of five, depending on the time of day, time of year, [[Ionosphere#Solar flux|AP magnetic index]], and recent [[Ionosphere#Solar flux|solar flux]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The FAI uses the Kármán line to define the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/9.5.1+FAI+Nav+Glossary+draft.pdf PDF on the FAI website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508042926/http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/9.5.1+FAI+Nav+Glossary+draft.pdf |date=2014-05-08 }}{{Failed verification|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations of the definition==
The expression "'''edge of space'''", is often used (by, for instance, the FAI{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} in some of their publications) to refer to a region below the conventional 100&amp;nbsp;km boundary to space, which is often meant to include substantially lower regions as well. Thus, certain [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] or [[airplane]] flights might be described as "reaching the edge of space". In such statements, "reaching the edge of space" merely refers to going higher than average aeronautical vehicles commonly would.&lt;ref name=wings&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/stories/2005/102105_Wings.html|title=A long-overdue tribute|publisher=NASA|date=2005-10-21|accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/astronaut_worldbook.html |title=World Book @ NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2006-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090504022327/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/astronaut_worldbook.html |archivedate=May 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 [[Andrew G. Haley]] discussed the Kármán line in his book ''Space Law and Government''.&lt;ref name=AGH&gt;[[Andrew G. Haley]] (1963) ''Space Law and Government'', [[Appleton-Century-Crofts]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a chapter on the limits of national [[sovereignty]], he made a survey of major writers’ views.&lt;ref name=AGH/&gt;{{rp|82–96}} He indicated the inherent imprecision of the Line:
:The line represents a [[mean]] or [[median]] measurement. It is comparable to such measures used in the law as [[mean sea level]], [[meander]] line, [[tide]] line; but it is more complex than these. In arriving at the von Kármán jurisdictional line, myriad factors must be considered – other than the factor of aerodynamic lift. These factors have been discussed in a very large body of literature and by a score or more of commentators. They include the physical constitution of the [[air]]; the biological and physiological viability; and still other factors which logically join to establish a point at which air no longer exists and at which [[airspace]] ends.&lt;ref name=AGH/&gt;{{rp|78,9}}

==Alternatives to the definition==
The [[U.S. Air Force]] definition of an [[astronaut]] is a person who has flown higher than {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level]], approximately the line between the [[mesosphere]] and the [[thermosphere]]. [[NASA]] formerly used the FAI's {{convert|100|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} figure, though this was changed in 2005, to eliminate any inconsistency between military personnel and civilians flying in the same vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA - Schneider walks the Walk |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/stories/2005/102105_Schneider.html |website=www.nasa.gov |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; when three veteran NASA [[North American X-15|X-15]] pilots ([[John B. McKay]], [[William H. Dana]] and [[Joseph Albert Walker]]) were retroactively (two [[posthumous award|posthumously]]) awarded their [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]], as they had flown between {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|108|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the 1960s, but at the time had not been recognized as astronauts.&lt;ref name="wings" /&gt; The latter altitude exceeds the modern international definition of the boundary of space.

Two recent papers (J.C. McDowell, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576518308221|title=The edge of space: Revisiting the Karman Line|author=Jonathan C. McDowell|publisher=Acta Astronautica|date=October 2018|accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Gangale, JSD, University of Nebraska-Lincoln&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brill.com/abstract/title/37940 |title=The Non Kármán Line: An Urban Legend of the Space Age|author=Thomas Gangale|accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
advocate that the demarcation of space should be at {{convert|80|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, citing as evidence von Kármán's original notes and calculations (which concluded the boundary should be 270,000&amp;nbsp;ft), plus functional, cultural, physical, technological, mathematical, and historical factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/outer-space-may-have-just-gotten-bit-closer|title=Outer space may have just gotten a bit closer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/63166-outer-space-border-karman-line.html|title=The Edge of Space Just Crept 12 Miles Closer to Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition proposed in [[international law]] discussions defines the lower boundary of space as the lowest perigee attainable by an orbiting space vehicle, but does not specify an altitude.  Due to atmospheric drag, the lowest altitude at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}}, whereas an object can maintain an elliptical orbit with perigee as low as about {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} without propulsion. Above altitudes of approximately {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} the sky is completely black.&lt;ref name=Army&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Environment and Orbital Mechanics|url=https://fas.org/spp/military/docops/army/ref_text/chap5im.htm|publisher=[[United States Army]]|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gibson Factory 030722.jpg|thumb|right|Damage to the Gibson Memphis Showcase following the storm. Damage to the [[FedExForum]] (still under construction) can be seen in the background.]]

The '''Memphis Summer Storm of 2003''' was a severe [[derecho]] event that affected parts of the [[Southern United States]], particularly southwestern [[Tennessee]] and northern [[Mississippi]], including the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] metropolitan area. It left 7&amp;nbsp;people dead and enormous damage across the region.

==Storm==
On July 22, 2003, a progressive derecho with straight-line winds in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;miles per hour (160&amp;nbsp;km/h) struck [[Crittenden County, AR|Crittenden]], [[DeSoto County, MS|DeSoto]], [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette]], and [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby]] Counties, including the city of Memphis.  The storm passed through the area between 6 and 7&amp;nbsp;am.

==Impact==
[[Image:Wikielvis.jpg|thumb|right|A tree uprooted by the derecho.]]Over 300,000 homes, 70% of Shelby County, were left without power in the wake of the storm.  Two individuals were left dead as a direct result of the storm, with several more deaths due to fires caused by unattended candles or generator accidents.

This storm was very similar to the derecho that went through [[Kansas City, Missouri]] in June 1982, as well as [[Great Lakes-Atlantic Coast derecho|one that hit]] [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on July 19, 2006.

According to the respected Ms. Vicky Armstrong at Southwest Tennessee Community College, there were many individuals cutting in line at gas stations because of fears over increased gasoline prices or gasoline shortages.

===Earning colloquial "hurricane" status===

The storm became commonly known in the area as "'''Hurricane [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]'''"&lt;ref&gt;Charlier, Tom; [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CA&amp;p_theme=ca&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_text_search-0=%22hurricane%20elvis%20the%20legwork%22&amp;s_dispstring=hurricane%20elvis%20the%20legwork%20AND%20date(2004)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2004&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no "Hurricane Elvis: The Legwork,"] 2004-07-18, ''The Commercial Appeal'' (Memphis daily paper), accessed 2008-12-26&lt;/ref&gt; as its winds reached the level of a [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|Category 2]] hurricane. As the storm crossed the Mississippi River into Downtown Memphis, a barge recorded an unofficial wind reading of 108&amp;nbsp;mph (174&amp;nbsp;km/h). Coincidentally, the [[National Hurricane Center|National Hurricane Center's]] [[Lists_of_tropical_cyclone_names#North_Atlantic|rotation of tropical cyclone names]] had identified that season's "D" storm, [[Hurricane Danny (2003)|"Danny]]," only two days earlier, thus the region's next real hurricane, [[Hurricane Erika (2003)]], would also start with an "E." 
The National Weather Service refers to the storm as the "Mid South Derecho of 2003".

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Memphis Derecho.JPG|thumb|right|Graphic of Memphis Derecho (courtesy of NOAA)]]It took two weeks to restore power to many of those who had lost it in the storm.  Temperatures reached past 90°F (32°C) leaving many residents unprotected from dangerously hot conditions.  Many Memphians were distressed that though they had survived hurricane-like conditions and weeks without power, little national news coverage was given to the event.  Shelby County Mayor [[A.C. Wharton]] said in a [[CNBC]] interview that he was "Feeling a bit lonely, because it seems that from a national perspective it never happened.  We suffered a 'dry-land hurricane'... yet we see on the national news over in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], they got more coverage on [[Hurricane Claudette (2003)|a hurricane that never did occur]]." In contrast, less than a month later, national news coverage was extensive when [[New York City]] residents were [[2003 North American blackout|left without power for a few hours]].

==FEMA dispute==
In 2009, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] claimed that the city of Memphis owed the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) $2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2009/dec/04/fema-wants-memphis-repay-2-million/&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed that Memphis misspent the money that was originally given to help clean up the city following Hurricane Elvis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12411">'''New physical principles weapons''' are a wide range of weapons or systems created using emerging technologies, like [[Wave Weaponry|wave]], [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]], and genetic weapons.

This definition is similar to "new types of [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons]]" used in documentation from [[United Nations General Assembly]] sessions since 1975 and "[[non-lethal weapon]]s" used by the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).

New types of "[[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons]]" were defined by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="UNODA 1977" /&gt; In 1976, the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] stated that these weapons are based on "qualitatively new principles of action", which can be new due to the nature of the impact, target to be attacked, method of action, or how they are used.&lt;ref name="US State Dept Sov Memo" /&gt; Examples given were [[Sonic weapon|infrasound weapons]] designed to damage internal organs and affect human behavior; [[Ethnic bioweapon|genetic weapon]]s, the use of which would affect the mechanism of heredity; ray weapons capable of affecting blood and intracellular plasma; robotic military equipment; unmanned controlled aircraft; and weapon systems, like aerospace weapon systems, where nuclear weapons are transported by spaceships and thereby more dangerous.&lt;ref name="US State Dept Sov Memo"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve14p2/d210|title=Telegram 4005 From the Mission to the United Nations to the Department of State - UNGA Disarmament: Soviet Memorandum on Disarmament|date=September 29, 1976|website=United States Department of State|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the never-adopted draft treaty of 1975, the proposed language in the United Nations Disarmament Conference classification for "new weapons of mass description"  to be banned included:
* radiological means of the non-explosive type acting with the aid of radioactive materials
* technical means of inflicting radiation injury based on the use of charged or neutral particles to affect biological targets
* infrasonic means using acoustic radiation to affect biological targets
* means using electromagnetic radiation to affect biological targets.&lt;ref name="UNODA 1977"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://unoda-web.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/publications/yearbook/en/EN-YB-VOL-02-1977.pdf |title=The United Nations Disarmament Yearbook: Volume 02: 1977|pages=41, 344|author= Department of Political and Security Council Affairs, United Nations Centre of Disarmament|website=United Nations Disarmament Organization|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nihonium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Nh''' and [[atomic number]] 113. It is extremely [[radioactive]]; its most stable known [[isotope]], nihonium-286, has a [[half-life]] of about 10&amp;nbsp;seconds. In the [[periodic table]], nihonium is a [[transactinide element]] in the [[p-block]]. It is a member of [[period 7 element|period&amp;nbsp;7]] and [[boron group|group 13]] (boron group).

Nihonium was first reported to have been created in 2003 by a Russian–American collaboration at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia, and in 2004 by a team of Japanese scientists at [[Riken]] in [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]], Japan. The confirmation of their claims in the ensuing years involved independent teams of scientists working in the United States, Germany, Sweden, and China, as well as the original claimants in Russia and Japan. In 2015, the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party]] recognised the element and assigned the [[scientific priority|priority]] of the discovery and naming rights for the element to Riken, as it judged that they had demonstrated that they had observed element 113 before the JINR team did so. The Riken team suggested the name ''nihonium'' in 2016, which was approved in the same year. The name comes from the common Japanese name for {{nihongo|Japan|日本|[[Names of Japan#Nihon and Nippon|nihon]]}}.

Very little is known about nihonium, as it has only been made in very small amounts that decay away within seconds. The anomalously long lives of some superheavy nuclides, including some nihonium isotopes, are explained by the "[[island of stability]]" theory. Experiments support the theory, with the half-lives of the confirmed nihonium isotopes increasing from milliseconds to seconds as [[neutron]]s are added and the island is approached. Nihonium has been calculated to have similar properties to its homologues [[boron]], [[aluminium]], [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]]. All but boron are [[post-transition metal]]s, and nihonium is expected to be a post-transition metal as well. It should also show several major differences from them; for example, nihonium should be more stable in the +1 [[oxidation state]] than the +3 state, like thallium, but in the +1 state nihonium should behave more like [[silver]] and [[astatine]] than thallium. Preliminary experiments in 2017 showed that elemental nihonium is not very [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]; its chemistry remains largely unexplored.

== History ==
{{See also|Discoveries of the chemical elements}}

=== Early indications ===
The syntheses of elements [[bohrium|107]] to [[copernicium|112]] were conducted at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, from 1981 to 1996. These elements were made by [[cold fusion]]{{efn|[[Transactinide element]]s, such as nihonium, are produced by [[nuclear fusion]]. These fusion reactions can be divided into "hot" and "cold" fusion, depending on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus produced. "Cold fusion" in the context of superheavy element synthesis is a distinct concept from the idea that nuclear fusion can be achieved under room temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0728(89)80006-3 |title=Electrochemically induced nuclear fusion of deuterium |date=1989 |last1=Fleischmann |first1=Martin |last2=Pons |first2=Stanley |journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry |volume=261 |issue=2 |pages=301–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hot fusion reactions, light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated towards heavy targets ([[actinide]]s), creating compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]]) that may fission, or alternatively emit several (3 to 5) neutrons.&lt;ref name=fusion&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Robert C. |last2=Gäggeler |first2=Heinz W. |last3=Karol |first3=Paul J. |last4=Nakahara |first4=Hiromichi |last5=Vardaci |first5=Emanuele |last6=Vogt |first6=Erich |title=Discovery of the element with atomic number 112 (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=81 |issue=7 |page=1331 |date=2009 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-08-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold fusion reactions use heavier projectiles, typically from the [[period 4 element|fourth period]], and lighter targets, usually [[lead]] and [[bismuth]]. The fused nuclei produced have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20&amp;nbsp;MeV), which decreases the probability that they will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the [[ground state]], they emit only one or two neutrons. Hot fusion produces more neutron-rich products because actinides have the highest neutron-to-proton ratios of any elements, and is currently the only method to produce the superheavy elements from [[flerovium]] (element 114) onwards.&lt;ref name=AM89&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Peter |last=Armbruster |first2=Gottfried |last2=Munzenberg |title=Creating superheavy elements |journal=Scientific American |volume=34 |pages=36–42 |date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} reactions, in which targets made of [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]], which are around the [[nuclear shell model|stable configuration]] of 82 protons, are bombarded with heavy ions of [[period 4 element]]s. This creates fused nuclei with low excitation energies due to the stability of the targets' nuclei, significantly increasing the yield of [[superheavy element]]s. Cold fusion was pioneered by [[Yuri Oganessian]] and his team in 1974 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Soviet Union. Yields from cold fusion reactions were found to decrease significantly with increasing atomic number; the resulting nuclei were severely neutron-deficient and short-lived. The GSI team attempted to synthesise element 113 via cold fusion in 1998 and 2003, bombarding bismuth-209 with [[zinc]]-70, but were unsuccessful both times.&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2016/26/epjconf-NS160-06001.pdf |title=The discovery of elements 107 to 112 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Sigurd |date=2016 |conference=Nobel Symposium NS160 – Chemistry and Physics of Heavy and Superheavy Elements |doi=10.1051/epjconf/201613106001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with this problem, Oganessian and his team at the JINR turned their renewed attention to the older hot fusion technique, in which heavy [[actinide]] targets were bombarded with lighter ions. [[Calcium-48]] was suggested as an ideal projectile, because it is very neutron-rich for a light element (combined with the already neutron-rich actinides) and would minimise the neutron deficiencies of the nuclides produced. Being [[doubly magic]], it would confer benefits in stability to the fused nuclei. In collaboration with the team at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) in [[Livermore, California]], United States, they made an attempt on [[flerovium|element 114]] (which was predicted to be a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]], closing a proton shell, and more stable than element 113).&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;

In 1998, the JINR–LLNL collaboration started their attempt on element 114, bombarding a target of [[plutonium-244]] with ions of calcium-48:&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;

:{{nuclide|plutonium|244}} + {{nuclide|calcium|48}} → &lt;sup&gt;292&lt;/sup&gt;114* → &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;114 + 2 {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;113 + [[electron neutrino|ν&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]]

A single atom was observed which was thought to be the isotope &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;114: the results were published in January 1999.&lt;ref name="99Og01"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oganessian |first1=Yu.

This would have been the first report of a decay chain from an isotope of element 113, but it was not recognised at the time, and the assignment is still uncertain.&lt;ref name=Hofmann2016 /&gt; A similar long-lived activity observed by the JINR team in March 1999 in the &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu + &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca reaction may be due to the electron-capture daughter of &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;114, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;113; this assignment is also tentative.&lt;ref name=EXON /&gt;

While the JINR–LLNL collaboration had been studying fusion reactions with &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, a team of Japanese scientists at the [[Riken]] Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science in [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]], Japan, led by Kōsuke Morita had been studying cold fusion reactions. Morita had previously studied the synthesis of superheavy elements at the JINR before starting his own team at Riken. In 2001, his team confirmed the GSI's discoveries of elements [[hassium|108]], [[darmstadtium|110]], [[roentgenium|111]], and 112. They then made a new attempt on element 113, using the same &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi + &lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;Zn reaction that the GSI had attempted unsuccessfully in 1998. Despite the much lower yield expected than for the JINR's hot fusion technique with calcium-48, the Riken team chose to use cold fusion as the synthesised isotopes would alpha decay to known daughter nuclides and make the discovery much more certain, and would not require the use of radioactive targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGVkkVMgvOg |title=Q &amp; A session |last=Morita |first=Kōsuke |date=5 February 2016 |publisher=The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan |via=YouTube |access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the isotope &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113 expected to be produced in this reaction would decay to the known &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, which had been synthesised in 2000 by a team at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL) in Berkeley.&lt;ref name=JWP /&gt;

The Riken team observed four alpha decays from &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113, creating a decay chain passing through &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Rg, &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Mt, and &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh before terminating with the spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Db.&lt;ref name=04Mo01 /&gt; The decay data they observed for the alpha decay of &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh matched the 2000 data, lending support for their claim.

=== Road to confirmation ===
When the discovery of a new element is claimed, the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] (JWP) of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) assembles to examine the claims according to their criteria for the discovery of a new element, and decides [[scientific priority]] and naming rights for the elements. According to the JWP criteria, a discovery must demonstrate that the element has an atomic number different from all previously observed values. It should also preferably be repeated by other laboratories, although this requirement has been waived where the data is of very high quality. Such a demonstration must establish properties, either physical or chemical, of the new element and establish that they are those of a previously unknown element. The main techniques used to demonstrate atomic number are cross-reactions (creating claimed nuclides as parents or daughters of other nuclides produced by a different reaction) and anchoring decay chains to known daughter nuclides. For the JWP, priority in confirmation takes precedence over the date of the original claim. Both teams set out to confirm their results by these methods.&lt;ref name=Karol /&gt;

The two chains with bold-bordered nuclides were accepted by the JWP as evidence for the discoveries of element 113 and its parents, elements 115 and 117.]]

==== 2004–2008 ====
In June 2004 and again in December 2005, the JINR–LLNL collaboration strengthened their claim for the discovery of element 113 by conducting chemical experiments on &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;[[Dubnium|Db]], the final [[decay product]] of &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;115. This was valuable as none of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known, so that their claim was not supported by any previous experimental data, and chemical experimentation would strengthen the case for their claim, since the chemistry of dubnium is known. &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Db was successfully identified by extracting the final decay products, measuring [[spontaneous fission]] (SF) activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a [[group 5 element]] (dubnium is known to be in group 5).&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;&lt;ref name=e115 /&gt; Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Db which lends support to the assignment of the parent and [[daughter isotope|daughter nuclei]] to elements 115 and 113 respectively.&lt;ref name=e115&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemical identification of dubnium as a decay product of element 115 produced in the reaction &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca+&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am |first1=S.

In November and December 2004, the Riken team studied the &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Tl + &lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;Zn reaction, aiming the zinc beam onto a [[thallium]] rather than a bismuth target, in an effort to directly produce &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Rg in a cross-bombardment as it is the immediate daughter of &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113. The reaction was unsuccessful, as the thallium target was [[Strength of materials|physically weak]] compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets, and it deteriorated significantly and became non-uniform in thickness. The reasons for this weakness are unknown, given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth.&lt;ref name=Morimoto2016 /&gt; The Riken team then repeated the original &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi + &lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;Zn reaction and produced a second atom of &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113 in April 2005&lt;!--the 2nd--&gt;, with a decay chain that again terminated with the spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Db. The decay data were slightly different from those of the first chain: this could have been because an [[alpha particle]] escaped from the detector without depositing its full energy, or because some of the intermediate decay products were formed in [[metastable state|metastable isomeric states]].&lt;ref name=JWP /&gt;

In 2006, a team at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in [[Lanzhou]], China, investigated the &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am + &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg reaction, producing four atoms of &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh. All four chains started with an alpha decay to &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Db; three chains ended there with spontaneous fission, as in the &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113 chains observed at Riken, while the remaining one continued via another alpha decay to &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Lr, as in the &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh chains observed at LBNL.&lt;ref name=Karol /&gt;

In June 2006, the JINR–LLNL collaboration claimed to have synthesised a new isotope of element 113 directly by bombarding a [[neptunium]]-237 target with accelerated calcium-48 nuclei:

:{{nuclide|link=no|Neptunium|237}} + {{nuclide|link=no|Calcium|48}} → &lt;sup&gt;285&lt;/sup&gt;113* → &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;113 + 3 {{SubatomicParticle|link=no|neutron}}

Two atoms of &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;113 were detected. The aim of this experiment had been to synthesise the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;113 and &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;113 that would fill in the gap between isotopes produced via hot fusion (&lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;113 and &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;113) and cold fusion (&lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113). After five alpha decays, these nuclides would reach known isotopes of [[lawrencium]], assuming that the decay chains were not terminated prematurely by spontaneous fission. The first decay chain ended in fission after four alpha decays, presumably originating from &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Db or its electron-capture daughter &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Rf. Spontaneous fission was not observed in the second chain even after four alpha decays. A fifth alpha decay in each chain could have been missed, since &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Db can theoretically undergo alpha decay, in which case the first decay chain would have ended at the known &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Lr or &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;No and the second might have continued to the known long-lived &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Md, which has a half-life of 51.5&amp;nbsp;days, longer than the duration of the experiment: this would explain the lack of a spontaneous fission event in this chain. In the absence of direct detection of the long-lived alpha decays, these interpretations remain unconfirmed, and there is still no known link between any superheavy nuclides produced by hot fusion and the well-known main body of the chart of nuclides.&lt;ref name=07Og01&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nrv.jinr.ru/pdf_file/PhysRevC_76_011601.pdf |title=Synthesis of the isotope &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;113 in the &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np + &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca fusion reaction |last=Oganessian |first=Yu.

The JWP published its report on elements 113–116 and 118 in 2011. It recognised the JINR–LLNL collaboration as having discovered elements 114 and 116, but did not accept either team's claim to element 113 and did not accept the JINR–LLNL claims to elements 115 and 118. The JINR–LLNL claim to elements 115 and 113 had been founded on chemical identification of their daughter dubnium, but the JWP objected that current theory could not distinguish between [[group 4 element|group 4]] and group 5 elements by their chemical properties with enough confidence to allow this assignment.&lt;ref name=JWP&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barber, Robert C. |author2=Karol, Paul J |author3=Nakahara, Hiromichi |author4=Vardaci, Emanuele |author5=Vogt, Erich W. |title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers greater than or equal to 113 (IUPAC Technical Report) |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-10-05-01 |journal=Pure Appl.

=== Approval of discoveries ===
In December 2015, the conclusions of a new JWP report were published by IUPAC in a press release, in which element 113 was awarded to Riken; elements 115, 117, and 118 were awarded to the collaborations involving the JINR.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost /&gt; A joint 2016 announcement by IUPAC and IUPAP had been scheduled to coincide with the publication of the JWP reports, but IUPAC alone decided on an early release because the news of Riken being awarded credit for element 113 had been leaked to Japanese newspapers.&lt;ref name=McKellar /&gt; For the first time in history, a team of Asian physicists would name a new element.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/26/element-113-created-synthetically-japan_n_1916253.html |title=Element 113: Ununtrium Reportedly Synthesised In Japan |publisher=''Huffington Post'' |date=September 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JINR considered the awarding of element 113 to Riken unexpected, citing their own 2003 production of elements 115 and 113, and pointing to the precedents of elements [[lawrencium|103]], [[rutherfordium|104]], and [[dubnium|105]] where IUPAC had awarded joint credit to the JINR and LBNL. They stated that they respected IUPAC's decision, but reserved determination of their position for the official publication of the JWP reports.&lt;ref name=reaction&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jinr.ru/posts/discovery-of-the-new-chemical-elements-with-numbers-113-115-117-and-118-2/ |title=Discovery of the new chemical elements with numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118 |date=6 January 2016 |publisher=[[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] |access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full JWP reports were published in January 2016. The JWP recognised the discovery of element 113, assigning priority to Riken. They noted that while the individual decay energies of each nuclide in the decay chain of &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113 were inconsistent, their sum was now confirmed to be consistent, strongly suggesting that the initial and final states in &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113 and its daughter &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Db were the same for all three events. The decay of &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Db to &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Lr and &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Md was previously known, firmly anchoring the decay chain of &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113 to known regions of the chart of nuclides. The JWP considered that the JINR–LLNL collaborations of 2004 and 2007, producing element 113 as the daughter of element 115, did not meet the discovery criteria as they had not convincingly determined the atomic numbers of their nuclides through cross-bombardments, which were considered necessary since their decay chains were not anchored to previously known nuclides. They also considered that the previous JWP's concerns over their chemical identification of the dubnium daughter had not been adequately addressed. The JWP recognised the JINR–LLNL–ORNL–Vanderbilt collaboration of 2010 as having discovered elements 117 and 115, and accepted that element 113 had been produced as their daughter, but did not give this work shared credit.&lt;ref name=Karol&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karol |first=Paul J. |last2=Barber |first2=Robert C. |last3=Sherrill |first3=Bradley M. |last4=Vardaci |first4=Emanuele |last5=Yamazaki |first5=Toshimitsu |date=22 December 2015 |title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers Z = 113, 115 and 117 (IUPAC Technical Report) |url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.2016.88.issue-1-2/pac-2015-0502/pac-2015-0502.pdf |journal=Pure Appl.

After the publication of the JWP reports, Sergey Dimitriev, the lab director of the Flerov lab at the JINR where the discoveries were made, remarked that he was happy with IUPAC's decision, mentioning the time Riken spent on their experiment and their good relations with Morita, who had learnt the basics of synthesising superheavy elements at the JINR.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/what-it-takes-to-make-a-new-element/1017677.article |title=What it takes to make a new element |last=Chapman |first=Kit |date=30 November 2016 |magazine=Chemistry World |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reaction /&gt;

The sum argument advanced by the JWP in the approval of the discovery of element 113 was later criticised in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI, as it is only valid if no [[gamma decay]] or [[internal conversion]] takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;113 decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility. If this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters becomes a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have different half-lives: for example, the ground state of &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;Ta has a half-life of hours, but an excited state [[isotopes of tantalum|&lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta]] has never been observed to decay. This study found reason to doubt and criticise the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of elements 115 and 117, but the data from Riken for element 113 was found to be congruent, and the data from the JINR team for elements 115 and 113 to probably be so, thus endorsing the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forsberg |first=U. |last2=Rudolph |first2=D. |first3=C. |last3=Fahlander |first4=P. |last4=Golubev |first5=L.

=== Naming ===
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], nihonium should be known as ''eka-thallium''. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ''ununtrium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uut''),&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chatt, J. |journal=Pure Appl.

The recommendations were widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, but were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it "element 113", with the symbol of ''E113'', ''(113)'', or even simply ''113''.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt;

== Isotopes ==
{{Main|Isotopes of nihonium}}
Nihonium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesised in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of nihonium have been reported with atomic masses 278, 282–287, and 290 (&lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;Nh are unconfirmed); they all decay through alpha decay to isotopes of [[roentgenium]];&lt;ref name=nuclidetable&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reCenter.jsp?z=113&amp;n=173 |title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides |publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory |author=Sonzogni, Alejandro |location=National Nuclear Data Center |accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been indications that nihonium-284 can also decay by [[electron capture]] to [[copernicium]]-284.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forsberg |first1=Ulrika |title=Recoil-α-fission and recoil-α–α-fission events observed in the reaction 48Ca + 243Am |journal=[[Nuclear Physics (journal)|Nuclear Physics A]] |date=September 2016 |volume=953 |pages=117–138 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2016.04.025 |url=https://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/1502.03030.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stability and half-lives ===
[[File:Island of Stability derived from Zagrebaev.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A chart of heavy nuclides with their known and predicted half-lives (known nuclides shown with borders). Nihonium (row 113) is expected to be within the "island of stability" (white circle) and thus its nuclei are slightly more stable than would otherwise be predicted; the known nihonium isotopes are too neutron-poor to be within the island.]]
The stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after [[curium]], element 96, whose half-life is over ten thousand times longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above [[mendelevium|101]] undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours: this is because of the ever-increasing [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb repulsion]] of protons, so that the [[strong nuclear force]] cannot hold the nucleus together against [[spontaneous fission]] for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilising factors, elements with more than [[lawrencium|103 protons]] should not exist. Researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed [[nuclear shell model|nuclear shells]] around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, and create an "[[island of stability]]" containing nuclides with half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. The existence of the island is still unproven, but the existence of the [[superheavy element]]s (including nihonium) confirms that the stabilising effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia |first1=Douglas M. |last1=Considine |first2=Glenn D. |last2=Considine |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |date=1994 |edition=8th |isbn=978-1-4757-6918-0 |page=623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=retro /&gt;

All nihonium isotopes are unstable and radioactive; the heavier nihonium isotopes are more stable than the lighter ones, as they are closer to the centre of the island. The most stable known nihonium isotope, &lt;sup&gt;286&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, is also the heaviest; it has a half-life of 8&amp;nbsp;seconds. The isotope &lt;sup&gt;285&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, as well as the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, have also been reported to have half-lives of over a second. The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Nh have half-lives of 1 and 0.1&amp;nbsp;seconds respectively. The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;milliseconds: &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;Nh has a half-life of 70&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, and &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, the lightest known nihonium isotope, is also the shortest-lived, with a half-life of 1.4&amp;nbsp;milliseconds. This rapid increase in the half-lives near the closed neutron shell at ''N'' = 184 is seen in roentgenium, copernicium, and nihonium (elements 111 through 113), where each extra neutron so far multiplies the half-life by a factor of 5 to 20.&lt;ref name=retro&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oganessian |first1=Yu.

[[File:Valence atomic energy levels for Tl and Nh.svg|thumb|Atomic energy levels of outermost s, p, and d electrons of thallium and nihonium&lt;ref name="Stysziński" /&gt;]]
Nihonium is the first member of the 7p series of elements and the heaviest [[boron group|group 13]] element on the periodic table, below [[boron]], [[aluminium]], [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]]. All the group 13 elements except boron are metals, and nihonium is expected to follow suit. Nihonium is predicted to show many differences from its lighter homologues. The major reason for this is the [[spin–orbit interaction|spin–orbit (SO) interaction]], which is especially strong for the [[superheavy element]]s, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities close to the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name="Thayer pp63-67"/&gt; In relation to nihonium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels&lt;!--|level is an important word.

Computational chemists see the split as a change of the second, [[azimuthal quantum number]] ''l'', from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more and less stabilised parts of the 7p subshell, respectively.&lt;ref name="Thayer pp63-67"/&gt;{{efn|The quantum number corresponds to the letter in the electron orbital name: 0 to s, 1 to p, 2 to d, etc.}} For theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; The first ionisation energy of nihonium is expected to be 7.306&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]], the highest among the metals of group 13.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; Similar subshell splitting should exist for the 6d electron levels, with four being 6d&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; and six being 6d&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt;. Both these levels are raised to be close in energy to the 7s ones, high enough to possibly be chemically active. This would allow for the possibility of exotic nihonium compounds without lighter group 13 analogues.&lt;ref name="Faegri" /&gt;

Periodic trends would predict nihonium to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one [[period (periodic table)|period]] further down the periodic table, but calculations suggest nihonium has an atomic radius of about 170&amp;nbsp;pm, the same as that of thallium, due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of its 7s and 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals. Thus nihonium is expected to be much denser than thallium, with a predicted density of about 16 to 18&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; compared to thallium's 11.85&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, since nihonium atoms are heavier than thallium atoms but have the same volume.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stysziński" /&gt; Bulk nihonium is expected to have a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure, like thallium.&lt;ref name=NhFl /&gt; The melting and boiling points of nihonium have been predicted to be 430&amp;nbsp;°C and 1100&amp;nbsp;°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;

=== Chemical ===
The chemistry of nihonium is expected to be very different from that of thallium. This difference stems from the spin–orbit splitting of the 7p shell, which results in nihonium being between two relatively inert closed-shell elements ([[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]]), an unprecedented situation in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=Zaitsevskii /&gt; Nihonium is expected to be less reactive than thallium, because of the greater stabilisation and resultant chemical inactivity of the 7s subshell in nihonium compared to the 6s subshell in thallium.&lt;ref name=BFricke /&gt; The [[standard electrode potential]] for the Nh&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Nh couple is predicted to be 0.6&amp;nbsp;V, so nihonium should be a rather [[noble metal]], as unreactive as [[rhodium]] and [[ruthenium]].&lt;ref name=BFricke /&gt;

The metallic group 13 elements are typically found in two [[oxidation state]]s: +1 and +3. The former results from the involvement of only the single p electron in bonding, and the latter results in the involvement of all three valence electrons, two in the s-subshell and one in the p-subshell. Going down the group, bond energies decrease and the +3 state becomes less stable, as the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the s-electrons. Hence, for aluminium and gallium +3 is the most stable state, but +1 gains importance for indium and by thallium it becomes more stable than the +3 state. Nihonium is expected to continue this trend and have +1 as its most stable oxidation state.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

The simplest possible nihonium compound is the monohydride, NhH. The bonding is provided by the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; electron of nihonium and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The SO interaction causes the [[binding energy]] of nihonium monohydride to be reduced by about 1&amp;nbsp;eV&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; and the nihonium–hydrogen bond length to decrease as the bonding 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is relativistically contracted. This is unique among the 7p element monohydrides; all the others have relativistic expansion of the bond length instead of contraction.&lt;ref name=hydride&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=112 |issue=6 |year=2000 |title=Spin–orbit effects on the transactinide p-block element monohydrides MH (M=element 113–118) |first1=Young-Kyu |last1=Han |first2=Cheolbeom |last2=Bae |first3=Sang-Kil |last3=Son |first4=Yoon Sup |last4=Lee |doi=10.1063/1.480842 |page=2684 |bibcode=2000JChPh.112.2684H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another effect of the SO interaction is that the Nh–H bond is expected to have significant [[pi bond]]ing character (side-on orbital overlap), unlike the almost pure [[sigma bond]]ing (head-on orbital overlap) in thallium monohydride (TlH).&lt;ref name=Seth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seth |first1=Michael |last2=Schwerdtfeger |first2=Peter |first3=Knut |last3=Fægri |date=1999 |title=The chemistry of superheavy elements.

In contrast to Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which forms the strongly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] hydroxide ([[thallium(I) hydroxide|TlOH]]) in solution, the Nh&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation should instead hydrolyse all the way to the [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] oxide Nh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which would be soluble in aqueous ammonia and weakly soluble in water.&lt;ref name=BFricke /&gt;

The [[adsorption]] behaviour of nihonium on [[gold]] surfaces in thermochromatographical experiments is expected to be closer to that of [[astatine]] than that of thallium. The destabilisation of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; subshell effectively leads to a valence shell closing at the 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;7p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration rather than the expected 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;7p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; configuration with its stable octet. As such, nihonium, like astatine, can be considered to be one p-electron short of a closed valence shell. Hence, even though nihonium is in group 13, it has several properties similar to the group 17 elements. ([[Tennessine]] in group 17 has some group-13-like properties, as it has three valence electrons outside the 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;7p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; closed shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jinr.ru/posts/25597/ |title=Quantum chemical modelling of electronic structure of nihonium and astatine compounds |last=Demidov |first=Yu. A. |date=15 February 2017 |publisher=Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions |access-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Nihonium is expected to be able to gain an electron to attain this closed-shell configuration, forming the −1 oxidation state like the [[halogen]]s ([[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and astatine). This state should be more stable than it is for thallium as the SO splitting of the 7p subshell is greater than that for the 6p subshell.&lt;ref name="Thayer pp63-67"/&gt; Nihonium should be the most [[electronegativity|electronegative]] of the metallic group 13 elements,&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; even more electronegative than tennessine, the period 7 congener of the halogens: in the compound NhTs, the negative charge is expected to be on the nihonium atom rather than the tennessine atom.&lt;ref name="Stysziński"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Why do we Need Relativistic Computational Methods? |title=Relativistic Methods for Chemists |last=Stysziński |first=Jacek |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9975-5_3 |date=2010 |pages=139–146 |isbn=978-1-4020-9974-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The −1 oxidation should be more stable for nihonium than for tennessine.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nash |first1=Clinton S. |last2=Bursten |first2=Bruce E. |date=1999 |title=Spin−Orbit Effects, VSEPR Theory, and the Electronic Structures of Heavy and Superheavy Group IVA Hydrides and Group VIIIA Tetrafluorides.

Significant 6d involvement is expected in the Nh–Au bond, although it is expected to be more unstable than the Tl–Au bond and entirely due to magnetic interactions.

The bonding in the lighter NhX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules can be considered as that of a linear {{chem|NhX|2|+}} species (similar to [[mercury(II) fluoride|HgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] or {{chem|AuF|2|-}}) with an additional Nh–X bond involving the 7p orbital of nihonium perpendicular to the other two ligands. These compounds are all expected to be highly unstable towards the loss of an X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and reduction to nihonium(I):&lt;ref name=Seth /&gt;
:NhX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NhX + X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Nihonium thus continues the trend down group 13 of reduced stability of the +3 oxidation state, as all five of these compounds have lower reaction energies than the unknown thallium(III) iodide.{{efn|The compound with stoichiometry [[thallium triiodide|TlI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] is a thallium(I) compound involving the [[triiodide]] anion, {{chem|I|3|-}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Die Kristallstrukturen von Rubidiumtriiodid und Thalliumtriiodid |last1=Tebbe |first1=K.-F. |last2=Georgy |first2=U. |journal=Acta Crystallographica C |date=December 1986 |volume=C42 |issue=12 |pages=1675–1678 |doi=10.1107/S0108270186090972}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The +3 state is stabilised for thallium in anionic complexes such as {{chem|TlI|4|-}}, and the presence of a possible vacant coordination site on the lighter T-shaped nihonium trihalides is expected to allow a similar stabilisation of {{chem|NhF|4|-}} and perhaps {{chem|NhCl|4|-}}.&lt;ref name=Seth /&gt;

The +5 oxidation state is unknown for all lighter group 13 elements: calculations predict that nihonium pentahydride (NhH&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and pentafluoride (NhF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) should have a [[square pyramidal molecular geometry]], but also that both would be highly thermodynamically unstable to loss of an X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and reduction to nihonium(III). Despite its instability, the possible existence of nihonium pentafluoride is entirely due to relativistic effects allowing the 6d electrons to participate in the bonding. Again, some stabilisation is expected for anionic complexes, such as {{chem|NhF|6|-}}. The structures of the nihonium trifluoride and pentafluoride molecules are the same as those for [[chlorine trifluoride]] and [[chlorine pentafluoride|pentafluoride]].&lt;ref name=Seth /&gt;

== Experimental chemistry ==
The chemical characteristics of nihonium have yet to be determined unambiguously.&lt;ref name=Eichler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eichler |first=Robert |date=2013 |title=First foot prints of chemistry on the shore of the Island of Superheavy Elements |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=420 |issue=1 |pages=012003 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/420/1/012003 |bibcode=2013JPhCS.420a2003E |arxiv=1212.4292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Düllmann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Düllmann |first1=Christoph E. |date=2012 |title=Superheavy elements at GSI: a broad research program with element 114 in the focus of physics and chemistry |journal=Radiochimica Acta |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |doi=10.1524/ract.2011.1842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, &lt;sup&gt;285&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, and &lt;sup&gt;286&lt;/sup&gt;Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation.&lt;ref name=Eichler /&gt; From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the JINR to determine the [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of nihonium. The isotope &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Nh was investigated, made as the daughter of &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Mc produced in the &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am+&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca reaction. The nihonium atoms were synthesised in a recoil chamber and then carried along [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE) capillaries at 70&amp;nbsp;°C by a carrier gas to the gold-covered detectors. About ten to twenty atoms of &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Nh were produced, but none of these atoms were registered by the detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the [[noble gas]]es  (and thus diffused away too quickly to be detected) or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the PTFE capillaries.&lt;ref name=Eichler /&gt; Formation of the hydroxide NhOH should ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide is expected to be more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more [[water vapour]] into the carrier gas. It seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favoured, so the longer-lived isotopes &lt;sup&gt;285&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and &lt;sup&gt;286&lt;/sup&gt;Nh were considered more desirable for future experiments.&lt;ref name=Eichler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–28 |isbn=978-3-642-37466-1 |date=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 experiment at the JINR, producing &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and &lt;sup&gt;285&lt;/sup&gt;Nh via the &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am+&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca reaction as the daughters of &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Mc and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, avoided this problem by removing the quartz surface, using only PTFE. No nihonium atoms were observed after chemical separation, implying an unexpectedly large retention of nihonium atoms on PTFE surfaces. This experimental result for the interaction limit of nihonium atoms with a PTFE surface {{nowrap|(−Δ''H''{{su|p=PTFE|b=''ads''}}(Nh)&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;45&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol)}} disagrees significantly with previous theory, which expected a lower value of 14.00&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. This suggests that the nihonium species involved in the previous experiment was likely not elemental nihonium but rather nihonium hydroxide, and that high-temperature techniques such as vacuum [[chromatography]] would be necessary to further probe the behaviour of elemental nihonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aksenov |first1=Nikolay V. |last2=Steinegger |first2=Patrick |first3=Farid Sh. |last3=Abdullin |first4=Yury V. |last4=Albin |first5=Gospodin A. |last5=Bozhikov |first6=Viktor I. |last6=Chepigin |first7=Robert |last7=Eichler |first8=Vyacheslav Ya. |last8=Lebedev |first9=Alexander Sh. |last9=Mamudarov |first10=Oleg N. |last10=Malyshev |first11=Oleg V. |last11=Petrushkin |first12=Alexander N. |last12=Polyakov |first13=Yury A. |last13=Popov |first14=Alexey V. |last14=Sabel'nikov |first15=Roman N. |last15=Sagaidak |first16=Igor V. |last16=Shirokovsky |first17=Maksim V. |last17=Shumeiko |first18=Gennadii Ya. |last18=Starodub |first19=Yuri S. |last19=Tsyganov |first20=Vladimir K. |last20=Utyonkov |first21=Alexey A. |last21=Voinov |first22=Grigory K. |last22=Vostokin |first23=Alexander |last23=Yeremin |first24=Sergey N. |last24=Dmitriev |date=July 2017 |title=On the volatility of nihonium (Nh, Z = 113) |journal=The European Physical Journal A |volume=53 |issue=158 |pages=158 |doi=10.1140/epja/i2017-12348-8 |bibcode=2017EPJA...53..158A}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bromine]] saturated with [[boron tribromide]] has been suggested as a carrier gas for experiments on nihonium chemistry; this oxidises nihonium's lighter congener thallium to thallium(III), providing an avenue to investigate the oxidation states of nihonium, similar to earlier experiments done on the bromides of group 5 elements, including the superheavy [[dubnium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tereshatov |first1=E.

{{other uses2|Gyre}}

[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|300px|right|The five major ocean gyres]]
In [[oceanography]], a '''gyre''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|aɪər}}) is any large system of circulating [[ocean current]]s, particularly those involved with large [[wind]] movements. Gyres are caused by the [[Coriolis effect]]; planetary [[vorticity]] along with horizontal and vertical friction, determine the circulation patterns from the ''[[wind stress]] [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]'' ([[torque]]).&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann, B. and the Open University (1998) ''Ocean circulation'', Oxford University Press: Page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''gyre'' can be used to refer to any type of [[vortex]] in the [[air]] or the sea, even one that is man-made, but it is most commonly used in [[oceanography]] to refer to the major [[ocean]] systems.

== Major gyres ==
The following are the five most notable gyres:&lt;ref name="SIO210slides"&gt;[http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~ltalley/sio210/Wind_circulation_NAtl_SHem/lecture_natl_shem.htm The five most notable gyres] PowerPoint Presentation&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Indian Ocean Gyre]] (generally flowing counter-clockwise)
* [[North Atlantic Gyre]]
* [[North Pacific Gyre]]
* [[South Atlantic Gyre]]
* [[South Pacific Gyre]]

== Other gyres ==

=== Tropical gyres ===
[[File:Currents.svg|thumb|250px|right|All of the world's larger gyres]]

Tropical gyres are less unified and tend to be mostly east-west with minor north-south extent.
* Atlantic Equatorial Current System (two counter-rotating circulations)
* Pacific Equatorial Current System
* Indian Monsoon Gyres (two counter-rotating circulations in northern Indian Ocean)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/ocean/BedfordBasin/Papers/Longhurst1998/Provinces/BGCP_table.htm Indian Monsoon Gyres]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subtropical gyres ===
The center of a subtropical gyre is a high pressure zone. Circulation around the high pressure is clockwise in the [[northern hemisphere]] and counterclockwise in the [[southern hemisphere]], due to the [[Coriolis effect]]. The high pressure in the center is due to the westerly winds on the northern side of the gyre and easterly trade winds on the southern side. These cause frictional surface currents towards the latitude at the center of the gyre.

This build-up of water in the center creates flow towards the equator in the upper {{convert|1000|to|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the ocean, through rather complex dynamics. This flow is returned towards the pole in an intensified western [[boundary current]]. The boundary current of the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] is the [[Gulf Stream]], of the [[North Pacific Gyre]] the [[Kuroshio Current]], of the [[South Atlantic Gyre]] the [[Brazil Current]], of the [[South Pacific Gyre]] the [[East Australian Current]], and of the [[Indian Ocean Gyre]] the [[Agulhas Current]].

=== Subpolar gyres ===
&lt;!-- [[Subpolar gyre]] redirects to this section --&gt;
Subpolar gyres form at high latitudes (around [[60th parallel (disambiguation)|60°]]). Circulation of surface wind and ocean water is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, around a [[low-pressure area]], such as the persistent [[Aleutian Low]] and the [[Icelandic Low]]. Surface currents generally move outward from the center of the system. This drives the [[Ekman transport]], which creates an [[upwelling]] of nutrient-rich water from the lower depths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanmotion.org/html/background/wind-driven-surface.htm Wind Driven Surface Currents: Gyres]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subpolar circulation in the southern hemisphere is dominated by the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], due to the lack of large landmasses breaking up the [[Southern Ocean]]. There are minor gyres in the [[Weddell Sea]] and the [[Ross Sea]], the [[Weddell Gyre]] and [[Ross Gyre]], which circulate in a clockwise direction.&lt;ref name="SIO210slides"/&gt;

== Climate change ==
Recently, stronger winds, especially the [[Subtropical ridge|subtropical trade winds]] in the [[Pacific]] ocean have provided a mechanism  for vertical [[ocean heat content|heat distribution]]. The effects are changes in the [[ocean current]]s, increasing the [[Thermohaline circulation#Movement of thermohaline circulation|subtropical overturning]], which are also related to the [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] phenomena. Depending on natural variability, during La Niña years around 30% more heat from the upper ocean layer is transported into the deeper ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Distinctive climate signals in reanalysis of global ocean heat content |year = 2013 | url= http://www.rmets.org/weather-and-climate/climate/has-global-warming-stalled | author = Balmaseda, Trenberth &amp; Källén | doi=  10.1002/grl.50382 |bibcode = 2013GeoRL..40.1754B | volume=40 |issue = 9 | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | pages=1754–1759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies in recent years, found a [[Multi-decadal oscillation|multidecadal]] increase in [[ocean heat content|OHC]] of the deep and upper ocean regions and attribute the heat uptake to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A review of global ocean temperature observations: Implications for ocean heat content estimates and climate change | year = 2013 | author = Abraham| doi= 10.1002/rog.20022 |bibcode = 2013RvGeo..51..450A |display-authors=etal | volume=51 | issue = 3 | journal=Reviews of Geophysics | pages=450–483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plasma channel''' is a conductive channel of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A plasma channel can be formed in these ways:
*With a high-powered [[laser]] that operates at a certain frequency that will provide enough energy for an atmospheric gas to break into its [[ion]]s, or form a plasma, such as in a [[Laser-Induced Plasma Channel]], for example in an [[electrolaser]].
*With a voltage higher than the dielectric breakdown voltage applied across a [[dielectric]], and [[dielectric breakdown]] occurs.
A plasma channel has a low [[electrical resistance]] and, once formed, will permit continuous current flow if the energy source that heats the plasma can be maintained. Unlike a normal electrical conductor, the resistance (and voltage drop) across an unconfined plasma channel decreases with increasing current flow, a property called [[negative resistance]]. As a result, an [[electric spark]] that initially required a very high voltage to initiate avalanche breakdown within the insulating gas will rapidly evolve into a hot, low-voltage [[electric arc]] if the electrical power source can continue to deliver sufficient power to the arc. Plasma channels tend to self constrict (see [[plasma pinch]]) due to [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces stemming from the current flowing through the plasma.

On Earth plasma channels are most frequently encountered in [[lightning]] storms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">A '''plateau''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a part of its [[domain of a function|domain]] where the function has constant value.

More formally, let ''U'', ''V'' be [[topological space]]s. A '''plateau''' for a  function ''f'': ''U'' → ''V'' is a [[path-connected]] set of points ''P'' of ''U'' such that for some ''y'' we have
:''f''&amp;nbsp;(''p'') = ''y''
for all ''p'' in ''P''.

Plateaus can be observed in mathematical models as well as natural systems. In nature, plateaus can be observed in physical, chemical and biological systems. An example of an observed plateau in the natural world is in the tabulation of biodiversity of life through time.

A '''plug-in hybrid electric vehicle''' (PHEV) is a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] whose [[Electric-vehicle battery|battery]] can be recharged by plugging it into an external source of [[electric power]], as well by its on-board engine and generator. Most PHEVs are passenger [[car]]s, but there are also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, motorcycles, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], and military vehicles.

Similarly to [[battery electric vehicle|all-electric vehicle]]s, plug-in hybrids displace emissions from the car tailpipe to the generators powering the electricity grid. These generators may be renewable, or may have lower emission than an internal combustion engine. Charging the battery from the grid can cost less than using the on-board engine, helping to reduce operating cost. 

Mass-produced plug-in hybrids were available to the public in China and the United States in 2010.&lt;ref name=GCC0310/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edmunds310/&gt;&lt;ref name=Volt1stDelivery/&gt; By the end of 2016, there were over 30 models of [[series production|series-production]] highway legal plug-in hybrids for retail sales. Plug-in hybrid cars are available mainly in the United States, Canada, [[Western Europe]], Japan, and China. Top-selling models were the [[Chevrolet Volt family]], the [[Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV]], and the [[Toyota Prius PHV]].&lt;ref name=Top10PEVs2016&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hybridcars.com/tesla-model-s-is-worlds-best-selling-plug-in-car-for-second-year-in-a-row/ |title=Tesla Model S Is World’s Best-Selling Plug-in Car For Second Year In A Row | first= Jeff | last=Cobb | website= HybridCars.com | date=2017-01-26 |accessdate=2017-01-26}} ''See also detailed 2016 sales and cumulative global sales in the two graphs.''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016|12}}, the global stock of plug-in hybrid cars totaled almost 800,000 units, out of over two million light-duty plug-in electric cars on the world roads at the end of 2016.&lt;ref name=Global2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Global2mi/&gt; {{As of|2015|12}}, the United States ranked as the world's largest plug-in hybrid car market with a stock of 193,770 units, followed by China with 86,580 vehicles, the Netherlands with 78,160, Japan with 55,470 units, and the UK with 28,250.&lt;ref name=Outlook2016/&gt;

A plug-in hybrid's all-electric range is designated by PHEV-''[miles]'' or PHEV''[kilometers]''km in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone. For example, a PHEV-20 can travel twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) without using its combustion engine, so it may also be designated as a PHEV32km.&lt;ref name="reduct"&gt;James, W. (September 2006) [http://www.rise.org.au/pubs/Alt_Trans_Energ_Conf_WA_20060912.pdf "Large Oil and GHG Reductions with Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles"] ''Alternative Transport Energies Conference'' (Perth, Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For these cars to be battery operated, they go through charging processes that use different currents. These currents are known as Alternating Current (AC) used for on board chargers and Direct Current (DC) used for external charging.&lt;ref name=Tilsley-2018-04-30&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tilsley |first1=Rachelle |title=What is the difference between AC and DC Charging? |url=https://charge.net.nz/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-ac-and-dc-charging/ |website=Electric Vehicle Charging Network |date=2017-03-07 |access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Other popular terms sometimes used for plug-in hybrids are "grid-connected hybrids", "Gas-Optional Hybrid Electric Vehicle" (GO-HEV) or simply "gas-optional hybrids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evworld.com/article.cfm?storyid=238|title=Making the Case for Grid-Connected Hybrids|publisher=EV World |date=2001-09-23|accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=8142 |title=What's In A Name? |publisher=EV World |date=2005-04-07|accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ergosphere.blogspot.com/2005/05/glossary.html |title=The glossary |publisher=The Ergosphere |date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM calls its [[Chevrolet Volt]] [[Series hybrid|series]] plug-in hybrid an "Extended-Range Electric Vehicle".&lt;ref name=RSC&gt;{{cite web |title=Sustainable transportation based on electric vehicle concepts: a brief overview |url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/EE/article.asp?doi=c001674h|last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich|first2=Rittmar|last2=von Helmolt |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |date=2010-05-14| accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/pages/open/default/fuel/electric.do|title=Chevy Volt: The Future is Electrifying| publisher =Chevrolet|accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invention and early interest===
The [[Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid]], produced as early as 1899, was the first hybrid electric car.&lt;ref name=HybridCarHist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/history/history-of-hybrid-vehicles.html |title=History of Hybrid Vehicles |publisher=HybridCars.com |date=2006-03-27 |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904154040/http://www.hybridcars.com/history/history-of-hybrid-vehicles.html |archivedate=2009-09-04 |df= }} ''See year 1898''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3456/Lohner-Porsche-Mixte-Voiturette.html|title=Lohner-Porsche Mixte Voiturette|date=2007-11-19|publisher=Ultimate Car Page|accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation. However, the term "plug-in hybrid" has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket. The term "plug-in hybrid electric vehicle" was coined by [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] [[Dr. Andrew Alfonso Frank|Professor Andrew Frank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113815056026555394 |title=Coalition Turns On to 'Plug-In Hybrids': Utilities, Localities, DaimlerChrysler Give Traction to Professor's Drive For High Mileage |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |first=John J. |last=Fialka |date=2006-01-25 |accessdate=2011-06-21 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has been called the "father of the modern plug-in hybrid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcars.org/history.html|title=Plug-In Hybrids: State Of Play, History &amp; Players|publisher=[[CalCars]]|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5406454 |title=Can Plug-In Hybrids Ride to America's Rescue? |publisher=[[ABC News]] |first=Mark |last=Clayton |date=2008-07-19 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plug_in"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sherry |last=Boschert |author-link=Sherry Boschert |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages=68–78 |publisher=New Society Publishers |location=Gabriola Island, Canada|ISBN=978-0-86571-571-4}} See Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The July 1969 issue of ''[[Popular Science]]'' featured an article on the [[General Motors XP-883]] plug-in hybrid. The concept commuter vehicle housed six {{nowrap|12-volt}} lead–acid batteries in the trunk area and a transverse-mounted DC electric motor turning a front-wheel drive. The car could be plugged into a standard North American 120 volt AC outlet for recharging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hybrid Car Ready in 1969|url= http://www.finkbuilt.com/blog/hybrid-car-ready-in-1969 |website=Finkbuilt |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of interest===
In 2003, [[Renault]] began selling the [[Elect'road]], a plug-in series hybrid version of their popular [[Kangoo]], in Europe. In addition to its engine, it could be plugged into a standard outlet and recharged to 95% range in about 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Holinger, H.

Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Elect'road was redesigned in 2007.

With the availability of hybrid vehicles and the rising gas prices in the United States starting around 2004, interest in plug-in hybrids increased. &lt;ref name=Anderson2010&gt; Curtis D. Anderson, Judy Anderson,'' Electric and Hybrid Cars: A History, 2d ed.'' McFarland, 2010, {{ISBN|0786457422}}, page 156 &lt;/ref&gt; Some plug-in hybrids were conversions of existing hybrids; for example, the 2004 [[CalCars]] converision of a Prius to add lead acid batteries and a range of up to {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} using only electric power.&lt;ref name="priusplus"&gt;{{cite web | title=How We Green-Tuned an '04 Prius into a PRIUS+ Plug-In Hybrid!| work=CalCars.com – The California Cars Initiative | url=http://www.priusplus.org|accessdate=2006-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Powertrains===
{{main|Hybrid vehicle drivetrains}}

PHEVs are based on the same three basic powertrain architectures of conventional hybrids; a ''series hybrid'' is propelled by electric motors only, a ''parallel hybrid'' is propelled both by its engine and by electric motors operating concurrently, and a ''series-parallel hybrid'' operates in either mode. While a plain hybrid vehicle charges its [[Electric-vehicle battery|battery]] from its engine only, a plug-in hybrid can obtain a significant amount of the energy required to recharge its battery from external sources.

===Charging systems===
The battery charger can be on-board or external to the vehicle. The process for an on-board charger is best explained as AC power being converted into DC power, resulting in the battery being charged.&lt;ref name=Tilsley-2018-04-30/&gt; On-board chargers are limited in capacity by their weight and size, and by the limited capacity of general-purpose AC outlets. Dedicated off-board chargers can be as large and powerful as the user can afford, but require returning to the charger; high-speed chargers may be shared by multiple vehicles.

Using the electric motor's inverter allows the motor windings to act as the transformer coils, and the existing high-power inverter as the AC-to-DC charger. As these components are already required on the car, and are designed to handle any practical power capability, they can be used to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with no significant additional weight or size. [[AC Propulsion]] uses this charging method, referred to as "reductive charging".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpropulsion.com/products-reductive.html "AC Propulsion's Reductive Charger"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107062236/http://www.acpropulsion.com/products-reductive.html |date=2011-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modes of operation===
A plug-in hybrid operates in [[charge-depleting]] and [[charge-sustaining]] modes. Combinations of these two modes are termed [[blended mode]] or mixed-mode. These vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in [[all-electric mode]], either at low speeds only or at all speeds. These modes manage the vehicle's battery discharge strategy, and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/09/plugins_progres.html |title=Plug-ins Progress |work=Green Car Congress |date=2006-09-29 |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charge-depleting mode''' allows a fully charged PHEV to operate exclusively (or depending on the vehicle, almost exclusively, except during hard acceleration) on electric power until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level, at which time the vehicle's internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be [[wikt:engaged|engaged]]. This period is the vehicle's all-electric range. This is the only mode that a [[battery electric vehicle]] can operate in, hence their limited range.&lt;ref name="energy"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.nrel.gov/vehiclesandfuels/vsa/pdfs/40970.pdf |title=Energy Management Strategies for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles |first1=J. |last1=Gonder |first2=T. |last2=Markel |conference=SAE World Congress |location=Detroit |id=NREL/CP-540-40970 |date=2007-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925221144/http://www.nrel.gov/vehiclesandfuels/vsa/pdfs/40970.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mixed mode''' describes a trip using a combination of multiple modes. For example, a car may begin a trip in low speed charge-depleting mode, then enter onto a freeway and operate in blended mode. The driver might exit the freeway and drive without the internal combustion engine until all-electric range is exhausted. The vehicle can revert to a charge sustaining-mode until the final destination is reached. This contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a PHEV's all-electric range.

===Electric power storage===
{{further|Electric vehicle battery|Charging station}}
The optimum battery size varies depending on whether the aim is to reduce fuel consumption, running costs, or emissions, but a recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/me/ddl/publications/2009-EP-Shiau-Samaras-Hauffe-Michalek-PHEV-Weight-Charging.pdf |title=Shiau, C.-S., C. Samaras, R. Hauffe and J.J. Michalek (2009) "Impact of battery weight and charging patterns on the economic and environmental benefits of plug-in hybrid vehicles," |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that "The best choice of PHEV battery capacity depends critically on the distance that the vehicle will be driven between charges. Our results suggest that for urban driving conditions and frequent charges every 10 miles or less, a low-capacity PHEV sized with an AER (all electric range) of about 7 miles would be a robust choice for minimizing gasoline consumption, cost, and greenhouse gas emissions. For less frequent charging, every 20–100 miles, PHEVs release fewer GHGs, but HEVs are more cost effective. "

PHEVs typically require deeper [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrids. Because the number of full cycles influences battery life, this may be less than in traditional HEVs which do not deplete their batteries as fully. However, some authors argue that PHEVs will soon become standard in the automobile industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.calcars.org/sci-am-romm-frank-apr06.pdf |title=Hybrid Vehicles Gain Traction |first1=Joseph J. |last1=Romm |first2=Andrew A. |last2=Frank |work=Scientific American |pages=72–79 |date=April 2006 |access-date=2017-12-30 |via=The California Cars Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design issues and trade-offs against battery life, capacity, heat dissipation, weight, costs, and safety need to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/406201/are-lithium-ion-electric-cars-safe/ |title=Are Lithium-Ion Electric Cars Safe? |first=Kevin |last=Bullis |work=Technology Review |publisher=MIT |location=Cambridge, Mass. |date=2006-08-03 |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced battery technology is under development, promising greater energy densities by both mass and volume,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wistechnology.com/article.php?id=3228 |title=Johnson Controls partnership wins new contract |first=Chris |last=Fleissner |work=Wisconsin Technology Network |date=2006-08-14 |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and battery life expectancy is expected to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nsti.org/press/PRshow.html?id=1312 |title=Altair Nanotechnologies Details Long Life Features of its Nano Titanate Battery |publisher=Nano Science and Technology Institute |work=Business Wire |date=2006-09-07 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051743/http://www.nsti.org/press/PRshow.html?id=1312 |archive-date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxide. This material is expensive, and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged. If the cobalt is replaced with [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|iron phosphates]], the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge. At early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices, the a break-even point is reached after six to ten years of operation. The payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids, because of their larger, more expensive batteries.&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/jan07/4848 |title=Lithium Batteries for Hybrid Cars |first=John |last=Voelcker |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=2007-01-02 |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries can be recycled; Toyota, for example, has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a US$200 credit for each battery returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/hybrids/how-hybrids-work |title=How hybrids work |publisher=Toyota |location=Canada |year=2016 |access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids, and thus require more resources. [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) has suggested that utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load leveling purposes. They state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles, their residual capacity still has significant value.&lt;ref name="woody"&gt;Woody, Todd.

A key design parameter of the Chevrolet Volt was a target of {{convert|40|mi|km}} for the all-electric range, selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs, and mainly because research showed that 78% of daily [[commuting|commuters]] in the U.S. travel {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} or less. This target range would allow most travel to be accomplished electrically driven and the assumption was made that charging will take place at home overnight.

==Comparison to non-plug-in hybrids==

===Fuel efficiency and petroleum displacement===
{{Main|Energy conversion efficiency|Well-to-wheel}}

Plug-in hybrids have the potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the PHEV's internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency. While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency), the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency.&lt;ref name="energy" /&gt; The actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation, inversion, battery charging/discharging, the motor controller and motor itself, the way a vehicle is used (its [[duty cycle]]), and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid.

Each [[kilowatt hour]] of battery capacity in use will displace up to {{convert|50|USgal|sp=us}} of [[petroleum fuel]]s per year (gasoline or diesel fuels).&lt;ref&gt;International Humanities Center (September 24, 2008) [http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1004.html "Senate OKs Plug-In Credits, Toyota Frets; Free Press Lyrical about Plug-Ins"] ''California Cars Initiative''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, electricity is multi-sourced and, as a result, it gives the greatest degree of [[energy resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Andy (July/August 2008) [http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future "Our Electric Future"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/ |date=2014-08-25 }} ''The American'' (American.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] for PHEVs depends on their powertrain operating modes, their all-electric range, and the amount of driving between charges. If no gasoline is used the [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e) depends only on the efficiency of the electric system. The first [[mass production]] PHEV available in the U.S. market, the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, with an EPA rated all-electric range of {{Convert|35|mi}}, and an additional gasoline-only extended range of {{Convert|344|mi}} has an EPA combined city/highway fuel economy of 93 MPG-e in [[all-electric mode]], and {{Convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}} in gasoline-only mode, for an overall combined gas-electric fuel economy rating of {{Convert|60|mpgus|abbr=on}} equivalent (MPG-e).&lt;ref name=EPAmpge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/phevsbs.shtml|title=2011 Chevrolet Volt|publisher=Fueleconomy.gov|author=[[U.

For the more comprehensive [[fuel economy and environment label]] that will be mandatory in the U.S. beginning in [[model year]] 2013, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids because of their design complexity, as PHEVS can operate in two or three operating modes: all-electric, blended, and gasoline-only.&lt;ref name=GCC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/felabel-20110525.html|title=EPA, DOT unveil the next generation of fuel economy labels|publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/carlabel/420f11017.htm|title=Fact Sheet: New Fuel Economy and Environment Labels for a New Generation of Vehicles|author=EPA|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=May 2011|accessdate=2011-05-31}}''EPA-420-F-11-017''&lt;/ref&gt; One label is for series hybrid or extended range electric vehicle (like the Chevy Volt), with all-electric and gasoline-only modes; and a second label for blended mode or [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain#Power-split or series-parallel hybrid|series-parallel hybrid]], that includes a combination of both gasoline and plug-in electric operation; and gasoline only, like a conventional hybrid vehicle.&lt;ref name=GCC2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;



The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) developed their recommended practice in 1999 for testing and reporting the fuel economy of hybrid vehicles and included language to address PHEVs. An SAE committee is currently working to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of PHEVs.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Energy (September 18, 2007) [http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/plugin_hybrids_conversions.html "Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conversions"] ''Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center'' Retrieved November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Toronto Atmospheric Fund tested ten retrofitted plug-in hybrid vehicles that achieved an average of 5.8 litres per 100 kilometre or 40.6 miles per gallon over six months in 2008, which was considered below the technology's potential.&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;Hamilton, Tyler.

===Operating costs===

A study published in 2014 by researchers from [[Lamar University]], [[Iowa State University]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] compared the operating costs of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) of various electric ranges (10, 20, 30, and 40 miles) with conventional gasoline vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) for different payback periods, considering different charging infrastructure deployment levels and gasoline prices. The study concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/03/20140311-lin.html|title=Study finds energy savings of PHEVs relative to HEVs dependent on charging coverage and daily VMT|author1=Xing Wu |author2=Jing Dong |author3=Zhenhong Lin |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2014-03-11|accessdate=2014-03-23}} ''For more details see: Xing Wu, Jing Dong, Zhenhong Lin (2014) Cost analysis of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using GPS-based longitudinal travel data, Energy Policy, Volume 68, Pages 206–217, doi: 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.12.054''&lt;/ref&gt;
* PHEVs save around 60% or 40% in energy costs, compared with conventional gasoline vehicles and HEVs, respectively. However, for drivers with significant daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT), hybrid vehicles may be even a better choice than plug-in hybrids with a range of {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}}, particularly when there is lack of public charging infrastructure.
*The incremental battery cost of large-battery plug-in hybrids is difficult to justify based on the incremental savings of PHEVs’ operating costs unless a subsidy is offered for large-battery PHEVs.
*When the price of gasoline increases from {{USD|4}} per gallon to {{USD|5}} per gallon, the number of drivers who benefit from a larger battery increases significantly. If the gas price is {{USD|3}}, a plug-in hybrid with a range of {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} is the least costly option even if the battery cost is $200/kWh.
*Although [[Charging station#DC charging stations (fast)|quick charger]]s can reduce charging time, they contribute little to energy cost savings for PHEVs, as opposed to [[Level 1, 2, and 3 charging|Level-2 charger]]s.

===Cost of batteries===
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
Disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional cost, weight, and size of a larger [[battery pack]]. According to a 2010 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], the cost of a [[lithium-ion]] battery pack is about {{USD|1,700}}/[[kW·h]] of usable energy, and considering that a PHEV-10 requires about 2.0&amp;nbsp;kW·h and a PHEV-40 about 8&amp;nbsp;kW·h, the estimated manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a PHEV-10 is around {{USD|3,000}} and it goes up to {{USD|14,000}} for a PHEV-40.&lt;ref name=NRC09_1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12826&amp;page=2|title=Transitions to Alternative Transportation Technologies—Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles|publisher=The National Academies Press|author=[[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1209&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/business/15hybrid.html?_r=2&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=plug-in%20hybrid&amp;st=cse|title=Study Says Big Impact of the Plug-In Hybrid Will Be Decades Away|publisher=New York Times|date=2009-12-14|accessdate=2010-03-04|author1=Jad Mouawad|author2=Kate Galbraith |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same study, even though costs are expected to decline by 35% by 2020, market penetration is expected to be slow and therefore PHEVs are not expected to significantly impact oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030, unless a fundamental breakthrough in battery technologies occurs.&lt;ref name=NRC09_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1209/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC09_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12826|title=Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Costs Likely to Remain High, Benefits Modest for Decades|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]|author=[[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]|date=2009-12-14|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2010 NRC study, although a mile driven on electricity is cheaper than one driven on gasoline, lifetime fuel savings are not enough to offset plug-ins' high upfront costs, and it will take decades before the break even point is achieved.&lt;ref name=NRC09_2/&gt; Furthermore, hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies and incentives are likely to be required to achieve a rapid plug-in market penetration in the U.S.&lt;ref name=NYT1209/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC09_2/&gt;

A 2013 study by the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] reported that battery costs came down from {{USD|1,300}} per kilowatt hour in 2007 to {{USD|500}} per kilowatt hour in 2012. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of {{USD|300}} per kilowatt hour in 2015 and {{USD|125}} per kilowatt hour by 2022. Cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/publications/researchreports/t133.pdf|title=Plug-in Electric Vehicles: Challenges and Opportunities|author1=Siddiq Khan |author2=Martin Kushler |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]]|date=June 2013|accessdate=2013-07-09}} ''ACEEE Report Number T133''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2011 by the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|Belfer Center]], [[Harvard University]], found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars over the vehicles’ lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices.

The study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years, assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase. Under the future scenarios considered, the study found that BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars ({{USD|1,155}} to {{USD|7,181}} cheaper), while PHEVs, will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios, and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices. BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel, while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines.&lt;ref name=KSG11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21216/will_electric_cars_transform_the_us_vehicle_market.html?hq_e=el&amp;hq_m=1303999&amp;hq_l=5&amp;hq_v=4613decb42|title=Will Electric Cars Transform the U.S. Vehicle Market?|author1=Henry Lee |author2=Grant Lovellette |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]], [[Kennedy School of Government]]|date=July 2011|accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid (fossil or renewable, for example) and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves. Identifying, regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plant—or replacing a plant altogether—may also be more practical. From a human health perspective, shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanellos |first=M. |date=2006-04-28 |url=http://news.com.com/Plug |title=Plug in your hybrid, pollute less? |work=CNET News |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714233237/http://news.com.com/Plug+in+your+hybrid,+pollute+less/2100-11389_3-6066360.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiered rate structure for electric bills===

The additional electrical consumption to recharge the plug-in vehicles could push many households in areas that do not have off-peak tariffs into the higher priced tier and negate financial benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bullis |first=K. |date=2006-12-21 |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/17930/?a=f |title=How Plug-in Hybrids Will Save the Grid |work=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers under such tariffs could see significant savings by being careful about when the vehicle was charged, for example, by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours. Thus, an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed operational cost of electric mode vehicle operation.

==Greenhouse gas emissions==
{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle#Air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions|l1=Greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in electric vehicles}}
The effect of PHEVs on greenhouse emissions is complex. Plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on [[all-electric mode]] do not emit harmful [[motor vehicle emissions|tailpipe pollutants]] from the onboard source of power. The clean air benefit is usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book | last = [[Daniel Sperling|Sperling, Daniel]] and Deborah Gordon | title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year =2009| pages=22 to 26 and 114–139|publisher =[[Oxford University Press]], New York| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, PHEVs do not emit [[greenhouse gases]] from the onboard source of power, but from the point of view of a [[Tank-to-wheel|well-to-wheel assessment]], the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for [[electricity generation]]. From the perspective of a full [[life cycle analysis]], the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from zero-emission sources such as renewable (e.g. [[wind power]], [[solar energy]] or [[hydroelectricity]]) or [[nuclear power]] for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B.

===Argonne===
In 2009 researchers at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] adapted their [[GREET model]] to conduct a full [[life cycle assessment|well-to-wheels]] (WTW) analysis of energy use and [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for several scenarios, considering different on-board fuels and different sources of electricity generation for recharging the vehicle batteries. Three US regions were selected for the analysis, [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Illinois]], as these regions include major metropolitan areas with significant variations in their energy generation mixes. The full cycle analysis results were also reported for the US generation mix and renewable electricity to examine cases of average and clean mixes, respectively&lt;ref name=Argonne&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/559.pdf|format=PDF|title=Well-to-Wheels Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles|publisher=Center for Transportation Research, [[Argonne National Laboratory]]|author1=A.

The Argonne study found that PHEVs offered reductions in petroleum energy use as compared with regular hybrid electric vehicles. More petroleum energy savings and also more GHG emissions reductions were realized as the all-electric range increased, except when electricity used to recharged was dominated by coal or oil-fired power generation. As expected, electricity from renewable sources realized the largest reductions in petroleum energy use and GHG emissions for all PHEVs as the all-electric range increased. The study also concluded that plug-in vehicles that employ biomass-based fuels (biomass-E85 and -hydrogen) may not realize GHG emissions benefits over regular hybrids if power generation is dominated by fossil sources.&lt;ref name=Argonne/&gt;

===Environmental Protection Agency===

In October 2014, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] published the 2014 edition of its annual report "''Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends''". For the first time, the report presents an analysis of the impact of [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s, with emphasis in [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s because as their market share is approaching 1%, PEVs began to have a measurable impact on the U.S. overall new vehicle fuel economy and {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name=EPA1975_2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCCtrends&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/10/20141011-trends.html|title=EPA Trends on EVs and PHEVs; beginning of a "measurable and meaningful impact" on new vehicle fuel economy and emissions |first=Mike |last=Millikin |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2014-10-11|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA's report included the analysis of 12 all-electric passengers cars and 10 plug-in hybrids available in the market as [[model year]] 2014. For purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions, the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between those PHEVs like the Chevrolet Volt that can operate in [[all-electric mode]] without using gasoline, and those that operate in a blended mode like the [[Toyota Prius PHV]], which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle, but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode. In addition, since the all-electric range of plug-in hybrids depends on the size of the battery pack, the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection, on average, of the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity (in electric only and blended modes) by an average driver. The following table shows the overall EV/hybrid fuel economy expressed in terms of [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (mpg-e) and the utility factor for the ten MY2014 plug-in hybrids available in the U.S. market. The study used the utility factor (since in pure EV mode there are no tailpipe emissions) and the EPA best estimate of the {{CO2}} [[tailpipe emissions]] produced by these vehicles in real world city and highway operation based on the EPA 5-cycle label methodology, using a weighted 55% city/45% highway driving. The results are shown in the following table.&lt;ref name=EPA1975_2014/&gt;

In addition, the EPA accounted for the upstream {{CO2}} emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity required to charge the PHEVs. Since electricity production in the United States varies significantly from region to region, the EPA considered three scenarios/ranges with the low end of the range corresponding to the California powerplant emissions factor, the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor, and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the Rockies. The EPA estimates that the electricity GHG emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346 g CO2/kW-hr in California to 986 g CO2/kW-hr in the Rockies, with a national average of 648 g CO2/kW-hr.&lt;ref name=EPA1975_2014/&gt; The following table shows the tailpipe emissions and the combined tailpipe and upstream emissions for each of the 10 MY 2014 PHEVs available in the U.S. market.

See pp. 251&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by three economist affiliated with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009, and used the specifications for the Chevrolet Volt (all-electric range of {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on}}). The analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the [[Upper Midwest]] compared to the [[Western U.S.]], and within regions, rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others.&lt;ref name=NBER2014/&gt; Applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles, the NBER researchers found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, {{CO2}} emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand. This pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening.&lt;ref name=NBER2014/&gt;

==Production and sales==

Since 2008, plug-in hybrids have been commercially available from both specialty manufacturers and from main-stream producers of internal combutsion engine vehicles. 

===Sales and main markets===

{{As of|2015|12}}, the global stock of highway-capable plug-in hybrid electric cars totaled 517,100 units, out of total cumulative global sales of 1.257 million light-duty [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s (41.1%). The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ev-volumes.com/country/total-world-plug-in-vehicle-volumes/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017151132/http://www.ev-volumes.com/country/total-world-plug-in-vehicle-volumes/ |title=The Electric Vehicle World Sales Database: Stable 60:40 Ratio |archivedate=2016-10-17 |publisher=EV-Volumes |accessdate=2016-10-17 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this design the Displacer piston is used without a regenerator.]]
The '''rhombic drive''' is a specific method of transferring mechanical energy, or [[Mechanical work|work]], used when a single cylinder is used for two separately oscillating pistons.

==History==
It was originally developed around 1900 for the twin-cylinder [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester]] car engine where it allowed perfect balancing of the inertial forces on both pistons. &amp;nbsp;A current example of its use is on beta type-[[Stirling engine]]s; the drive's complexity and tight tolerances, causing a high cost of manufacture, is a hurdle for the widespread usage of this drive.

==Operation==
[[File:Animrhombor.gif|thumb|left|200px| Schematic of a rhombic drive stirling engine in operation.]]
In its simplest form, the drive utilizes a jointed [[rhomboid]] to convert linear work from a reciprocating [[piston]] to rotational work. &amp;nbsp; The [[connecting rod]] of the piston is rigid as opposed to a common reciprocating engine which directly connects the piston to the [[crankshaft]] with a flexible joint in the piston. Instead, the rod connects to one corner of a [[rhomboid|rhombus]]. &amp;nbsp; When force is applied to the piston, it pushes down; at the same time, the outer corners of the rhomboid push out. They push on two cranks/flywheels which cause them to rotate, each in opposite directions. As the wheels rotate the rhombus progresses its change of shape from being flattened in the direction of the piston axis at [[top dead centre]] to being flattened in the perpendicular direction to the piston axis at [[bottom dead centre]].

In the pictured example the left crank/flywheel turns clockwise and the right crank/flywheel anticlockwise.  They turn at the same angular velocity and this can be reinforced by intermeshing them as gear wheels.

'''Robert Peter Gale''' (born October 11, 1945) is an American physician and medical researcher. He is known for research in [[leukemia]] and other [[bone marrow]] disorders (such as [[aplastic anemia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://todayinsci.com/10/10_11.htm Today in Science History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Gale received his A.B. degree with honors in biology and chemistry from [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] in 1966 and his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree from the [[State University of New York]] at Buffalo in 1970 (with Evan Caukins, Robin Bannerman and John Edwards). His postgraduate medical training ([[internal medicine]], [[hematology]] and [[oncology]]) was at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) from 1970–1973. In 1976 he received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[microbiology]] and [[immunology]] from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) following doctoral work focusing on [[cancer immunology]] (with John Fahey). His postdoctoral studies at UCLA were funded by the [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[Leukemia Society of America]], where he was the Bogart Fellow and Scholar.

==Career==
From 1973–1993, Gale was on the faculty of the [[UCLA School of Medicine]] in the Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology &amp; Oncology where he focused on the molecular biology, immunology and treatment of leukemia. He also developed the bone marrow transplant program supported by the NIH. At UCLA, he was active in the Department of Psychology, where he and his colleagues studied interactions between stress, immunity and cancer.

From 1980–1997, Gale was Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the [[Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research]] (CIBMTR), an organization of more than 400 transplant centers in over 60 countries worldwide working together to analyze and advance knowledge about blood cell and bone marrow transplants.  In 1989–2003 Gale chaired the Scientific Advisory Board of the Center for Advanced Studies in Leukemia, a charity funding innovation leukemia research.

From 1986–1993, Gale was President of the [[Armand Hammer]] Center for Advanced Studies in Nuclear Energy and Health, a foundation supporting research on medical aspects of nuclear issues. From 1985–1990 Gale was the Wald Scholar in Biomedical Communications at UCLA.

From 1993–1999, Gale was Senior Physician and Corporate Director of Bone Marrow and Blood Cell Transplantation at Salick Health Care (SHC), Inc. in Los Angeles (now Aptium Oncology), a subsidiary of [[AstraZeneca]]. Gale was also responsible for developing cancer treatment guidelines (in collaboration with colleagues at [[RAND]] and Value Health Sciences) and for studying medical aspects of managed cancer care.

From 2000–2004 he was Senior Vice-President for Medical Affairs at [[Antigenics Inc.]], in New York where he was responsible for design, implementation and analysis of [[clinical trials]] of [[cancer vaccines]]. He was also Senior Medical Consultant to Oxford Health Plans in areas of advanced medical technologies. From 2004 to 2007, Gale was Senior Vice-President of Research for ZIOPHARM Oncology in Boston, MA and New York, NY which he helped co-found. His focus was on developing and testing new cancer therapies. In 2007 Gale joined [[Celgene Corporation]] ([[Summit, NJ]]) where he is Executive Director of Clinical Research, Hematology and Oncology. His activities include development and execution of [[clinical trials]] in blood and bone marrow cancers, transplantation and [[immune disorders]]. Since 2005 Gale has been a Visiting Professor of Haematoloy in the Department of Medicine, Division of Experimental Medicine, Section of Haematology, [[Imperial College, London]] assigned to Hammersmith Hospital.  He is an editor, co-editor and/or reviewer of many scientific journals in hematology, oncology, immunology, transplantation and internal medicine.  Prof. Gale is regarded as a world expert on the medical response to nuclear and radiation accidents and has participated in rescue efforts at Chernobyl, Goiania, Tokaimura, Fukushima and others. In 2012, after extensive analysis of the Japanese data, he said that "the increased risk of cancer incidence [from the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima incident]]] would be only 0.002 percent for a member of the Japanese public".&lt;ref&gt;http://safetyfirst.nei.org/public-health/experts-say-health-effects-of-fukushima-accident-should-be-very-minor/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bone marrow transplantation==
Gale has contributed to basic science and clinical research in [[bone marrow transplantation]] where he made contributions to understanding the immune-mediated anti-leukemia effects of transplants (graft-versus-leukemia [GvL]. He has also advanced understanding other complex immune effects of transplants in humans, like [[graft-versus-host disease]] and post-transplant [[immune deficiency]]. He has worked on alternate sources of [[hematopoietic stem cells]] including fetal liver transplants.

==Publications==
Gale has published over 1000 scientific articles and more than 20 books, mostly on leukemia (biology and treatment), [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] (biology, immunology and treatment), [[cancer immunology]] and [[radiation]] (biological effects and accident response). He has written on medical topics, [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and weapons and politics of [[US-Soviet relations]] in articles for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. In addition to his academic publications, Gale has written popular books on [[Chernobyl]] and [[US nuclear energy policy]]. He has written parts of screenplays for and/or appeared in several movies including ''[[Chernobyl: The Final Warning]]'' (with [[Jon Voight]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/23/movies/review-television-2-docudramas-deal-with-big-issues.html?pagewanted=2|title=Review/Television; 2 Docudramas Deal With Big Issues|last=O'Connor|first=John J.|date=April 23, 1991|work=The New York Times|page=16|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fat Man and Little Boy]]'' (with [[Paul Newman]]) and ''[[City of Joy]]'' (with [[Patrick Swazye]]).

__NOTOC__
A '''rocking horse''' is a child's [[toy]], usually shaped like a [[horse]] and mounted on rockers similar to a [[rocking chair]]. There are two sorts, the one where the horse part sits rigidly attached to a pair of curved rockers that are in contact with the ground, and a second sort, where the horse hangs on a rigid frame by iron straps the horse moves only relative to the frame, which does not move.

Predecessors of the rocking horse may be seen in the [[Bassinet|rocking cradle]], the tilting seats used during the Middle Ages for [[jousting]] practice as well as the wheeled [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]. The toy in its current form did not appear before the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/collections/toys/traditional_toys/rocking_horses/index.html Toy Horses] (from the [[V&amp;A Museum of Childhood]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; though some conflicting sources note medieval manuscripts including references to carved rocking horses, presumably of the toy kind.&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;

From the 19th century onward, rocking horses became more commonly considered as child's toy. Mostly built by hobby [[Woodworking|woodcrafter]]s, and ranging from relatively crude to finely ornamented and the toys of future kings, it was not until the late 19th century that the production became industrialised.&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galloping for Rocking Horses?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/tips/rockinghorses.html|work=[[Antiques Roadshow]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] certified Katlinel and Les Hartness of California as having the largest hand-carved wooden rocking horse on record. This rocking horse was built in 2000 and is 7 feet 8&amp;nbsp;inches tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. It can be seen at [[renaissance faire]]s, [[faerie festivals]], and at private parties and events where up to 3 adults or 4-5 children can ride it together at one time. According to Les and Katlinel, the youngest rider has been six weeks old and the oldest, 94 years.

'''Salt tectonics''' is concerned with the geometries and processes associated with the presence of significant thicknesses of [[evaporite]]s containing [[rock salt]] within a [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] sequence of rocks. This is due both to the low [[density]] of salt, which does not increase with burial, and its low strength.

Salt structures (excluding undeformed layers of salt) have been found in more than 120 [[sedimentary basin]]s across the world.&lt;ref name="RobertsBally2012"&gt;{{cite book | title=Regional Geology and Tectonics: Phanerozoic Passive Margins, Cratonic Basins and Global Tectonic Maps – Volume 1 | publisher=Elsevier | author=Roberts, D.G. and Bally, A.W (editors) | year=2012 | location=Amsterdam | pages=20–21 | isbn=978-0-444-56357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive salt structures==

Structures may form during continued sedimentary loading, without any external tectonic influence, due to gravitational instability. Pure [[halite]] has a density of 2160&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. When initially deposited, [[sediments]] generally have a lower density of 2000&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, but with loading and compaction their density increases to 2500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, which is greater than that of salt.&lt;ref&gt;McGeary. D and C. C. Plummer (1994) ''Physical Geology: Earth revealed,'' Wm . C. Brown Publishers, Dubuque, p.475-476 {{ISBN|0-697-12687-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the overlying layers have become denser, the weak salt layer will tend to deform into a characteristic series of ridges and depressions, due to a form of [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]]. Further sedimentation will be concentrated in the depressions and the salt will continue to move away from them into the ridges. At a late stage, [[diapir]]s tend to initiate at the junctions between ridges, their growth fed by movement of salt along the ridge system, continuing until the salt supply is exhausted. During the later stages of this process the top of the diapir remains at or near the surface, with further burial being  matched by diapir rise, and is sometimes referred to as ''downbuilding''. The [[Schacht Asse II]] and [[Gorleben]] [[salt dome]]s in Germany are an example of a purely passive salt structure.

Such structures do not always form when a salt layer is buried beneath a sedimentary overburden. This can be due to a relatively high strength overburden or to the presence of sedimentary layers interbedded within the salt unit that increase both its density and strength.

==Active salt structures==
[[image:SaltTectonics3.jpg|500px|thumb]]
Active [[tectonics]] will increase the likelihood of salt structures developing. In the case of [[extensional tectonics]], faulting will both reduce the strength of the overburden and thin it.&lt;ref&gt;Vendeville, B. C. and M. P. A. Jackson (1992b). The rise of diapirs during thin-skinned extension. ''Marine and Petroleum Geology'', 9: 331-353&lt;/ref&gt;  In an area affected by [[thrust tectonics]], buckling of the overburden layer will allow the salt to rise into the cores of [[anticline]]s, as seen in [[salt dome]]s in the [[Zagros Mountains]].

If the pressure within the salt body becomes sufficiently high it may be able to push through its overburden, this is known as ''forceful'' diapirism. Many salt diapirs may contain elements of both active and passive salt movement. An active salt structure may pierce its overburden and from then on continue to develop as a purely passive salt diapir.

==Reactive salt structures==
[[image:SaltTectonics2.jpg|500px|thumb]]
In those cases where salt layers do not have the conditions necessary to develop passive salt structures, the salt may still move into relatively low pressure areas around developing folds and faults. Such structures are described as ''reactive''.

==Salt detached fault systems==
When one or more salt layers are present during [[extensional tectonics]], a characteristic set of structures are formed. Extensional faults propagate up from the middle part of the crust until they encounter the salt layer. The weakness of the salt prevents the fault from propagating through. However, continuing displacement on the fault offsets the base of the salt and causes bending of the overburden layer. Eventually the stresses caused by this bending will be sufficient to fault the overburden. The types of structures developed depend on the initial salt thickness. In the case of a very thick salt layer there is no direct spatial relationship between the faulting beneath the salt and that in the overburden, such a system is said to be ''unlinked''. For intermediate salt thicknesses, the overburden faults are spatially related to the deeper faults, but offset from them, normally into the footwall; these are known as ''soft-linked'' systems. When the salt layer becomes thin enough, the fault that develops in the overburden is closely aligned with that beneath the salt, and forms a continuous fault surface after only a relatively small displacement, forming a ''hard-linked'' fault.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, S. A., 2007, ''Salt tectonics in the North Sea Basin: a structural style template for seismic interpreters,'' Special Publication of the Geological Society, London, 272, 361-396&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas of [[thrust tectonics]] salt layers act as preferred detachment planes. In the [[Zagros fold and thrust belt]], variations in the thickness and therefore effectiveness of the late [[Neoproterozoic]] to [[Early Cambrian]] [[Hormuz Formation|Hormuz salt]] are thought to have had a fundamental control on the overall topography.&lt;ref&gt;Bahroudi, H. and H. A. Koyi, 2003, ''Effect of spatial distribution of Hormuz salt on deformation style in the Zagros fold and thrust belt: an analogue modelling approach,'' Journal of the Geological Society, 160, 719-733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salt weld==
When a salt layer becomes too thin to be an effective detachment layer, due to salt movement, dissolution or removal by faulting, the overburden and the underlying sub-salt basement become effectively ''welded'' together. This may cause the development of new faults in the cover sequence and is an important consideration when modeling the migration of [[hydrocarbon]]s.
Salt welds may also develop in the vertical direction by putting the sides of a former diapir in contact.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, K. A. and Lawton, T. F. (1999). Attributes and evolution of an exhumed salt weld, La Popa basin, northeastern Mexico. Geology. v. 27 no. 4 p. 323-326. {{doi|10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027&lt;0323:AAEOAE&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allochthonous salt structures==
{{main|Salt surface structures}}
Salt that pierces to the surface, either on land or beneath the sea, tends to spread laterally away and such salt is said to be "allochthonous". [[Salt glacier]]s are formed on land where this happens in an arid environment, such as in the Zagros Mountains. Offshore tongues of salt are generated that may join together with others from neighbouring piercements to form canopies.

==Economic importance==
A significant proportion of the world’s [[hydrocarbon]] reserves are found in structures related to salt tectonics, including many in the [[Middle East]], the [[South Atlantic]] [[passive margin]]s ([[Brazil]], [[Gabon]] and [[Angola]]) and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

'''Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] government cabinet position from 2008 to 2016. The [[Department for Energy and Climate Change]] was created on 3 October 2008 when former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] reshuffled his [[Brown Ministry|Cabinet]].

The Energy and Climate Change Secretary revived the earlier post of the [[Secretary of State for Energy]] as head of the [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Department of Energy]], existing from 1974 to 1992. After which, the [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Department of Energy]] was merged into the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[John Major|Sir John Major]] in 1992.

Sixteen years later, and immediately prior to the creation of the new department, energy policy was the responsibility of the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] (itself now a defunct government department, superseded by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]).

In 2010, [[Jonathan Marland, Baron Marland|Lord Marland]] was made [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/lord_marland/lord_marland.aspx Media Release: Department of Energy and Climate Change.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121145745/http://decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/lord_marland/lord_marland.aspx |date=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2012, [[Chris Huhne]] resigned from the post after it was announced that he would be [[R v Huhne and Pryce|prosecuted for perverting the course of justice]], in relation to accusations that he passed on speeding penalties to his ex-wife to avoid losing his own licence. The post was taken over by [[Ed Davey]] on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16866127 Chris Huhne quits cabinet over speeding claims charge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The post was formed into the new [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] in July 2016.

In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], '''separated sets''' are pairs of [[subset]]s of a given [[topological space]] that are related to each other in a certain way: roughly speaking, neither overlapping nor touching.
The notion of when two sets are separated or not is important both to the notion of [[connected space]]s (and their connected components) as well as to the [[separation axiom]]s for topological spaces.

Separated sets should not be confused with [[separated space]]s (defined below), which are somewhat related but different.
[[Separable space]]s are again a completely different topological concept.

== Definitions ==

There are various ways in which two subsets of a topological space ''X'' can be considered to be separated.

*''A'' and ''B'' are '''disjoint''' if their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] is the [[empty set]]. This property has nothing to do with topology as such, but only [[naive set theory|set theory]]; it is included here because it is the weakest in the sequence of different notions. For more on disjointness in general, see: [[disjoint sets]].
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated''' in ''X'' if each is disjoint from the other's [[closure (topology)|closure]]. The closures themselves do not have to be disjoint from each other; for example, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s [0,1) and (1,2] are separated in the [[real line]] '''R''', even though the point 1 belongs to both of their closures. More generally in any [[metric space]], two [[open balls]] ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = {y:''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y)&lt;''r''} and   ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = {y:''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,y)&lt;''s''} are separated whenever ''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ ''r''+''s''. Note that any two separated sets automatically must be disjoint.
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by neighbourhoods''' if there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhoods]] ''U'' of ''A'' and ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. (Sometimes you will see the requirement that ''U'' and ''V'' be ''[[open (topology)|open]]'' neighbourhoods, but this makes no difference in the end.) For the example of ''A'' = [0,1) and ''B'' = (1,2], you could take ''U'' = (-1,1) and ''V'' = (1,3). Note that if any two sets are separated by neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated. If ''A'' and ''B'' are open and disjoint, then they must be separated by neighbourhoods; just take ''U'' := ''A'' and ''V'' := ''B''. For this reason, separatedness is often used with closed sets (as in the [[normal separation axiom]]).
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by closed neighbourhoods''' if there is a [[closed (topology)|closed]] neighbourhood ''U'' of ''A'' and a closed neighbourhood ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. Our examples, [0,1) and (1,2], are ''not'' separated by closed neighbourhoods. You could make either ''U'' or ''V'' closed by including the point 1 in it, but you cannot make them both closed while keeping them disjoint. Note that if any two sets are separated by closed neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated by neighbourhoods.
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by a function''' if there exists a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the space ''X'' to the real line '''R''' such that ''f''(''A'') = {0} and ''f''(''B'') = {1}. (Sometimes you will see the [[unit interval]] [0,1] used in place of '''R''' in this definition, but it makes no difference in the end.) In our example, [0,1) and (1,2] are not separated by a function, because there is no way to continuously define ''f'' at the point 1. Note that if any two sets are separated by a function, then they are also separated by closed neighbourhoods; the neighbourhoods can be given in terms of the [[preimage]] of ''f'' as ''U'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[-''e'',''e''] and ''V'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[1-''e'',1+''e''], as long as ''e'' is a [[positive number|positive real number]] less than [[half|1/2]].
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''precisely separated by a function''' if there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to '''R''' such that ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(0) = ''A'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1) = ''B''. (Again, you may also see the unit interval in place of '''R''', and again it makes no difference.) Note that if any two sets are precisely separated by a function, then certainly they are separated by a function. Since {0} and {1} are closed in '''R''', only closed sets are capable of being precisely separated by a function; but just because two sets are closed and separated by a function does not mean that they are automatically precisely separated by a function (even a different function).

== Relation to separation axioms and separated spaces ==

The ''separation axioms'' are various conditions that are sometimes imposed upon topological spaces which can be described in terms of the various types of separated sets.
As an example, we will define the T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axiom, which is the condition imposed on separated spaces.
Specifically, a topological space is ''separated'' if, given any two [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] points ''x'' and ''y'', the singleton sets {''x''} and {''y''} are separated by neighbourhoods.

Separated spaces are also called ''Hausdorff spaces'' or ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spaces''.
Further discussion of separated spaces may be found in the article [[Hausdorff space]].
General discussion of the various separation axioms is in the article [[Separation axiom]].

== Relation to connected spaces ==

Given a topological space ''X'', it is sometimes useful to consider whether it is possible for a subset ''A'' to be separated from its [[complement (set theory)|complement]].
This is certainly true if ''A'' is either the empty set or the entire space ''X'', but there may be other possibilities.
A topological space ''X'' is ''connected'' if these are the only two possibilities.
Conversely, if a nonempty subset ''A'' is separated from its own complement, and if the only [[subset]] of ''A'' to share this property is the empty set, then ''A'' is an ''open-connected component'' of ''X''.
(In the degenerate case where ''X'' is itself the [[empty set]] {}, authorities differ on whether {} is connected and whether {} is an open-connected component of itself.)

For more on connected spaces, see [[Connected space]].

== Relation to topologically distinguishable points ==

Given a topological space ''X'', two points ''x'' and ''y'' are ''topologically distinguishable'' if there exists an [[open set]] that one point belongs to but the other point does not.
If ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically distinguishable, then the [[singleton set]]s {''x''} and {''y''} must be disjoint.
On the other hand, if the singletons {''x''} and {''y''} are separated, then the points ''x'' and ''y'' must be topologically distinguishable.
Thus for singletons, topological distinguishability is a condition in between disjointness and separatedness.

For more about topologically distinguishable points, see [[Topological distinguishability]].

[[File:500kVA-UPS.jpg|right|thumb|A large datacenter-scale UPS being installed by electricians]]

An '''uninterruptible power supply''' or '''uninterruptible power source''' ('''UPS''') is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source or [[Mains electricity|mains power]] fails. A UPS differs from an auxiliary or [[emergency power system]] or [[standby generator]] in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, [[supercapacitors]], or [[flywheel]]s.  The on-battery run-time of most uninterruptible power sources is relatively short (only a few minutes) but sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment. It is a type of [[continual power system]].

A UPS is typically used to protect hardware such as [[computer]]s, [[data center]]s, [[telecommunication]] equipment or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious business disruption or data loss. UPS units range in size from units designed to protect a single computer without a video monitor (around 200 [[volt-ampere]] rating) to large units powering entire data centers or buildings.  The world's largest UPS, the 46-megawatt Battery Electric Storage System (BESS), in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], powers the entire city and nearby rural communities during outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=6910#tabs_ElecStorage-5 |title=Electricity storage: Location, location, location … and cost - Battery storage for transmission support in Alaska |publisher= Energy Information Administration (EIA) |first= |last= |work=eia.gov |year=2012 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common power problems==
The primary role of any UPS is to provide short-term power when the input power source fails. However, most UPS units are also capable in varying degrees of correcting common utility power problems:
# [[Voltage spike]] or sustained [[overvoltage]]
# Momentary or sustained [[Brownout (electricity)|reduction in input voltage]]
# [[Voltage sag]]
# Noise, defined as a [[Line noise|high frequency transient]] or [[Transient (oscillation)|oscillation]], usually injected into the line by nearby equipment
# Instability of the [[mains frequency]]
# [[Harmonic distortion]], defined as a departure from the ideal [[sinusoidal]] [[waveform]] expected on the line

Some manufacturers of UPS units categorize their products in accordance with the number of power-related problems they address.&lt;ref&gt;E-book on choosing a UPS topology based on application type {{cite web|url=http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/UPS%20Trap%20Doors%20for%20SMB.PDF|format=PDF|title=Avoiding Trap Doors Associated with Purchasing a UPS System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==

The three general categories of modern UPS systems are ''on-line'', ''line-interactive'' and ''standby''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Solter |first=W. |title=A new international UPS classification by IEC 62040-3 |year=2002 |doi=10.1109/INTLEC.2002.1048709 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Detailed explanation of UPS topologies {{cite web|url=http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/High-Availability%20Power%20Systems,%20Part%20I_UPS%20Internal%20Topology.pdf|format=PDF|title=High-Availability Power Systems, Part I: UPS Internal Topology |date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; An on-line UPS uses a "double conversion" method of accepting AC input, [[Rectifier|rectifying]] to DC for passing through the [[rechargeable battery]] (or battery strings), then inverting back to 120&amp;nbsp;V/230&amp;nbsp;V AC for powering the protected equipment. A line-interactive UPS maintains the inverter in line and redirects the battery's DC current path from the normal charging mode to supplying current when power is lost. In a standby ("off-line") system the load is powered directly by the input power and the backup power circuitry is only invoked when the utility power fails. Most UPS below 1&amp;nbsp;kVA are of the line-interactive or standby variety which are usually less expensive.

For large power units, Dynamic Uninterruptible Power Supplies (DUPS) are sometimes used. A synchronous motor/alternator is connected on the mains via a [[Choke (electronics)|choke]]. Energy is stored in a [[flywheel]]. When the mains power fails, an eddy-current regulation maintains the power on the load as long as the flywheel's energy is not exhausted. DUPS are sometimes combined or integrated with a diesel generator that is turned on after a brief delay, forming a [[diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply]] (DRUPS).

A [[fuel cell]] UPS has been developed in recent years using hydrogen and a fuel cell as a power source, potentially providing long run times in a small space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogenics.com/hydrogen-products-solutions/fuel-cell-power-systems/stationary-stand-by-power/telecom-data-centre-backup-power |title=Hydrogen Fuel Cell UPS}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- the volumetric energy density of even liquid hydrogen is only about one fourth that of gasoline, and 150 bar compressed H2 is about one twentieth, so claim of "long run times in a small space" compared to diesel will require a ref. --&gt;

===Offline/standby===
[[Image:Standby UPS Diagram SVG.svg|thumb|350px|Offline/Standby UPS: The green line illustrates the flow of electric power. Typical protection time: 0–20 minutes. Capacity expansion: Usually not available]]
The offline/standby UPS (SPS) offers only the most basic features, providing surge protection and battery backup. The protected equipment is normally connected directly to incoming utility power. When the incoming voltage falls below or rises above a predetermined level the SPS turns on its internal DC-AC inverter circuitry, which is powered from an internal storage battery. The UPS then mechanically switches the connected equipment on to its DC-AC inverter output. The switchover time can be as long as 25 milliseconds depending on the amount of time it takes the standby UPS to detect the lost utility voltage. The UPS will be designed to power certain equipment, such as a personal computer, without any objectionable dip or [[Brownout (electricity)|brownout]] to that device.

===Line-interactive===
[[Image:Line-Interactive UPS Diagram SVG.svg|thumb|500px|Line-interactive UPS: The green line illustrates the flow of electric power. Typical protection time: 5–30 minutes. Capacity expansion: several hours]]

The line-interactive UPS is similar in operation to a standby UPS, but with the addition of a multi-tap variable-voltage [[autotransformer]]. This is a special type of [[transformer]] that can add or subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the output voltage of the transformer.  This may also be performed by a ''[[buck–boost transformer]]'' which is distinct from an autotransformer, since the former may be wired to provide [[galvanic isolation]].

This type of UPS is able to tolerate continuous undervoltage [[Brownout (electricity)|brownouts]] and overvoltage surges without consuming the limited reserve battery power. It instead compensates by automatically selecting different power taps on the autotransformer. Depending on the design, changing the autotransformer tap can cause a very brief output power disruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stacoenergy.com/ups/on-line-uninterruptible-power-supply.htm |title=UPS On-Line Uninterruptible Power Supply Backup Power Source |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222451/http://www.stacoenergy.com/ups/on-line-uninterruptible-power-supply.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may cause UPSs equipped with a power-loss alarm to "chirp" for a moment.

This has become popular even in the cheapest UPSs because it takes advantage of components already included. The main 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz transformer used to convert between line voltage and battery voltage needs to provide two slightly different turns ratios: One to convert the battery output voltage (typically a multiple of 12&amp;nbsp;V) to line voltage, and a second one to convert the line voltage to a slightly higher battery charging voltage (such as a multiple of 14&amp;nbsp;V). The difference between the two voltages is because charging a battery requires a delta voltage (up to 13–14&amp;nbsp;V for charging a 12&amp;nbsp;V battery). Furthermore, it is easier to do the switching on the line-voltage side of the transformer because of the lower currents on that side.

To gain the ''buck/boost'' feature, all that is required is two separate switches so that the AC input can be connected to one of the two primary taps, while the load is connected to the other, thus using the main transformer's primary windings as an autotransformer. The battery can still be charged while "bucking" an overvoltage, but while "boosting" an undervoltage, the transformer output is too low to charge the batteries.

Autotransformers can be engineered to cover a wide range of varying input voltages, but this requires more taps and increases complexity, and expense of the UPS.&lt;!-- No significant change to size or weight; it's still one transformer.--&gt; It is common for the autotransformer to cover a range only from about 90&amp;nbsp;V to 140&amp;nbsp;V for 120&amp;nbsp;V power, and then switch to battery if the voltage goes much higher or lower than that range.

In low-voltage conditions the UPS will use more current than normal so it may need a higher current circuit than a normal device. For example, to power a 1000-W device at 120&amp;nbsp;V, the UPS will draw 8.33&amp;nbsp;A. If a brownout occurs and the voltage drops to 100&amp;nbsp;V, the UPS will draw 10&amp;nbsp;A to compensate. This also works in reverse, so that in an overvoltage condition, the UPS will need less current.

===Online/double-conversion===

In an online UPS, the batteries are always connected to the inverter, so that no power transfer switches are necessary. When power loss occurs, the rectifier simply drops out of the circuit and the batteries keep the power steady and unchanged. When power is restored, the rectifier resumes carrying most of the load and begins charging the batteries, though the charging current may be limited to prevent the high-power rectifier from overheating the batteries and boiling off the electrolyte. The main advantage of an on-line UPS is its ability to provide an "electrical firewall" between the incoming utility power and sensitive electronic equipment.

The online UPS is ideal for environments where electrical isolation is necessary or for equipment that is very sensitive to power fluctuations. Although it was at one time reserved for very large installations of 10&amp;nbsp;kW or more, advances in technology have now permitted it to be available as a common consumer device, supplying 500&amp;nbsp;W or less. The initial cost of the online UPS may be higher, but its total cost of ownership is generally lower due to longer battery life. The online UPS may be necessary when the power environment is "noisy", when utility power sags, outages and other anomalies are frequent, when protection of sensitive IT equipment loads is required, or when operation from an extended-run backup generator is necessary.

The basic technology of the online UPS is the same as in a standby or line-interactive UPS. However it typically costs much more, due to it having a much greater current AC-to-DC battery-charger/rectifier, and with the [[rectifier]] and inverter designed to run continuously with improved cooling systems. It is called a ''double-conversion'' UPS due to the rectifier directly driving the inverter, even when powered from normal AC current.

Online UPS typically have Static transfer switch (STS) for increasing reliability .

===Hybrid topology/double conversion on demand===

These hybrid Rotary UPS&lt;ref name="Rotary UPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pscpower.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Hybrid-Rotary-UPS.pdf|title=Hybrid Rotary UPS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204152131/http://www.pscpower.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Hybrid-Rotary-UPS.pdf|archivedate=December 4, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; designs do not have official designations, although one name used by '''UTL''' is "double conversion on demand".&lt;ref name="HPman"&gt;http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c01173322/c01173322.pdf {{dead link|date=July 2016}} {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of UPS is targeted towards high-efficiency applications while still maintaining the features and protection level offered by double conversion.

A hybrid (double conversion on demand) UPS operates as an off-line/standby UPS when power conditions are within a certain preset window. This allows the UPS to achieve very high efficiency ratings. When the power conditions fluctuate outside of the predefined windows, the UPS switches to online/double-conversion operation.&lt;ref name="HPman" /&gt; In double-conversion mode the UPS can adjust for voltage variations without having to use battery power, can filter out line noise and control frequency. 

===Ferroresonant===

Ferroresonant units operate in the same way as a standby UPS unit; however, they are online with the exception that a [[Voltage regulator#Constant-voltage transformer|ferroresonant transformer]], is used to filter the output. This transformer is designed to hold energy long enough to cover the time between switching from line power to battery power and effectively eliminates the transfer time. Many ferroresonant UPSs are 82–88% efficient (AC/DC-AC) and offer excellent isolation.

The transformer has three windings, one for ordinary mains power, the second for rectified battery power, and the third for output AC power to the load.

This once was the dominant type of UPS and is limited to around the {{nowrap|150 kVA}} range. These units are still mainly used in some industrial settings (oil and gas, petrochemical, chemical, utility, and heavy industry markets) due to the robust nature of the UPS. Many ferroresonant UPSs utilizing controlled ferro technology may not interact with power-factor-correcting equipment.{{Elucidate|date=May 2012}}

===DC power===

A UPS designed for powering DC equipment is very similar to an online UPS, except that it does not need an output inverter. Also, if the UPS's battery voltage is matched with the voltage the device needs, the device's power supply will not be needed either. Since one or more power conversion steps are eliminated, this increases efficiency and run time.

Many systems used in telecommunications use an [[extra-low voltage]] "[[common battery]]" 48&amp;nbsp;V DC power, because it has less restrictive safety regulations, such as being installed in conduit and junction boxes. DC has typically been the dominant power source for telecommunications, and AC has typically been the dominant source for computers and servers.

There has been much experimentation with 48&amp;nbsp;V DC power for computer servers, in the hope of reducing the likelihood of failure and the cost of equipment. However, to supply the same amount of power, the current would be higher than an equivalent 115&amp;nbsp;V or 230&amp;nbsp;V circuit; greater current requires larger conductors, or more energy lost as heat.

A laptop computer is a classic example of a PC with a DC UPS built in.

High voltage DC (380&amp;nbsp;V) is finding use in some data center applications, and allows for small power conductors, but is subject to the more complex electrical code rules for safe containment of high voltages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=My Ton (Ecos Consulting), Brian Fortenbery (EPRI), William Tschudi (LNBL)|url=http://hightech.lbl.gov/documents/DATA_CENTERS/DCDemoFinalReport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820050448/http://hightech.lbl.gov/documents/DATA_CENTERS/DCDemoFinalReport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-08-20|title=DC Power for Improved Data Center Efficiency|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|date=January 2007}}  &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotary ===

A rotary UPS uses the inertia of a high-mass spinning [[flywheel]] ([[flywheel energy storage]]) to provide short-term ''ride-through'' in the event of power loss. The flywheel also acts as a buffer against power spikes and sags, since such short-term power events are not able to appreciably affect the rotational speed of the high-mass flywheel. It is also one of the oldest designs, predating vacuum tubes and integrated circuits.

It can be considered to be ''on line'' since it spins continuously under normal conditions. However, unlike a battery-based UPS, flywheel-based UPS systems typically provide 10 to 20 seconds of protection before the flywheel has slowed and power output stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Active Power|url=http://i.activepower.com/marketing/External%20Documents/Marketing%20Materials/White%20Papers/English/WP%20107%2015%20Seconds%20vs%2015%20Minutes.pdf|title=15 Seconds versus 15 Minutes: White Paper 107 Designing for High Availability}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally used in conjunction with standby &lt;!-- not necessarily :diesel--&gt; generators, providing backup power only for the brief period of time the engine needs to start running and stabilize its output.

The rotary UPS is generally reserved for applications needing more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;W of protection, to justify the expense and benefit from the advantages rotary UPS systems bring. A larger flywheel or multiple flywheels operating in parallel will increase the reserve running time or capacity.

Because the flywheels are a mechanical power source, it is not necessary to use an electric motor or generator as an intermediary between it and a diesel engine designed to provide emergency power. By using a transmission gearbox, the rotational inertia of the flywheel can be used to directly start up a diesel engine, and once running, the diesel engine can be used to directly spin the flywheel. Multiple flywheels can likewise be connected in parallel through mechanical [[countershaft]]s, without the need for separate motors and generators for each flywheel.

They are normally designed to provide very high current output compared to a purely electronic UPS, and are better able to provide inrush current for inductive loads such as motor startup or compressor loads, as well as medical MRI and [[cath lab]] equipment. It is also able to tolerate short-circuit conditions up to 17 times larger than an electronic UPS, permitting one device to blow a fuse and fail while other devices still continue to be powered from the rotary UPS.

Its life cycle is usually far greater than a purely electronic UPS, up to 30 years or more. But they do require periodic downtime for mechanical maintenance, such as [[ball bearing]] replacement. In larger systems redundancy of the system ensures the availability of processes during this maintenance. Battery-based designs do not require downtime if the batteries can be [[Hot swapping|hot-swapped]], which is usually the case for larger units. Newer rotary units use technologies such as [[magnetic bearing]]s and air-evacuated enclosures to increase standby efficiency and reduce maintenance to very low levels.

Typically, the high-mass flywheel is used in conjunction with a [[motor-generator]] system. These units can be configured as:
# A motor driving a mechanically connected generator,&lt;ref name="Rotary UPS" /&gt;
# A combined [[synchronous motor]] and generator wound in alternating slots of a single rotor and stator,
# A hybrid rotary UPS, designed similar to an online UPS, except that it uses the flywheel in place of batteries. The rectifier drives a motor to spin the flywheel, while a generator uses the flywheel to power the inverter.

In case No.&amp;nbsp;3 the motor generator can be synchronous/synchronous or induction/synchronous. The motor side of the unit in case Nos.&amp;nbsp;2 and 3 can be driven directly by an AC power source (typically when in inverter bypass), a 6-step double-conversion motor drive, or a 6-pulse inverter. Case No.&amp;nbsp;1 uses an integrated flywheel as a short-term energy source instead of batteries to allow time for external, electrically coupled gensets to start and be brought online. Case Nos.&amp;nbsp;2 and 3 can use batteries or a free-standing electrically coupled flywheel as the short-term energy source.

UPS systems come in several different forms and sizes. However, the two most common forms are tower and rack-mount.&lt;ref&gt;Tripp Lite: UPS Buying Guide, http://www.tripplite.com/products/ups-Buying-Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tower model===
Tower models stand upright on the ground or on a desk/shelf, and are typically used in network workstations or desktop computer applications.

===Rack-mount model===
Rack-mount models can be mounted in standard 19" rack enclosures and can require anywhere from 1U to 12U (rack space). They are typically used in server and networking applications.

==Applications==

===N+1===
In large business environments where reliability is of great importance, a single huge UPS can also be a single point of failure that can disrupt many other systems. To provide greater reliability, multiple smaller UPS modules and batteries can be integrated together to provide [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] power protection equivalent to one very large UPS. "N+1" means that if the load can be supplied by N modules, the installation will contain N+1 modules. In this way, failure of one module will not impact system operation.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed explanation of optimized N+1 configurations{{cite web|url=http://www.emersonnetworkpower-partner.com/ArticleDocuments/172/Balancing%20Scalability%20and%20Reliability%20in%20the%20Critical%20Power%20System.pdf.aspx|format=PDF|title=Balancing Scalability and Reliability in the Critical Power System: When Does N + 1 Become Too Many + 1?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221250/http://www.emersonnetworkpower-partner.com/ArticleDocuments/172/Balancing%20Scalability%20and%20Reliability%20in%20the%20Critical%20Power%20System.pdf.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple redundancy===
Many computer servers offer the option of redundant power supplies, so that in the event of one power supply failing, one or more other power supplies are able to power the load. This is a critical point – each power supply must be able to power the entire server by itself.

Redundancy is further enhanced by plugging each power supply into a different circuit (i.e. to a different [[circuit breaker]]).

Redundant protection can be extended further yet by connecting each power supply to its own UPS. This provides double protection from both a power supply failure and a UPS failure, so that continued operation is assured. This configuration is also referred to as 1+1 or 2N redundancy. If the budget does not allow for two identical UPS units then it is common practice to plug one power supply into [[mains power]] and the other into the UPS.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed explanation of UPS redundancy options{{cite web|url=http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/High-Availability%20Power%20Systems,%20Part%20II_Redundancy%20Options.pdf|format=PDF|title=High-Availability Power Systems, Part II: Redundancy Options}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor use===
When a UPS system is placed outdoors, it should have some specific features that guarantee that it can tolerate weather without any effects on performance. Factors such as temperature, [[humidity]], rain, and snow among others should be considered by the manufacturer when designing an outdoor UPS system. [[Operating temperature]] ranges for outdoor UPS systems could be around −40&amp;nbsp;°C to +55&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to safety standard IEC 60950-22 or a local derivative according to location e.g. EN 60950-22 (Europe); UL 60950-22 (USA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor UPS systems can either be pole, ground (pedestal), or host mounted. Outdoor environment could mean extreme cold, in which case the outdoor UPS system should include a battery heater mat, or extreme heat, in which case the outdoor UPS system should include a fan system or an air conditioning system.

[[File:Sunny Boy 3000.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Internal view of a solar inverter. Note the many large capacitors (blue cylinders), used to store energy briefly and improve the output waveform.]]
A '''solar inverter''', or '''PV inverter''', or '''solar converter''', converts the variable [[direct current]] (DC) output of a [[photovoltaic]] (PV) [[solar panel]] into a [[utility frequency]] [[alternating current]] (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical [[utility grid|grid]] or used by a local, [[off-grid]] electrical network. It is a critical [[Balance of system|BOS]]–component in a [[photovoltaic system]], allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including [[maximum power point tracking]] and anti-[[islanding]] protection.

== Power factor ==
{{see also|Power factor}}

A problem in the combination of a double-conversion UPS and a generator is the voltage distortion created by the UPS. The input of a double-conversion UPS is essentially a big rectifier. The current drawn by the UPS is non-sinusoidal. This can cause the voltage from the AC mains or a generator to also become non-sinusoidal. The voltage distortion then can cause problems in all electrical equipment connected to that power source, including the UPS itself. It will also cause more power to be lost in the wiring supplying power to the UPS due to the spikes in current flow. This level of "noise" is measured as a percentage of "[[Total harmonic distortion|total harmonic distortion of the current]]" (THD&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;). Classic UPS rectifiers have a THD&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; level of around 25%–30%. To reduce voltage distortion, this requires heavier mains wiring or generators more than twice as large as the UPS.

There are several solutions to reduce the THD&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; in a double-conversion UPS:

Classic solutions such as passive filters reduce THD&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; to 5%–10% at full load. They are reliable, but big and only work at full load, and present their own problems when used in tandem with generators.

An alternative solution is an active filter. Through the use of such a device, THD&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; can drop to 5% over the full power range. The newest technology in double-conversion UPS units is a rectifier that does not use classic rectifier components (thyristors and diodes) but uses high-frequency components instead. A double-conversion UPS with an [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] rectifier and inductor can have a THD&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; as small as 2%. This completely eliminates the need to oversize the generator (and transformers), without additional filters, investment cost, losses, or space.

==Communication==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

[[Power management]] (PM) requires
# The UPS to report its status to the computer it powers via a communications link such as a [[RS-232|serial port]], [[Ethernet]] and [[Simple Network Management Protocol]], GSM/[[GPRS]] or [[USB]]
# A subsystem in the [[Operating system|OS]] that processes the reports and generates notifications, PM events, or commands an ordered shut down.&lt;ref name="tldp_aen187"&gt;Raymond, Eric Steven. [http://tldp.org/HOWTO/UPS-HOWTO/x142.html#AEN187 UPS HOWTO, section 3.3]. The Linux Documentation Project, 2003–2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some UPS manufacturers publish their communication protocols, but other manufacturers (such as [[American Power Conversion|APC]]) use [[proprietary protocol]]s.

The basic computer-to-UPS control methods are intended for one-to-one signaling from a single source to a single target. For example, a single UPS may connect to a single computer to provide status information about the UPS, and allow the computer to control the UPS. Similarly, the USB protocol is also intended to connect a single computer to multiple peripheral devices.

In some situations it is useful for a single large UPS to be able to communicate with several protected devices. For traditional serial or USB control, a ''signal replication'' device may be used, which for example allows one UPS to connect to five computers using serial or USB connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Generex|quote=Multi-XS is an active RS232 data switch, designed to handle serial communications of one UPS with up to 5 / 10 computers|url=http://www.generex.de/generex/download/manuals/manual_MULTIXS_en.pdf|title=Multi-XS User Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the splitting is typically only one direction from UPS to the devices to provide status information. Return control signals may only be permitted from one of the protected systems to the UPS.&lt;ref&gt;APC AP9207 Share-UPS, User Manual, pp. 6–7, ''Port 1 is called the Advanced port because it supplies smart signaling, which provides the advanced capabilities available to a server running PowerChute plus software.

As Ethernet has increased in common use since the 1990s, control signals are now commonly sent between a single UPS and multiple computers using standard Ethernet data communication methods such as [[TCP/IP]].&lt;ref&gt;An example of an Ethernet UPS controller: [http://emersonnetworkpower.com/EN-US/PRODUCTS/MONITORING/FORLARGEDATACENTER/ADVANCEDMONITORING/Pages/LiebertIntelliSlotWebCardCommunicationsInterfaceCard.aspx Liebert IntelliSlot Web Card Communications Interface Card]&lt;/ref&gt; The status and control information is typically encrypted so that for example an outside hacker can not gain control of the UPS and command it to shut down.&lt;ref&gt;APC Application Note #67 {{cite web|url=http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/VAVR-5ZJSVU_R2_EN.pdf |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424231216/http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/VAVR-5ZJSVU_R2_EN.pdf |archivedate=April 24, 2012 |title= APC Network Management Card Security Implementation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution of UPS status and control data requires that all intermediary devices such as Ethernet switches or serial multiplexers be powered by one or more UPS systems, in order for the UPS alerts to reach the target systems during a [[power outage]]. To avoid the dependency on Ethernet infrastructure, the UPSs can be connected directly to main control server by using GSM/GPRS channel also. The SMS or GPRS data packets sent from UPSs trigger software to shut down the PCs to reduce the load.

==Batteries==
[[image:EPS 6000 Battery Cabinet.jpg|thumb|right|Battery cabinet]]
There are three main types of UPS batteries: Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA), Flooded Cell or VLA batteries,Lithium Ion batteries.
The run-time for a battery-operated UPS depends on the type and size of batteries and rate of discharge, and the efficiency of the inverter. The total capacity of a [[lead–acid battery]] is a function of the rate at which it is discharged, which is described as [[Peukert's law]].

Manufacturers supply run-time rating in minutes for packaged UPS systems. Larger systems (such as for data centers) require detailed calculation of the load, inverter efficiency, and battery characteristics to ensure the required endurance is attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=How to calculate battery run-time
|publisher=PowerStream Technologies
|accessdate=2010-04-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common battery characteristics and load testing ===
When a lead–acid battery is charged or discharged, this initially affects only the reacting chemicals, which are at the interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte.  With time, the charge stored in the chemicals at the interface, often called "interface charge", spreads by [[diffusion]] of these chemicals throughout the volume of the active material.

If a battery has been completely discharged (e.g. the car lights were left on overnight) and next is given a fast charge for only a few minutes, then during the short charging time it develops only a charge near the interface.  The battery voltage may rise to be close to the charger voltage so that the charging current decreases significantly.  After a few hours this interface charge will spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte, leading to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saslow|first=Wayne M.|title=Electricity, Magnetism, and Light|year=2002|publisher=Thomson Learning|location=Toronto|isbn=0-12-619455-6 |pages=302–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the interface charge, brief UPS ''self-test'' functions lasting only a few seconds may not accurately reflect the true runtime capacity of a UPS, and instead an extended ''recalibration'' or ''rundown'' test that deeply discharges the battery is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maintaining Mission Critical Systems in a 24/7 Environment|author= Peter M. Curtis|pages=261–262 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GVczgy4BkU8C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=ups+battery+rundown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mOxqN2Jma7&amp;sig=dHfjr2fql5WFvvotq8gR6UzxGbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=R6HBTvDNAcK02gW96cC8BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CHEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ups%20battery%20rundown&amp;f=false|year=2011|isbn=9781118041628|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deep discharge testing is itself damaging to batteries due to the chemicals in the discharged battery starting to [[crystallize]] into highly stable molecular shapes that will not re-dissolve when the battery is recharged, permanently reducing charge capacity. In lead acid batteries this is known as [[Lead-acid battery#Sulfation and desulfation|sulfation]] but also affects other types such as [[nickel cadmium batteries]] and [[lithium batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Emergency and backup power sources: preparing for blackouts and brownouts|author= Michael F.

=== Testing of strings of batteries/cells ===
Multi-[[kilowatt]] commercial UPS systems with large and easily accessible battery banks are capable of isolating and testing individual cells within a ''battery string'', which consists of either combined-cell battery units (such as 12-V lead acid batteries) or individual chemical cells wired in series. Isolating a single cell and installing a jumper in place of it allows the one battery to be discharge-tested, while the rest of the battery string remains charged and available to provide protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Data Center Journal|title=Maintaining and Testing Your UPS System to Ensure Continuous Power, Section: Maintaining a Battery Bank|url=http://www.datacenterjournal.com/facilities-news/306-electricalElectrical/2639-maintaining-and-testing-your-ups-system-to-ensure-continuous-power}} {{dead link|date=July 2016}} {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to measure the electrical characteristics of individual cells in a battery string, using intermediate sensor wires that are installed at every cell-to-cell junction, and monitored both individually and collectively. Battery strings may also be wired as series-parallel, for example two sets of 20 cells. In such a situation it is also necessary to monitor current flow between parallel strings, as current may circulate between the strings to balance out the effects of weak cells, dead cells with high resistance, or shorted cells. For example, stronger strings can discharge through weaker strings until voltage imbalances are equalized, and this must be factored into the individual inter-cell measurements within each string.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120401023942/http://www.btechinc.com/btech-focus-battery%20failure.shtml BTECH Inc, BTECH's Focus – Predicting Battery Failure] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20140622185615/http://www.btechinc.com/docs/S5/S5%20Installation%20Manual.pdf Installation Manual], page 18, showing sensor wires for each cell/battery on a battery string, and also note that the current transducer sensors to detect cross-string series-parallel current recirculation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Series-parallel battery interactions ===
Battery strings wired in [[Series and parallel circuits|series-parallel]] can develop unusual failure modes due to interactions between the multiple parallel strings. Defective batteries in one string can adversely affect the operation and lifespan of good or new batteries in other strings. These issues also apply to other situations where series-parallel strings are used, not just in UPS systems but also in [[electric vehicle]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpoweruk.com/balancing.htm mpoweruk.com], Battery and Energy Technologies, Cell Balancing, Woodbank Communications Ltd, Chester, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a series-parallel battery arrangement with all good cells, and one becomes shorted or dead:
* The failed cell will reduce the maximum developed voltage for the entire series string it is within.
* Other series strings wired in parallel with the degraded string will now discharge through the degraded string until their voltage matches the voltage of the degraded string, potentially overcharging and leading to [[electrolyte]] boiling and outgassing from the remaining good cells in the degraded string. These parallel strings can now never be fully recharged, as the increased voltage will bleed off through the string containing the failed battery.
* Charging systems may attempt to gauge battery string capacity by measuring overall voltage. Due to the overall string voltage depletion due to the dead cells, the charging system may detect this as a state of discharge, and will continuously attempt to charge the series-parallel strings, which leads to continuous overcharging and damage to all the cells in the degraded series string containing the damaged battery.
* If [[lead–acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] are used, all cells in the formerly good parallel strings will begin to sulfate due to the inability for them to be fully recharged, resulting in the storage capacity of these cells being permanently damaged, even if the damaged cell in the one degraded string is eventually discovered and replaced with a new one.

The only way to prevent these subtle series-parallel string interactions is by not using parallel strings at all and using separate charge controllers and inverters for individual series strings.

=== Series new/old battery interactions ===
Even just a single string of batteries wired in series can have adverse interactions if new batteries are mixed with old batteries. Older batteries tend to have reduced storage capacity, and so will both discharge faster than new batteries and also charge to their maximum capacity more rapidly than new batteries.

As a mixed string of new and old batteries is depleted, the string voltage will drop, and when the old batteries are exhausted the new batteries still have charge available. The newer cells may continue to discharge through the rest of the string, but due to the low voltage this energy flow may not be useful, and may be wasted in the old cells as resistance heating.

For cells that are supposed to operate within a specific discharge window, new cells with more capacity may cause the old cells in the series string to continue to discharge beyond the safe bottom limit of the discharge window, damaging the old cells.

When recharged, the old cells recharge more rapidly, leading to a rapid rise of voltage to near the fully charged state, but before the new cells with more capacity have fully recharged. The charge controller detects the high voltage of a nearly fully charged string and reduces current flow. The new cells with more capacity now charge very slowly, so slowly that the chemicals may begin to crystallize before reaching the fully charged state, reducing new cell capacity over several charge/discharge cycles until their capacity more closely matches the old cells in the series string.

For such reasons, some industrial UPS management systems recommend periodic replacement of entire battery arrays potentially using hundreds of expensive batteries, due to these damaging interactions between new batteries and old batteries, within and across series and parallel strings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://datapowermonitoring.com/pdfs/battery_asset_mgmt.pdf datapowermonitoring.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406210343/https://datapowermonitoring.com/pdfs/battery_asset_mgmt.pdf |date=2013-04-06 }}, Battery Asset Management: VRLA ageing characteristics, Bart Cotton, founder and CEO, Data Power Monitoring Corporation, ''Batteries International'', Jan 2005 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Solar Challenge''' or the '''Bridgestone World Solar Challenge''' since 2013 due to the sponsorship of [[Bridgestone Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bwsc.bridgestone/passion/sponsorship.html Bridgestone Website]&lt;/ref&gt; is a biennial [[Solar car racing|solar-powered car race]] which covers {{convert|3022|km|mi|abbr=on}} through the Australian [[Outback]], from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Northern Territory]] to [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/ WSC website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by [[university|universities]] or [[corporation]]s although some are fielded by [[high school]]s. The race has a 30-year history spanning thirteen races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987.

The 30th anniversary event was held October 8–15, 2017.

== Objective ==
The objective of this competition is to promote research on [[solar vehicle|solar-powered cars]]. Teams from universities and enterprises participate. In 2015, 43 teams from 23 countries competed in the race.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150613003450/http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/team_info/2015_team_list WSC 2015 team list]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Racing strategy ==
Efficient balancing of power resources and power consumption is the key to success during the race. At any moment in time the optimal driving speed depends on the weather forecast and the remaining capacity of the batteries. The team members in the escort cars will continuously remotely retrieve data from the solar car about its condition and use these data as input for prior developed computer programs to work out the best driving strategy.

It is equally important to charge the batteries as much as possible in periods of daylight when the car is not racing. To capture as much solar energy as possible, the solar panels are generally directed such that these are perpendicular to the incident sun rays. Sometimes the whole solar array is tilted for this purpose.

== Important rules ==
*The timed portion of the race stops at the outskirts of Adelaide, 2998&amp;nbsp;km from Darwin. However, for the timings recorded at that point to count, competitors must reach the official finish line in the centre of the city under solar power alone.
*As the race is over public roads, the cars have to adhere to the normal traffic regulations; however, there is a special note in the official regulations remarking on the tendency of drivers to take advantage of a favourable road camber in order to capture the maximum amount of solar energy. After midday when the sun is in the west, it would be advantageous to drive on the right side of the highway, provided, of course, there is no traffic in opposite direction.
*A minimum of 2 and maximum 4 drivers have to be registered. If the weight of a driver (including clothes) is less than {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, ballast will be added to make up the difference.
*Driving time is between 8:00 and 17:00 (from 8&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5&amp;nbsp;p.m.). In order to select a suitable place for the overnight stop (alongside the highway) it is possible to extend the driving period for a maximum of 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, which extra driving time will be compensated by a starting time delay the next day.
*At various points along the route there are checkpoints where every car has to pause for 30&amp;nbsp;minutes. Only limited maintenance tasks (no repairs) are allowed during these compulsory stops.
*The capacity of the batteries is limited to a mass for each chemistry (such as Lithium Ion) equivalent to approximately 5&amp;nbsp;kWh maximum. At the start of the race, the batteries may be fully charged. Batteries may not be replaced during the competition, except in the situation of a breakdown. However, in that case a penalty time will apply.
*Except for the maximum outer dimensions, there are no further restrictions on the design and construction of the car.
*The deceleration of the dual braking system must be at least 3.8&amp;nbsp;m/s² (149.6 in/s²).

=== Rule evolution ===
*By 2005, several teams were handicapped by the South Australian speed limit of {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, as well as the difficulties of support crews keeping up with {{convert|130|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} race vehicles. It was generally agreed that the challenge of building a solar vehicle capable of crossing Australia at vehicular speeds had been met and exceeded. A new challenge was set: to build a new generation of solar car, which, with little modification, could be the basis for a practical proposition for sustainable transport.
*Entrants to the 2007 race chose between racing in the Adventure and Challenge classes. Challenge class cars were restricted to 6&amp;nbsp;square meters of [[Silicon|Si]] solar collectors (a 25% reduction), and later to 3&amp;nbsp;square meters for [[GaAs]], driver access and egress were required to be unaided, seating position upright, steering controlled with a steering wheel, and many new safety requirements were added. Competitors also had to adhere to the new {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} speed limit across the [[Northern Territory]] portion of the [[Stuart Highway]]. The 2007 event again featured a range of supplementary classes, including the Greenfleet class, which features a range of non-solar energy-efficient vehicles exhibiting their fuel efficiency.
*For the 2009 challenge class several new rules were adopted, including the use of profiled tyres. Battery weight limits depend on secondary cell chemistries so that competitors have similar energy storage capabilities. Battery mass is now 20&amp;nbsp;kg for [[Li-ion battery|Li-ion]] and [[Lithium polymer battery|Li-polymer battery]] (was reduced from 25 and 21&amp;nbsp;kg in the past).
*In 2013, a new Cruiser Class was introduced. The race took place in four stages. Final placings were based on a combination of time taken (56.6%), number of passengers carried (5.7%), battery energy from the grid between stages (18.9%), and a subjective assessment of practicality (18.9%)
*In the 2015 Cruiser Class regulations, the scoring formula emphasized practicality less than before. Elapsed time will account for 70% of the score, passengers 5%, grid energy use 15%, and practicality 10%.
*In 2017, solar array areas were reduced, and the Cruiser Class was changed to a Regularity Trial, with scoring based on energy efficiency and practicality.

== History ==
The idea for the competition originates from Danish-born adventurer [[Hans Tholstrup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An epic journey revisited|url=https://pateblog.nma.gov.au/2016/09/08/an-epic-journey-revisited/|website=The People &amp; Environment Blog|publisher=National Museum of Australia|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Courtney|title=RACING; Here They Come, as Fast as the Sun Will Carry Them|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/22/automobiles/racing-here-they-come-as-fast-as-the-sun-will-carry-them.html|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The New York Times|date=22 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to circumnavigate the Australian continent in a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} open boat. At a later stage in his life he became involved in various competitions with fuel saving cars and trucks. Already in the 1980s, he became aware of the necessity to explore sustainable energy as a replacement for the limited available fossil fuel. Sponsored by BP, he designed the world's first solar car, called [[The Quiet Achiever]], and traversed the {{convert|4052|km|mi|abbr=on}} between [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]] in 20&amp;nbsp;days. That was the precursor of the World Solar Challenge.

After the 4th race, he sold the rights to the state of South Australia and leadership of the race was assumed by Chris Selwood.

The race was held every three years until 1999 when it was switched to every two years.

=== 1987 ===
The first edition of the World Solar Challenge was run in 1987 when the winning entry, [[General Motors Corporation|GM]]'s [[Sunraycer]] won with an average speed of {{convert|67|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://140.112.14.7/~ifplab/solar/team.htm#1987 ifp lab site]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Australia]]'s "Sunchaser" came in second. The "[[Solar Resource]]", which came in 7th overall, was first in the Private Entry category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wakefield |first=E.H. |title=History of the Electric Automobile: Hybrid Electric Vehicles |publisher=SAE International |location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 World Solar Challenge featured the introduction of the Cruiser Class, which comprised more 'practical' solar cars with 2–4 occupants. The inaugural winner was Solar Team Eindhoven's ''[[Stella (solar vehicles)|Stella]]'' from [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] in the [[Netherlands]] with an average speed of {{convert|74.52|km/h|mph|2|abbr=on}}, while the second place team was the ''SunCruiser'' from Hochschule Bochum in Germany, who inspired{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} the creation of the Cruiser Class by racing more practical solar cars in previous WSC races. The Australian team, the [[University of New South Wales]] solar racing team [[Sunswift]] was the fastest competitor to complete the race, but was awarded third place overall after points were awarded for 'practicality' and for carrying passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/files/493_final_results_sunday_cruiser_class.pdf WSC 2013 Cruiser class results]&lt;/ref&gt;
