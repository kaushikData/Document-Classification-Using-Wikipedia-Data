==History==
The flagship chapter of 826, 826 Valencia, opened in 2002, at 826 Valencia St. in the [[Mission District]] of [[San Francisco]]. The original address inspired the name 826 National. It was co-founded by educator [[Nínive Clements Calegari]] and author [[Dave Eggers]], who also founded the independent publishing house [[McSweeney's]].

In April 2010, Dave Eggers founded [[ScholarMatch]], a nonprofit organization that aims to make higher education possible for underserved youth. ScholarMatch coordinates students with various resources, donors, scholarships, and universities to aid in the financial undertaking of pursuing a college education.

Following the success and impact of 826 Valencia in its first two years, 826NYC opened its doors in 2004. In 2005, 826michigan, 826LA, and 826CHI were established, respectively. In 2007, 826 Boston joined the growing network, followed most recently by 826DC, which opened in 2010.&lt;ref name="Sally Holland"&gt;{{cite news

In 2008, a national office was established to support the chapters and act as a central hub of the 826 network. 826 National is an independent nonprofit organization that provides strategic leadership, administration, and other resources to ensure the success of its writing and tutoring centers.

In addition, there are fifty 826-inspired organizations across the globe. 826 Digital support educators through [[826digital.com|826 Digital]], a new online pay-what- you-wish platform designed to help teach and ignite a love of writing.826 National is the hub of the 826 Network: facilitating collaboration and alignment among our chapters, and bringing the 826 Network model and approach to new communities.

It offers books covering [[language arts]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[social studies]] tests. The company also produces transparencies, basic review books, and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] and [[SAT]] preparation books.

It currently publishes nearly 200 materials, most of them specifically developed for Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

==Company history==

American Book Company was founded in 1996 by Dr. Frank Pintozzi, a professor of reading and [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|English as a Second Language]] at [[Kennesaw State University]], and Colleen Pintozzi, a math teacher and supervisor of [[General Educational Development]] programs.

They began writing textbooks for nearby South Carolina. After finding success, they created more books for states across the country.

==Book Features==

American Book Company books have frequent references to standards provided by [[state education agency|state departments of education]]. Each book is based around multiple practice tests modeled after the relevant state test.

Many of the company's books include links to online modules curated by the [[National Science Teachers Association]]'s [http://www.scilinks.org/ sciLINKS] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= American Book Company Joins NSTA SciLinks Program|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS148364+27-May-2008+PRN20080527|publisher= [[Reuters]]|accessdate= March 11, 2009 | date=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validation Study==

In 2006, publishing [[consultant]] Lois Eskin Associates studied the effects of using American Book Company books to prepare for standardized tests. The goal of the study was to find if students were more likely to pass standardized tests after studying with American Book Company books. The study included schools in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas.

Results were positive, with every school showing success attributed to American Book Company. In particular, [[Tranquillity High School]] increased its pass rate on the [[CAHSEE]] by 135%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Validation Study of American Book Company’s High School Graduation Test Preparation Programs|url= http://www.americanbookcompany.com/pdfs/ABCValidationStudy.pdf|publisher= Lois Eskin Associates|accessdate= March 11, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219025929/http://americanbookcompany.com/pdfs/ABCValidationStudy.pdf| archivedate= 19 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andy Barrett''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Tai Hara]]. The character made his first screen appearance on 28 August 2013. Hara relocated to [[Sydney]] to take on the role. [[Kyle Pryor]] who plays fellow character [[Nate Cooper]] originally auditioned for the role. Andy and his half-brother [[Josh Barrett (Home and Away)|Josh]] (Jackson Gallagher) were introduced to viewers through a series of online [[webisodes]] titled ''Home and Away Extras'', prior to appearing in the main series. Andy is characterised as a troubled man because of his upbringing and disappearance of his father. Hara has described his character as "extremely unpredictable" and very protective of his brother. Andy has spent time in prison and causes trouble from his first episode. Andy's initial storyline was a feud with the Braxton family which had been ongoing before he was born. Through this story, writers involved Andy in crimes ranging from fights and car chases to explosions and shootings. Hara announced he would be departing from the show on 22 February 2016, after over three years in the role and Andy made his final appearance on 5 July 2016.

Producers created a romantic partnership between Andy and [[Hannah Wilson (Home and Away)|Hannah Wilson]] (Cassie Howarth). Their on/off relationship has been focused on heavily during his tenure. Andy is also involved in drug dealing which saw him temporarily separated from Hannah. His involvement leads to the death of [[Casey Braxton]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]), which prompts Andy to want to change his life. He sets on course to become a gym instructor, become literate and maintain a relationship with Hannah. The latter rarely goes well as they face problems such as Hannah's paralysis, her infidelity and Andy's temper. The character became popular with viewers as the Barrett brothers gained a fan-base. A reporter from ''The Daily Examiner'' said that Andy continually causes friction on the show. A writer from ''TV Soap'' noted that trouble follows Andy everywhere. They concluded that writers transformed the character from "rough customer" to "respectable citizen".

==Casting==
The character and Hara's casting was reported by Debbie Schipp from ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' on 3 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Barretts"/&gt; Hara relocated from [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] to [[Sydney]] to take on the role.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vrajlal|first1=Alicia|title=Home and Away's Tai Hara supports his Hi-5 star girlfriend Fely Irvine as she auditions for The Voice|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2616488/Home-Aways-Tai-Hara-supports-Hi-5-star-girlfriend-Fely-Irvine-auditions-The-Voice.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of being cast in ''Home and Away'', Hara commented "I thought how lucky I was. It's just a real privilege to be on a show that is so loved."&lt;ref name="Barretts"/&gt; Andy was introduced to the show along with his brother [[Josh Barrett (Home and Away)|Josh]] (Jackson Gallagher). The characters first appeared in online [[webisodes]], which explored their backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Barretts"/&gt; The Barretts were initially rivals of the Braxton brothers and Hara said "There is a lot of history behind both the families. I carry the secrets of what our whole relationship is with them."&lt;ref name="Barretts"/&gt; Andy's debut on the main show was broadcast on 28 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Barretts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/home-and-away-introduces-new-bad-boys-tai-hara-and-jackson-gallagher-with-innovative-webisodes/story-fni0cvc9-1226690688394|title=Home and Away introduces new bad boys Tai Hara and Jackson Gallagher with innovative webisodes|last=Schipp|first=Debbie|date=3 August 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British actor [[Kyle Pryor]] also auditioned for the role with an Australian accent. But producers thought he was better suited to the role of [[Nate Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gavin|last1=Scott|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Paging doctor sexy|date=21–27 September 2013|issue=38|pages=32, 33|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
{{quote|Andy's father was his world during his formative years in Mangrove River. So Johnny Barrett’s disappearance was a devastating blow. In the aftermath, the Barrett family fell to pieces. Thirteen-year-old Andy tried to step up but he struggled to cope. Andy continued to carry the stress with him to school and began lashing out. He soon landed in juvie.|source=An excerpt taken from the official ''Home and Away'' website outlining Andy's backstory.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Barrett|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/characters/andy-barrett/|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andy is characterised as an over-protective brother to Josh. He has an uncontrollable temper which leads gets him into trouble. His anger issues date back to the disappearance of his father which changed him and eventually led to him being reprimanded by the law.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He is a "feisty" resident of the infamous Mangrove River who "thinks with his fists before thinking of consequences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Hara (plays Andy Barrett)|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/clips/18572222/tai-hara-plays-andy-barrett-/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a "loose cannon" and harbours a "volatile mood" which has gained him a significant criminal history. They added that his attitude would only carry on adding to his criminality.&lt;ref name=arrive&gt;{{cite web|title=The Barrett Brothers arrive in Summer Bay|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/18593815/the-barrett-brothers-arrive-in-summer-bay/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hara told a [[Yahoo!7]] reporter that "he's an extremely unpredictable and protective character and regardless of his circumstances, family always comes first." Andy was forced to take care of Josh in the absence of their father. Hara added that "although sometimes he lacks morals and normal social behaviour, everything he does for his brother, despite how reckless, it comes from a place of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Hara|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/tai-hara/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Home and Away Extras''===
Andy and Josh were introduced to viewers in a series of four special online episodes titled ''Home and Away Extras'', which were made available online from 7 August.&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt; The episodes gave fans a chance to see the characters prior to their on-screen arrival. They were written by Supervising Script Producer, Louise Bowes and directed by Danny Raco.&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt;

A promotional article stated that the footage would reveal a shared history and angst with the established characters of [[Darryl Braxton|Brax]] ([[Steve Peacocke]]), [[Heath Braxton|Heath]] ([[Dan Ewing]]) and [[Casey Braxton]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]).&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt; To coincide with the content the show produced a series of additional content such as spoilers and cast interviews as extra promotion. Series Producer Lucy Addario created the "webisodes" because she wanted alternative ways for viewers to interact with the ''Home and Away'' brand.&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt; She added "we're going to reveal dramatic details of the characters' back-stories before they are introduced as a major storyline." ''Home and Away Extras'' completed its run on 26 August and Andy was introduced into the main show two days later.&lt;ref name=webisode&gt;{{cite web|title=Home and Away introduces new characters in web exclusive videos|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/18362277/home-and-away-introduces-new-characters-in-web-exclusive-videos/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feud with the Braxton family===
To introduce Andy and Josh into the main series ''Home and Away'' developed a feud storyline between the Barrett and the Braxton brothers. The established Braxton family were popular with viewers and garnered a large fan base. Hara was not worried about their popularity ruining the chances of his character being successful and believed the Barretts would gain their own fans. He warned that Andy does not get intimidated by no one and would comfortably rival the Braxton brothers.&lt;ref name=rival/&gt; Ewing told a ''TV Week'' reporter that the Braxtons would still be the "top dog" but the Barretts would give them "a run for their money". He believed his family had the advantage because they learned to carefully think about their actions whereas Andy is an "act first, think later" type of character.&lt;ref name=rival&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Unleash the beast|date=31 August – 6 September 2013|issue=35|pages=12, 13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline began when Josh meets [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]) at a party and she refuses to leave. Her friend Casey does not approve of Maddy trying to lose her virginity and starts an argument with Josh. Younes explained that Andy gets involved and they fight, but he manages to defuse the trouble. He added "Casey has no idea who these guys are. He's never met them, but they say that they have."&lt;ref name=crash/&gt; When Casey and Maddy drive away Andy decides to start a car chase and runs Casey's car off the road causing an accident and explosion. He is left with life changing injuries. The crash and subsequent explosion were big stunt scenes for the show. The car chase scenes Andy featured in were filmed at night on location down a narrow road, the cast described the shoot as a "scary" scenario.&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Heroes of the Bay|date=24–30 August 2013|issue=34|pages=10, 11|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Casey's brother Brax learns that Andy and Josh caused the accident he attacks Josh. [[Bianca Scott]] ([[Lisa Gormley]]) intervenes but Brax hits Andy instead. Hara stated that "hot head" Andy is not afraid of a fight or Brax because of his upbringing. Andy and Brax have known each other for a long time and there was "bad blood" between them. He added that "revenge is something they've all grown up with. You strike someone and they strike back. I think Andy will be prepared whatever happens."&lt;ref name=rival/&gt; Gallagher added that there is a "lot of unspoken history" between Andy and Brax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=You'll see me in my boardies a bit|date=31 August – 6 September 2013|issue=35|pages=52|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers then decided to cause a divide between the Barrett brothers and added a new dynamic between Brax and Josh. Realising that Josh is homeless, Brax asks Josh to stay at his home. Gallagher explained that it was Andy's hatred that influenced Josh's feelings towards the Braxtons. His attitude does not change but he begins to see another side to Brax. The actor added, "deep down he doesn't hold the same anger and resentment Andy does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gavin|last1=Scott|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Brax's truce|date=21–27 September 2013|issue=38|pages=15|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the effect the Barrett's arrival has on Brax becomes apparent and he visits [[Debbie Barrett]] (Olivia Pigeot) to confess that he killed Andy's step-father [[Johnny Barrett (Home and Away)|Johnny Barrett]] (Stephen Anderton). Andy attacks Brax in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Erin|last1=Miller|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Brax behind bars|date=28 September – 4 October 2013|issue=39|pages=10, 11|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Brax appears in court Andy considers shooting Brax. But Debbie steals the gun and tries to shoot Brax, but Josh is hit by the bullet but survives. The cast were not allowed to reveal who fired the shot before the episode aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Brax under fire|date=5–11 October 2013|issue=40|pages=12|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this Andy becomes jealous that Josh is spending all his time with Maddy and spikes her drink. A reporter from ''TV Week'' wrote that following Maddy behaving erratically Josh punches his brother for his crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Glen|last1=Williams|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Elsewhere in the Bay|date=16–22 November 2013|issue=46|pages=13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later development it is revealed that Johnny had slept with [[Cheryl Braxton]] (Suzi Dougherty) and had fathered Casey.&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; Andy was angry with this and Hara told Shayn from [[The Edge (New Zealand)|The Edge]] that "he is never going to be considered a Barrett in Andy's eyes" and "Brax is not happy to learn his mother slept with their dad". He also explained that the Barrett and Braxton feud had been going on long before Andy was born.&lt;ref name=radioint&gt;{{cite web|first1=Sharyn|last1=Clint|title=Home and Away's Andy Barrett|url=http://www.theedge.co.nz/Home-and-Aways-Andy-Barrett/tabid/155/articleID/31362/Default.aspx|website=[[The Edge (New Zealand)|The Edge]]|publisher=([[MediaWorks New Zealand]])|accessdate=19 June 2015|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug dealing===
The show decided to begin Andy's journey through 2014 by exploring his "dark past". A guest character, [[List of Home and Away characters (2014)#Sean Green|Sean Green]] ([[Khan Chittenden]]) was introduced on-screen as Andy's old prison enemy.&lt;ref name=gym/&gt; He targets Andy's livelihood by vandalising the gym he works at. Hara told Miller that it comes at a point in Andy's life when things were "looking up for him". It becomes apparent that Sean wants revenge because Andy made a deal to leave jail at Sean's expense by naming him for a crime. He threatens to hurt Josh and Maddy if he does not tell the truth.&lt;ref name=gym/&gt; Hara added that "Andy feels responsible for putting them at risk, he doesn't want Josh involved in this." Andy tries to reason with Sean but he gathers a gang to punish the character.&lt;ref name=gym&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Erin|date=1–7 February 2014|title=Blast from the past!|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|issue=5|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline marked a turning point of the Braxton/Barrett feud as Casey gathers his family to help Andy and [[Kyle Braxton]] ([[Nic Westaway]]) rescues him by attacking Sean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Violent siege|journal=Soap World|date=March 2014|pages=10|publisher=[[nextmedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show created a drug dealing storyline for Andy, which saw him trying to raise money to move out of the Summer Bay caravan park. He begins selling marijuana but his girlfriend [[Hannah Wilson (Home and Away)|Hannah Wilson]] (Cassie Howarth) destroys the drugs when she finds them in her home. This gets Andy into debt with the drug gang.&lt;ref name=deal/&gt; In retaliation Josh is seriously assaulted by the gang. Hara told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter that Andy knows that the attack on Josh is a warning.&lt;ref name=beat/&gt; He added that "he's incredibly protective of his little brother, so of course he feels responsible for what's happened." Despite Josh becoming involved in his predicament he cannot afford to pay his debt. Hara explained that his character is "dead broke" and "in some deep debt".&lt;ref name=beat&gt;{{cite journal|title=Josh is beaten up!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=13–19 September 2014|issue=36|pages=31|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline developed chaotically as Andy's debt continued to grow. He believes he can prolong paying his suppliers off by meeting up with them and pleading for more time. Hara said that it does not go according to plan and Andy is left with severe injuries following an assault and being thrown from a moving vehicle.&lt;ref name=car/&gt; The story sees Andy turning to Casey for help, Hara explained Andy's out-of-character actions were because the dealers are "unpredictable so everyone close to Andy is at risk." The storyline made way for a different dynamic between Andy and "arch-nemisis" Brax as he is forced to accept money from him to clear his debts. But Hara warned that his character would become more erratic, adding "Andy's heading down a path of self-destruction - and someone will pay for his mistakes."&lt;ref name=car&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andy's big mistake|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=4–10 October 2014|issue=39|pages=30|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brynmor Pattison from the ''[[Irish Mirror]]'' observed the storyline as a "dramatic development that pulls many other characters into a vortex of trouble." While Hara explained that the drug dealing "will cause a domino effect that implicates numerous people and puts their lives at risk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pattison|first1=Brynmor|title=Home And Away spoilers: Every cast members' 'lives at risk' with trouble brewing in Summer Bay|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/whats-on/whats-on-news/home-away-spoilers-every-cast-4036604|website=[[Irish Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=28 March 2015|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casey's death===
The main dealer is revealed to be [[Jake Pirovic]] ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]), unbeknownst to him the sworn enemy of the Braxton family. He uses Andy in his plan to enact revenge on Brax for killing his brother, [[Hammer Pirovic|Hammer]] ([[Benedict Samuel]]) . But when Andy tries to defy him, Josh is kidnapped and Andy if forced to beg Casey for help.&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; Gallagher explained that Stephen Downie (''TV Week'') that Andy does not realise the severity of his involvement with Jake. He added that the storyline was "very heavy" viewing.&lt;ref name=table&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Kidnapped again|date=6–12 September 2014|issue=36|pages=13|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hara said that Andy no longer wants anything to do with Jake because "he's exploited and manipulated him into a situation that seems irreversible."&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; The interviewers questioned why Casey would want to help Andy after his constant trouble making. Younes explained that his character "sees the best in Andy" and wants him to change his life for the better.&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; When Casey realises that Jake is involved he tries to keep Brax out of the situation. But he fails and Andy, Brax, Casey and Kyle end up in a fatal confrontation with Jake. ''Home and Away's'' producers put an embargo on which character would be killed off in the scenes. They kept viewers guessing by confirming one character at the scene would definitely die. Following a shooting, Casey dies in Brax's arms.&lt;ref name=uses&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Murder!|date=13–19 September 2014|issue=37|pages=12, 13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hara told Chantay Logan of the ''[[Gold Coast Bulletin]]'' that many fans were "devastated" following the death of Casey. But he noted that "a lot of them were sticking up for me too, there’s not that much hate there. It’ll be interesting to see if the audience goes along on the rest of Andy’s journey with him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Logan|first1=Chantay|title=Former Gold Coaster Tai Hara has his work cut out for him with Dancing with the Stars and Home &amp; Away gigs|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/entertainment/former-gold-coaster-tai-hara-has-his-work-cut-out-for-him-with-dancing-with-the-stars-and-home-away-gigs/story-fnj94hgr-1227079061877|website=[[Gold Coast Bulletin]]|publisher=([[News Corp Australia]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Hill from the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' reported that Andy and Brax would team up to avenge Casey's death. But a high speed car chase results in a crash. Hara stated that "Andy and Brax need to end this before more people get killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Susan|title=Home and Away: Darryl Braxton plots revenge as he reaches a collision course with Jake|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/402192/Home-and-Away-Darryl-Braxton-plots-revenge-as-he-reaches-a-collision-course-with-Jake|website=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=([[Northern &amp; Shell]])|accessdate=28 March 2015|date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Jake dead, Andy is left to face the wrath of other characters. But Brax is forgiving of his one-time-nemesis. Hara explained that "Brax doesn't blame Andy for what happened to Casey. He understands that Andy was manipulated by Jake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Playing with fire|date=27 September – 3 October 2014|issue=39|pages=16, 17|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Hannah Wilson===
[[File:Cassie Howarth.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Cassie Howarth (''pictured'') plays Andy's love interest Hannah Wilson.]]
The show decided to renew the partnership between Andy and Hannah. She asks Andy to meet with her, feeling confused Andy asks [[Denny Miller (Home and Away)|Denny Miller]] (Jessica Grace Smith) how Hannah feels. But Denny still blames Andy for Casey's death and lies to him. Andy sleeps with [[Neive Devlin]] ([[Jolene Anderson]]) in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Love hotel|date=22–28 November 2014|issue=47|pages=15|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah is involved in a bus crash and is told she may never walk again. One aspect of the storyline showed Andy afraid to have sex with Hannah in case he hurt her due to her disability. Howarth was unhappy when she received the scripts because she believed that there were other topics that their storyline could have explored. But writers told Howarth that it is a "very real situation" and one they felt ''Home and Away'' needed to portray.&lt;ref name=writers/&gt; Hannah presumes that she has become a burden on Andy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are the Palmers leaving?|url=http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/news/articles/2015/3/are-the-palmers-leaving/|website=[[TV Week]]|publisher=([[Bauer Media Group]])|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wants to have sex and Andy's reluctance leaves Hannah feeling dejected. Howarth told an ''Inside Soap'' writer that Andy "freaks out" when Hannah tries to be intimate. They do not have the same physical relationship they once shared so he finds it "strange".&lt;ref name=dumps/&gt; [[Nate Cooper]] ([[Kyle Pryor]]) advises Andy that there is no medical reason not resume sexual activity, but Hannah ends their relationship before he can apologise. Howarth added that "Andy has become more like a carer to Hannah than a boyfriend, and she doesn't want that for either of them. She wants Andy to have the opportunity to be happy with someone else. She wishes for him to enjoy a normal life." Despite this their love for one another remains and the actress added that Andy chooses not to give up on their relationship.&lt;ref name=dumps&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hannah dumps Andy!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=28 March – 3 April 2015|issue=12|pages=30|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy knows that he still loves Hannah and tries to resume their relationship, asking Denny for help. Hara told Erin Miller (''TV Week'') that "Andy told Hannah he's not the same person he used to be. It's going to be a test for their relationship but he wants to prove that he loves her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Erin|last1=Miller|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Fighting for love|date=14–20 March 2015|issue=11|pages=13|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair get back together but Hannah soon becomes depressed because she cannot go outside. She decides to behave spontaneously and begs Andy to take her on a boat ride at sea.&lt;ref name=boat/&gt; Howarth explains that being stuck at home has "taken its toll on her both physically and emotionally" and she is "desperate" to go outside. The writers throw the duo into yet another dangerous situation as their boat capsizes. With Hannah's paralysis she is unable to stay afloat and disappears beneath the water. Howarth added that it is dangerous because of her condition. Andy frantically searches for her to save her.&lt;ref name=boat&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Erin|last1=Miller|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=All at sea|date=28 March – 3 April 2015|issue=13|pages=13|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem the duo encounter is Andy's literacy problems when he needs help with revision for his personal trainer qualifications. He becomes angry and argumentative with Hannah despite her help. A ''TV Soap'' reporter stated that Andy "hated feeling like a five year old in front of her." But when he admits the truth to Josh he decides to apologise to Hannah. Josh struggles to mentor him but carries on knowing that Andy is trying to make Hannah proud of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Food for thought|journal=TV Soap|date=26 March – 9 April 2015|pages=41|publisher=[[nextmedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howarth told Kerry Harvey from ''[[TV Guide (New Zealand)|TV Guide]]'' that Andy and Hannah "balance each other well", two opposites personality wise, but they get along so well. She concluded "I think with what's happened with the accident he's really risen to the occasion and he's been so good to her. I think at least for a while they'll be able to be happy."&lt;ref name=writers&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Kerry|title=Home and Away star struggled with sex storyline|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-guide/68774000/Home-and-Away-star-struggled-with-sex-storyline|website=[[TV Guide (New Zealand)|TV Guide]]|publisher=([[Fairfax New Zealand]])|accessdate=19 June 2015|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Hannah's recovery and reuse of her legs, Andy becomes jealous of Hannah's new found freedom. When he witnesses Hannah dancing with another man he becomes violent and punches him. Hara said that the bad side of Andy had not surfaced for sometime and likened him to the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. He defended his character's overreaction, "imagine walking into a bar and seeing the one you love dancing with someone else."&lt;ref name=ugly&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Ugly Andy|date=23–29 May 2015|issue=21|pages=11|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah then meets her ex-boyfriend [[List of Home and Away characters (2015)#Sean Gleeson|Sean Gleeson]] ([[Luke Pegler]]) and is unfaithful. Howarth said that her character "loves Andy and doesn't want to hurt him, but ultimately she's not happy."&lt;ref name=pair/&gt; Hannah remembers how exciting her life was with Sean and doesn't feel the same when she is with Andy. She sleeps with Sean and is nearly caught by Andy. Hannah struggles with the guilt of cheating, but still decides she wants Sean instead.&lt;ref name=pair&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Ex Factor|date=13–19 June 2015|issue=24|pages=11|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Hannah is shocked to learn that Sean is married. Hannah realises that she has made a mistake and wants to keep her infidelity a secret. But Sean's wife arrives and confronts Hannah. Howarth told a ''TV Week'' reporter that the whole situation "blows up in her face". Hannah tells Sean that she is going to be honest with Andy, unaware that Josh has recorded her and Andy learns the truth.&lt;ref name=reveals&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Busted|date=20–26 June 2015|issue=25|pages=13|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure===
On 22 February 2016, the Seven Network Twitter account announced Hara's departure from ''Home and Away''.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a784448/goodbye-andy-home-and-away-confirms-that-tai-hara-has-left-the-show/|title=Goodbye Andy! Home and Away confirms that Tai Hara has left the show|last=Silverstein|first=Adam|date=23 February 2016|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They implied that he was travelling overseas to [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]].&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt; The actor stated, "My time on HAA has been a once in a lifetime experience that I'll never forget and I can't wait for what's to come!"&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt; Andy's exit storyline was not immediately revealed, but he is one of several suspects in the [[Charlotte King (Home and Away)|Charlotte King]]'s ([[Erika Heynatz]]) murder.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;

==Reception==
Alicia Vrajlal from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' branded Andy a "bad boy" character and a "fan favourite" with viewers.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vrajlal|first1=Alicia|title=In his element!

The '''Arrangers' Publishing Company''' (APC) is an American publisher of [[marching band]] music, [[concert band]] music and drill designs for middle school, high school and college bands. 

The company originated in 1985 with the goal of providing a new approach to marching band music. In 1992, APC published its first concert band literature. Low-cost drill designs presented in an easy to use format were offered shortly thereafter.

The company's focus has been on the effectiveness of the [[arrangement]], showcasing diverse and sometimes unlikely material, with genres ranging from [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] to [[jazz]] and [[American patriotic music]]. APC produces full-length studio recordings of its music.

Notable APC arrangers and composers include Roland Barrett, Kenny Bierschenk, [[Scott Boerma]], Jay Dawson, John Fannin, Gary P. Gilroy, Larry Kerchner, Bill Locklear, Victor Lopez, Chris McDonald, Joe Murphy, Brad Pearson, [[Timothy Rhea]], Steve Reisteter, Jeff Simmons, Tom Wallace and Bill Wiedrich.

'''Brno University of Technology''' (abbreviated: ''BUT''; in [[Czech language|Czech]]: '''Vysoké učení technické v Brně''' &amp;ndash; Czech abbreviation: ''VUT'') is a [[university]] located in [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]. Being founded in 1899 and initially offering a single course in civil engineering, it grew to become a major Czech university with over 24,000 students enrolled at 8 faculties and 2 university institutes.

==History==
The [[Jesuit order|Jesuits]] dominated university education in Moravia at the beginning of 18th century as they controlled the [[University of Olomouc]]. The focus on theology and philosophy was unwelcomed by the Moravian nobility. The nobility initiated commencement of law education at the University of Olomouc in 1679. Later in 1725 the Moravian nobility enforced establishment of the '''[[Collegium Nobilium (Olomouc)|Academy of Nobility]]''' in Olomouc. [[Law]] and [[economy]], [[mathematics]], [[geometry]], civil and [[military]] [[architecture]], [[history]] and [[geography]] were lectured there. As it aimed to promote knighthood also foreign languages, dance, swordsmanship and equitation were taught there. The Academy was in Olomouc until 1847, when it was relocated to [[Brno]], where it became bases for what was later to become the University of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;M. Pojsl: Olomouc - malé dějiny města, Olomouc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to extinction of the University in [[Olomouc]], there was any institution that would provide an academic [[education]] in [[Moravia]] and only one technical school, besides German one, could not cover the lack of need, so the students mostly left to [[Prague]], [[Vienna]] or [[Kraków]]. Related to this situation the voices that called for the establishment of university, but not regional one in Olomouc but in the state capital – [[Brno]], grew stronger. The [[Moravian Germans]] rejected the second Czech university and thus led to the many quarrels (the settlement occurred after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1919 by the establishment of [[Masaryk University]]). In September 1899 the disputes were solved by founding the '''Imperial Czech Technical University of [[Franz Joseph]]''' in Brno.

In the beginning the university was settled in Augustine Street and had to make do with 4 professors and 47 students who could study only Civil Engineering. In the following year (1900) the teaching of the field of machine engineering was started and followed by the cultural engineering (landscaping), electrical engineering and chemical engineering. After World War I it was also possible to study architecture. In 1911 the university  was moved into a newly built luxurious building in Veveří Street which  is still  used by the Faculty of civil enegineering. In the interwar period it was connected with the German Technical University and was renamed the Brno University of Technology. The school has used the name of the University of Technology of Dr. E. Benes for a short time.

After the German occupation of [[Czechoslovakia]] and installing the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], all Czech universities, including the Czech Technical University, were forced to close ''(see [[International Students' Day]])''. After the end of the war in 1945, the university was restored to its pre-war state. After the war the school was reopened under the older name the University of Technology of Dr. E. Benes. The school was ceased to exist in 1951; some parts were transferred to the newly established Military Technical Academy. The only faculties that provided civilian training remained Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture Faculty, both under the name College of Engineering. Already in 1956 the university activity was gradually restored under the present name Brno University of Technology. Today's appearance was more or less stabilized in 1961.

After 1989 there was a reorganization of certain faculties and the emergence of many new ones. There was restored The Faculty of Chemistry  (1992) and in addition to the technical fields, BUT focused on economy (Faculty of Business founded in 1992) and arts (Faculty of Fine Arts, founded in 1993).

Another milestone is associated with the year 2000 when the BUT separates two faculties deployed in [[Zlín]] - Faculty of Technology and Faculty of Management and Economics - and thus established the Tomas Bata University.
The most recent significant organizational change is the splitting of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication and the Faculty of Information Technology which occurred in 2002.&lt;ref name="History of the Brno University of Technology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pernes|first=Jiří|title=Kapitoly z dějin Vysokého učení technického v Brně 1899–2009|year=2009|publisher=VUTIUM|location=Brno|isbn=978-80-214-3376-2|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of the BUT buildings are now located in the area under Palacky Hill in the city district Kralovo Pole. There are the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Business, Faculty of Chemistry and a new building of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication as well as two college campuses.
Faculty of Information Technology is located in a former Carthusian monastery in Bozetechova Street and in the new complex across the street. The Faculty of Civil Engineering you can find in extensively rebuilt building in the Veveri Street. Faculty of Architecture is located in the Porici Street, Faculty of Fine Arts in the Rybarska Street. BUT also uses the buildings in the Udolni Street and the third college campus in Kounicova Street. Rector's Offices are located in a newly renovated Baroque building in Antoninska Street.

In the course of more than 110 years BUT has matured into an internationally recognized institution offering education in a broad spectrum of fields ranging from technical and scientific disciplines through economics to the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vutbr.cz/en/life-on-but VUTBR.cz]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorities==
The head of the university is the rector who is represented by five prorectores in various fields of activity. Financial matters of BUT are in the hands of the bursar, communication and promotion is the business of the public relations officer in cooperation with the Unit of external relations. Important documents and guidelines are discussed and approved by the Academic Senate which consisted of an employee and a student chamber. Scientific direction of BUT determines the Scientific Council, acting as BUT experts, other universities and industry.

Each of faculty is governed by dean and his vice-deans. Also, the faculties have their academic senates which deal exclusively with the laws of the faculties. Similarly, the faculties have their own scientific council.
There are a number of student organizations in BUT, for historical reasons called the Student Unions. Each Faculty has its student chamber which represents students in the Academic Senate - students have the opportunity to participate in the management of their faculty.

One of the oldest faculties of Brno University of Technology was established in 1919.During its existence the faculty was merged with the Faculty of civil Engineering. Currently provides training in [[architecture]] and [[urban design]] and has about three hundred students.&lt;ref name="History of the Faculty of Architecture"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Faculty of Architecture |url=http://www.fa.vutbr.cz/pages/historie_fa.aspx?lang=en&amp;menu=1 |publisher=Brno University of Technology |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006134943/http://www.fa.vutbr.cz/pages/historie_fa.aspx?lang=en&amp;menu=1 |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faculty of Chemistry.jpg|thumb|right|Faculty of Chemistry]]

Teaching [[Chemistry]] at BUT dates back to 1911 when there was established Department of Chemistry at the [[Czech Technical University]]. The development was interrupted in 1951 by converting BUT to the [[Military Technical Academy]]. The restoration of the teaching of chemistry was reached in 1992. Faculty realizes bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs in chemistry and [[food industry]].&lt;ref name="History of the Faculty of Chemistry"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Faculty of Chemistry|url=http://www.fch.vutbr.cz/en/faculty/history.html|publisher=Brno University of Technology|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], the '''Indian residential school system'''{{refn|group=nb|''Indian'' has been used because of the historical nature of the article and the precision of the name. It was, and continues to be, used by government officials, Indigenous peoples and historians while referencing the school system. The use of the name also provides relevant context about the era in which the system was established, specifically one in which [[Indigenous peoples in Canada]] were homogeneously referred to as ''Indians'' rather than by language that distinguishes [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]] and [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] peoples. Use of ''Indian'' is limited throughout the article to proper nouns and references to government legislation.}} was a network of [[boarding school]]s for [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]].{{refn|group=nb|''Indigenous'' has been capitalized in keeping with the style guide of the Government of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=14.12 Elimination of Racial and Ethnic Stereotyping, Identification of Groups|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-srch?lang=eng&amp;srchtxt=indigenous&amp;cur=2&amp;nmbr=2&amp;lettr=14&amp;info0=14.12#zz14|website=Translation Bureau|publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=April 30, 2017|language=en|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalization also aligns with the style used within the final report of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]] and the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]. In the Canadian context, ''Indigenous'' is capitalized when discussing peoples, cultures or communities in the same way ''European'' or ''Canadian'' is used to refer to non-Indigenous topics or people.&lt;ref name="McKay"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKay |first1=Celeste |title=Briefing Note on Terminology |url=http://umanitoba.ca/student/indigenous/terminology.html |publisher=University of Manitoba |accessdate=April 30, 2017 |date=April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025224808/http://umanitoba.ca/student/indigenous/terminology.html |archivedate=October 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The network was funded by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]'s [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Department of Indian Affairs]] and administered by Christian churches.  The school system was created for the purpose of removing children from the influence of their own culture and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilating]] them into the dominant Canadian culture. Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year existence, about 30 per cent of Indigenous children (around 150,000) were placed in residential schools nationally.&lt;ref name="NCTROverview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Residential Schools Overview |url=http://umanitoba.ca/centres/nctr/overview.html |publisher=University of Manitoba |accessdate=April 14, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420012021/http://umanitoba.ca/centres/nctr/overview.html |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}} The number of school-related deaths remains unknown due to an incomplete historical record, though estimates range from 3,200 upwards of 6,000.&lt;ref name="Tasker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tasker |first1=John Paul |title=Residential schools findings point to 'cultural genocide', commission chair says |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/residential-schools-findings-point-to-cultural-genocide-commission-chair-says-1.3093580 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |publisher=CBC News |date=May 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518220713/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/residential-schools-findings-point-to-cultural-genocide-commission-chair-says-1.3093580 |archivedate=May 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

The system had its origins in laws enacted before [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], but was primarily active from the passage of the [[Indian Act]] in 1876. An amendment to the Indian Act in 1884 made attendance at [[day school]]s, [[industrial school]]s, or residential schools compulsory for First Nations children. Due to the remote nature of many communities, school locations meant that for some families residential schools were the only way to comply. The schools were intentionally located at substantial distances from Indigenous communities to minimize contact between families and their children. Indian Commissioner [[Hayter Reed]] argued for schools at greater distances to reduce family visits, which he thought counteracted efforts to civilize Indigenous children. Parental visits were further restricted by the use of a [[Pass system (Canadian history)|pass system]] designed to confine Indigenous peoples to [[Indian reserve|reserves]]. The last federally operated residential school closed in 1990. Schools operated in every province and territory with the exception of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]].&lt;ref name="MillerCE" /&gt;

The residential school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by [[Child displacement|removing them from their families]], depriving them of their [[indigenous languages|ancestral languages]], exposing many of them to [[child abuse|physical]] and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], and forcibly [[Indian enfranchisement in Canada|enfranchising]] them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the residential school system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system has been linked to an increased prevalence of [[post-traumatic stress]], [[alcoholism]], [[substance abuse]], and suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities today.

On June 11, 2008, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] offered a public apology on behalf of the Government of Canada and the leaders of the other [[List of federal political parties in Canada|federal parties]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. Nine days prior, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) was established to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered statements from residential school survivors{{refn|group=nb|''Survivor'' is the term used in the final report of the TRC and the ''Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools'' issued by Stephen Harper on behalf of the Government of Canada in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Harper |title=Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |website=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |language=en |date=June 11, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516080220/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. The TRC report found that the school system amounted to [[cultural genocide]].

Attempts to assimilate [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] were rooted in [[imperialism|imperial colonialism]], which centred around a European worldview of cultural practice and an understanding of land ownership based on the [[Discovery doctrine|doctrine of Discovery]].&lt;ref name="TRCExec"/&gt;{{rp|47–50}} As explained in the executive summary of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's]] (TRC) final report: "Underlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization to savage people who could never civilize themselves. The 'civilizing mission' rested on a belief of racial and cultural superiority."&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|50}}

Although many of these early schools were open for only a short time, efforts persisted. The [[Mohawk Institute Residential School]], the oldest, continuously operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on [[Six Nations of the Grand River]] near [[Brantford]], Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mohawk Institute&amp;nbsp;– Brantford, ON |url=http://www.anglican.ca/tr/histories/mohawk-institute/ |website=Anglican Church of Canada |accessdate=May 5, 2017 |date=September 23, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114080830/http://www.anglican.ca/tr/histories/mohawk-institute/ |archivedate=November 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewed interest in residential schools in the early 1800s has been linked to the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the [[War of 1812]]. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement.&lt;ref name="GordonWhite" /&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=J.

Beginning in the late 1800s, the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) officially encouraged the growth of the residential school system as a valuable component in a wider policy of integrating Indigenous people into [[European-Canadian]] society.&lt;ref name="GordonWhite"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon |first1=Catherine E. |last2=White |first2=Jerry P. |title=Indigenous Educational Attainment in Canada |url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1195&amp;context=iipj |journal=International Indigenous Policy Journal |date=June 2014 |volume=5 |issue=3 |doi=10.18584/iipj.2014.5.3.6 |doi-access=free |accessdate=June 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130184321/http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1195&amp;context=iipj |archivedate=November 30, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsible for separating children from their families and communities, this process was found by the TRC to be [[cultural genocide]], a conclusion that echoed the words of historian John S.

Many of the government-operated residential schools were run by churches of various denominations, with the majority administered by [[Roman Catholic]]s. Between 1867 and 1939, the number of schools operating at one time peaked at 80 in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were operated by Roman Catholics; 21 were operated by the [[Church of England]] / [[Anglican Church of Canada]]; 13 were operated by the [[United Church of Canada]], and 2 were operated by [[Presbyterianism#Canada|Presbyterians]].&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1"/&gt;{{rp|682}} The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed by the federal government for economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning.&lt;ref name="Dickason" /&gt; As a result, the number of schools per denomination was less a reflection of their presence in the general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|683}}

===Government involvement===
Although [[education in Canada]] was made the jurisdiction of the provincial governments by the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]], Indigenous peoples and their treaties were under the jurisdiction of the federal government.&lt;ref name="Dickason"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dickason  | first = Olive Patricia | authorlink=Olive Dickason|title = Canada's First Nations: A History of Founding Peoples from Earliest Times | publisher = Oxford University Press|edition=2nd | year = 1998 | page = 309 | isbn = 0-19-541358-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential schools were funded under the [[Indian Act]] by what was then the federal [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Department of the Interior]]. Adopted in 1876 as ''An Act to amend and consolidate the laws respecting Indians'', it consolidated all previous laws placing Indigenous communities, land and finances under federal control. As explained by the TRC, the Act "made Indians wards of the state, unable to vote in provincial or federal elections or enter the professions if they did not surrender their status, and severely limited their freedom to participate in spiritual and cultural practices".&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|110}}

The design of a federally supported residential school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen. Sir [[Peregrine Maitland]], a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, was the best way to influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General [[Charles Bagot]], entitled ''Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada''.&lt;ref name="milloy" /&gt;{{rp|12–17}}&lt;ref name="Bagot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nctr.ca/assets/reports/Historical%20Reports/Bagot%20report.pdf|title=Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada, laid before the Legislative Assembly, 20th March, 1845|author=Rawson W.

On May 26, 1847, Ryerson wrote a letter for George Vardon, Assistant Superintendent of Indian Affairs, asserting that "the North American Indian cannot be civilized or preserved in a state of civilization (including habits of industry and sobriety) except in connection with, if not by the influence of, not only religious instruction and sentiment but of religious feelings".&lt;ref name="RyersonReport" /&gt;{{rp|3}} He expressly recommended that Indigenous students be educated in a separate, denominational, English-only system with a focus on industrial training.&lt;ref name="Carney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RUAEC" /&gt; This letter was published as an appendix to a larger report entitled ''Statistics Respecting Indian Schools''.&lt;ref name="RyersonReport"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nctr.ca/assets/reports/Historical%20Reports/Ryerson%20Report.pdf|title=Statistics Respecting Residential Schools, Appendix A: Report by Dr Ryerson on Industrial Schools|last=Ryerson|first=Egerton|authorlink=Egerton Ryerson|year=1847|website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation|publisher=Indian Affairs|type=Letter to George Vardon, Assistant Superintendent of Indian Affairs|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gradual Civilization Act]] of 1857 and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869 formed the foundations for this system prior to Confederation. These acts assumed the inherent superiority of French and British ways, and the need for Indigenous peoples to become French or English speakers, Christians, and farmers. At the time, many Indigenous leaders argued to have these acts overturned.&lt;ref name="Comeau"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Comeau |first1=Sylvain |title=First Nations Act draws fire from SCPA panel |url=http://ctr.concordia.ca/2002-03/March_27/11-scpa/index.shtml |website=Concordia's Thursday Report Online |accessdate=December 2, 2009 |date=March 23, 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728025226/http://ctr.concordia.ca/2002-03/March_27/11-scpa/index.shtml |archivedate=July 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gradual Civilization Act awarded {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land to any Indigenous male deemed "sufficiently advanced in the elementary branches of education" and would automatically "enfranchise" him, removing any tribal affiliation or treaty rights.&lt;ref name="milloy" /&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="Statutes1857"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statutes of the Province of Canada|date=1857|publisher=S.

In January 1879, [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A.

He visited only one industrial day school, in [[Minnesota]], before submitting his findings.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|154–158}} In his report Davin concluded that the best way to civilize Indigenous peoples was to start with children in a residential setting, away from their families, so that they could be "kept constantly within the circle of civilized  conditions".&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|157}}&lt;ref name="Davin" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

Davin's findings were supported by [[Vital-Justin Grandin]], who felt that while the likelihood of civilizing adults was low, there was hope when it came to Indigenous children. He explained in a letter to Public Works Minister [[Hector-Louis Langevin]] that the best course of action would be make children "lead a life different from their parents and cause them to forget the customs, habits &amp; language of their ancestors".&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|159}} In 1883 Parliament approved $43,000 for three industrial schools and the first, [[Battleford Industrial School]], opened on December 1 of that year. By 1900 there were 61 schools in operation.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|161}}

The government began purchasing church run boarding schools in the 1920s. During this period capital costs associated with the schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated due to the lack of written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|240}}

By the 1930s it was recognized by government officials that the residential school system was financially unsustainable and failing to meet the intended goal of training and assimilating Indigenous children into European-Canadian society. [[Robert Hoey]], superintendent of welfare and training at Indian Affairs, opposed the expansion of new schools, noting in 1936 that "to build educational institutions, particularly residential schools, while the money at our disposal is insufficient to keep the schools already erected in a proper state of repair, is, to me, very unsound and a practice difficult to justify".&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2"/&gt;{{rp|3}} He proposed the expansion of day schools, an approach to educating Indigenous children that he would continue to pursue after being promoted to director of the welfare and training branch in 1945. The proposal was resisted by the United Church, the Anglican Church, and the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], who believed that the solution to the system's failure was not restructuring but intensification.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2" /&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

Between 1945 and 1955, the number of day schools run by Indian Affairs expanded from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by an amendment to the Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|71}} It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education as a result of their transition into the public school system.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Erin|title=Sixties Scoop|url=http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/sixties_scoop/|website=Indigenous Foundations|publisher=UBC First Nations and Indigenous Studies|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the shift in policy from educational assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued through much of the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2" /&gt;{{rp|147}} The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of [[Indian Act#Section 88|section 88]] to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place.

Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|669–674}}

In 1884, amendments to the Indian Act made school attendance compulsory for Indigenous children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, the health of the children and their prior completion of school examinations.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's Residential Schools: The History, Part 1 Origins to 1939: Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Volume 1|url=http://nctr.ca/assets/reports/Final%20Reports/Volume_1_History_Part_1_English_Web.pdf|website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|accessdate=July 1, 2016|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|254–255}} It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908.&lt;ref name=TRCHistoryPart1 /&gt;{{rp|261}}&lt;ref name="IA1908"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Department of Indian Affairs |title=Regulations relating to the education of Indian children |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/3140.html |website=Peel's Prairie Provinces |publisher=Government Printing Bureau |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |year=1908 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808174349/http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/3140.html |archivedate=August 8, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of mandatory attendance was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. Reliant on student enrollment quotas to secure funding, they were struggling to attract new students due to increasingly poor school conditions.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;{{rp|128}}

Compulsory attendance ended in 1948, following the 1947 report of a special joint committee and subsequent amendment of the Indian Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Haig-Brown, Celia|year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_-ny5eSVHkC&amp;dq=subject:%22Residence+and+education%22|url-access=limited|title=Resistance and Renewal: Surviving the Indian Residential School|page=32|publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press Ltd|isbn=0-88978-189-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials were still able to influence student attendance. The introduction of the [[Family Allowance Act]] in 1945 stipulated that school-aged children had to be enrolled in school for families to qualify for the "[[Baby bonus#Canada|baby bonus]]", further coercing Indigenous parents into having their children attend residential schools.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;{{rp|170}}&lt;ref name="VM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carmacks, Yukon: A Northern Tutchone Homeland – 2.3 K'uch'an Adäw: Churches and Schools |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000488&amp;sl=3740&amp;pos=1 |website=Virtual Museum of Canada |publisher=Canadian Museum of History |accessdate=August 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818023615/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000488&amp;sl=3740&amp;pos=1 |archivedate=August 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students in the residential school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline that would not have been tolerated in any other school system.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="milloy" /&gt; [[Corporal punishment]] was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways&amp;nbsp;– whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and [[tuberculosis]]; in one school, the death rate reached 69 per cent.&lt;ref name="CurryHowlett"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curry |first1=Bill |last2=Howlett |first2=Karen |title=Natives died in droves as Ottawa ignored warnings |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/natives-died-in-droves-as-ottawa-ignored-warnings/article4309756/?page=all |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=April 24, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827043602/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/natives-died-in-droves-as-ottawa-ignored-warnings/article4309756/?page=all |archivedate=August 27, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.&lt;ref name="milloy" /&gt;{{rp|83–89}}

Until the late 1950s, when the federal government shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the [[forced labour]] of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosby |first=Ian |title=Administering Colonial Science: Nutrition Research and Human Biomedical Experimentation in Aboriginal Communities and Residential Schools, 1942–1952 |journal=Histoire sociale/Social history |date=July 2013 |volume=46 |issue=91 |pages=145–172 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/histoire_sociale_social_history/v046/46.91.mosby.html |accessdate=August 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723154855/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=%2Fjournals%2Fhistoire_sociale_social_history%2Fv046%2F46.91.mosby.html |archivedate=July 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of the mistreatment of students were published numerous times throughout the 20th century by both government officials, reporting on the condition of schools, and by the proceedings of civil cases brought forward by survivors seeking compensation for the abuse they endured.&lt;ref name="NCTROverview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MillerCE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller |first1=J.R. |title=Residential Schools |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools/ |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |date=October 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128235739/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools/ |archivedate=January 28, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to the conditions and impacts of residential schools were also brought to light in popular culture as early as 1967 with the publication of "The Lonely Death of [[Chanie Wenjack]]" by [[Ian Adams]] in ''[[Maclean's]]'' and the [[Indians of Canada Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]]. In the 1990s, investigations and memoirs by former students revealed that many students at residential schools were subjected to severe physical, [[psychological abuse|psychological]], and [[sexual abuse]] by school staff members and by older students. Among the former students to come forward was [[Phil Fontaine]], then Grand Chief of the [[Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs]], who in October 1990 publicly discussed the abuse he and others suffered while attending Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|129–130}}

Following the government's closure of most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater awareness by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities to draw attention to the residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]].&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2" /&gt;{{rp|551–554}}

===Family visitation===
Parents and family members regularly travelled to the schools, often camping outside to be closer to their children. The number of parents who made the trip prompted Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed to argue that industrial schools, like residential schools, be moved greater distances from reserves to make visiting more difficult.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|601–604}} He also objected to allowing children to return home during school breaks and holidays because he believed the trips interrupted the civilizing of school attendees.&lt;ref name="Titley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Titley |first1=E. Brian |title=Reed, Hayter |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/reed_hayter_16E.html |work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128050107/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/reed_hayter_16E.html |archivedate=November 28, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Reed explained in 1894, the problem with day schools was that students returned home each night where they were influenced by life on the reserve, whereas "in the boarding or industrial schools the pupils are removed for a long period from the leadings of this uncivilized life and receive constant care and attention".&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|199}}

Visitation, for those able to make the journey, was strictly controlled by school officials in a manner similar to the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were required to meet in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the [[Pass system (Canadian history)|pass system]]. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1" /&gt;{{rp|601–604}} Launched in 1885 as a response to the [[North-West Rebellion]], and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.&lt;ref name="Benjoe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benjoe |first1=Kerry |title=First Nation reserves prior to 1960s were 'open-air prisons,' says Saskatoon filmmaker behind The Pass System |url=http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/the-pass-system-more-than-a-movie?__lsa=15e4-3395 |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=November 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128133936/http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/the-pass-system-more-than-a-movie?__lsa=15e4-3395 |archivedate=November 28, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction style and outcomes===
[[File:Indian school.jpg|thumb|Residential school group photograph, [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]], 1908|alt=Posed, group photo of students and teachers, dressed in black and white, outside a brick building in Regina, Saskatchewan]] Instruction provided to students was rooted in an institutional and European approach to education. It differed dramatically from child rearing in [[traditional knowledge]] systems that are generally based on 'look, listen, and learn' models. Unlike the corporal punishment and loss of privileges that characterized the residential school system, traditional approaches to education favour positive guidance toward desired behaviour through the use of game-based play, story-telling, and formal ritualized ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;{{rp|15–21}}&lt;ref name="Patridge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partridge|first1=Cheryle|title=Residential Schools: The Intergenerational Impacts on Aboriginal Peoples|journal=Native Social Work Journal|year=2010|volume=7|pages=33–62|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/OSUL/TC-OSUL-382.PDF|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at school, many children had no contact with their families for up to 10 months at a time because of the distance between their home communities and schools, and in some cases had no contact for years. The impact of the disconnect from their families was furthered by students being discouraged or prohibited from speaking [[Native American languages|Indigenous languages]], even among themselves and outside the classroom, so that English or French would be learned and their own languages forgotten. In some schools, they were subject to physical violence for speaking their own languages or for practicing non-Christian faiths.&lt;ref name="CBCFAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrisjohn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chrisjohn|first1=Roland D.|last3=Maraun|first3=Michael|last2=Young|first2=Sherri L.|title=The circle game: shadows and substance in the Indian residential school experience in Canada|date=1997|publisher=Theytus Books|isbn=978-0-919441-85-9|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37984632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most schools operated with the goal of providing students with the [[Vocational education|vocational training]] and [[social skills]] required to obtain employment and integrate into Canadian society after graduation. In actuality, these goals were poorly and inconsistently achieved. Many graduates were unable to land a job due to poor educational training. Returning home was equally challenging due to an unfamiliarity with their culture and, in some cases, an inability to communicate with family members using their traditional language. Instead of intellectual achievement and advancement, it was often physical appearance and dress, like that of [[middle class]], urban teenagers, or the promotion of a Christian ethic, that was used as a sign of successful assimilation. There was no indication that school attendees achieved greater financial success than those who did not go to school. As the father of a pupil who attended Battleford Industrial School, in Saskatchewan, for five years explained: "he cannot read, speak or write English, nearly all his time having been devoted to herding and caring for cattle instead of learning a trade or being otherwise educated. Such employment he can get at home."&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;{{rp|164–172, 194–199}}

==Mortality rates==

The 1906 Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs, submitted by chief medical officer [[Peter Bryce]], highlighted that the "Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times".&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|97–98}}&lt;ref name="Bryce1906" /&gt;{{rp|275}} Among the list of causes he noted tuberculosis and the role residential schools played in spreading the disease by way of poor ventilation and medical screening.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|97–98}}&lt;ref name="Bryce1906"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Bryce |first1=Peter H. |authorlink=Peter Bryce |title=Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs, for the fiscal year ended 30th June, 1906 |url=http://govinfocollections.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/govinfo1%3A11747#page/1/mode/1up |publisher=Department of Indian Affairs |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |pages=272–284 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829045344/http://govinfocollections.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/govinfo1%3A11747 |archivedate=August 29, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|275–276}}

In 1909, Bryce reported that, between 1894 and 1908, mortality rates at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30 to 60 per cent over five years (that is, five years after entry, 30 to 60 per cent of students had died, or 6 to 12 per cent per annum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New documents may shed light on residential school deaths |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/new-documents-may-shed-light-on-residential-school-deaths-1.2487015 |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2016 |publisher=CBC News |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923090958/http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/new-documents-may-shed-light-on-residential-school-deaths-1.2487015 |archivedate=September 23, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published ''The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921.'' In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates could have been avoided if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FNCaringSociety"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Dr. Peter Henderson Bryce? |url=https://fncaringsociety.com/peter-bryce |website=First Nations Child &amp; Family Caring Society of Canada |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416065935/https://fncaringsociety.com/peter-bryce |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deachman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deachman |first1=Bruce |title=Beechwood ceremony to honour medical officer's tenacity |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/beechwood-ceremony-to-honour-medical-officers-tenacity |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=August 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915162705/http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/beechwood-ceremony-to-honour-medical-officers-tenacity |archivedate=September 15, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness.

In 1920 and 1922, [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] physician F.{{nbsp}}A. Corbett was commissioned to visit the schools in the west of the country, and found similar results to those reported by Bryce.

In 2011, reflecting on the TRC's research, Justice [[Murray Sinclair]] told the ''[[Toronto Star]]'': "Missing children&amp;nbsp;– that is the big surprise for me&amp;nbsp;...

===Missing children and unmarked graves===
The TRC concluded that it may be impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, in part because of the habit of burying students in unmarked graves.&lt;ref name="Barrera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrera |first1=Jorge |title=Identities, bodies of children who died in residential schools may be lost forever |url=http://aptnnews.ca/2012/05/31/identities-bodies-of-children-who-died-in-residential-schools-may-be-lost-forever/ |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |work=APTN National News |date=April 22, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305140453/http://aptnnews.ca/2012/05/31/identities-bodies-of-children-who-died-in-residential-schools-may-be-lost-forever/ |archivedate=March 5, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schroeder"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schroeder |first1=Janice |title=Children taught to hate themselves says TRC report |url=http://www.canadianmennonite.org/stories/children-taught-hate-themselves-says-trc-report |work=Canadian Mennonite |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |date=June 17, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919145346/http://www.canadianmennonite.org/stories/children-taught-hate-themselves-says-trc-report |archivedate=September 19, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leung |first1=Marlene |title=Aboriginal children at residential schools often buried in unmarked graves, report reveals |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/aboriginal-children-at-residential-schools-often-buried-in-unmarked-graves-report-reveals-1.2701373 |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |work=CTV News |date=December 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117151338/http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/aboriginal-children-at-residential-schools-often-buried-in-unmarked-graves-report-reveals-1.2701373 |archivedate=November 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith |first1=Joanna |title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report details deaths of 3,201 children in residential schools |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/12/15/truth-and-reconciliation-commissions-report-details-deaths-of-3201-children-in-residential-schools.html |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |work=Toronto Star |date=December 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826133919/https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/12/15/truth-and-reconciliation-commissions-report-details-deaths-of-3201-children-in-residential-schools.html |archivedate=August 26, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.&lt;ref name="Leung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paul |first1=Alexandra |title=Where are the children buried? |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/fyi/where-are-the-children-buried-116524718.html |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |work=Winnipeg Free Press |date=February 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184150/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/fyi/where-are-the-children-buried-116524718.html |archivedate=November 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth volume of the TRC's final report, dedicated to missing children and unmarked burials, was developed after the original TRC members realized, in 2007, that the issue required its own working group. In 2009, the TRC requested $1.5{{nbsp}}million in extra funding from the federal government to complete this work, but was denied.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The researchers concluded, after searching land near schools using satellite imagery and maps, that, "for the most part, the cemeteries that the Commission documented are abandoned, disused, and vulnerable to accidental disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nctr.ca/assets/reports/Final%20Reports/Volume_4_Missing_Children_English_Web.pdf|title=Canada's Residential Schools: Missing Children and Unmarked Burials The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Volume 4|year=2016|website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

When the government revised the Indian Act in the 1940s and 1950s, some bands, along with regional and national Indigenous organizations, wanted to maintain schools in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abuse of Trust: What happened behind the walls of residential church schools is a tragedy that has left native victims traumatized |last=O'Hara |first=Jane |url=https://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-62858699/abuse-trust-happened-behind-walls-residential-church |date=June 26, 2000 |work=Maclean's |first2=Patricia |author2=Treble |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918101021/https://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-62858699/abuse-trust-happened-behind-walls-residential-church |archivedate=September 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations for support of the schools included their role as a social service in communities that were suffering from extensive family breakdowns; the significance of the schools as employers; and the inadequacy of other opportunities for children to receive education.

In the 1960s, a major confrontation took place at the [[Saddle Lake Cree Nation|Saddle Lake Reserve]] in Alberta. After several years of deteriorating conditions and administrative changes, parents protested against the lack of transparency at the [[University nuhelot’įne thaiyots’į nistameyimâkanak Blue Quills|Blue Quills Indian School]] in 1969. In response, the government decided to close the school, convert the building into a residence, and enroll students in a public school {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} away in [[St. Paul, Alberta|St. Paul]], Alberta.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nctr.ca/assets/reports/Final%20Reports/Volume_1_History_Part_2_English_Web.pdf|title=Canada's Residential Schools: The History, Part 2, 1939 to 2000: The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Volume 1|date=January 1, 2016|website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation|publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|access-date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}} The TRC report pertaining to this period states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fearing their children would face racial discrimination in St. Paul, parents wished to see the school transferred to a private society that would operate it both as a school and a residence.

The NIB paper underscored the right of Indigenous communities to locally direct how their children are educated and served as the integral reference for education policy moving forward.

Few other former residential schools have transitioned into independently-operated community schools for Indigenous children. [[Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School|White Calf Collegiate]] in Lebret, Saskatchewan, was run by the [[Star Blanket Cree Nation]] from 1973 until its closure in 1998, after being run by the Oblates from 1884 to 1969.&lt;ref name="LaRose"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LaRose |first1=Stephen |title=Wrecker's ball claims White Calf Collegiate |journal=Saskatchewan Sage |year=1999 |volume=3 |issue=8 |page=18 |url=http://www.ammsa.com/publications/saskatchewan-sage/wreckers-ball-claims-white-calf-collegiate |accessdate=May 5, 2017 |publisher=Aboriginal Multi-Media Society |language=en |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425163827/http://www.ammsa.com/publications/saskatchewan-sage/wreckers-ball-claims-white-calf-collegiate |archivedate=April 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Sun Community College]] is run by the [[Siksika Nation]] in Alberta in a building designed by architect Roland Guerney Orr.&lt;ref name=Miłosz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miłosz |first1=Magdalena |title=Claiming Remnants: Intergenerational Representations and the Vicarious Pasts of Indian Residential Schools |journal=Breach |url=http://www.breachmagazine.ca/claiming-remnants/ |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917233808/http://www.breachmagazine.ca/claiming-remnants/ |archivedate=September 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Robert G.|title=Orr, Roland Guerney|url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/123|website=Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800–1950| accessdate=May 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun residential school, first run by the Anglicans and taken over by the federal government in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anglican.ca/tr/histories/old-sun/ |title=Old Sun School&amp;nbsp;– Gleichen, AB |publisher=Anglican Church of Canada |access-date=June 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807031627/http://www.anglican.ca/tr/histories/old-sun/ |archivedate=August 7, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was converted to adult learning and stood as a campus of [[Mount Royal University|Mount Royal College]] from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations.

==Lasting effects==
Survivors of residential schools and their families have been found to suffer from historic trauma that has had a lasting and adverse effect on the transmission of Indigenous culture between generations. Passed on [[intergenerationality|intergenerationally]], a 2010 study led by Gwen Reimer explains historic trauma as the process through which "cumulative stress and grief experienced by Aboriginal communities is translated into a collective experience of cultural disruption and a collective memory of powerlessness and loss".&lt;ref name="Reimer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reimer |first1=Gwen |title=The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement's Common Experience Payment and Healing: A Qualitative Study Exploring Impacts on Recipients |url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/cep-2010-healing.pdf |publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation |accessdate=August 31, 2016 |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909183024/http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/cep-2010-healing.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x}} It has been used to explain the persistent negative social and cultural impacts of colonial rule and residential schools, including the prevalence of sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, lateral violence, mental illness and suicide among Indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt;{{rp|10–11}}&lt;ref name="Wesley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wesley-Esquimaux |first1=Cynthia C. |last2=Smolewski |first2=Magdalena |title=Historic Trauma and Aboriginal Healing |url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/historic-trauma.pdf |publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation |accessdate=July 12, 2016 |year=2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914143825/http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/historic-trauma.pdf |archivedate=September 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of language and culture===
Although encouragement to keep Indigenous languages alive was present in some schools, a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society was to suppress [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous languages]] and culture. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. Teachers responded by strictly prohibiting the use of these languages despite many students having little or no understanding of English or French.&lt;ref name="IndigenousFoundations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galley"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Younging |editor1-first=Gregory |editor2-last=Dewar |editor2-first=Jonathan |editor3-last=DeGagné |editor3-first=Mike |last=Galley |first=Valerie |title=Response, responsibility and renewal: Canada's truth and reconciliation journey |date=2009 |publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation |isbn=978-1-897285-72-5 |url=http://speakingmytruth.ca/downloads/AHFvol2/22_Galley.pdf |accessdate=March 26, 2017 |chapter=Reconciliation and the Revitalization of Indigenous Languages |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024202740/http://speakingmytruth.ca/downloads/AHFvol2/22_Galley.pdf |archivedate=October 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of traditional and spiritual activities including the [[Potlatch]] and [[Sun Dance]] were also banned.&lt;ref name="Residential schools timeline" /&gt; Some survivors reported being [[Strapping (punishment)|strapped]] or forced to [[Washing out mouth with soap|eat soap]] when they were caught speaking their own language.  The inability to communicate was further affected by their families' inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors felt ashamed for being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities as ugly and dirty.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|4, 83–87}}&lt;ref name="SurvivorsSpeak" /&gt;

The stigma created by the residential school system regarding transmission of Indigenous culture by elders to younger generations has been linked to the over-representation of Indigenous languages on the [[list of endangered languages in Canada]]. The TRC noted that the majority of 90 Indigenous languages still in existence are "under serious threat of extinction".&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|202}} With great-grandparents representing the only speakers of many Indigenous languages, it was concluded that a failure of governments and Indigenous communities to prioritize the teaching and preservation of traditional languages would ensure that, despite the closure of resident schools, the eradication of Indigenous culture desired by government officials and administrators would inevitably be fulfilled "through a process systemic neglect".&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|202}}

Harper's apology excluded [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] as it was argued that the government should not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in [[St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Anthony]], [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]], [[North West River]], [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] and [[Makkovik]].

===Vatican's expression of sorrow===

In 2009, Chief Fontaine had a private meeting with [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to obtain an apology for abuses that occurred in the residential school system. Fontaine was accompanied at the meeting by a delegation of Indigenous peoples from Canada funded by [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]. Following the meeting, the Vatican released an official expression of sorrow on the church's role in residential schools:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His Holiness [i.e. the Pope] recalled that since the earliest days of her presence in Canada, the Church, particularly through her missionary personnel, has closely accompanied the Indigenous peoples.

Given the sufferings that some Indigenous children experienced in the Canadian Residential School system, the Holy Father expressed his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church and he offered his sympathy and prayerful solidarity. His Holiness emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society. He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada – Communiqué of the Holy See Press Office |url=http://www.vatican.va/resources/resources_canada-first-nations-apr2009_en.html |website=The Holy See |publisher=Vatican |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |date=April 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624083003/http://www.vatican.va/resources/resources_canada-first-nations-apr2009_en.html |archivedate=June 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fontaine later stated at a news conference that, at the meeting, he sensed the Pope's "pain and anguish" and that the acknowledgement was "important to [him] and that was what [he] was looking for".&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curry |first1=Bill |title=Pope expresses sorrow for residential-school abuse |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/pope-expresses-sorrow-for-residential-school-abuse/article4273299/ |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=April 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919055744/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/pope-expresses-sorrow-for-residential-school-abuse/article4273299/ |archivedate=September 19, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked the current [[Pope Francis]] for a public apology to all survivors of the residential school system, rather than the expression of sorrow issued in 2009.&lt;ref name="GuardianPopeApology"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trudeau asks Pope Francis to apologise to indigenous people for church's abuses|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/trudeau-asks-pope-francis-to-apologise-to-indigenous-people-for-churchs-abuses|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithPopeApology"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Joanna|title=Trudeau meets Pope, looking for residential school apology|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trudeau-pope-vatican-1.4135553|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=CBC News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCPopeApology"&gt;{{cite news|title=Justin Trudeau asks Pope for apology|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40087126|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=BBC News|date=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request aligned with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's call for "a formal apology issued by the Pope to the survivors of the residential school system for the spiritual, cultural, emotional, physical and sexual abuse of Canada's First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples".&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Rhiannon|title=Justin Trudeau wants the Pope to say 'sorry'|url=https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/ywn4k5/justin-trudeau-wants-the-pope-to-say-sorry|accessdate=December 22, 2017|work=VICE News|date=May 19, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudeau invited the Pope to issue the apology in Canada. Although no commitment for such an apology followed the meeting, he noted that the Pope pointed to a lifelong commitment of supporting marginalized people and an interest in working collaboratively with Trudeau and Canadian bishops to establish a way forward.&lt;ref name="GuardianPopeApology"/&gt;

In the summer of 1990, the [[Kanesatake, Quebec|Mohawks of Kanesatake]] confronted the government about its failure to honour Indigenous land claims and recognize traditional Mohawk territory in [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]], [[Quebec]]. Referred to by media outlets as the [[Oka Crisis]], the land dispute sparked a critical discussion about the Canadian government's complacency regarding relations with Indigenous communities and responses to their concerns. The action prompted then Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] to underscore four government responsibilities: "resolving land claims; improving the economic and social conditions on reserves; defining a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and governments; and addressing the concerns of Canada's aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life."&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|240}} The actions of the Mohawk community members led to, in part, along with objections from Indigenous leaders regarding the [[Meech Lake Accord]], the creation of the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] to examine the status of Indigenous peoples in Canada. In 1996, the Royal Commission presented a final report which first included a vision for meaningful and action-based reconciliation.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|239–240}}&lt;ref name="AADNCHighlights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights from the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples |url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014597/1100100014637 |website=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada  |accessdate=April 13, 2017 |year=1996 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430072526/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014597/1100100014637 |archivedate=April 30, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial compensation===
In January 1998, the government made a "statement of reconciliation"&amp;nbsp;– including an apology to those people who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools&amp;nbsp;– and established the [[Aboriginal Healing Foundation]] (AHF). The foundation was provided with $350{{nbsp}}million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="AHFSummary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Points of the AHF Final Report |url=http://www.fadg.ca/downloads/rapport-final-eng.pdf |publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation |accessdate=December 26, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928165735/http://www.fadg.ca/downloads/rapport-final-eng.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2005 Canadian federal budget|its 2005 budget]], the Canadian government committed an additional $40{{nbsp}}million to support the work of the AHF.&lt;ref name="AHFCloses"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal Healing Foundation closes after 16 years |url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/september-29-2014-press-release.pdf |publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation |accessdate=February 18, 2017 |date=September 30, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914142114/http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/september-29-2014-press-release.pdf |archivedate=September 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget.&lt;ref name="Rolbin-Ghanie"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rolbin-Ghanie |first1=Maya |title=Funding cuts a catastrophe for residential school survivors |url=http://rabble.ca/news/2010/03/funding-cuts-catastrophe-residential-school-survivors |accessdate=February 18, 2017 |work=rabble.ca |date=March 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223063202/http://rabble.ca/news/2010/03/funding-cuts-catastrophe-residential-school-survivors |archivedate=December 23, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHF closed in 2014.

In June 2001, the government established Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada as an independent government department to manage the residential school file. In 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process was launched as part of a larger National Resolution Framework which included health supports, a commemoration component and a strategy for litigation.&lt;ref name="INACTimelinne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline – Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1332939430258/1332939552554 |website=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=May 5, 2017 |language=en |date=May 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516100531/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1332939430258/1332939552554 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by the TRC, the ADR was designed as a "voluntary process for resolution of certain claims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and forcible confinement, without having to go through the civil litigation process".&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2" /&gt;{{rp|564}} It was created by the Canadian government without consultation with Indigenous communities or former residential school students. The ADR system also made it the responsibility of the former students to prove that the abuse occurred and was intentional, resulting in former students finding the system difficult to navigate, re-traumatizing, and discriminatory. Many survivor advocacy groups and Indigenous political organizations such as the [[Assembly of First Nations]] (AFN) worked to have the ADR system dissolved.&lt;ref name="Petoukhov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petoukhov |first1=Konstantin |title=Recognition, Redistribution, and Representation: Assessing the Transformative Potential of Reparations for the Indian Residential Schools Experience |journal=McGill Sociological Review |date=February 2013 |volume=3 |pages=73–91 |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/msr/volume3/article5 |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912210741/http://www.mcgill.ca/msr/volume3/article5 |archivedate=September 12, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Assembly of First Nations released a report critical of the ADR underscoring, among other issues, the failure of survivors to automatically receive the full amount of compensation without subsequent ligation against the church and failure to compensate for lost family, language and culture.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2" /&gt;{{rp|565}} The [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs|Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development]] released its own report in April 2005 finding the ADR to be "an excessively costly and inappropriately applied failure, for which the Minister and her officials are unable to raise a convincing defence".&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2" /&gt;{{rp|566}} Within a month of the report's release a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision granted school attendees the right to pursue class-action suits, which ultimately led to a government review of the compensation process.&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart2" /&gt;{{rp|566}}

On November 23, 2005, the Canadian government announced a $1.9-billion compensation package to benefit tens of thousands of former students. National Chief of the AFN, [[Phil Fontaine]], said the package was meant to cover "decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities".&lt;ref name="CBCGetting" /&gt; [[Justice Minister]] [[Irwin Cotler]] applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was "the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history".&lt;ref name="CBCGetting" /&gt; At an Ottawa news conference, [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Anne McLellan]] said: "We have made good on our shared resolve to deliver what I firmly believe will be a fair and lasting resolution of the Indian school legacy."&lt;ref name=CBCGetting&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/school-abuse-victims-getting-1-9b-1.540142 |title=School abuse victims getting $1.9B |publisher=CBC News |date=November 23, 2005 |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001153957/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/school-abuse-victims-getting-1-9b-1.540142 |archivedate=October 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth and Reconciliation program, as well as an individual Common Experience Payment (CEP).&lt;ref name="SurvivorsSpeak"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Survivors_Speak_2015_05_30_web_o.pdf |title=The Survivors Speak: A Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |date=May 30, 2015 |access-date=February 4, 2016 |website=The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110141912/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Survivors_Speak_2015_05_30_web_o.pdf |archivedate=January 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP.&lt;ref name="INACCEP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Experience Payments |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015594/1100100015595 |website=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=May 2, 2017 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516101112/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015594/1100100015595 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of compensation was based on the number of years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marshall |first1=Tabitha |title=Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/indian-residential-schools-settlement-agreement/ |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |accessdate=May 2, 2017 |language=en |date=November 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220161415/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/indian-residential-schools-settlement-agreement/ |archivedate=December 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement|url=http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/IRS%20Settlement%20Agreement-%20ENGLISH.pdf|website=Residential Schools Settlement|publisher=Residential Schools Class Action Litigation|accessdate=May 7, 2017|date=May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

The IRSSA also included the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), a case-by-case, out-of-court resolution process designed to provide compensation for sexual, physical and emotional abuse.  The IAP process was built on the ADR program and all IAP claims from former students are examined by an adjudicator. The IAP became available to all former students of residential schools on September 19, 2007. Former students who experienced abuse and wished to pursue compensation had to apply by themselves or through a lawyer of their choice to receive consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iap-pei.ca/us-nous/us-nous-eng.php |title=About the Independent Assessment Process |year=2007 |access-date=July 14, 2016 |website=Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817000148/http://www.iap-pei.ca/us-nous/us-nous-eng.php |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline to apply for the IAP was September 19, 2012. This gave former students of residential schools four years from the implementation date of the IRSSA to apply for the IAP.

The IRSSA also proposed an advance payment for former students alive and who were 65 years old and over as of May 30, 2005. The deadline for reception of the advance payment form by IRSRC was December 31, 2006. Following a legal process, including an examination of the IRSSA by the courts of the provinces and territories of Canada, an "opt-out" period occurred. During this time, the former students of residential schools could reject the agreement if they did not agree with its dispositions. This opt-out period ended on August 20, 2007, with about 350 former students opting out. The IRSSA was the largest [[class action lawsuit|class action]] settlement in Canadian history. By December 2012, a total of $1.62{{nbsp}}billion was paid to 78,750 former students, 98 per cent of the 80,000 who were eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development&amp;nbsp;– Number 063&amp;nbsp;– 1st Session&amp;nbsp;– 41st Parliament |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=41&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=6028840 |website=Parliament of Canada |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |date=March 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917025853/http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=41&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=6028840 |archivedate=September 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the IRSSA funds left over from CEPs were offered for educational credits for survivors and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Residential school settlement offers $3K education credits |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/residential-school-settlement-offers-3k-education-credits-1.2508958 |accessdate=July 8, 2016 |publisher=CBC News |date=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325185318/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/residential-school-settlement-offers-3k-education-credits-1.2508958 |archivedate=March 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)}}
In 2008, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to travel across Canada collecting the testimonies of people affected by the residential school system. About 6,000 Indigenous people told their stories. The TRC concluded in 2015 with the publication of a six volume, 4,000-plus-page report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. It focused on the importance of moving "from apology to action"&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;{{rp|262}} to achieve true reconciliation and resulted in the establishment of the [[National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation]].&lt;ref name="AADNCTRC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1450124405592/1450124456123 |website=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=April 22, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516072206/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1450124405592/1450124456123 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mas |first1=Susan |title=TRC report charts path to 'true reconciliation,' says Trudeau |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/truth-and-reconciliation-final-report-ottawa-event-1.3365921 |accessdate=April 22, 2017 |publisher=CBC News |date=December 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416185418/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/truth-and-reconciliation-final-report-ottawa-event-1.3365921 |archivedate=April 16, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive summary of the TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide.&lt;ref name="TRCExec"&gt;{{cite web|title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation |publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=May 31, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706170855/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that would be difficult to prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=David B.|authorlink=David Bruce MacDonald|title=Canada's history wars: indigenous genocide and public memory in the United States, Australia and Canada|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=October 2, 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=411–431|doi=10.1080/14623528.2015.1096583|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623528.2015.1096583|subscription=yes|issn=1462-3528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WoolfordBenvenuto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woolford|first1=Andrew|last2=Benvenuto|first2=Jeff|title=Canada and colonial genocide|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=October 2, 2015|volume=17|issue=4|pages=373–390|doi=10.1080/14623528.2015.1096580|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14623528.2015.1096580|url-access=subscription|issn=1462-3528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 94 [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)#Calls to action|Calls to Action]] that accompanied the conclusion of the TRC were recommendations to ensure that all Canadians are educated and made aware of the residential school system.&lt;ref name="Vowel" /&gt;{{rp|175–176}} Justice [[Murray Sinclair]] explained that the recommendations were not aimed solely at prompting government action, but instead a collective move toward reconciliation in which all Canadians have a role to play: "Many of our elements, many of our recommendations and many of the Calls to Action are actually aimed at Canadian society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada must confront 'cultural genocide' of residential schools, Truth and Reconciliation report says |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/truth-and-reconciliation-commission-urges-canada-to-confront-cultural-genocide-of-residential-schools-1.3096229 |accessdate=August 31, 2016 |publisher=CBC News |date=June 2, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906092245/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/truth-and-reconciliation-commission-urges-canada-to-confront-cultural-genocide-of-residential-schools-1.3096229 |archivedate=September 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation of documentation of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted as part of the TRC's Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses.&lt;ref name="Woolley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vincent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SurvivorsPush" /&gt; On April 4, 2016, the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perkel |first1=Colin |title=Documents of residential school abuse can be destroyed, court rules |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2617401/documents-of-residential-school-abuse-can-be-destroyed-court-rules/ |accessdate=July 7, 2016 |work=Global News |date=April 4, 2016 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611005859/http://globalnews.ca/news/2617401/documents-of-residential-school-abuse-can-be-destroyed-court-rules/ |archivedate=June 11, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[Lynn Beyak]], a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] member of the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] [[Standing committee (Canada)|Standing Committee]] of Aboriginal Peoples, voiced disapproval of the final TRC report, saying that it had omitted an "abundance of good" that was present in the schools.&lt;ref name="Ballingall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ballingall|first1=Alex|title=Lynn Beyak calls removal from Senate committee 'a threat to freedom of speech'|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/04/06/lynn-beyak-calls-removal-from-senate-committee-a-threat-to-freedom-of-speech.html|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galloway"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galloway |first1=Gloria |title=Conservatives disavow Tory senator's positive views of residential schools |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-disavow-tory-senators-positive-views-of-residential-schools/article34248144/ |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=March 9, 2017 |language=en-ca |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511115119/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-disavow-tory-senators-positive-views-of-residential-schools/article34248144/ |archivedate=May 11, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beyak's right to free speech was defended by some Conservative senators, her comments were widely criticized by members of the opposition, among them [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs]], [[Carolyn Bennett]], and leader of the [[New Democratic Party]], [[Tom Mulcair]].&lt;ref name="Campion-Smith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campion-Smith|first1=Bruce|title=Senator dumped from aboriginal issues committee for controversial views|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/04/05/senator-dumped-from-aboriginal-issues-committee-for-controversial-views.html|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglican Church also raised concerns stating in a release co-signed by bishops [[Fred Hiltz]] and [[Mark MacDonald (bishop)|Mark MacDonald]]: "There was nothing good about children going missing and no report being filed. There was nothing good about burying children in unmarked graves far from their ancestral homes."&lt;ref name="HiltzMacDonald"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiltz|first1=Frank|last2=MacDonald|first2=Mark|last3=Thompson|first3=Michael|title=There was nothing good: An open letter to Canadian Senator Lynn Beyak – Anglican Church of Canada|url=http://www.anglican.ca/news/nothing-good-open-letter-canadian-senator-lynn-beyak/30018179/|website=Anglican Church of Canada |accessdate=May 7, 2017|date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopper"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopper |first1=Tristan |title='There was nothing good': Anglican church disputes Senator's claim that residential schools contained 'good' |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/there-was-nothing-good-anglican-church-disputes-senators-claim-that-residential-schools-contained-good |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |work=National Post |date=March 20, 2017 |language=en |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Conservative Party leadership removed Beyak from the Senate committee underscoring that her comments did not align with the views of the party.&lt;ref name="Campion-Smith" /&gt;

===Ecclesiastical projects===
The four churches of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement&amp;nbsp;– the United, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches&lt;ref name="SurvivorsSpeak" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– agreed to participate in the reconciliation process between Indigenous and settler Canadians. They have been involved in funding various projects and services that assist former residential school students and their families in healing from the trauma caused by the schools. The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican.ca/healingfund/ |title=Anglican Healing Fund |website=Anglican Church of Canada |access-date=July 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706012512/http://www.anglican.ca/healingfund/ |archivedate=July 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing &amp; Reconciliation Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/social-action/justice-initiatives/justice-and-reconciliation-fund |title=Justice and Reconciliation Fund |website=United Church of Canada |access-date=July 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716223733/http://www.united-church.ca/social-action/justice-initiatives/justice-and-reconciliation-fund |archivedate=July 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing &amp; Reconciliation |url=http://presbyterian.ca/healing/ |website=Presbyterian Church in Canada |accessdate=September 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916191439/http://presbyterian.ca/healing/ |archivedate=September 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The churches have also engaged in reconciliation initiatives such as the Returning to Spirit: Residential School Healing and Reconciliation Program, a workshop that aims to unite Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through discussing the legacy of residential schools and fostering an environment for them to communicate and develop mutual understanding.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt; In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health organizations such as the AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their active participation in these healing efforts.&lt;ref name="TRCExec" /&gt;

===Educational initiatives===
For many communities the existence of buildings that formerly housed residential schools is a traumatic reminder of the system's legacy, and there has been much discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.&lt;ref name="Woolley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucobserver.org/justice/2015/06/grim_reminders/ |title=Grim reminders |last=Woolley |first=Pieta |date=June 2015 |work=The UC Observer |access-date=June 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420102721/http://ucobserver.org/justice/2015/06/grim_reminders/ |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vincent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vincent |first1=Donovan |title=Aboriginals push to save former Ontario residential school known as 'mush hole' |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/06/13/aboriginals-push-to-save-former-ontario-residential-school-known-as-mush-hole.html |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |work=Toronto Star |date=June 13, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815123106/https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/06/13/aboriginals-push-to-save-former-ontario-residential-school-known-as-mush-hole.html |archivedate=August 15, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SurvivorsPush"&gt;{{cite news|title=Survivors push to turn former Manitoba residential school into museum |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/survivors-push-to-turn-former-portage-la-prairie-residential-school-into-museum-1.3367082 |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |publisher=CBC News |date=December 16, 2015 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813072952/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/survivors-push-to-turn-former-portage-la-prairie-residential-school-into-museum-1.3367082 |archivedate=August 13, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2016, it was announced that the building of the former [[Mohawk Institute Residential School]] would be converted into an educational centre with exhibits on the legacy of residential schools. Ontario's Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, [[David Zimmer]], noted: "Its presence will always be a reminder of colonization and the racism of the residential school system; one of the darkest chapters of Canadian history."&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown |first1=Louise |title=Giving a voice to residential school ghosts |url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/07/02/mohawk-institute-residential-to-become-educational-centre.html |accessdate=July 7, 2016 |work=Toronto Star |date=July 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703114132/https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/07/02/mohawk-institute-residential-to-become-educational-centre.html |archivedate=July 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconciliation efforts have also been undertaken by several Canadian universities.

'''Career assessments''' are tools that are designed to help individuals understand how a variety of personal attributes (i.e., data values, preferences, motivations, aptitudes and skills), impact their potential success and satisfaction with different career options and work environments.  Career assessments have played a critical role in career development and the economy in the last century (Whiston and Rahardja, 2005).  Assessments of some or all of these attributes are often used by individuals or organizations, such as university career service centers, [[career counselors]], [[outplacement]] companies, corporate human resources staff, executive coaches, vocational [[Rehabilitation counseling|rehabilitation counselors]], and guidance counselors to help individuals make more informed career decisions.

In part, the popularity for this tool is due to the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which funded career guidance in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kapes, J.T. |author2=Mastie, M.M |author3=&amp;Whitfield, E.A. |title=A Counselor’s Guide to Career Assessment Instruments|year=1994|publisher=National Career Development Association.|location=Alexandria,VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Focus was put onto tools that would help high school students determine which subjects they may want to focus on to reach a chosen career path.  Since 1958, career assessment tool options have exploded.

==Types of career assessments==

Career assessments come in many forms and vary along several dimensions.  The assessments selected by individuals or administrators vary depending on their personal beliefs regarding the most important criteria when considering career choices, as well as the unique needs of the individual considering a career decision.  Some common points of variance are:
* '''Methodology''' - some assessments are quantitative in nature and precisely measure key attributes believed to influence an individuals potential success and satisfaction with a career.  Others are qualitative exercises designed to help individuals clarify their goals and preferences, which can then be used to make more informed career decisions.
* '''Measured attributes''' - assessments vary with regard to the specific personality attributes measured.  Some assessments focus on an individual's interests, and perhaps [[aptitude]], while others focus on skills or values. More robust assessments use [[key development indicator]]s (KDIs) that define measurements for specific types of careers and match individual career aspirations with the needs of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aubrey|first1=Bob|title=The Measure of Man: Leading Human Development|date=September 2015|publisher=McGraw Hill Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Validity''' - many assessments, particularly those offered on the internet, lack evidence for "validity," which is the degree to which interpretation of the results of the assessment or decisions made from the results are useful. Typical evidence of validity is verified empirically. Users should evaluate any tests psychometric properties when assessing whether to use it for a particular purpose, and how much weight to give to the results. When the validity of the assessment for its intended purpose cannot be evaluated, results should be interpreted with appropriate caution.
* '''Target customer profile''' - some assessments, such as the [[Strong Interest Inventory]], the [[Myers Briggs Type Indicator]], [[Careerscope]] and [https://www.traitify.com/ Traitify] are designed to serve broad markets (i.e., virtually any individual choosing a vocational program or [[Career Clusters]], starting their career or considering a career change. Although they may lack well-established reliability (replicability) and validity (usefulness), they can, nevertheless, be useful in helping the individual to identify their career goals.While these tests or assessment tools can be useful, the American Psychological Association's ethics code&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that psychologists using those tests clearly explain the limitations of the tests to their clients.
* '''Career assessment interview''' - a career assessment interview with a trained career counselor or a psychologist who is trained in career counseling can be crucial in helping to integrate tests results into the broader context of the individual's passions, personality, culture and goals. For those interested in this sort of more comprehensive help with their career search a good starting point can be to contact the National Career Development Association [http://www.ncda.org](NCDA). Within the United States, this national body awards the designation, "Master Career Counselor" (MCC) to specially qualified career counselors.

==Benefits==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Career assessments are designed to discover the skills, aptitude and talents of candidates. A self-assessment can be a useful tool in assessing the areas in which a candidate has strengths and limitations. The results can be useful in helping candidates to choose a career that is in tune with their goals and talents.  While the validation of each instrument may vary from test to test, overall these types of assessments have been proven to introduce more career options, increase satisfaction in one’s career plan and increase the understanding of oneself  (Prince et al., 2003).

Data as to how often people change careers are unavailable while there's a considerable mythology about it, no systematic studies have been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704206804575468162805877990.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people change careers more than once. Some make changes because the career path they chose is no longer viable (to wit, buggy whip makers are no longer in high demand). Or because as they mature throughout their lifespan their interests evolve. The biggest benefit of career assessment, therefore, is that it enables candidates to make the best career decisions to grow both personally and professionally.

To make an assessment of their skills, candidates can pursue many avenues, they can take career interest tests such as the [[Strong Interest Inventory]] or the Campbell Interest and Skill inventory, which is based on the Strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manual for the Campbell Interest and Skill Inventory|last=Campbell|first=David|publisher=National Computer Systems|year=1992|isbn=|location=Minneapolis MN 55440|pages=i-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, they can conduct a self-assessment; they can use the plethora of career books designed to help with this task. In fact, there are myriad helpful books, the most famous of which is, Richard Bolles, "What Color is Your Parachute." In addition, they can seek expert help from career counselors, career coaches or, when warranted, psychologists or other mental health professionals. These professionals use a variety of techniques to determine the talents of candidates. Also, career counselors, career coaches and executive coaches can guide candidates on how to go about planning their career to achieve professional success.

==Psychoanalytically-Informed Career Assessment==
People who are unhappy in their work-life may be uncertain as to where to turn for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisoncareerguide.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331155803/http://www.harrisoncareerguide.com/ |archivedate=2015-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have seen career counselors or career coaches or read self-help books and found that their difficulties did not yield to these interventions.&lt;ref name=WashBiz&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman|first=Lynn |date=2000 |title=Analyze this: My job, my life and why I'm not thrilled |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2007/06/04/smallb2.html |journal=Washington Business Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals may be stymied in their careers not only because they lacked career development and job hunting skills but also because they were driven by unconscious factors outside of their awareness.&lt;ref name=NCDA2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman|first=Lynn |date=2014 |title=The Psychoanalytically-Informed Career Assessment Model |url=http://www.ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/98443/_PARENT/layout_details_cc/false |journal=National Career Development Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalytically-Informed Career Assessment (also referred to as psychodynamic career assessment) developed in 2000 by Dr. Lynn Friedman, aims to understand the unconscious factors that create conflicts and identify ways to resolve these conflicts.&lt;ref name=WashBiz /&gt;

Focused on individuals who seek career counseling, but end up undermining the process,&lt;ref name=NCDA2014 /&gt; Psychoanalytically-Informed Career Assessment explores whether the conflicts seen in their careers or career counseling sessions are repeated elsewhere in their lives, for example in school, or with their parents.&lt;ref name=NCDA2015&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman|first=Lynn |date=2015 |title=Understanding the Role of Transference in Career Counseling |url=http://www.ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/106690/_PARENT/layout_details_cc/false |journal=National Career Development Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interventions for these individuals might include one or all of the following: career counseling, psychotherapy or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name=NCDA2014 /&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Career assessment, in the form of tests and other structured and unstructured tools, can be very useful for those who are uncertain about the array of career possibilities.  However, there are some drawbacks to each. At best, the results of individual career assessments provide targeted information that may not address a particular individual's needs.  In addition, some of the best individual assessment tools require the help of a qualified professional to ensure the results are interpreted correctly and usefully.

Also, many of the tests are based on the person’s view of himself or herself. If someone is not self-aware, the results may not be accurate.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy.A.M.|author2=Garavan,T.N.|title=Developing self-awareness in the managerial career development process: the value of 360-degree feedback and the MBTI|journal=Journal of European Industrial Training|year=1999|volume=23|issue=9|pages=437–445|doi=10.1108/03090599910302613}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many times they do not take into account that people have natural blind spots.  The test is only as good as its user and individuals are often not clearly aware of their own strengths and weaknesses.

The '''Civilian Pilot Training Program''' ('''CPTP''') was a [[flight training]] program (1938–1944) sponsored by the [[United States]] government with the stated purpose of increasing the number of civilian pilots, though having a clear impact on military preparedness.

== Establishment ==
In the years immediately preceding [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], several European countries, particularly Italy and Nazi Germany, began training thousands of young people to become [[aviator|pilots]].  Purportedly civilian in nature, these European government-sponsored programs were, in fact, nothing more than military flight training academies.

In October 1938, [[Henry H. Arnold|General Henry H. "Hap" Arnold]] brought in the top three aviation school representatives to request they establish an unfunded startup of CPTP schools at their own risk. These were [[Oliver Parks]] of [[Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology|Parks Air College]], [[C.&amp;nbsp;C. Moseley]] of the [[Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute]], and [[Theophilus Lee]] of the [[Boeing School of Aeronautics]]; all agreed to start work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Army Air Forces in World War&amp;nbsp;II, Volume Six Men and Planes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAA headed by Robert Hinckley,created the [[United States government role in civil aviation|Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938]] that contained language authorizing and funding a trial program for what would evolve into the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP). President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] unveiled the program on December 27, 1938, announcing at a White House press conference that he had signed off on a proposal to provide a needed boost to [[general aviation]] by providing pilot training to 20,000 college students a year.

Following the precedent established by the Europeans, the CPTP was established as a civilian program but its potential for national defense was undisguised. The program started in 1939 with two laws passed by Congress in April and June,&lt;ref name=shsu&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Americans in Defense of Our Nation |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/AfrAmer.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703092352/http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/AfrAmer.html|archive-date=3 July 2009|publisher=Sam Houston State University|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the government paying for a 72-hour [[ground school]] course followed by 35 to 50 hours of [[flight instruction]] at facilities located near eleven colleges and universities.  It was an unqualified success and provided a grand vision for its supporters—to greatly expand the nation's civilian pilot population by training thousands of college students to fly.

== Controversy ==
The military establishment was initially unenthusiastic about the CPTP concept, quite unimpressed by any program initiated and administered by civilians.  [[United States Congress|Congress]], too, was split along mostly party lines as to the value of the CPTP.  [[Isolationists]] branded the program as provocative saber-rattling that threatened the nation's neutrality; others slammed it as a [[pork barrel]] waste of tax dollars, while supporters touted the positive impacts on the aviation industry and the defense value of a vastly enlarged base of trained pilots.

After the [[Polish September Campaign|Nazi invasion of Poland]] on September 1, 1939, triggered World War&amp;nbsp;II, the military value of the CPTP became obvious, even to the program's detractors.  The United States started to evaluate its ability to fight an air war and the results were appalling. Pilots, [[flight instructor|instructors]], and [[training aircraft]] were all in short supply.  Acknowledging the shortage of trained pilots, both the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] reluctantly waived certain “elimination” courses for CPTP graduates and allowed them to proceed directly into pilot training.

The [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] deemed the situation to be so grave it proposed that [[private aviation]] be suspended and all pilot training (most notably the CPTP) be brought under the control of the military. The December 13, 1940, issue of ''American Aviation Daily'' carried this account of the Army's intentions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Preliminary plans are understood to be already drafted by the Army to ground all private flying in the United States for the duration of the national emergency...The Army will take over all training (including CPTP).”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Army's proposal met with stiff resistance. Just two weeks after the American Aviation Daily article appeared, 83 companies with a vested interest in general aviation organized the [[National Aviation Training Association]] (NATA). NATA members recognized that, if left unchallenged, the Army plan would, for all practical purposes, ban private aircraft from U.S. skies. The NATA and other aviation interests blunted the Army's bid with an effective lobbying campaign in Congress. Their actions not only saved the CPTP, they may have saved the entire general aviation industry in the United States.

== Buildup ==
The result was a revitalized CPTP and an expansion of its curriculum to a larger segment of the nation's colleges and universities. In May 1939 the first nine schools were selected, nine more were added in August 1940 (as the [[Battle of Britain]] was raging), 11 more in March 1941, and 15 more by October 1941—four months after the formation of the [[USAAF]]—and just two months before the United States' entry into World War&amp;nbsp;II.  By the program's peak, 1,132 educational institutions and 1,460 flight schools were participating in the CPTP. Institutions such as the [[University of Michigan]]; [[University of Virginia]]; [[University of Washington]]; [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]; [[Pomona Junior College]]; [[San José State University|San Jose State Teachers College]]; and most notably, the [[Tuskegee Institute]], all included the CPTP in their curricula. (See References below to access complete list of educational institutions participating in the CPTP.)

The inclusion of [[Tuskegee University]] in the ranks of CPTP participants, along with [[Hampton University]], [[Virginia State University]], [[Delaware State University]], and [[Howard University]], helped open the doors for the first [[Tuskegee Airmen|African-American military pilots]]. The onset of World War II and political pressure combined to compel the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] — as it was known before [[United States Army Air Forces|June 20, 1941]] — to employ African-Americans as officers and pilots, with the majority of its personnel being graduates of the CPTP.

The decision to train civilian pilots also produced an unexpected, but welcome, side effect on the general aviation industry. As it turned out, the United States faced just as large a shortage of training aircraft as it did civilian pilots. The federal [[Civil Aeronautics Authority]] (predecessor of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]) regulations required a CPTP-participating [[flight school]] to own one aircraft for every ten students enrolled in the program.

Furthermore, the requirements specified for these aircraft narrowed down the field to only several models in production at that time, with most flight schools preferring the [[tandem-seat configuration]] of the [[Piper Cub]]. Seizing the opportunity unexpectedly thrust upon them, several light aircraft manufacturers quickly filled the market void with CPTP-compatible aircraft of their own, such as the [[Waco Aircraft Company|WACO]] [[Waco F series|UPF-7]] and the [[Meyers Aircraft Company|Meyers]] [[Meyers OTW|OTW]] [[biplane]]. [[Aeronca]] and [[Taylorcraft]] also produced [[tandem]] versions of their existing [[side-by-side seating]] high-winged monoplanes, each of which would lead to their own military equivalents.

== Entry into war ==
After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the U.S. entrance into World War&amp;nbsp;II, the CPTP changed forever, including the name. The Civilian Pilot Training Program became the War Training Service (WTS) and, from [[1942 in aviation|1942]] to [[1944 in aviation|1944]], served primarily as the screening program for potential pilot candidates. Students still attended classes at colleges and universities and flight training was still conducted by private flight schools, but all WTS graduates were required to sign a contract agreeing to enter the military following graduation. There is a list of colleges and universities participating in the CPTP in '43-'44 in the appendix of "They Flew Proud".

The CPTP/WTS program was largely phased out in the summer of 1944, but not before 435,165 people, including hundreds of women and African-Americans, had been taught to fly. Notable legends trained under the CPTP include: Astronaut/Senator [[John Glenn]], top Navy ace [[Alexander Vraciu]], Douglas test pilot Robert Rahn, top World War&amp;nbsp;II ace Major [[Richard Bong]], triple ace [[Bud Anderson]], former Senator [[George McGovern]], [[Women Airforce Service Pilots|WASP]] Dora Dougherty and Tuskegee airman Major Robert W. Deiz. The CPTP admirably achieved its primary mission, best expressed by the title of aviation historian Dominick Pisano's book, ''To Fill the Skies with Pilots''.

Two of the largest CPT/WTS schools were Piedmont Aviation, operated by Tom Davis, and Southern Airways, operated by Frank W. Hulse. Piedmont's school was based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, while Southern had schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, Greenville and Camden, South Carolina, and in Birmingham and Decatur, Alabama. Both companies trained over 60,000 war pilots including young men from Brazil (Piedmont) and a large number of Royal Air Force pilots from England (Southern). By 1947 Davis had turned his school into Piedmont Airlines with scheduled passenger flights between North Carolina and Ohio. In 1949, Hulse had Southern Airways flying commercial service between Jacksonville, Florida and Memphis, Tennessee, and between Atlanta and Charlotte. Both airlines began operations with war surplus Douglas DC-3 aircraft that were modified for commercial service in their former CPT/WTS maintenance hangars.

One of the few women instructors in the CPTP later wrote about her experiences. With the threat of war rising on the horizon, [[Opal Kunz]] renewed her pilot’s license after taking a refresher course at Hagerstown, Maryland, and began teaching aviation students at the Arkansas State College (now [[Arkansas State University]]). She later moved to Rhode Island, and at the start of World War II became an instructor at the [[Rhode Island State Airport Terminal]] for Navy cadets and the government sponsored “Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP)”  during the war, teaching over 400 young men how to fly for the Air Corps. This was her old dream of the [[Betsy Ross Air Corps]] come true, as she helped train the men who would fly fighter aircraft in combat. An account from the time shows the work she was doing by saying: “Mrs. Kunz has been in Providence since January [1942] as a member of the staff of E. W. [[Wiggins Airways]].  She has a mother’s confidence in her ‘boys’ and they reciprocate with respect and enthusiasm. Nothing gives her greater joy than to see them solo, to know she has taken them one step nearer to Uncle Sam’s aerial defense line.”  Later, at her home in California, she would recall her experiences with fondness. “I trained about 400 boys and it was easily the highlight of my career. I really became a sort of foster mother to them. You would be surprised how many of my boys brought their wives and children to see me after the war.”&lt;ref&gt;Lu Hollander, Executive Director of the 99's. Private Communication, September 18, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; She also indicated in a letter that she had trained combat pilots. “...I was a flight instructor all during the war. Had over three hundred students who served as combat pilots in the war.”&lt;ref&gt;John F. Kennedy Library, Boston, “White House Central Name File, Box 1532, Folder: KUNZ.” Letter from Opal Kunz to President Kennedy, dated April 14, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one CPTP graduate, [[Betty Tackaberry Blake]], went on to serve as a [[Women Airforce Service Pilot]] (WASP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Betty C.G.T.

'''Compit Educational Centre''' or Compit for short, is a privately operated school system located in [[Easleigh]], [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].

==History==
Compit was founded in 2001-2002 school year to meet the schooling needs for ever increasing [[Somali people|Somali]] immigrants in Kenya's capital.

Students at Compit are young people fleeing from war torn areas in Somalia from such places like [[Mogadishu]], [[Kismayo]], [[Bardera]], [[Beled Haawo]], [[Belet wayne]] and other large towns in the south of the country where much of the population of Somalia once lived.

==History and Current Student Population==
Compit started operating from rented facilities opposite from 6th Street Mosque and it grew over the years. By school year 2010, the school's student body stands at 2,800 students.

Two types of students attend Compit Educuational Centre, uniformed students and non-uniform students. High school students go to classrooms in Easleigh's section III. The two other locations; 6th street and Sunrise Shopping Centre are non-uniformed although uniformed Standard Eight classes are formed in last quarter of 2010.

The manager of Compit Education Centre, Hassan Buule Faliir and school's principal Mr. Otieno plan to graduate each year 400 students, 200 each from Standard Eight and Form Four classes.

==Diplomas granted==
Primary and secondary education diplomas are granted from qualifying curriculum and policies from Kenya Education System and Compit has been part of this process from the start. Primary education certificate or standard/grade 1-8 or KCPE and secondary education which is grade 9 or form II- to form IV or KCSE are granted at Compit Educational Centre graduates. Both KCPE (Kenya Certificate of Primary Education) and KCSE (Kenya Certificate for Secondary Education) are being debated about their validity according to a new education commission.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Compit is registered with a host of institutions and governmental agencies such as the Kenya Ministry of Education and Computer Society of https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100404/http://www.cskonline.org/training.html. Leaving graduation certificates such as Primary Education and Secondary Education are obtained from the Kenya Ministry of Education. Students sit on annual leaving exams of primary and secondary education which are available across Kenya.

==Location==
For 2010 School year, Compit Educational Centre is still renting classrooms and offices from ordinary looking business places such as Sunrise Shopping Center on 2nd Avenue in Eastleigh. The original 6th street location which opened in 2011 is still being used as offices as well as classrooms.

==Plot==
Kaburagi Kazeo is a new transfer student at Suzuran All-Boys High School. While walking to school, he witnesses a group of students get clipped by a passing town car. He arrives just in time for the “opening ceremony”, a showdown between Goura Toru, the school's number one fighter, and another student. The fracas is interrupted by the arrival of Kagami Ryohei, another transfer student, whose arrogance immediately draws the ire of the crowd. Recognizing his vehicle as the town car from earlier, Kazeo confronts Ryohei, who ignores him and walks away. Before he can follow, Kazeo is attacked by another student, Wajima, whom he promptly knocks out with a single punch.

At the Doberman Bar, former mob enforcer Katagiri Ken enjoys a drink while trying to keep a low profile. He encounters Makise Takashi, whom he implores to forget they saw each other. Makise instead ropes Ken into coming to work with him at a local auto dealer. Back at Suzuran, Kazeo is approached by Ogisu Kenichi, who explains that since beating Wajima at the opening ceremony, Kazeo has been ranked as the school's number five fighter. He goes on to suggest that Kazeo might be a contender to take on Goura for the top spot, and that they should join forces. Kazeo rejects the idea, asserting that he has no interest in conquering Suzuran. Meanwhile, Ryohei begins taking on challengers, and proves to be a skilled fighter himself.

Later, at the bar, Kazeo and Kenichi get into a scrap with Shibata Hiroki, the top fighter from neighboring Kurosaki Industrial High. Back at the Nakata dealership, Ken is adjusting well to his new life as a salesman, and has become smitten with the owner, Aya. However, he soon discovers that the local mob is trying to force the shop out in order to redevelop the land. To protect Aya and the business, Ken goes to see the mob boss, Mr. Nara, who refuses to stop pursuing the Nakata property. During the meeting, Ken encounters Fujiwara, a former Kurosaki student turned mob recruit, as well Ryohei. Having known Ryohei's father from his former profession, Ken is disheartened to learn that Ryohei is now being groomed as Nara's successor.

Kazeo visits the cemetery accompanied by his mother, with whom he has a strained relationship. It is revealed that his father was a professional boxer who died due to injuries sustained during a match, and that his mother subsequently developed problems with drinking and gambling. The next day, Ken comes to Suzuran to find Ryohei but runs into Kazeo, with whom he shares stories of his youth at the school. Fujiwara is sent on behalf of the Nara Gang to harass the Nakata shop. He also begins stirring up conflict between Kurosaki and Suzuran as revenge against Shibata, with whom he holds a grudge following an incident which landed Fujiwara in prison. His plan pays off, as an enraged Goura begins attacking Kurosaki students in retaliation. Goura soon learns that Ryohei and Fujiwara are acquainted, but is stabbed by a Kurosaki student.

Shibata confronts Fujiwara, but is defeated and left with a broken arm. Ryohei and his gang begin relentless assaults at Suzuran, resulting in Kenichi being hospitalized. The injured Goura challenges Ryohei, but is also defeated, and Ryohei is named Suzuran's top fighter. Later, Fujiwara and Ryohei return to the Nakata shop to shut it down once and for all, setting fire to the building. Escaping the blaze, Ken seeks out Kazeo and begs him to stop Ryohei, for his own good. Spurred on by the escalating violence, Kazeo assembles his own force to take back the school.

Kazeo leads his gang, joined by Goura, to confront Ryohei and Fujiwara. Despite his injury, Goura singlehandedly dispatches many opponents before taking on Fujiwara himself, where he quickly loses the upper hand. As Fujiwara prepares to finish Goura, Shibata arrives. Noticing burns on Shibata’s chest that he caused, Fujiwara admits that he had deserved to have been punished for his actions; he apologizes to Shibata and retreats. Kazeo finally clashes with Ryohei, and after an intense and lengthy battle, he emerges victorious. Ken arrives soon after and whisks the battered Ryohei off for treatment, and away from the influence of the Nara Gang.

Sometime later, the Nakata auto shop has been renovated and is a thriving business again. Kazeo, having become the number one fighter and united the school, faces down the final obstacle on his path to completely conquering Suzuran - the indomitable Rindaman. The film ends as their battle begins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4620">[[Image:Cryophorus.svg|thumb|300px|right|A diagram of a cryophorus showing water evaporating from the left bulb and condensing and freezing in the right bulb.]]

A '''cryophorus''' is a glass container containing [[liquid water]] and [[water vapor]]. It is used in [[physics]] courses to demonstrate rapid [[freezing]] by [[evaporation]]. A typical cryophorus has a bulb at one end connected to a tube of the same material. When the liquid water is manipulated into the bulbed end and the other end is submerged into a freezing mixture (such as [[liquid nitrogen]]),  the gas pressure drops as it is cooled.  The liquid water begins to evaporate, producing more water vapor. Evaporation causes the water to cool rapidly to its [[freezing point]] and it solidifies suddenly.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wollaston's cryophorus was a repurposed "pulse glass".&lt;br&gt;

The "pulse glass" or "pulse hammer" (German: ''Pulshammer'') was a toy / novelty that had existed in Germany since the 1760s and perhaps earlier.  In 1767 [[Benjamin Franklin]] visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it.  See:
*  [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-15-02-0091#BNFN-01-15-02-0091-fn-0013-ptr Benjamin Franklin's letter to John Winthrop of 2 July 1768]
*  {{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Benjamin|title=Experiments And Observations On Electricity, Made At Philadelphia in America … |date=1769|publisher=David Henry|location=London, England|pages=489–492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-48_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA489#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}

Franklin's pulse glass consisted of two glass bulbs connected by a U-shaped tube; one of the bulbs was partially filled with water in equilibrium with its vapor.  Holding the partially filled bulb in one's hand would cause the water to flow into the empty bulb. For videos of Franklin's pulse glass in operation, see:
*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Yei5vBsxM Pulse Glass]
*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbiMGsE0h8k Franklin's pulse glass]
Wollaston was familiar with the pulse glass's construction:  from (Wollaston, 1813), p. 73:  "The mode of effecting this [i.e., expelling air from the cryophorus] is well known to those who are accustomed to blow glass."&lt;br&gt;
In the case of Franklin's pulse glass, water in the filled bulb was caused to evaporate by heating the water in the filled bulb.  In the case of Wollaston's cryophorus, water in the filled bulb was caused to evaporate by cooling and condensing the water vapor in the empty bulb.&lt;br&gt;

Wollaston's cryophorus was a precursor to the modern [[heat pipe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Wollaston's cryophosphorus – precursor of the heat pipe | last = Smith | first = B.A. | date = September 1980 | journal = Physics Education | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 310–314 | url = http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0031-9120/15/5/006 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9120/15/5/006|bibcode = 1980PhyEd..15..310S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic''' ('''ASNC''' or, informally, '''ASNaC''') is one of the constituent departments of the [[University of Cambridge]], and focuses on the history, material culture, languages and literatures of the various peoples who inhabited [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and the extended [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian world]] in the early Middle Ages (5th century to 12th century). It is based on the second floor of the Faculty of English at [[West Road, Cambridge|9 West Road]]. In Cambridge University jargon, its students are called ''ASNaCs''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shakespeare]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27731725 'A Point of View: Taking England back to the Dark Ages'], ''BBC News Magazine'', 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains the only university faculty or department in the world to focus entirely on the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hugh Magennis, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Anglo-Saxon Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The study of Anglo-Saxon England and its neighbouring regions has deep roots at Cambridge, beginning with the sixteenth-century Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]]. The first half of the seventeenth century saw [[Abraham Wheelocke]] hold a readership in Anglo-Saxon, and in 1657 [[John Spelman]] bestowed on [[William Somner]] the annual stipend of the Anglo-Saxon lecture founded by his father, [[Sir Henry Spelman]], at Cambridge, enabling him to complete the first Old English dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum, voces, phrasesque praecipuas Anglo-Saxonicas. . . cum Latina et Anglica vocum interpretatione complectens. . . Aecesserunt Aelfrici Abbatis Grammatica Latino-Saxonica cum glossario suo ejusdem generis,' 2 pts, Oxford, 1659; 2nd edit, with additions by [[Thomas Benson (scholar)|Thomas Benson]], 1701.&lt;/ref&gt; After a lull in interest in Old English, in the nineteenth century, [[John Mitchell Kemble]] developed the study of Old English and Anglo-Saxon archaeology at Trinity College, and [[Joseph Bosworth]], another Anglo-Saxonist who was associated with Trinity, endowed the [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon|Elrington and Bosworth Chair]] in Anglo-Saxon, established in 1878, and first held by [[Walter William Skeat]]. Strengths at Cambridge in Old Norse were built up by [[Eiríkr Magnússon|Eiríkur Magnússon]] (1833–1913) and in Celtic studies by [[Edmund Crosby Quiggin]] (1875–1920).

The ASNaC Department as such has its origins in the work and ideas of Skeat's successor as Elrington and Bosworth Professor, [[Hector Munro Chadwick]], of Clare College. Chadwick took a leading role in integrating the philological study of Old English with archaeology and history and, by bringing the study of Old English from the Faculty of English to Archaeology and Anthropology in 1928, founded what was to become the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic:&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the University of Cambridge'', ed. by [[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]], 4 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988–2004), IV (Peter Searby, ''1890–1990''), 445. See further [[Allen Frantzen]], 'By the Numbers: Anglo-Saxon Scholarship at the Century's End', in ''A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), DOI: 10.1111/b.9780631209041.2001.00030.x (pp. 478-80).&lt;/ref&gt; 'Chadwick's aim ... was to keep Old English studies free from philology (as it was then practised), but also from the dominance of English Literature'.&lt;ref&gt;John Walmesley, ' "A Term of Opprobrium": Twentieth Century Linguistics and English Philology', in ''History of Linguistics 2008'', ed. by Gerda Hassler, Studies in the History of the Language Sciences, 115 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2008), pp. 35-47 (at p. 39).&lt;/ref&gt; However, 'the alliance of Anglo-Saxon and archaeology suited the professor and not the students; and in the 1960s Professor [[Dorothy Whitelock]] led the Saxon flock back into the English fold'--specifically in 1967, though the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology continues to sustain strengths in Anglo-Saxon and early medieval archaeology, with relevant archaeology papers being available to ASNaCs.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the University of Cambridge'', ed. by Christopher Brooke, 4 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988–2004), IV (Peter Searby, ''1890–1990''), 445, 202; Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901–1982)', in ''Women Medievalists and the Academy'', ed. by [[Jane Chance]] (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at pp. 559-60).&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies Tripos was introduced as a single-part (two-year) Tripos in 1957, the class list being published under the title 'Anglo-Saxon'; in 1971 this was relabelled 'Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic' under [[Peter Clemoes]].&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Leedham-Green, ''A Concise History of the University of Cambridge'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 226-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, under the leadership of [[Michael Lapidge]], ASNC became a two-part (three-year) Tripos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/about/history.htm Departmental History, Department of ASNC]&lt;/ref&gt; The Elrington and Bosworth Professor was customarily the head of the ASNaC Department, until a rotating headship system was introduced during the professorship of [[Simon Keynes]] in the early twenty-first century.

The name ASNC or ASNaC is pronounced /{{IPA|'æznæk}}/, and originally denoted members of the ASNC Society rather than of the Department. It was coined as a pun on an early poster for the ASNC Society Lunches: 'A Snack for ASNACs'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Harvey, ''The Origin of ASNaC'', Chadwick Lecture Addendum 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students in the department were referred to in English as Asnackers, in French as Asnaciennes or Asnaques, and in German as Asnäckische.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the simpler term 'Asnacs' came into common use.

In 2015 the department was the subject of the scholarly article collection ''H M Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', edited by [[Michael Lapidge]] (CMCS Publications).

== Major research projects ==

In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] the department was rated as the top Celtic Studies department in the UK, and one of the top departments and faculties within the University of Cambridge, with 75% of its submitted research rated internationally excellent (3*) or world-leading (4*).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because of its strongly interdisciplinary nature, elements of the Department's research were considered by the panels for History, English and Classics as well as Celtic Studies.

In collaboration with [[King's College London]], since 2005 the department has developed and organised the free-access [[Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet L. Nelson, 'From Building Site to Building: The ''Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England'' (''PASE'') Project', in ''Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities'', ed. by Marilyn Deegan, Willard McCarty (Farnham: Ashgate, 2012), pp. 123-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages taught ==

Language-study is central to ASNaC degree programmes, and the Department is a major training ground in these skills for researchers in early medieval history. The Department provides ''ab initio'' tuition in Old English, Old Norse, Old Irish, Middle Welsh, and Latin.

Despite the Department's medieval focus, its pre-eminence as a UK centre of Scandinavian and Celtic studies has led both the Irish and Icelandic governments to provide grants for the teaching of Modern Irish and Icelandic (respectively) to members of Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/currentstudents/icelandic/, http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/currentstudents/irish/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==
=== Applications and admissions ===

Between 1900 and 1999, around 860 students studied in the Department or its precursor institutions. Between 1900 and 1946, 68% were women; thereafter there was a slight majority of men until 1980; and rough gender parity 1980-1999.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Abersytwyth University, 2015), pp. 1-58 {{ISBN|9780955718298}} [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70], pp. 1-58 (p. 41).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2012, between 50 and 60 applicants applied for the ASNC BA per year; about 53% were offered places; and about 43% (20-25 students) accepted their offers.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/statistics/.|title=Undergraduate Study|publisher=study.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduate student body is majority female (⅔ for the 2011 admissions cycle) and has a strong preponderance of state-school leavers (84% of home students for the 2011 admissions cycle).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/statistics/archive/admissionsstatistics2011.pdf, pp. 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASNaC Society===

The department has an affiliated student society, the ASNaC Society. It is recorded as hosting academic papers as early as 1971.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. W. Hunter, 'The Study of Anglo-Saxon Architecture Since 1770: An Evaluation', ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society'', 66 (1975-76), 129-39 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Clement, '[https://www.oenewsletter.org/OEN/archive/OEN13_1.pdf University of Cambridge Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic Society', ''Old English Newsletter'', 13.1 (Fall 1979), 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Rollason, 'The Cults of Murdered Royal Saints in Anglo-Saxon England', ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 11 (1982), 1-22 (p. 1 fn 1), {{DOI|10.1017/S0263675100002544}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Lapidge]], &lt;blockquote&gt;From the mid-1980s onward, the combined number of undergraduate nd graduate students reached (which might be described as) a critical mass, with the result that there was a very palpable surge in corporate spirit and concomitant pride in being an 'ASNaC', a member of a small but elite group of students distinguished throughout the University for its academic attainments.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Society organises a weekly 'ASNaC Lunch', field trips, punting expeditions, dinners, and ASNaC mugs and sweatshirts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Abersytwyth University, 2015), pp. 1-58 {{ISBN|9780955718298}} [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70], pp. 1-58 (pp. 44-45, quoting p. 44).&lt;/ref&gt; The Society is also noted for producing the (mostly) twice yearly ''Gesta Asnacorum'', founded by [[Tom Shakespeare]], which satirises the life of the Department and the medieval texts and modern scholarship it studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Asnacorum. 'Gesta Asnacorum', 1985–1995: The First Ten Years'', ed. by Richard Fairhurst (Cambridge: The Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, 1997), p. 7; http://www.srcf.ucam.org/asnac/data/gesta.php.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ''Gesta Asnacorum'' is merely a scurrilous student rag, it does feature the [[juvenilia]] of many alumni of the department who have gone on to become prominent historians.

=== Alumni ===

ASNaCs have gone into many walks of life, but a significant proportion of academics in the fields of early medieval European literature and history, particularly in Celtic studies, have studied or taught at the department, making it a historically highly influential institution in its field. Academically prominent alumni of the department or its forerunner institutions who are not listed above as staff include:

*[[Florence Harmer]] (matriculated before 1920)
*[[Audrey Meaney]] (graduated 1959)
*[[David Denison]]
*[[Philip Jenkins]] (matriculated c. 1970)
*[[Sarah Foot]] (matriculated 1979)
* [[Julia Crick]] (matriculated 1982)

Other noted alumni include:

* [[Jane Stevenson]], historian and novelist (matriculated c. 1980)
* [[Tom Shakespeare]], academic and disability campaigner (matriculated 1984)
* [[Stephan Grundy]], novelist (graduated 1995)
* [[Elin Manahan Thomas]], opera singer (matriculated 1995)
* [[Dan Starkey (actor)]], actor (matriculated 1996)
* [[Rebecca Dowbiggin]], rower (matriculated c. 2001)
* [[Paul Best (cricketer)|Paul Best]], cricketer (matriculated c. 2009)

== Appearances in popular culture ==

Maria, the protagonist of Thomas Thurman's children's book ''Not Ordinarily Borrowable; or, Unwelcome Advice'', is an Asnac (there characterised as 'a person who studies the way people lived a long, long time ago, far longer ago than the time when Maria lived, and looks at the things they made and the writings they left behind').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Thurman, ''Not Ordinarily Borrowable; or, Unwelcome Advice'' ([n.p.]: CreateSpace, 2009), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eve Poole''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO}} (born '''Eva Auerbach'''; 29 December 1924 – 26 December 1992) was a New Zealand politician who served as [[Mayor of Invercargill]] from 1983 until her death in 1992. She was the first and thus far only woman and Jewish person to hold this position.

==Early life==
Eve Poole was born Eva Auerbach in Frankfurt, Germany on 29 December 1924.&lt;ref name="Gilman_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/search/search?path=%2FqueryEntry.m%3Ftype%3Ddeaths |title=Death search: registration number 1993/31161 |website=Births, deaths &amp; marriages online |publisher=Department of Internal Affairs |accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family fled to [[Tel Aviv]], Israel in 1932 after her father was brutally beaten in a [[Nazi]] street demonstration against Jews.&lt;ref name="Gilman_1999"&gt;{{cite book | title=Jewries at the Frontier: Accommodation, Identity, Conflict | publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] | date=1 September 1999 | editor1=Gilman, Sander L |editor2=Milton, Shane |isbn=0252067924|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=FhXZHOmcrlYC&amp;pg=PA366|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Thomson |editor-first= Jane |title= Southern People: a dictionary of Otago Southland biography |year=1998 |publisher=Longacre Press |location=Dunedin |isbn=1-877135-11-9|oclc= |page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1939 to 1945 she served in the [[British Eighth Army]] as a driver in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. It was during this time that she met her husband, Vernon Poole, who was a tank commander in the [[20th Battalion (New Zealand)|20th Battalion]] of the [[2nd New Zealand Division]]. They married in Israel, and after the war they settled down in Invercargill.&lt;ref name="Past Mayors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icc.govt.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Past-Mayors-updated-March-20161.pdf |title=Information on past Mayors of Invercargill City |publisher=Invercargill City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having trained at [[Habima Theatre]] in Israel,&lt;ref name="nzgeo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/southland-a-winter-journey/ |title=Southland: A winter journey |publisher=New Zealand Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poole went on to teach drama at [[Southland Girls' High School]].&lt;ref name="Gilman_1999"/&gt;

==Political career==
Poole was elected to the Invercargill City Council in 1971 and became Deputy Mayor in 1974, being the first woman to hold either position in Invercargill. In 1980 she made her first challenge for Mayor but was unsuccessful, losing to the incumbent [[Russell Miller (mayor)|F. Russell Miller]] by 400 votes.&lt;ref name="Stuff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/150-stories-in-150-days/8094984/Invercargill-elects-first-woman-mayor |title=Invercargill elects first woman mayor |publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1982 Queen's Birthday Honours]] Poole was appointed a [[Companion of the Queen's Service Order]] for public services.&lt;ref name="whatsonivers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whatsoninvers.nz/wednesday-windback-23/ |title=Wednesday Windback – What's on Invers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poole returned to politics in 1983, making a second run for Mayor. She won 56.8 per cent of the vote, becoming the first woman mayor and first Jewish mayor of Invercargill.&lt;ref name="Stuff"/&gt; As Mayor, Poole was highly involved in [[the arts]]. [[Norman Jones (politician)|Norman Jones]], the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] MP for [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)|Invercargill]], described her as having brought nothing but "culture and emotion" to Southland.&lt;ref name="nzgeo"/&gt; She was instrumental in the construction of the Invercargill Public Library, which was later named in her honour after her death in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/southland-region/print |title=Southland region |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as President of the [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery|Southland Museum]] Trust Board, and as member of the [[Anderson Park, Invercargill|Anderson Park]] Art Gallery Council&lt;ref name="whatsonivers"/&gt; and the [[Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council]].&lt;ref name="Past Mayors"/&gt;

==Death==
Poole was admitted to [[Dunedin Hospital]] in late 1992 due to severe back pain. She developed an infection during the course of examination, and died peacefully on 26 December 1992, aged 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/150-stories-in-150-days/8168474/City-Mayor-Eve-Poole-dies |title=City Mayor Eve Poole dies |publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at Invercargill's Eastern Cemetery, along with her husband who died on 27 April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icc.govt.nz/cemetery-result/?id=58885 |title=Cemetery result |publisher=Invercargill City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">A '''Field Training Officer''' ('''FTO''') is an experienced or senior member of an organization who is responsible for the training and evaluation of a junior or probationary level member. The role is used extensively in [[Law enforcement organisation|law enforcement]], [[fire departments]], and [[emergency medical services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walledlake.com/NewFire/Training/WLFD_04_Trng_rpt.pdf |title=Walled Lake Fire Department Training Division 2004 Report |author=Gonzales, Jason R. |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609023002/http://www.walledlake.com/NewFire/Training/WLFD_04_Trng_rpt.pdf |archivedate=June 9, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==

Field training officers usually receive specialized classroom training and certification to meet state requirements (such as [[Police Officer Standards and Training|POST]], [[TCLEOSE]] or [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]) before performing field training duties for the department they work for.

==Function==

{{Main|Field training program}}
[[File:Army-USA-OR-02.svg|thumb|Some FTO’s wear distinguishing insignia, such as single [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summervillepolice.com/ftoprogram.htm |title=Field Training and Evaluation Program |accessdate=April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A new trainee is usually only allowed to work with an FTO for a predetermined amount of time, or until the field training staff determines that they are ready to work on their own. Field training for police officers typically lasts 12 to 18 weeks, In some instances the trainee may work for a short amount of time prior to attending a formal training/certification program. During this time the FTO may complete part or the majority of the FTO program and then complete the remaining upon completion of the certification process.

It is also not unusual for a trainee to have multiple field training officers that they rotate around to. For instance, in some law enforcement agencies a trainee may spend several weeks on each shift or in each specialty area of a department, during which time they could have multiple FTOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wftoa.org/manuals/Mesapd_fto_manual.pdf |title=Mesa Police Department Supplemental Manual| author=Strauss, Jan |accessdate=April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==

The duties of the FTO involve being a [[role model]], clearly communicating the expectations of training, teaching the trainee the policies of the department, correctly applying concepts learned in the classroom to field training operations, and evaluating the trainee on his or her progress in the program. Ultimately, the FTO is responsible for making sure shift duties are performed properly and completely.

==Burnout==

Addressing the concept of “[[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]]” in FTOs is a fairly recent development. Burnout can begin as loss of interest in a task or boredom. Eventually, if left untreated, burnout can result in loss of productivity, low morale, substance abuse, and mental illness.&lt;ref name="FTOburn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mesaaz.gov/police/fto/pdf/FTOBurnoutEthics.pdf |title=FTO Burnout |work=An APOSTB document addressing FTO burnout |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331063132/http://www.mesaaz.gov/police/fto/pdf/FTOBurnoutEthics.pdf |archivedate=March 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether burnout affects FTOs more than regular employees. Considering that an FTO not only performs his or her normal work tasks, but also the tasks of a trainer, it would stand to reason that FTOs would be particularly subject to the effect.

Many agencies and profession-related articles have begun to formally address the effect.&lt;ref name="FTOburn" /&gt;

==Industry==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}} 
The role of FTO is also common among large corporations who elect to develop their own [[Trainer (business)|trainers]] as opposed to hiring professional corporate trainers from outside the company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1776">{{about|the general concept of a "gathering place"|the park in Tulsa, Oklahoma|Gathering Place}}

A '''gathering place''' is any place where people are able to congregate. Gathering places may be [[public space|public]]; for example, city streets, town squares, and parks; or private; for example, churches, coffee shops, stadiums, and theaters.

Examples of gathering places include [[Stonehenge]], the [[agora]] of [[ancient Greece]], [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], and [[London]]'s [[Trafalgar Square]].

==Island of O{{okina}}ahu as ''The Gathering Place''==
The Island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] in [[Hawaii]] is often nicknamed (or translated as) ''"The Gathering Place"''. This makes sense because O{{okina}}ahu is the most populated [[Hawaiian islands|Hawaiian Island]]. In ancient times, however, O{{okina}}ahu was not populous and was outranked by the status of other islands. The translation of ''"gathering place"'' was suggested as recently as 1922 by Hawaiian Almanac author [[Thomas Thrum]]. It has been speculated that Thrum ignored or misplaced the [[ʻOkina|{{okina}}okina]] because the [[Hawaiian Language|Hawaiian]] phrase "''{{okina}}o ahu''" could be translated as ''"gathering of objects"'' (''{{okina}}o'' is a subject marker and ''ahu'' means ''"to gather"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Pukui, Mary Kawena | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Place Names of Hawaii | date= | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | location= | isbn=0-8248-0524-0 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct spelling — O{{okina}}ahu — has no confirmed translation.

[[image:Ginetlogo.png|thumb|right|300px|Genocide Intervention Network logo]]
The '''Genocide Intervention Network''' (or '''GI-NET''') was a [[non-profit organization]] aiming to "empower individuals and communities with the tools to prevent and stop genocide".&lt;ref name="Global Hand"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalhand.org/en/browse/disasters/176/all/organisation/25012 |title=The Genocide Intervention Network (GI-NET) |publisher=[[Crossroads Foundation Ltd]]|work=Global Hand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2004, in 2005 the '''Genocide Intervention Fund''' changed its name to Genocide Intervention Network,&lt;ref name="Global Hand"/&gt; and in 2011, it merged with the [[Save Darfur Coalition]] to form a new organization, '''United to End Genocide'''.

==History==
In October 2004, two [[Swarthmore College]] students, [[Mark Hanis]] and [[Andrew Sniderman]], established the Genocide Intervention Network in hopes of empowering citizens to protect civilians from the atrocities occurring in Darfur. GI-Net's mission and policy goals were greatly influenced by the "[[Responsibility to Protect]]" doctrine, drafted by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, in order to create a permanent anti-genocide grassroots movement.&lt;ref name="United to End Genocide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Responsibility to Protect|url=http://endgenocide.org/learn/responsibility-to-protect/|publisher=United to End Genocide|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, GI-Net and the Save Darfur Coalition merged to establish United to End Genocide.&lt;ref name="Save Darfur Coalition"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Ann|title=Advocacy Groups Save Darfur Coalition and Genocide Intervention Network Announce Merger to Create Powerful Constituency Focused on Preventing Genocide and Mass Atrocities|url=http://www.savedarfur.org/pages/press/advocacy-groups-save-darfur-coalition-and-genocide-intervention-networ/|accessdate=28 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116023108/http://www.savedarfur.org/pages/press/advocacy-groups-save-darfur-coalition-and-genocide-intervention-networ/|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting the African Mission in Sudan===

Mark Hanis, Andrew Sniderman, Sam Bell, Cara Angelotta, Susannah Gund, Janessa Calvo-Friedman, Rita Kamani, Elisabeth Jaquette and others wanted the genocide in Sudan to be treated as a security issue, not as a humanitarian disaster, and did so by directly supporting the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]] (AMIS), an underfunded peacekeeping force.&lt;ref name=Zengerle&gt;{{cite web|last=Zengerle|first=Jason|title=Student Aid|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/student-aid#|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GI-Net's controversial idea of supporting military force for foreign intervention attracted the attention of Gayle Smith, who had two decades of experience in Africa and had been the senior director of African Affairs in Clinton's National Security Council. Smith provided the first positive interest in GI-Net's work. Smith helped GI-Net raise over $300,000 to support AMIS.&lt;ref name="Zengerle"/&gt;

After several disagreements on how to organize the fundraising money, GI-Net, in collaboration with the African Union, funded the [[Africa Humanitarian Action]] to support patrols that would protect displaced women, who put themselves at risk of rape when they left the internally displaced persons camps to collect firewood in order to prepare food. The program was canceled due to a lack of additional support and financial resources.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Rebecca|title=for Darfur: Public Action and the Struggle to Stop Genocide|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0230100228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Divestment Movement===
In 2006, GI-Net looked for new methods to increase economic pressure on the Sudanese government. However, after the U.S. government had already maxed out the economic sanctions it could apply alone, GI-Net increased its involvement in the divestment campaign that had begun on Harvard's college campus in 2004.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

The goal behind the divestment campaign was simple: to engage students to pressure their universities to withdraw investments providing revenue to Sudanese government. This financial support allowed the Sudanese government to expand on their military assets.

By April 2005, the student activism prompted college officials to change its investment policies. Harvard University declared that it would withdraw support in China National Petroleum Corporation, a business partner of the Sudanese government.&lt;ref name="President and Fellows of Harvard College"&gt;{{cite news |title=Statement by Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (CCSR) Regarding Stock in PetroChina Company Limited|author=President and Fellows of Harvard College|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2005/04/ccsr_statement/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=4 April 2005|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies in the oil industry were the perfect target for divestment since oil is an essential source of revenue for the government, but is an industry that provides little benefit or relief to Sudanese civilians.&lt;ref name=Strout&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strout|first=Erin|title=Sudan Divestment Movement Gains On Campuses|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=30 June 2006|volume=52|issue=43|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.proxyau.wrlc.org/ehost/detail?sid=5a6c8f11-8acb-48f3-8989-9f0eaa7a4185%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=122&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=21669927|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 2006, the divestment movement grew substantially and adopted larger goals. The group eventually became known as the Sudan Divestment Task Force, which drafted legislation to influence state legislatures around the United States to divest.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

Feeling pressured by the U.S.-based advocacy campaign, the Khartoum spent close to a million dollars on an eight-page spread in the New York Times encouraging companies to invest in Sudan, a country with "peaceful, prosperous and democratic future".&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

===Dream for Darfur===

As the official Olympic torch made its way around the world prior to the beginning of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], the [[Olympic Dream for Darfur]] team, a campaign to bring mass attention to the conflict in Darfur, began its own symbolic relay. The Dream for Darfur team had one and only goal: to convince China that the continuation of the Olympic Games in Beijing was at risk unless it withdrew support for Sudan's regime.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenberg|first=Ilan|title=Changing the Rules of the Games|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/magazine/30olympics-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genocide survivors joined the relay led by [[Mia Farrow]] and traveled to Rwanda, Armenia, Germany, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Cambodia.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

This led to the formation of a U.S.-based relay in September 2007. Jill Savitt and Mia Farrow organized and led the event, supported by GI-Net, the [[Save Darfur Coalition]], and the [[Enough Project]].&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;

The mission of the Dream for Darfur team was to break down the foreign policy information into digestible form, so that citizens, without the background to understand the complexities of the international policy-making process, could become involved in the anti-genocide campaign.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

The Dream for Darfur team encouraged the major sponsors of the Olympic Games, such as [[McDonald's]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Volkswagen]] to privately meet with Chinese officials to raise concern over affairs in Darfur. Eventually, the team encouraged [[Steven Spielberg]] to resign as creative consultant for the opening ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;

===Rebranding and reorganizing===
In 2005, the organization changed its name from Genocide Intervention Fund to its current name, Genocide Intervention Network. GI-Net was publicly re-launched on April 6, 2005. GI-Net immediately broadened its efforts by introducing a membership and chapter program in order to educate and mobilize support for U.S. policies that could assist victims in Darfur.&lt;ref name="United to End Genocide"/&gt; In 2011, the Save Darfur Coalition and GI-Net merged to create United to End Genocide. The organization's president is Tom Andrews.&lt;ref name="United to End Genocide"/&gt;

==Advocacy Programs==

===Carl Wilkens Fellowship===

GI-Net launched a program to build an engaged and permanent anti-genocide community. Named in honor of [[Carl Wilkens]]—the only American to remain in Rwanda during the genocide in 1994—the "Wilkens Fellowship" was a selective year-long program that exposed individuals to vital tools and resources in hopes of building permanent peaceful communities throughout the world.

The Wilkens Fellowship allowed hundreds of ordinary United States citizens to become anti-genocide leaders. The program terminated in 2012 due to financial constraints.&lt;ref name="United to End Genocide" /&gt;

===STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition===

Shortly after President George W. Bush labeled the conflict in [[Darfur]] as "genocide," a group of Georgetown University students created a campus community organization that focuses on genocide prevention. The program gained national recognition, and now colleges and universities across the United States host STAND chapters.&lt;ref name="Who We Are"&gt;{{cite web|title=STAND|url=http://www.standnow.org/about/who|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STAND emerged as a grassroots-based campaign that networks students who are committed to ending crimes against humanity around the world. Since its debut, STAND developed as a key component in the anti-genocide movement alongside its previous parent organizations: the Genocide Intervention Network, which merged into United to End Genocide. In 2012, STAND became an independent organization, entirely student-run.&lt;ref name="Who We Are" /&gt;

===Sudan Divestment Task Force/Conflict Risk Network===

Two college students co-founded the Sudan Divestment Task Force (SDTF) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Kimura-Walsh and Walter Allen. "Globalization from Above: Globalization from Below, Mechanisms for Social Disparity and Social Justice in Higher Education in Rodney K. Hopson, Carol Camp Yeakey, Francis Musa Boakari, Power, Voice and the Public Good: Schooling and Education in Global Societies, (Bingley, UK: JAI Press) p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force launched successful divestment campaigns around the world targeting university endowments, asset managers and city, state, and national investment policies.&lt;ref name="Holly Hubbard Preston"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sudan divestment campaigns gain momentum|author=Holly Hubbard Preston|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/your-money/23iht-mdivest.1.13157602.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=23 May 2008|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Task Force efforts, twenty-two states, dozens of universities, eleven cities and fifteen countries adopted Sudan divestment policies. SDTF worked closely with Genocide Intervention Network, and in 2006 became part of GI-NET under the leadership of Adam Sterling, an original co-founder. The Sudan Divestment Task Force led to the enactment of the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act (SADA) on December 31, 2007. This dynamic act has been the most forceful Sudan bill since the start of the genocide in Darfur.

Universities spanning the United States are taking active parts in the campaign. The University of California, Brown, Amherst, Princeton, the University of Vermont, and the University of Washington are only some of the several accredited institutions that encourage companies not to provide financial support to the Sudanese government. Instead, financial aid is given directly to the victims of the genocide.&lt;ref name=Fliegler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fliegler|first=Caryn Meyers|title=Paths To Sudan Divestment|journal=University Business|year=2006|volume=9|series=7|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.proxyau.wrlc.org/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=af49db98-b9aa-422f-a1e1-432b7af8a997%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=122|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, SDTF became the Conflict Risk Network (CRN). Drawing upon successes in corporate engagement and the lessons learned from the Sudan divestment movement, CRN calls on corporate actors to fulfill their responsibility to respect human rights and to take steps that support peace and stability in areas affected by genocide and mass atrocities.&lt;ref name="Conflict Risk Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conflictrisknetwork.org/ |title=Conflict Risk Network |publisher=Conflict Risk Network |accessdate=15 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Pierce Baker''' (April 4, 1866 – January 6, 1935)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1800047 ''American National Biography'']&lt;/ref&gt; was an American educator in the field of [[drama]].

==Biography==
Baker graduated in the [[Harvard University]] class of 1887, served as Editor-in-Chief of ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]'', and taught in the English Department at Harvard from 1888 until 1924. He started his "47 workshop" class in playwriting in 1905. He was instrumental in creating the Harvard Theatre Collection at [[Harvard University Library]]. In 1908 he began the Harvard Dramatic Club, acting as its sponsor, and in 1912 he founded Workshop 47 to provide a forum for the performance of plays developed within his English 47 class. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1914.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to persuade Harvard to offer a degree in playwriting, he moved to [[Yale University]] in 1925, where he helped found the [[Yale School of Drama]]. He remained there until his retirement in 1933.&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Banham|editor-first = Martin|year=1998|chapter=Baker, George Pierce|title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-43437-8|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker was also selected to teach a seminar whose unconfirmed title was "Shakespeare" or "the English drama" at the [[Sorbonne]] University (Paris, France) in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Archival source: CARAN, Paris. AJ/16-4750 (1907) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--('''HEA''') is the authority in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] with responsibility for [[higher education]] since 1968 and placed on a [[Act of the Oireachtas|statutory]] basis in 1971. The authority supports [[HEAnet]], part of the [[GEANT]] network.--&gt;

The '''Higher Education Authority'''&lt;ref&gt;The official name of the authority is "''An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas''" (sometimes shortened to "''An tÚdarás''"), from [[Irish language|Irish]], but in practice the unofficial English name, taken from the short title of the enacting legislation, is more widely used.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''HEA''') is the statutory policy-advisory body for higher education in Ireland. This means that the HEA works in providing high-quality, evidence-based policy-advice to the Government across all aspects of the mission of higher education.

According to their website, the aim of the HEA is "to create a coherent system of diverse institutions with distinct missions, which is responsive to the social, cultural and economic development of Ireland and its people and supports the achievement of national objectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hea.ie/about-us/overview/|title=Higher Education Authority - Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The authority has a statutory responsibility, at central government level, for the effective governance and regulation of higher education institutions and the higher education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hea.ie/about-us/|title=Higher Education Authority - About us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority is responsible for the funding of Irish universities, institutes of technology and other third level colleges. 
&lt;!-- The authority has presented many strategic reports since its foundation, a recent report was conducting into reforming medical training in Ireland; this proposed system should lead to the creation of a two route entry into medicine which will include entry via a bachelor's degree and aptitude test, in addition to the current "[[Central Applications Office|points race]]" system. --&gt;

The '''Independent Association of Prep Schools''' ('''IAPS''', formerly '''Independent Association of Preparatory Schools''') is a schools association, representing around 670 [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://iaps.uk/about/| title = IAPS {{!}} The Independent Association of Prep Schools| last = www.chapel-studios.co.uk| first = Chapel Studios -| website = iaps.uk| access-date = 2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of IAPS' schools are in the UK, with other locations including Africa, the Middle East, Singapore, and the USA.

IAPS is a part of the [[Independent Schools Council]].

== History ==
IAPS was founded in 1892, as the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools.

In 1981 IAPS merged with the Association of Headmistresses of Preparatory Schools, and ten years later moved its headquarters from Kensington to its current offices in [[Royal Leamington Spa|Leamington Spa.]]

In 2007 the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools changed its legal title to IAPS, and became known as the Independent Association of Preparatory Schools. In 2010, this was shortened to the current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = IAPS - Overview (free company information from Companies House)
| website = beta.companieshouse.gov.uk
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
IAPS elects a chairman every three years, having changed from a one-year cycle in 2015. Vice-chairs continue to be elected annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

| last = www.chapel-studios.co.uk
| first = Chapel Studios -
| website = iaps.uk
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hanson has been chief executive of IAPS since 2008. In 2015, Mark Brotherton replaced Julie Robinson as Director of Education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Much of the work of IAPS is directed by various committees, made up of current headteachers of member schools.

IAPS' Council meets once a term, and the association holds an annual conference every September.

==Role==
IAPS commits itself to providing and promoting excellence in education. It provides its members with a national voice on matters of independent prep school education, and seeks to have a positive influence on public opinion of prep schools,

Members are provided with advice, information and support on educational and school management issues, and receive regular internal and external mailings via the organisation.

Schools are encouraged to share their news stories with IAPS, many of which are featured in the association's partner magazine, ''Attain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

IAPS arranges a number of developmental courses for its members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10296">{{Rights|Distinctions}}
Group rights, also known as collective rights, are [[rights]] held by a group ''qua'' group rather than by its members severally;&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-group/ |title=Group Rights (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast, individual rights are rights held by [[Individuality|individual people]]; even if they are group-differentiated, which most rights are, they remain individual rights if the right-holders are the individuals themselves.&lt;ref name="Jones 2010"&gt;{{harvp|Jones|2010|p=39ss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group rights have historically been used both to infringe upon and to facilitate individual rights, and the concept remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Bisaz 2012"&gt;{{harvp|Bisaz|2012|pp=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational group rights==
Besides the rights of groups based upon the immutable characteristics of their individual members, other group rights cater toward organizational persons, including nation-states, [[trade union]]s, [[corporation]]s, trade associations, chambers of commerce, [[political parties]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Such organizations are accorded rights which are particular to their specifically-stated functions and their capacities to speak on behalf of their members, i.e. the capacity of the corporation to speak to the government on behalf of all individual customers or employees or the capacity of the trade union to [[Collective bargaining|negotiate for benefits with employers on behalf of all workers in a company]].

==Philosophies==
In the political views of [[classical liberal]]s and some [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarians]], the role of the government is solely to identify, protect, and enforce the natural rights of the individual while attempting to assure just remedies for transgressions. Liberal governments that respect individual rights often provide for systemic controls that protect individual rights such as a system of [[due process]] in [[criminal justice]]. Proponents of this philosophy,  such as [[Jordan Peterson]], situate individual rights as in dialectical opposition to [[Collectivism|collective]] rights, suggesting that the two are mutually exclusive, and that philosophies and political theories that value collective rights do so at the expense of the individual and their rights. Peterson cites this sacrifice of the individual for the collective as reason to oppose left-wing ideologies, with particular reference to communism, alleging that "group rights are catastrophic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Rational National|title=Jordan Peterson Claims ‘Group Rights’ Are Catastrophic|date=2018-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhhsl5iI1DI|accessdate=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Critics of Peterson's reasoning suggest that his argument is based on a fallacious false-dichotomy that implies individual and group rights are mutually exclusive, separate and opposed; instead proposing that the two are inherently connected and require one another to ensure both are secured. Without certain collective rights, for example, a cardinal principle in international law, enshrined in Chapter I Article I of the [[United Nations Charter]], secures the right of "[[Self-determination]] of ''peoples''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html|title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter 1: Purposes &amp; Principles|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without this group right, the ''people'' have no means or authority to assert the individual rights that self-determination enables the establishment of. If ''people'' are unable to determine their collective future, they are certainly unable to assert or ensure their individual rights, future and freedoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/rights-group/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Jones|first=Peter|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to individual-collective dichotomy proposed by Peterson and contemporaries, critics suggest that both are necessarily connected and intertwined, rejecting the assertion that they exist in a mutually exclusive relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]], developer of the philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], asserted that a group, as such, has no rights. She maintained that only an individual can possess rights, and therefore the expression "individual rights" is a redundancy, while the expression "collective rights" is a contradiction in terms. In this view, a person can neither acquire new rights by joining a group nor lose the rights which he does possess. Man can be in a group without want or the group minority, without rights. According to this philosophy, individual rights are not subject to a public vote, a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority, the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from the will of majorities, and the smallest minority on earth is the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualrights.html |title=Individual Rights – Ayn Rand Lexicon |publisher=Aynrandlexicon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand offers several unique perspectives on rights, holding that 1. ontologically, rights are neither attributes nor conventions but principles of morality, having, therefore, the same epistemic status as any other moral principle; 2. rights "define and sanction man's freedom of action,";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3. as protectors of freedom of action, rights do not mean "entitlements" to be supplied with any goods or services;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|pp=110, 113–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4. "Man's rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only by means of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or enslave him, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or compel him to act against his own rational judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1964|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5. rights derive from the mind's needs: for an organism that survives by means of reason, freedom is a survival-requirement:initiated force negates or paralyzes the thinking mind. Rand's overall argument is that rights protect freedom in order to protect reason. "Force and mind are opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rand|1957|p=1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in 1776 in his book [[The Wealth of Nations|''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']], describes the right of each successive generation, as a group, collectively, to the earth and all the earth possesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stewart|1811|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Declaration of Independence|''Declaration of Independence'']] states several group, or collective, rights of the people as well as the states, for example the Right of the People: "whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" and the right of  the States: "... as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do."

'''InsideOUT Writers''' ('''IOW''') is a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization that conducts weekly writing classes inside Los Angeles County juvenile halls and jails. IOW also serves as a support network for formerly incarcerated young people. The program seeks to inspire personal growth and transformation through creative writing.&lt;ref name="JJI"/&gt; Since 1996, more than 11,000 youth have participated in over 15,000 classes.&lt;ref name="IOW"&gt;{{cite web|title=IOW History|url=http://www.insideoutwriters.org/mission/|publisher=InsideOUT Writers|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During each class, students are given multiple writing prompts and are then asked to share their work and both receive and provide feedback from the writing circle.&lt;ref name="jjc"/&gt;  IOW also convenes annual writing retreats at juvenile detention facilities and publishes ''In Depth'', a literary journal of students and alumni writings. The classes are taught by writers, poets, screenwriters, journalists, educators and other volunteers. Notable teachers have included [[Scott Budnick (film producer)|Scott Budnick]], [[Bruce Lisker]] and [[Mark Salzman]]. The organization is funded both by the county and private donors.&lt;ref name="JJI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Archer|first1=Christine|title=California Teacher Uses Writing to Inspire Incarcerated Youth|url=http://jjie.org/california-teacher-uses-writing-to-inspire-incarcerated-youth/107372/|publisher=Juvenile Justice Information Exchange|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
InsideOUT Writers was founded in 1996 by Sister Janet Harris, [[Presentation Sisters|PBVM]], who was serving as the Catholic chaplain at [[Central Juvenile Hall]]. While speaking to the young inmates about what they were going through, she found them frustrated, hopeless, afraid, and wondered: "What outlets could she provide for them to process those feelings?"&lt;ref name="justin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cascio|first1=Justin|title=Incarcerated Youth Write the Stories of Their Lives|url=http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/the-good-life-insideout-incarcerated-youth-write-the-stories-of-their-lives/|publisher=The Good Men Project|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister Janet decided to start a writing experience at [[Central Juvenile Hall]].  She recruited then-''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Duane Noriyuki to come and teach a writing class.&lt;ref name="justin"/&gt; In 1996, Noriyuki wrote a piece for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' about Harris's ministry entitled ''Sister of Mercy''.&lt;ref name="mercy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noriyuki|first1=Duane|title=Sister of Mercy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-04/news/ls-31091_1_sister-janet|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the beginning of the program, Mario Rocha, who was on trial for murder, met Sister Harris when he was selected for the writing program. Harris was struck by his demeanor and was impressed with his writing skills. Ultimately, she became convinced of his innocence, even though he was convicted of murder, and she began her own investigation.&lt;ref name="mich"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mario Rocha|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3589|website=National Registry of Exonerations|publisher=University of Michigan Law School|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Harris found new witnesses and persuaded the law firm of [[Latham Watkins]] to take on the case for free, Rocha was exonerated.&lt;ref name="mich"/&gt;

Several notable figures have participated in IOW. In 2003, [[Scott Budnick (film producer)|Scott Budnick]] began volunteering as an InsideOUT teacher at the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in [[Sylmar, California]].&lt;ref name=mother&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mechanic|first1=Michael|title=Why the Producer of "The Hangover Part III" Spends So Much Time in Prison|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/hangover-part-iii-executive-producer-scott-budnick-california-prison-interview|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, Budnick still volunteers at the Nidorf Juvenile Hall.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehta|first1=Seema|title=For Writers in Juvenile Hall, Sentences Can be Liberating|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-juvenile-hall-writers-20140922-story.html#page=2|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this experience and others, Budnick began to tell administrators and politicians about the problems he was seeing in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems, and founded the [[Anti-Recidivism Coalition]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=Mary|title=Scott Budnick, Hollywood blockbuster producer, gave it all up to reform prisons|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/20/scott-budnick-hollywood-producer-prison-reform|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mother/&gt; Bruce Lisker, who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his mother, has taught with IOW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Iris|title=Lisker Chronicles: Bruce gives back|url=http://www.laobserved.com/intell/2015/12/lisker_chronicles_bruce_gives.php|publisher=LAObserved|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Salzman]] taught for IOW at Central, and wrote a book about his experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCollam|first1=Douglas|title=Rough Drafts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/books/rough-drafts.html|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christina McDowell, author of ''After Perfect'', teaches with IOW.&lt;ref name="lowe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Lindsay|title=My Dad Worked for 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and Left Me $100,000 in Debt|url=http://parade.com/405206/lindsaylowe/my-dad-worked-for-the-wolf-of-wall-street-and-left-me-100000-in-debt/|publisher=Parade|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, IOW teamed with the [[Los Angeles Opera]] to perform stories written by incarcerated youths at Central.&lt;ref name="molvi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molvi|first1=Fareeha|title=LA Opera performs stories by incarcerated youth at juvenile hall|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/11/11/29801/l-opera-set-perform-pieces-written-incarcerated-yo/|publisher=89.3 KPCC|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alumni program==
In 2010, InsideOUT formalized an Alumni Program. When students get out of detention, InsideOUT provides case management, life skills training, continued creative writing classes, and mentoring, to build on what happens inside.&lt;ref name="justin"/&gt; During weekly writing circles, former incarcerated students reflect on their time on the inside and since.&lt;ref name="jjc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Henry Foster|title=InsideOUT Writers Turn the System Inside Out|url=http://jjie.org/insideout-writers-turn-the-system-inside-out/107627/|publisher=Juvenile Justice Information Exchange|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JamesLong1.JPG|thumb|Bust of James Long on James Long Sarani, Kolkata]]
'''James Long''' (1814–1887) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] priest of the [[Anglican Church]]. A [[humanism|humanist]], educator, [[Evangelism|evangelist]], translator, essayist, philanthropist and [[List of Protestant missionaries in India|a missionary to India]], he resided in the city of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India, from 1840 to 1872 as a member of the [[Church Missionary Society in India|Church Missionary Society]], leading the mission at [[Thakurpukur]].

Long was closely associated with the [[Calcutta School-Book Society]], the [[Bethune Society]], the [[Bengal Social Science Association]] and [[The Asiatic Society]]. He also published the English translation of the play ''[[Nil Darpan]]'' by [[Dinabandhu Mitra]], an act for which he was subsequently prosecuted for libel, fined, and briefly jailed.

==Early life==
James Long was born in [[Bandon, County Cork]], Ireland in 1814, when Ireland was still [[Act of Union 1800|a part of the United Kingdom]], to John Long and his wife Anne. At the age of twelve he was enrolled at the newly opened Bandon Endowed School, where he learnt "Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French and English languages; Euclid, Algebra, Logic; Arithmetic, Book-keeping, Reading, Writing, History and Geography".&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; He proved an excellent student, distinguishing himself especially in theology and the [[classics]].

Long's application to join the Church Missionary Society was accepted in 1838 and he was sent to the [[Church Missionary Society College, Islington]].&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Following two years's training at Islington the Reverend Long was sent to Calcutta to join the CMS mission there. He arrived in Calcutta in 1840, briefly returning to England in 1848 to marry Emily Orme, daughter of William Orme.&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calcutta and Thakurpukur==
From 1840 to 1848, Long taught at the school for non-Christian students run by the CMS at its premises located on [[Amherst Street (Kolkata)|Amherst Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to India a married man in 1848, he was placed in charge of the CMS mission in Thakurpukur, at the time a hamlet a day’s journey out of Calcutta in the [[Bengal Presidency]]. By 1851, Long had set up a [[vernacular]] school for boys in Thakurpukur, while his wife Emily ran a corresponding school for girls. In an 1854 letter to F. J. Halliday of the Council of Education, he boasts a roll-call of "about 100 boys, [[Hindu]], [[Muslim|Mussulman]], and Christians."&lt;ref&gt;"To the Hon'ble F. J. Halliday", Issue no.22 of ''Selections from the records of the Bengal Government'', (Calcutta Gazette Office, 1855) p.74 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=correspondence+relationg+to+vernacular+education&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; His work ''Bengali Proverbs'' (1851) has been called a significant addition to [[Bengali literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Choudhury |first=Nurul Hossain |year=2012 |chapter=Long, Rev. James |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Long,_Rev._James |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied Bengali proverbs and folk literature for another two decades, publishing ''A Catalogue of Bengali Newspapers and Periodicals from 1818 to 1855'' (1855), and the ''Descriptive Catalogue of Vernacular Books and Pamphlets'' which was forwarded by the Government of India to the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exposition]] of 1867 .

===The ''Nil Darpan'' affair===
[[File:NilDurpanfrontpage.JPG|thumb|Title page of Long's edition of the English ''Nil Darpan'']]

In 1861, at the height of the [[Indigo revolt]] by the [[ryot]]s in [[Bengal]], Long received a copy of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] play ''[[Nil Darpan]]'' (also transcribed as ''Neel Darpan'' or ''Nil Durpan'') from its author [[Dinabandhu Mitra]], who had been one of Long's students at the CMS school on Amherst Street. The play, published anonymously the previous year in [[Dhaka|Dacca]], was sympathetic to the abject condition of the ryots or labourers on indigo plantations and critical of the British land-holding class who kept the ryots in slave-like conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Long brought it to the notice of Walter Scott Seton-Karr, Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission. Seton-Karr, sensing its importance, mentioned ''Nil Durpan'' in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor, [[John Peter Grant]]. Grant then expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends. Long had it anonymously translated into English "By A Native" (Long refused to divulge the name of the translator to the trial court; [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] later attributed the translation to [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], although this attribution remains contentious&lt;ref&gt;Preface to ''Nil Durpan'' by Sudhi Pradhan, p.xxv&lt;/ref&gt;) and printed in either April or May  1861.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial note to ''Nil Darpan'' by Sudhi Pradhan, p.i&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to the play, he wrote that "[i]t is the earnest wish of the writer of these lines that harmony may be speedily established between the Planter and the Ryot..."&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''Nil Durpan'' by James Long ed. Pradhan, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Long sent the translated manuscript to Clement Henry Manuel, the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press, to print five hundred copies at the cost of some three hundred rupees. Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor, Long began sending out copies in official Government envelopes to prominent Europeans both in India and abroad that had the heading: "on her Majesty’s Service."&lt;ref&gt;Oddie,p.119&lt;/ref&gt;

The circulation of the play "generated hostility from indigo planters, who brought a lawsuit against Long on the charges that the preface of the play slandered the editors of the two pro-plantation newspapers, the ''Englishman'' and the ''Bengal Hurkaru'', and that the text of the drama brought the planters a bad name."&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia pp.21-22&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the planters noticed the circulation of the play, W. F. Fergusson, the Secretary of the Landholders' and Commercial Association, wrote to the Governor of Bengal. He inquired as to which parties had sanctioned the play and whether the authority of the Bengal Government had given permission to publish it. He also threatened those who had circulated "foul and malicious libel on indigo planting, evoking sedition and breaches of the peace".&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote that they must be prosecuted "with an utmost rigour of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The Lieutenant Governor replied that some officials had caused the offence; the planters, unsatisfied with the answer, decided to institute legal proceedings with a view to ascertain the authors and publishers of the ''Nil Durpan''. The words mentioned in Long’s Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was "plain but true"; this was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements. C. H. Manuel, whose name was mentioned as printer of ''Nil Durpan'', was indicted in the [[Calcutta Supreme Court]] on 11 June 1861. He pleaded guilty, and his counsel (acting on Long’s advice) named Long as his employer in the matter of publishing.

Long's trial lasted from 19 to 24 July 1861, at the Calcutta Supreme Court. Mr. Peterson and Mr. Cowie prosecuted, Mr. Eglinton and Mr. Newmarch appeared on behalf of the defendant, and Sir M.L. Wells presided as judge. Wells found Long guilty of libel,&lt;ref&gt;''Nil Durpan'' ed. Pradhan, p.115-116&lt;/ref&gt; fined him one thousand [[rupee]]s and sentenced him to one month’s imprisonment, which he served in the period of July–August 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia p.22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaliprasanna Singha]] paid the fine of Long's behalf.

==Later life and legacy==

Following three years of home leave following the indigo controversy, Rev. and Mrs Long returned to Calcutta. Mrs Long died of [[amoebic dysentery]] while on a voyage back to England in February 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, Long shared a house in Calcutta with the Rev. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]], a longtime friend and associate who had lost his wife the same year. Together the two men hosted joint Indo-British soirees—rare events in those segregated times—and generally sought to foster a rapprochement between the British colonizers and the natives. Guests included [[George Edward Lynch Cotton|Bishop Cotton]] and [[Keshub Chunder Sen]] among others.

As Long continued his educational work, he developed a keen interest in Russia, which he visited for the first time in 1863, and twice after his retirement in 1872. In his paper entitled ''Russia, Central Asia, and British India'' published in London in 1865, he wrote of his optimism about the prospects of [[serf]] emancipation, and against the current attitude of [[The Great Game|paranoia towards Russia]] about the valuable role of the [[Russian Empire|Russian government]] and of the [[Orthodox Church]] in propagating Christianity in central Asia to serve as a bulwark against [[Islam]].

In 1872, Reverend James Long retired from the Church Missionary Society and left India for good. He lived for the rest of his life in London, where he continued to write and publish until his death on 23 March 1887. Long set up a posthumous endowment called the ''Long Lectureship in Oriental Religions'' in 1885, for the appointment of one or more lecturers annually to deliver lectures at certain centres of education in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Oddie, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Long lends his name to [[James Long Sarani]], a major thoroughfare running through Thakurpukur.

==Birth and early life==
Januarius Asongu was born into a middle-class family in West [[Cameroon]] (former [[British Cameroons]]) in 1970 as the first of seven children (four female and three male). His parents, Nicholas Jingwa and Monique Nkengbeza, were devout [[Catholic]] Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catholic-social-teaching/seven-themes-of-catholic-social-teaching.cfm |title=Seven themes of Catholic Social Teaching |publisher=Usccb.org |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a leader of the Young Christian Students (YCS) in Kumbo Diocese, while in secondary and high school.

==Education==
Asongu went to secondary and high school at Government High School [[Kumbo]] (now Government Bilingual High School Kumbo) from 1982–89.

'''John Maclean Jr.''', [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] (March 3, 1800 &amp;ndash; August 10, 1886)&lt;ref&gt;J. P. MacLean, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GZDRnxhDmUkC&amp;pg=PA388 ''A History of the Clan MacLean from Its First Settlement at Duard Castle, in the Isle of Mull, to the Present Period, Including a Genealogical Account of Some of the Principal Families Together with Their Heraldry, Legends, Superstitions, Etc''], Heritage Books, 2009, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] clergyman and educator who served as the tenth President of [[Princeton University]], then known as the College of New Jersey. Maclean, the son of the first professor of [[chemistry]] at the College of New Jersey, grew up in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He attended the College and later [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]. At age 23, he became full professor of [[mathematics]] at the university. Six years later, he became university vice president. He was responsible for bringing a number of renown scholars and academics to the college. During this time, he also left mathematics and became professor of [[historical linguistics|ancient languages]]. Maclean was one of the chief architects of the state's public education system. His plan for a state [[normal school]], local boards of education and nonsectarian public schools was adopted by the [[New Jersey Legislature|state legislature]]. He became president of the College of New Jersey in 1854. He led the university through the 1855 burning of [[Nassau Hall]] and the [[American Civil War]]. After retiring from his post after 14 years in office, he wrote a two-volume history of the university. He served as the honorary president of the university's Alumni Association until his death.

==Early life==
Maclean Jr. was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], as the son of John Maclean Sr., the first professor of [[chemistry]] at the College of New Jersey. He attended the College of New Jersey and graduated in 1816 as the youngest member of his class. He then spent the next two years earning his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree from the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]. Afterwards, he went back to the university and began as a tutor in [[Greek language|Greek]]. He became a full professor of [[mathematics]] at age 23. In 1824, he helped to create the [[Chi Phi]] Society, a semi-religious, semi-literary organization, which ceased activity the following year when it merged with the Philadelphian Society.

==As vice president==
In the late 1820s, Maclean devised a plan to enlarge and improve the faculty, in hopes of reversing the declining enrollment which had beleaguered the university over the last few years, to the point that university president [[James Carnahan]] considered shutting down the institution. Maclean's plan was accepted by the university's trustees in 1829, and he was subsequently named vice president. During his 25 years at that position, Maclean brought in a number of noted scholars to the institution, such as [[Joseph Henry]], [[Arnold Henry Guyot]], [[John Torrey]], [[Stephen Alexander (astronomer)|Stephen Alexander]] and Albert B. Dod. Maclean also shifted his professorship from mathematics to [[historical linguistics|ancient languages]] until 1854, when he succeeded James Carnahan as the tenth president of the university.

==President of the university==
During his 14-year tenure as president, Maclean led the university through some difficult times. In 1855, after [[Nassau Hall]] burned down, he sought the financial support of alumni and beneficiaries to contribute funds for rebuilding. He operated the college on a limited budget for five years and gave up part of his own salary to help rebuild the hall. The university lost a number of students who joined the [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate armies]] during the Civil War. Maclean kept the faculty together and managed a complete educational program for the students still attending the university. During the war Maclean, as voted by the board of trustees, conveyed an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Lincoln accepted, and wrote to Maclean that "[t]he assurance conveyed by this high compliment that the course of the government which I represent has received the approval of a body of gentlemen of such character and intelligence in this time of public trial is most grateful to me."

As president, Maclean witnessed the start of [[college baseball|baseball]] at Princeton, heard the first rendition of the university [[alma mater]], ''Old Nassau'', and voted to make orange among the university's official colors.

==Other work==
In 1828, Maclean gave an address, advocating for a [[public education]] system in [[New Jersey]]. He drew up a plan for a state [[normal school]], local [[board of education|boards of education]], and nonsectarian public schools. On the subject of religion and public education, Maclean stated:
{{cquote|There should be in no case the least interference with the rights of conscience, and no scholar should be required to attend to any lesson relating to morals or religion, to which his parents may be opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Maclean | first=John Jr. |title=A Lecture on a School System for New Jersey: Delivered, January 23, 1828, in the Chapel of Nassau Hall, Before the Literacy and Philosophical Society of New Jersey | publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] | location=Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1829 |isbn= | page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The state legislature soon afterwards adopted his public education plan. Maclean also took interest in local churches. He served as a counselor, [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] and organizer of the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church and the Second Presbyterian Church, which became known as "Doctor Maclean's Church". Maclean also was involved with the state's prisons. As a member of the New Jersey Prison Association, he conducted weekly [[service of worship|service]]s at the state penitentiary in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]].

==Retirement==
After retiring from the university, Maclean's friends bought him a house, where he lived during the remainder of his life. In 1877, he wrote a two-volume history of the university entitled ''History of the College of New Jersey: From Its Origin in 1746 to the Commencement of 1854''. He served as honorary president of the university's Alumni Association and attended an alumni commencement meeting in 1886, just six weeks before his death.

Maclean was honored with the naming of university's Maclean House, which has served as the office of the Alumni Council since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Sail Training Vessel ''Kaliakra''''' (Known also as '''STV ''Kaliakra''''', {{lang-bg|Калиакра}}) is a [[barquentine]], built in 1984 at the [[Gdańsk Shipyard]], after the plans of the Polish technical designer [[Zygmunt Choreń]]. She is a property of Bulgarian  Maritime Training Centre and is operated by [[Navibulgar|Navigation Maritime Bulgare]], Bulgaria. The ship's home port is Varna, Bulgaria.

==The ship==
The general perception is that ''Kaliakra'' is a reproduction of a ship of the same name from the time before World War I. In fact, she is one of three modern sister ships designed for training, the other two being [[Pogoria (ship)|STS ''Pogoria'']] and [[Iskra (Tall ship)|ORP ''Iskra'']]. Now she is used for training the Naval Cadets from [[Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy]] in [[Varna]], Bulgaria.

The ship is one of the fastest [[tall ship]]s in the world.{{cn|date=March 2014}} She has participated on relatively regular basis in the [[The Tall Ships' Races|Cutty Sark Tall Ships regatta]], organized by the [[Sail Training International]] (STI) Association. During the Columbus Race in 1992, dedicated to the 500 years jubilee of the discovery of [[Americas|America]], ''Kaliakra'' sailed the Atlantic Ocean twice and finished third out of 143 ships.

Onboard ''Kaliakra'' have been King [[Juan Carlos of Spain]], [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince Haakon of Norway]] and many other distinguished personalities.{{cn|date=March 2014}}

Sail Training journeys are performed, as well as tourist cruises.

In 1996 a coin of 1000 [[Bulgarian lev|leva]] denomination that featured the ship on its tail was issued.

'''Kannu''' is a [[learning management system]], purpose-built for creative education in music, arts, and design. It was released by California-based company [[Kadenze]] in 2014 after the success of its [[MOOC]] platform, which Kannu is modeled after.

== History ==
[[Kadenze]] first released Kannu in November of 2014. Some early adopters of the customized platform were [[California Institute of the Arts]], [[Otis College of Art and Design]], [[Rhode Island School of Design]], [[Goldsmiths College]], and [[Stanford University]]. After rounds of user testing and improvement it officially launched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Tara García Mathewson, [http://www.educationdive.com/news/kadenze-follows-up-arts-focused-mooc-platform-with-lms/409526/ "Kadenze follows up arts-focused MOOC platform with LMS"], Education Dive, November 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
Kannu offers the usual features included in an LMS, such as course authoring, gradebooks, and attendance sheets. Some of its special features include modular course materials and custom branding, as well as forums for students. Per its origin as an arts LMS, it has a submission gallery, robust media embedding, and a portfolio system for students to share work publicly.

Kannu is a [[software as a service]], i.e. cloud-based and scalable, rather than installed on a local network. As a newer product, it adheres to most modern web standards and practices, making it responsive to both computers and mobile devices.

'''Kulturdenkmal''' is the official term to describe [[National Heritage Site]]s listed by law&lt;ref&gt;According to international law, the English term is [[Cultural property]], but can also be called ''Protected monument''.&lt;/ref&gt; in German-speaking areas of Europe, to protect and spread awareness of [[cultural heritage]].

==Austria==
In Austria, the [[Bundesdenkmalamt]] (BDA), the institution in charge of the National Heritage Sites, administers the list of Kulturdenkmal objects, which it formally refers to as [[Denkmalgeschütztes Objekt|Denkmalgeschützte Objekte]].

==Belgium==
The [[Institut du Patrimoine]] is the institution in charge of the National Heritage Sites of Wallonia, which includes the National Heritage Sites of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]. Various local websites with public information are maintained, and  various initiatives are undertaken to assist owners of protected properties and to increase public awareness, most notably the European Heritage Days, which are called "Tage des offenen Denkmals".

==Germany==
As cultural matters lie largely within the responsibility not of the national government, but of the 16 states ([[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]), the 16 respective heritage protection authorities (Landesdenkmalämter) survey and list official monuments.

==Switzerland==
{{seealso|Cultural heritage protection in Switzerland}}
The [[Kulturgüterschutz]] is the institution in charge of the National Heritage Sites of the German-speaking areas of Switzerland. They maintain the [[Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance|inventory of protected objects]] and also organize the European Heritage Days, which are called ''Europäischer Tag des Denkmals''.

The '''MPT8080 "Microtutor"''' is a [[microprocessor]] trainer based on the [[Intel 8080]] processor, developed by Limrose Electronics. It was designed in the mid-1970s to assist in the understanding of the then-new microprocessors.

Users of the MPT8080 enter [[assembly language]] programs via binary switches or a [[hexadecimal]] keypad. While the code executes, the user can observe what is happening on the address, data, and control signals of the microprocessor. The MPT8080 acts like a [[Computer architecture simulator|simulator]], in that code can be stepped through one [[Instruction set|instruction]]—or each cycle of each individual instruction—at a time to observe what is happening.

The MPT8080 has simple input and output, consisting of eight [[LED]]s and eight switches. The input port allows code to sense the state of external switches, whilst the output port can display information on one of its eight LEDs. The input and outputs port also have connectors, allowing them to be connected to external signals through accessory patch kits, allowing the MPT8080 to control and monitor other circuitry.

==History==
Initially, a [[Motorola 6800]]-based trainer was developed alongside the Intel 8080–based model, but due to technical and operational issues the 6800 trainer was abandoned.

As recently as 2012, the MPT8080 remained in academic use at [[King's College London]], as part of a course in practical physics.

=== MPT8080 Version 1 ===
The initial version of the MPT8080 was designed by Dr. Ravi Raizada, the chief executive officer of Limrose Electronics.  It was first marketed in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Details of version 1 of the microtutor are included in the book : Small Systems Computer Sourcebook, author: J C Boonham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version used eight binary switches and a load button for program entry.

=== MPT8080 Version 2 ===
The second version of the MPT8080, introduced around 1980,{{When|date=March 2011}} replaced the binary switch input with a 16-key hexadecimal keypad.  Although more than half of the trainer's circuitry was redesigned for this version, it remained compatible with the first version. A trace mode was added to allow single-cycle execution as well as machine cycles; this allowed the user to quickly step through code until reaching the portion of the program in which the user was interested. Latest UK price £495+vat (source: Limrose U.K.Price List 1st Sept 2010).

== Operating the MPT8080 ==
Programs are entered in the MPT8080 in data entry mode ("MMLE").  Each byte of the program is entered, either by toggling the binary switches and pressing the load button, or by entering the byte on the hexadecimal keypad.  The program can then be executed.

The program can control the eight output port lines, turning the associated LEDs on or off.

By selecting single-step and single-cycle mode and stepping through a program with the step button, the user can see exactly what happens during every [[instruction cycle]], observing the program counter, data bus and control signals on their corresponding LEDs.

By selecting single-instruction mode, rather than single-cycle mode, each press of the step button will execute a complete instruction, rather than a single cycle.  This is useful for quickly advancing to a specific address.

The input/output ports can be used to read external signals and drive [[output device]]s like motors and buzzers with little or no additional hardware.

The system is programmed directly in 8080 [[machine code]]:
&lt;pre&gt;
Address       Code           Instruction                     Comments
0000          DB 00          IN  0                           Read from switches
0002          D3 00          OUT 0                           write to LEDs
0004          C3 00 00       JMP 0                           return to start of code
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">'''Mary Swartz Rose''' (October 31, 1874&amp;nbsp;– February 1, 1941) was an American laboratory scientist and educator in the fields of nutrition and dietetics.

== Education ==
Rose graduated from high school in 1892, valedictorian of her class. She graduated from [[Denison University]] in 1901, in Liberal Arts. In 1906 she received a B.S. in Household Arts from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]]. She then went to [[Yale University]], where she received her PhD (studying under [[Lafayette Mendel]]) in Physiological Chemistry in 1909.&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jn" /&gt;

== Career ==
After her graduation from Yale, Rose began a career at Columbia University Teachers College that lasted the rest of her life. Rose and Henry Sherman created the nation's first program in nutrition there.&lt;ref name="contento" /&gt; From 1910 to 1923 she was named Professor of Household Arts. From 1923 onward, she was Professor of Nutrition. Rose was famous both as an educator and as a laboratory scientist, as the titles of her works show. She was a prolific author, and wrote both scientific and technical works and pamphlets designed to educate ordinary citizens in the consequences of scientific advances on food selection, preparation, and nutritional planning. Rose worked associated with Herbert Hoover during the years of World War I, produced scientific recipes and balanced menus for the military, and played a part in the development of Army rations.&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Rose was a founder of and the fifth President and first woman President of the American Institute of Nutrition;&lt;ref name="contento" /&gt; on the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the AMA; and on the Nutrition Commission of the health organization of the League of Nations.&lt;ref name="contento" /&gt; The Greater New York Dietetic Association named an annual lectureship in her honor. The [[American Dietetic Association]] named a fellowship in her honor.&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt; The [[American Society for Nutrition]] and the Council for Responsible Nutrition present two awards in her name for research on safety and efficacy of bioactive compounds for human health. Columbia University Teachers College named a professorship in her honor.

== Family ==
Rose was born in Newark, Ohio, the first of five children of Hiram Schwartz and Martha Jane Davies. In 1910 she married Anton Rose, another chemist she had met at Yale. Anton Rose subsequently received his PhD in Chemistry at Columbia University and ultimately worked for the Prudential insurance company. They had one son in 1915. Rose died of cancer and was buried in Granville, Ohio. One of Rose's hobbies was to make crossword puzzles based on amino acids.&lt;ref name="reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jn" /&gt;

The '''Ministry of Education''' ('''MOE''') of the [[Government of China|People's Republic of China]] is the agency of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] that regulates all aspects of the educational system in [[mainland China]], including compulsory basic education, vocational education, and tertiary education.  The MOE certifies teachers, standardizes [[curriculum]] and [[textbook]]s, establishes standards, and monitors the entire education system in an effort to "modernize China through education". It is headquartered in [[Xidan]], [[Xicheng District]], Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_2792/index.html English home page]. [[Ministry of Education (China)]]. Retrieved on December 29, 2015. "Address: No.37 Damucang Hutong, Xidan, Beijing, P.R.C " - [http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/s3635/201005/87303.html Chinese address]: "地址：北京市西单大木仓胡同37号 邮编：100816"&lt;/ref&gt; The MOE stresses [[technical education]] over other subjects.

The MOE was established in 1949 as the '''Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government,''' and was renamed the '''State Education Commission of the People's Republic of China''' from 1985 to 1998.  Its current title was assigned during the restructuring of the State Council in 1998.

'''New York State United Teachers''' ('''NYSUT''') is a 600,000-member [[New York (state)|New York]] state teachers union, affiliated since 2006 with the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), the [[AFL-CIO]], and the [[National Education Association]] (NEA). NYSUT is an umbrella group which provides services to local affiliates in New York state; lobbies on the local, state and federal level; conducts research; and organizes new members.

NYSUT's membership is diverse, representing all five membership categories of the AFT:  preK through 12th grade teachers and paraprofessionals in the public and private sector; higher education faculty and paraprofessionals; public employees; private sector libraries; and nurses and other healthcare workers in the public and private sector.

There are more than 900 local affiliates of NYSUT, which range in size from locals of fewer than 10 members to the 140,000-member [[United Federation of Teachers]] (UFT) in [[New York City]].

Officers of NYSUT are elected annually by a Representative Assembly (RA). The RA also elects a board of directors, which determines policy between conventions.

According to NYSUT's Department of Labor records, about 33%, or a third, of the union's total membership are considered retirees, with eligibility to vote in the union. Other, voting ineligible, classifications include "special constituency" (2%) and "at-large" (1%). NYSUT contracts also cover some non-members, known as [[agency fee]] payers, which number comparatively about 4% of the size of the union's membership. This accounts for 203,427 "retiree," 12,663 "special constituency," and 7,731 "at-large" members, plus 23,365 non-members paying agency fees, compared to 388,476 "in-service" members.&lt;ref name="OLMS_LM-2_2014-11-25"/&gt;

==History==
In 1960, New York City social studies teacher [[Albert Shanker]] and [[Teachers Guild]] president [[Charles Cogen]] led New York City teachers out on strike. At the time, there were more than 106 teacher unions in the New York City public schools, many existing solely on paper, while others, like the Brooklyn Teachers Association, were real unions.

The motives behind the strike were wages, establishment of a grievance process, reduced workloads and more funding for public education. However to win on these issues, Shanker and Cogen argued, the city's teachers had to be in one union. In early 1960 the Teachers Guild merged with a splinter group from the more militant [[High School Teachers Association]] to form the [[United Federation of Teachers]] (UFT).

The UFT struck on November 7, 1960. More than 5,600 teachers walked the picket line, while another 2,000 engaged in a sick-out. It was a fraction of the city's 45,000 teachers. However, intervention by national, state and local AFL-CIO leaders pressured New York City mayor [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.|Robert Wagner]] to appoint a pro-labor fact-finding committee to investigate conditions in the city's schools and recommend a solution to the labor problem.

The fact-finding committee recommended a collective bargaining law, which eventually was forced onto the city's Board of Education by the state of New York. Despite a battle royale with the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), an infusion of cash by the AFT and the AFL-CIO enabled the UFT to win the December 16, 1961, election with 61.8 percent of the votes.

In 1967, the New York state legislature passed the [[Taylor Law]], which provided collective bargaining rights to public employees. Both the NEA and AFT began rapidly organizing new members.

The NEA's state operation, the [[New York State Teachers Association]] (NYSTA), had been dominated by administrators until 1965, when they were excluded from membership.

The AFT's state affiliate, the [[Empire State Federation of Teachers]], was very small. Shanker urged changes on the AFT state affiliate. The organization was renamed the [[New York State Federation of Teachers]] in the 1960s and the [[United Teachers of New York]] (UTNY) in 1971. That same year, Shanker was elected president of UTNY.

In 1971, the New York State legislature, under "messages of necessity" from Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], enacted five "anti-teacher" laws. One extended the probationary period for new teachers from three to five years.

Shortly after, the executive director and other staff members of NYSTA began to meet with Shanker and his aides to discuss the possibility of a merger. Each union had spent large amounts of money battling the other for bargaining rights and members while the state legislature and local school districts steadily chipped away at union rights and collective bargaining agreements.

In 1971, Shanker and newly elected NYSTA president [[Thomas Hobart]] entered into formal merger negotiations. The merger agreement was signed March 30, 1972. Hobart was elected president and Shanker executive vice president. Other offices included Dan Sanders, first vice president; [[Antonia Cortese]], second vice president; and Ed Rodgers, secretary-treasurer.

NYSUT and UTNY had sought and won approval for the merger from both parent unions, but tensions with the NEA quickly became apparent. Hobart and Shanker began promoting a merger between the NEA and AFT at NEA meetings, an effort that met with a hostile response. NEA leadership began to isolate NYSUT officers and delegates at conventions and other meetings. The NEA staff, working through the UniServ system (which provides services to NEA local unions), began to actively turn other state and local NEA members against the merged union.

In 1976, the NEA undertook an 'image enhancement' campaign in New York state. NYSUT officials saw this as a propaganda effort designed to undermine the merged union.

At the NYSUT convention in New York City that same year, delegates argued over the merits of the disaffiliation resolution. Shanker then delivered a powerhouse speech that galvanized the delegates. The delegates responded by passing a resolution that disaffiliated NYSUT from NEA.

Shanker and Hobart had, however, ignored a key provision in the merger agreement approved by both NEA and AFT. It stated that disaffiliation from either national group, within a five-year period of the 1972 merger, would obligate NYSUT to pay "liquidated damages" to the national organization from which NYSUT disaffiliated. NYSUT was ultimately required to pay NEA a multi-million dollar settlement.

NEA responded to the disaffiliation move by setting up a rival state organization, the [[New York Education Association]] (NYEA). The NEA believed that many NYSUT locals, with at least 50,000 members, would leave the organization. While many locals disaffiliated from the NYSUT, a few soon rejoined. Over the next quarter-century, NYEA's membership stagnated, while NYSUT's exploded thanks to its leaders' decision to recruit members outside the field of education.

NYSUT's membership had, in fact, been diversified from the outset. The union welcomed paraprofessionals and other school-related personnel—including bus drivers, custodians, cafeteria workers, and others. It also affiliated several independent unions of higher education faculty. In 1979, the union began organizing registered nurses and other health care professionals in both public and private sector hospitals and clinics.

Shanker was elected president of the national AFT in 1974 but continued to hold his position in NYSUT until 1984. Shanker was elected to the executive council of the AFL-CIO in 1974 as well. His election represented the first time the AFT had a seat on the council. When, however, he voted against enhanced education funding in favor of Cold War measures (like the B-1 bomber), Shanker insisted that he was elected by all the members of the AFL-CIO convention and obliged, therefore, to vote against teachers when approval of defense appropriations was at issue.

Shanker died in 1997. Hobart retired as president of NYSUT in April 2005. He was succeeded by [[Richard Ianuzzi]], NYSUT second vice president and a member of NYSUT's board of directors. In April 2014, Karen Magee was elected NYSUT president.

==Political activity==
Politically, 1973 was a pivotal year for NYSUT. The union adopted UTNY's Committee of 100 program, a group of many more than 100 members who agreed to lobby the state legislature in person twice each year. In 1967 NYSUT had created its own political action committee, VOTE-COPE, which was also melded into NYSUT. In 2005, the Committee of 100 counted several thousand members and VOTE-COPE raised more than $3 million in voluntary contributions.

Over the years, NYSUT's political activism has led it to be characterized as 'the 800-pound gorilla of New York politics.' Some of the union's accomplishments include:
* In 1975, passage of a law guaranteeing tenure transfer rights and a maximum two-year probation period for teachers who switched districts;
* In 1976, a legislative override of a veto of a bill requiring a formula for average funding of New York City public schools (it was the first override of a governor's veto in 104 years);
* In 1977, a law providing for significantly enhanced enforcement powers for the state Public Employment Relations Board; and
* In 1978, repeal of the Taylor Law's mandatory penalty of one year's probation for any public employee who went on strike.

NYSUT continued to expand collective bargaining rights for teachers as well. In 1981, the union won passage of a law granting collective bargaining rights for substitute teachers. In 1982, the state legislature passed the [[Triborough Amendment]] to the Taylor Law. Many school districts ceased to honor clauses they disliked in expired teacher union contracts, which led many locals to strike. The Triborough Amendment required school districts to honor the entire contract until a new agreement was reached, and the number of strikes fell drastically.

Professional development also became a concern. In 1984, NYSUT successfully pushed for passage of a state law creating and funding centers where teachers could obtain continuing education. In 1986, the union won passage of a bill creating mandatory mentor-intern programs in schools, so that established teachers would be able to mentor student-teachers during their internships in the public schools.

Retirement issues also came to the fore. NYSUT established a retiree division in 1976. In 1985, the state legislature passed a bill providing for full retirement benefits for any teacher aged 55 who had taught for at least 30 years. A year later, the union won passage of a bill giving school paraprofessionals a full year's retirement credit (12 months) for working a full 10-month school year.

For the 2012 [[New York's 18th congressional district]] the NYSUT endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Sean Patrick Maloney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2012/06/democrat-sean-patrick-maloney-racks-up-nods-from-nys-afl-cio-and-nysut-in-ny-1 |title=Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney Racks Up Nods From NYS AFL-CIO And NYSUT In NY-18 Bid |publisher="NY Daily News |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 merger with NEA==
On May 5, 2006, NYSUT voted to merge with the NEA/NY, the renamed NYEA. The 35,000-member NYEA had approved the merger agreement on April 29, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nysut.org/cps/rde/xchg/nysut/hs.xsl/mediareleases_06mediarelations_15.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The merger became effective on September 1, 2006, and the newly merged union is now jointly affiliated with both the NEA and AFT.

The AFT has long sought merger with the NEA on a national level. But acrimonious relationships between the two unions on the local level and AFT's insistence on what NEA and its affiliates consider undemocratic practices and AFT's insistence upon affiliation with the AFL-CIO are significant obstacles. Among AFT's "undemocratic" practices are its abolition of the secret ballot, its requirement that delegates to its convention vote for officers by roll-call ballot, identifying their choices and their names in writing.

The two unions have continued to work together, however. After the failed merger attempt, the unions formed the 'NEAFT Partnership' to encourage joint policies on education, federal funding for public schools, and lobbying. The unions also agreed to support local- and state-level mergers where appropriate.

Three other states have merged AFT-NEA affiliates: [[Florida Education Association|Florida]], [[Education Minnesota|Minnesota]] and [[MEA-MFT|Montana]]. Among local mergers is that in Wichita, Kansas, long a battleground for the two national unions, and [[Los Angeles]]. Combined, the merged units represent 197,000 members. The NEA has 2.7 million members, the AFT 1.3 million.

With the NYSUT merger, 681,000 members of the AFT (or about 52 percent) now belong to NEA.

The '''''Portugaliae Monumenta Historica''''' (Historical Monuments of Portugal, abbreviated PMH) is a collection of &lt;!--[[Critical edition|critically edited]]--&gt; texts from [[Portuguese history]]. Inspired by the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', it was published by the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa]] between 1856 and 1917 and divided into four sections: ''Scriptores'' (writers), ''Leges et Consuetudines'' (laws and customs), ''Diplomata et Chartae'' (diplomas and charters) and ''Inquisitiones'' (investigations). The first three were compiled under the direction of [[Alexandre Herculano]] before 1873, and the last, ''Inquisitiones'', between 1888 and 1897, after his death. The documents date from the [[Middle Ages]] and are primarily in [[Middle Latin]] and [[Old Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;João Dionísio, "After the Lisbon Earthquake: Reassembling History", ''European Studies: A Journal of European Culture, History and Politics'' '''26'''.1 (2008): 151–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scholaster''', from the Latin ''scholasticus'' (schoolmaster), or '''magister scholarum''', was the head of an ecclesiastical school, typically a [[cathedral school]], [[monastic school]], or the school of a [[collegiate church]], in medieval and early-modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nissen and William den Boer, "The Middle Ages after 1200", in ''Handbook of Dutch Church History'', edited by Herman Selderhuis (Göttingen, 2014), pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the size of the school and the status of the institution to which it was attached, they might be the only teacher, the head of a considerable educational establishment, or have oversight over all the schools in their city or territory.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Helen Haggh, ''Music, Liturgy, and Ceremony in Brussels, 1350-1500'', vol. 1 (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1988) , pp. 149-153.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholaster might be a dignitary in a cathedral or collegiate [[chapter (religion)|chapter]], alongside the [[provost (religion)|provost]], [[dean (Christianity)|dean]], [[cantor (Christianity)|cantor]], [[succentor]], [[precentor]], [[archdeacon]], [[church treasure|treasurer]], [[cellarium|cellarer]], [[sacristan]] or [[almoner]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Walters Robertson, ''Guillaume de Machaut and Reims: Context and Meaning in His Musical Works'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 35, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not unknown for a scholaster to take the revenues of the post and deputise somebody else to carry out any teaching work involved.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nissen and William den Boer, "The Middle Ages after 1200", in ''Handbook of Dutch Church History'', edited by Herman Selderhuis (Göttingen, 2014), pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School-to-work transition'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-08-01|title=The school-to-work transition: A role identity perspective|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879107000395|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|language=en|volume=71|issue=1|pages=114–134|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2007.04.004|issn=0001-8791}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a phrase referring to [[on-the-job training]], [[apprenticeship]]s, [[cooperative education]] agreements or other programs designed to prepare students to enter the job market. This education system is primarily employed in the United States, partially as a response to work training as it is done in Asia.

School to Work is a system to introduce the philosophy of school-based, work-based, and connecting activities as early as kindergarten to expose students to potential future careers. School to Work emphasizes [[lifelong learning]].

School to Work is funded and sponsored at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/pubs/SER/SchoolWork/study3.html|title=Study of School-To-Work Initiatives|website=www2.ed.gov|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the state level in states like Arizona, the grant is administered by the Arizona Department of Commerce, School to Work Division. This grant was funded for a maximum of five years with decreasing funds years three through five; 

An example of county level involvement is the [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] School to Work Consortia in [[Arizona]].  It is composed of more than fifty Cochise County public and private schools, kindergarten through four-year university level, local and community-based organizations, and more than one hundred supporting business partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.willcoxrangenews.com/news/article_fa545286-09f2-5ae0-8679-465bb4458cb9.html|title=WUSD, Cochise County ahead on the learning curve|last=News|first=Ainslee S. Wittig/Arizona Range|work=Arizona Range News|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

STW is part of a comprehensive education reform movement which includes formulating new standards which emphasize higher order thinking skills, new standards based assessments, and graduation exams, such as the [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]] which insure that students are ready for job training or college prep by age 16&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may95/vol52/num08/The-Certificate-of-Initial-Mastery.aspx|title=The Certificate of Initial Mastery - Educational Leadership|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Reformers believe that it is important and egalitarian that all students graduate ready for jobs and ready for college, rather than tracking students one way or the other.

== Critics ==

"Back to basics" traditionalists observe that in Europe, apprenticeships typically mean that the worker essentially ends their formal education after age 16, and works full-time at reduced pay in exchange for learning "job skills" such as assembling automobiles. Some believe that it was better to have students who were not bound for college concentrate on career schools, while academic students should spend class time learning core academic subjects such as history or science rather than job-shadowing at a hospital or auto dealer. A student in North Dakota would have little opportunity to learn to be an auto designer, while one in Alabama would have little opportunity to do job shadowing at a major software company if job training were allocated according to local human resource needs, as many programs are structured. Local businesses also need to structure their operations to accommodate student workers, and transportation since typically schools are situated close to homes, and not businesses which are typically a car or transit commute away from homes.

The Michigan STW Initiative states "students work without pay for two to three hours each day" and "students are able to perform what might otherwise be hazardous order work." which would contradict child labor laws. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.eagleforum.org/educate/1997/july97/mi_model.html Michigan Model of School to Work]&lt;/ref&gt;  Data would be shared with state STW partnership network and local labor market areas which might be an invasion of privacy. The state would utilize the national industry-recognized skill certificates when developed, which would be the [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]]. Critics call this a government-controlled passport to work. Michigan Rep. Harold J. Voorhees expressed concern that, with full implementation, a child would not be employed without this Certificate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://americanpolicy.org/1999/03/29/school-to-work/|title=School-to-Work - American Policy Center|date=1999-03-29|work=American Policy Center|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the 2018 [[Education Review Office (New Zealand)|Education Review Office]] report the school had 179 pupils out of which 18 were international. Out of those, 58% were female and 42% were male. The racial markup was 79% [[Pākehā]], 4% [[Māori people|Māori]], 12% [[Asian New Zealanders|Asian]], 3% Pacific and 2% of other races.&lt;ref name=ero&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ero.govt.nz/review-reports/titirangi-rudolf-steiner-school-04-05-2018/|title=Titirangi Rudolf Steiner School|publisher=[[Education Review Office (New Zealand)|Education Review Office]]|date=4 May 2018|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERO also found that the school meets the registration as a [[private school]] criteria.&lt;ref name=ero/&gt;

'''The Valuev Circular''' ({{lang-ru|Валуевский циркуляр, Valuyevskiy tsirkulyar}}; {{lang-uk|Валуєвський циркуляр, Valuievs'kyi tsyrkuliar}}) of 18 July 1863 was a secret [[decree]] ([[Ukase|ukaz]]) of the [[List of Ministers of Interior of Imperial Russia|Minister of Internal Affairs]] of the [[Russian Empire]] [[Pyotr Valuev]] (Valuyev) by which a large portion of the publications (religious, and literature used for school training) in the [[Ukrainian language]] was forbidden.

The Circular has put the reason for the growing number of textbooks in Ukrainian, and beginner-level books in Ukrainian with "the Poles' political interests" and the "separatist intentions of some of the Little Russians". The Circular also stated that "a separate [[Little Russian]] language never existed, doesn't exist, and couldn't exist", and that the commoners' tongue in Little Russia is nothing but Russian corrupted by [[Polish language|Polish]] influence.

The Circular ordered the Censorship Committees to ban the publication of religious texts, educational texts, and beginner-level books in Ukrainian, but permitted publication of ''[[belles-lettres]]'' works in that language.

Further restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian language by the [[Ems Ukaz]] in 1876, which completely prohibited the usage of the language in open print.

The '''World Federation of Teachers Unions''' known by its French initials FISE (Federation Internationale Syndicale de L'Enseignement) is an international trade union of educators affiliated with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

== History ==

The FISE was founded in Paris in July 1946 as a merger of the [[International Professional Secretariat of Education]] and ''[[l’Internationale des Travailleurs de l’Enseignement]]'' (ITE), with the participation of the [[American Education Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/dudeman5685_yahoo_WFTU The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985. ]'' Prague; Published by the WTFU in cooperation with PRACE Czechoslovak Trade Unions 1985 p.152&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951 a group of unions split off and founded the [[International Federation of Free Teachers Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Percy Coldrick|Coldrick, A. Percy]] and [[Philip James Jones|Jones, Philip]]. ''The international directory of the trade union movement'' New York : Facts on File, [1978] p.198&lt;/ref&gt;

 During the 1980s it cooperated with the [[International Federation of Teachers Unions]] (then affiliated with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]]), the [[World Federation of Educators]] (affiliated with the [[World Confederation of Labour]]) and the [[World Federation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession]].&lt;ref&gt;''The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985'' p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

FISE is [[Consultative Status|an organization with consultative status]] with [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100045205 UNESCO profile]&lt;/ref&gt; It has had its position within UNESCO since at least 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985'' p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

== Action ==

FISE takes actively part in the Worker’s Group of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), as well as in conferences of all of the above international organisations.
During the previous period it actively participated in most activities of the WFTU and took initiatives which strengthened the renown and the strength of the organisation.
In 2013 it organized an international conference in Brussels on “the role of teachers today, today’s school, public education, democracy in education” and  published a book with the proceedings.
It held meetings with trade unionists teachers from different countries and unions: Cuba, Germany, Egypt, Palestine, Greece, Italy, Mexico, etc.
FISE publishes every year announcements and posters useful for every trade union, concerning the International Workers’ May Day (May 1), the International Teachers Day, the International Women's Day (March 8), the Day of the Anti-fascist Victory of Peoples (May 9), the day against violence towards women, against child labour, for the refugees, the xenophobia and racism, and other relevant topics or subjects of commemoration. 
It particularly focuses on the expression of concrete solidarity.
It denounced the killings and police attacks against the Mexican teachers. 
One of the most important actions that FISE undertook in Greece was the solidarity campaign for the children of Palestine, entitled "a notebook for GAZA".  Many students, parents, parents' associations, cultural associations, women's associations,  responded to the invitation of FISE and gathered materials. They organized theatrical performances in which the ticket was two notebooks or other school supplies. Discussions have been held by teachers to students on the situation in Palestine. Painting exhibitions on the Palestinian matter were organised, as well as other initiatives, too.

== Organization ==

The organizations highest organ is the Statutory Conference, formerly called the World Conference of Teachers. Originally annual events, they were held at irregular intervals in the 1950s and now are constitutionally mandated to be held every four years.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts about international Communist front organisations'' pp. 57-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wftufise.org/constitution/ Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; Between meetings of this conference the organization is headed by an Administrative Committee which meets at least once a year.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts about international Communist front organisations'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wftufise.org/constitution/ Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; Day to operations are directed by a Bureau which consists of the General Secretary, President, Vice-President and Secretariat, who are ex-officio members of the Administrative Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wftufise.org/constitution/ Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the headquarters immediately after the expulsion from Vienna is unclear, though FISEs' journal ''Teachers of the World'' was published from 10 [[Rue de Solférino]], Paris [[7ème arrondissement, Paris|7ème]].&lt;ref&gt;''Facts about international Communist front organisations'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 its headquarters is reported at [[Wilhelm Wolff Strasse]] 21, [[East Berlin]] 111.&lt;ref&gt;Coldrick and Jones p.199&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the same address in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985'' p.152&lt;/ref&gt; Its current headquarters is at 6/6 Kalicharan Ghosh Road, 700 050, [[Kolkata]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100045205 UNESCO profile]&lt;/ref&gt; After the 18th Congress of FISE is currently located in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Fraccionamiento Riviera 1, código postal 58195, Colonia Ana María Gallaga, calle circuito Insurgentes núm. 199 Ciudad de Morelia, Michoacán de Ocampo, México, Estados Unidos Mexicanos.
