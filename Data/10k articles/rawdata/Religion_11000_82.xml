'''''Against the [[Galilean faith|Galileans]]''''' ({{lang-grc|Κατὰ Γαλιλαίων}}; {{lang-la|Contra Galilaeos}}), meaning [[Christian]]s, was a Greek [[polemic]]al essay written by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], commonly known as Julian the Apostate, during his short reign (361–363). Despite having been originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]], it is better known under its Latin name, probably due to its extensive reference in the polemical response ''Contra Julianum'' by [[Cyril of Alexandria]].

As emperor, Julian had tried to stop the growing influence of [[Christianity]] in the [[Roman Empire]], and had encouraged support for the original [[pagan]] imperial [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] and ethnic religions of the Empire. In this essay Julian's described what he considered to be the mistakes and dangers of the Christian faith, and he attempted to throw an unflattering light on ongoing disputes inside the Christian Church. Julian portrayed Christians as [[apostate]]s from [[Judaism]], which the Emperor considered to be a very old and established religion that should be fully accepted. After Julian's death in battle in 363, the essay was [[anathema]]tized, and even the text was lost.  We only know of Julian's arguments second-hand, through texts written by Christian authors who sought to [[refute]] Julian.

==Introduction==
Julian was the last pagan emperor to rule the Roman Empire. As he was a nephew of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], he had been brought up as a Christian, though he studied with Neoplatonists while growing up, and secretly abandoned Christianity in 351.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1995|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he became the Roman Emperor, he tried to end the persecution of pagans that had ongoing over the previous decades, legalizing cult sacrifice, restoring many pagan temples, and financing cults. Though he did not persecute Christians or forbid Christianity, he ended subsidies to the Christian church and ended the punishments that had been given to heretical Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1995|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also composed treatises that attacked those whose ideas he disagreed with, including two on those he called “false Cynics” and Against the Galileaens,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1995|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written during his stay in Antioch in the winter of 362–363.&lt;ref name="smith190"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1995|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of Against the Galileaens does not survive, probably being destroyed in an anti-pagan edict in 448 or 529.&lt;ref name="smith190"/&gt; What we know of it comes from the writings of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who quoted it at length while writing a refutation that was finished either between 434–437 or 439–441. Cyril's refutation, however, does not survive fully intact. Only ten books still exist, all of which cover the first book out of three of Against the Galileaens, though multiple fragments of another ten books also survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|2000|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyril claimed that it was one of the most important anti-Christian works that had been written, and that it was widely considered to be irrefutable, while [[Libanius]] praised it as an even greater work than the critiques of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry of Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1995|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many Christian authors had written texts in which they scorned Julian, only [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] had previously attempted a refutation of the work before Cyril.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|2000|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the obvious divide of one being a Christian and one a pagan, Cyril's religious views were very different from Julian's. Whereas Julian had supported the Jewish community in the Roman Empire and sought to rebuild their temple, Cyril often wrote of how the Jewish community stood in the way of Christianity, and that Gentiles ought to reject all things Jewish, including the idea of rebuilding the [[Second Temple|Temple]] in Jerusalem, an idea which Julian had embraced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cyril of Alexandria|title=The Sages and Scripture|work=Cyril of Alexandria|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was this fundamental disagreement over the value of the Jewish faith that made Cyril's refutation so bitter, as it speaks of Julian as a satanically inspired man who desired to drag as many others as he could away from the Christian faith, and the Greek tradition that Julian came from as folly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|2000|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, according to Cyril, any truth that was in the Greek texts was there as a result of the Greeks having heard of the wisdom of Moses — even Plato supposedly was a great admirer of the Jewish lawgiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|2000|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; His refutation was thus an attempt to prove that Julian's view of the Platonic tradition as superior to the Mosaic religious tradition was, in fact, the reverse of the truth, as it was the Greeks whose words were a shadow of the truth of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|2000|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis of Against the Galileans==
===How Men Came to Believe in the Divine===

Julian first criticizes the practice of the Galileans of denying the existence of the gods, and their practice, taken from the Greeks, of being lazy and superstitious (43A–52C). Julian claims that men inherently know of the existence of God without being taught of it and that all men have an inherent belief that the gods reside in the heavens and observe what occurs in the world. Further, all men, from looking at the stable nature of the heavenly bodies, have come to believe that the gods are eternal and unchanging (43A–52C).

===What the Greeks and Hebrews Say About the Divine===
Julian goes on to discuss the creation myths of the Greeks and the Jews, citing the account of the Book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. He ridicules the idea of literally interpreting the Jewish account, claiming that it is not only logically impossible (75B) – he asks how the serpent was able to speak a human language (86A) – but that is also blasphemous and insulting to God (89B). A true God, he says, would not have withheld the knowledge of good and evil from men or have been jealous of men eating from the tree of life and living forever. Indeed, this behavior shows God to be evil and the serpent, giving man the enormously valuable gift of differentiating good and evil, to be good. Therefore, it must have a deeper meaning (94A).

Julian also brings up questions from the account of how God created the world. Where, he asks, did the abyss, the darkness, and the waters come from that are mentioned (49C)? Where did angels come from, since they are not mentioned in the creation account? To Julian, the account of Genesis is not about a creator God, but about an inferior god who merely shaped the matter that had already been created (49E). He compares this to Plato's account of the creation in [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], in which inferior gods shape the matter created by the creator God (58C), and concludes that the Genesis account cannot adequately explain who created the matter that the God of Moses shaped (49E). Julian goes on to argue that there must be more than one god who shaped matter (66A), as if there was only one God, all created beings would be identical. The fact that there is such a difference between immortal beings, humans, and animals, proves that different gods shaped different beings (65D). The God of Moses, being a god who chose the Jews as his people and gave them alone the gift of prophecy and his teachings, is merely the god of the Jewish people, not the god of any other race of men (106D). Julian finds it absurd to believe that the God who created everything in the world, who describes himself as being a jealous God (106D–E), was content to confine himself to caring for a small tribe in Palestine while letting all races besides the Jews worship false gods for thousands of years (106D).

Julian then discusses how the Greeks view the gods as being the delegates of the creator God, each responsible for caring for different nations, cities, and races of men (115D), which explains why the character and customs of men are so different (131C). He mocks the idea that a literal interpretation of the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] can adequately explain why men differ so greatly, saying that it does not explain why men have different morals or laws or why they have such marked physical differences (138A). Instead, he believes, different gods responsible for different races and nations are responsible for mankind’s differences (143A). The God of Moses does exist, but only as an inferior to the God of All (148B). Julian expounds on this idea, asking why, if the Jewish God is the only god, the Jews have not accomplished as much as other races, such as the Greeks, [[Phoenicia|Phoenicians]] or Egyptians (178A), and why the Jews have been subjugated by so many other races (213A).

===Why Have the Galileans Abandoned Jewish Beliefs?===
Julian spends time discussing how, even after having nominally embraced Jewish traditions, Galileans have really rejected them and only accepted their blasphemy of the gods (238A–B). He criticizes the belief that Jesus is the prophet that was predicted by Moses and [[Isaiah]], as Jesus, supposedly being the son of God, was not descended from Judah, and says that the idea of a god who claims to be the sole God creating a being equal to him (and thus a second God) goes against the monotheistic beliefs of Judaism (253A–B). He points out that Galileans have abandoned many of the central tenets of Judaism, such as the sacrificing of animals (305D) and its dietary restrictions (314C), and criticizes the claim that God has set up a new law for them while Moses so adamantly warned against changing the law (320B).

Along with abandoning Jewish teachings, Julian also charges the Galileans with abandoning those of the original apostles (327A). He claims that no apostle claimed that Jesus was God until [[John the Apostle|John]], and he probably only did so to clarify an important dispute within a disunited church (327A). Galileans also disobey the words of Jesus, as they revere tombs and the dead, while Jesus referred to gravesites as places of impurity (335B). Julian then brings up other Jewish practices abandoned by Galileans such as circumcision and the celebration of Passover, wondering why they have abandoned such practices when they were assigned such importance in the Jewish law (351A), going so far as to claim that the religious practices of Moses and Abraham are far closer to the religious practices of the Greeks than those of the Galileans (356C).

'''''Kitāb al–Milal wa al-Nihal''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:كتاب الملل والنحل, ''The Book of Sects and Creeds''), written by the [[Islamic scholar]] [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] (d. 1153 [[Common Era|CE]]), is a non-polemical study of religious communities and philosophies that had existed up to his time, considered to be the first systematic [[religious studies|study of religion]]. It was written around 1127-1128 and divides religions between sects, which have written doctrines, and creeds which do not.

A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by [[UNESCO]] (''Livre des religions et des sects.'' Leuven, Peeters: vol. I, 1986, Vol. II, 1993).

'''Aphrodite'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Aphrodite.ogg|æ|f|r|ə|ˈ|d|aɪ|t|i}} {{respell|af-rə|DY|tee}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀφροδίτη}} ''Aphrodítē''}} is an [[ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek goddess]] associated with [[love]], [[beauty]], [[pleasure]], and [[procreation]]. She is identified with the planet [[Venus]], which is named after the Roman goddess {{lang|la|[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]}}, [[Interpretatio graeca|with whom Aphrodite was extensively syncretized]]. Aphrodite's major symbols include [[Myrtle (plant)|myrtle]]s, [[rose]]s, [[dove]]s, [[sparrow]]s, and [[swan]]s.

The cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Phoenician goddess]] [[Astarte]], a [[cognate]] of the [[East Semitic]] goddess [[Ishtar]], whose cult was based on the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian cult]] of [[Inanna]]. Aphrodite's main cult centers were [[Kythira|Cythera]], [[Cyprus]], [[Corinth]], and [[Athens]]. Her main festival was the [[Aphrodisia]], which was celebrated annually in midsummer. In [[Laconia]], Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess. She was also the patron goddess of [[Prostitution in ancient Greece|prostitutes]], an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of "[[sacred prostitution]]", an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous.

In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Aphrodite is born off the coast of Cythera from the foam (''aphros'') produced by [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'s genitals, which his son [[Cronus]] has [[castration|severed]] and thrown into the sea. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', however, she is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]]. [[Plato]], in his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 180e, asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities: [[Aphrodite Urania|Aphrodite Ourania]] (a transcendent, "Heavenly" Aphrodite) and [[Aphrodite Pandemos]] (Aphrodite common to "all the people"). Aphrodite had many other [[epithet]]s, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess, or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as '''Cytherea''' (''Lady of Cythera'') and '''Cypris''' (''Lady of Cyprus''), due to the fact that both locations claimed to be the place of her birth.

In [[Greek mythology]], Aphrodite was married to [[Hephaestus]], the god of blacksmiths and metalworking. Despite this, Aphrodite was frequently [[adultery|unfaithful]] to him and had many lovers; in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is caught in the act of adultery with [[Ares]], the god of war. In the ''[[Homeric Hymns|First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite]]'', she seduces the mortal shepherd [[Anchises]]. Aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd [[Adonis]], who was killed by a [[wild boar]]. Along with [[Athena]] and [[Hera]], Aphrodite was one of the three goddesses [[Judgement of Paris|whose feud]] resulted in the beginning of the [[Trojan War]] and she plays a major role throughout the ''[[Iliad]]''. Aphrodite has been featured in [[Art of Europe|western art]] as a symbol of [[Physical attractiveness#Female physical attractiveness|female beauty]] and has appeared in numerous works of [[western literature]]. She is a major deity in modern [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan religions]], including the [[Church of Aphrodite]], [[Wicca]], and [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenismos]].

== Etymology ==
[[Hesiod]] derives ''Aphrodite'' from ''aphrós'' (ἀφρός) "sea-foam",{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} interpreting the name as "risen from the foam",&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+173 190-197].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious [[folk etymology]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}}{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134–138}} Early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that Aphrodite's name was of Greek or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin,{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134–138}} but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned.{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134–138}} Aphrodite's name is generally accepted to be of non-Greek, probably [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], origin,{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134–138}} but its exact derivation cannot be determined.{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134–138}}

Scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, accepting Hesiod's "foam" etymology as genuine, analyzed the second part of Aphrodite's name as *''-odítē'' "wanderer"&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kretschmer]], "Zum pamphylischen Dialekt", ''[[Historische Sprachforschung|Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiet der Indogermanischen Sprachen]]'' 33 (1895): 267.&lt;/ref&gt; or *''-dítē'' "bright".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Maaß, "Aphrodite und die hl. Pelagia", ''Neue Jahrbücher für das klassische Altertum'' 27 (1911): 457-468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vittore Pisani, "Akmon e Dieus", ''Archivio glottologico italiano'' 24 (1930): 65-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Janda, also accepting Hesiod's etymology, has argued in favor of the latter of these interpretations and claims the story of a birth from the foam as an [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] [[mytheme]].{{sfn|Janda|2005|pages=349–360}}{{sfn|Janda|2010|page=65}} Likewise, Witczak proposes an Indo-European compound ''{{PIE|*abʰor-}}'' "very" and ''{{PIE|*dʰei-}}'' "to shine", also referring to Eos.{{sfn|Witczak|1993|pages=115–123}} Other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since Aphrodite's attributes are entirely different from those of both Eos and the [[Vedic deity]] [[Ushas]].{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=164}}{{sfn|Boedeker|1974|pages=15–16}}

A number of improbable non-Greek etymologies have also been suggested. One Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian ''barīrītu'', the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Assyrian Dictionary'', vol. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; Hammarström&lt;ref&gt;M. Hammarström, "Griechisch-etruskische Wortgleichungen", ''Glotta: Zeitschrift für griechische und lateinische Sprache'' 11 (1921): 215-6.&lt;/ref&gt; looks to [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], comparing ''(e)prϑni'' "lord", an Etruscan honorific loaned into Greek as [[Prytaneis|πρύτανις]].{{sfn|Frisk|1960|page=196 f.}}{{sfn|Beekes|2010|page=179}}{{sfn|West|2000|page=134}} This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, "the lady".{{sfn|Frisk|1960|page=196 f.}}{{sfn|Beekes|2010|page=179}} Most scholars reject this etymology as implausible,{{sfn|Frisk|1960|page=196 f.}}{{sfn|Beekes|2010|page=179}}{{sfn|West|2000|page=134}} especially since Aphrodite actually appears in Etruscan in the borrowed form ''Apru'' (from Greek ''Aphrō'', clipped form of ''Aphrodite'').{{sfn|Beekes|2010|page=179}} The medieval ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' (c. 1150) offers a highly contrived etymology, deriving ''Aphrodite'' from the compound ''habrodíaitos'' ({{lang|grc|ἁβροδίαιτος}}), "she who lives delicately", from ''habrós'' and ''díaita''. The alteration from ''b'' to ''ph'' is explained as a "familiar" characteristic of Greek "obvious from the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Macedonians]]".&lt;ref&gt;Etymologicum Magnum, Ἀφροδίτη.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult of Aphrodite in Greece was imported from, or at least influenced by, the cult of [[Astarte]] in [[Phoenicia]],{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|pages=8–12}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2012|pages=49–52}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=27}}{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|pages=43–59}} which, in turn, was influenced by the cult of the [[Mesopotamia]]n goddess known as "Ishtar" to the [[East Semitic]] peoples and as "[[Inanna]]" to the [[Sumer]]ians.{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=152–153}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=27}}{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|pages=43–59}} [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] states that the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], after the Assyrians, the [[Paphos|Paphians]] of Cyprus, and then the Phoenicians at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]. The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.14.7 I. XIV.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aphrodite took on Inanna-Ishtar's associations with sexuality and procreation.{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}} Furthermore, she was known as [[Aphrodite Urania|Ourania]] (Οὐρανία), which means "heavenly",{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|pages=10–11}} a title corresponding to Inanna's role as the [[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]].{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|pages=10–11}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=162}} Early artistic and literary portrayals of Aphrodite are extremely similar on Inanna-Ishtar.{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}} Like Inanna-Ishtar, Aphrodite was also a warrior goddess;{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2012|pages=49–52}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|page=163}} the second-century AD Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as ''[[Aphrodite Areia]]'', which means "warlike".{{sfn|Cyrino|2012|pages=51–52}}{{sfn|Budin|2010|pages=85–86, 96, 100, 102–103, 112, 123, 125}} He also mentions that Aphrodite's most ancient cult statues in [[Sparta]] and on Cythera showed her bearing arms.{{sfn|Cyrino|2012|pages=51–52}}{{sfn|Budin|2010|pages=85–86, 96, 100, 102–103, 112, 123, 125}}{{sfn|Graz|1984|page=250}}{{sfn|Breitenberger|2007|page=8}} Modern scholars note that Aphrodite's warrior-goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship{{sfn|Iossif|Lorber|2007|page=77}} and see it as an indication of her Near Eastern origins.{{sfn|Iossif|Lorber|2007|page=77}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=162–163}}

Nineteenth century classical scholars had a general aversion to the idea that ancient Greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the Near East,{{sfn|Konaris|2016|page=169}} but, even [[Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker]], who argued that Near Eastern influence on Greek culture was largely confined to material culture,{{sfn|Konaris|2016|page=169}} admitted that Aphrodite was clearly of Phoenician origin.{{sfn|Konaris|2016|page=169}} The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular,{{sfn|Burkert|1998|pages=1–6}} is now widely recognized as dating to a period of [[Orientalizing period|orientalization]] during the eighth century BC,{{sfn|Burkert|1998|pages=1–6}} when [[archaic Greece]] was on the fringes of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].{{sfn|Burkert|1998|pages=1–41}}

===Indo-European dawn goddess===
Some early [[comparative mythology|comparative mythologists]] opposed to the idea of a Near Eastern origin argued that Aphrodite originated as an aspect of the Greek dawn goddess [[Eos]]{{sfn|Dumézil|1934|page=}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} and that she was therefore ultimately derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] dawn goddess [[Hausos|*''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;éusōs'']] (properly Greek [[Eos]], Latin [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], Sanskrit [[Ushas]]).{{sfn|Dumézil|1934|page=}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} Most modern scholars have now rejected the notion of a purely Indo-European Aphrodite,{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134–138}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=162–164}}{{sfn|Boedeker|1974|pages=15–16}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=24–25}} but it is possible that Aphrodite, originally a Semitic deity, may have been influenced by the Indo-European dawn goddess.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=24–25}} Both Aphrodite and Eos were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} and both had relationships with mortal lovers.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} Both goddesses were associated with the colors red, white, and gold.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} Michael Janda etymologizes Aphrodite's name as an epithet of Eos meaning "she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]"{{sfn|Janda|2010|page=65}} and points to Hesiod's ''Theogony'' account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth.{{sfn|Janda|2010|page=65}} Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the [[Rig Veda|Rigvedic]] myth of [[Indra]] defeating [[Vrtra]], liberating [[Ushas]].{{sfn|Janda|2005|pages=349–360}}{{sfn|Janda|2010|page=65}} Another key similarity between Aphrodite and the Indo-European dawn goddess is her close kinship to the Greek sky deity,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=24–25}} since both of the main claimants to her paternity (Zeus and Uranus) are sky deities.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=25}}

{{see also|:Category:Epithets of Aphrodite}}

Aphrodite's most common cultic epithet was ''[[Aphrodite Urania|Ourania]]'', meaning "heavenly",{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=28}}{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}} but this epithet almost never occurs in literary texts, indicating a purely cultic significance.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=28–29}} Another common name for Aphrodite was ''[[Aphrodite Pandemos|Pandemos]]'' ("For All the Folk").{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=35}} In her role as Aphrodite Pandemos, Aphrodite was associated with ''[[Peitho|Peithō]]'' ({{lang|grc|Πείθω}}), meaning "persuasion",{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=35–38}} and could be prayed to for aid in seduction.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=35–38}} [[Plato]], in his [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']], argues that Ourania and Pandemos are, in fact, separate goddesses. He asserts that ''Aphrodite Ourania'' is the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, and the older of the two goddesses. According to the ''Symposium'', Aphrodite Ourania is the inspiration of [[Human male sexuality#Male homoeroticism|male homosexual desire]], specifically the [[Ephebic Oath|ephebic]] [[Eros (concept)|eros]]. ''Aphrodite Pandemos'', by contrast, is the younger of the two goddesses: the common Aphrodite, born from the union of Zeus and Dione, and the inspiration of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual desire]], the "lesser" of the two loves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 181a-d.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Hunter, ''Plato's Symposium'', Oxford University Press: 2004, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] and, later, their Christian interpreters, Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love; it was the subject of a [[chryselephantine sculpture]] by [[Phidias]] for [[Elis]], known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Periegesis'' vi.25.1; ''Aphrodite Pandemos'' was represented in the same temple riding on a goat, symbol of purely carnal rut: "The meaning of the tortoise and of the he-goat I leave to those who care to guess," Pausanias remarks. The image was taken up again after the Renaissance: see [http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FALc195 Andrea Alciato, ''Emblemata / Les emblemes'' (1584)].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Aphrodite's most common literary epithets is ''Philommeidḗs'' ({{lang|grc|φιλομμειδής}}),{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=39}} which means "smile-loving",{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=39}} but is sometimes mistranslated as "laughter-loving".{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=39}} This epithet occurs throughout both of the Homeric epics and the ''First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite''.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=39}} Hesiod references it once in his ''[[Theogony]]'' in the context of Aphrodite's birth,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=39–40}} but interprets it as "genital-loving" rather than "smile-loving".{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=39–40}} Monica Cyrino notes that the epithet may relate to the fact that, in many artistic depictions of Aphrodite, she is shown smiling.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=39–40}} Other common literary epithets are ''Cypris'' and ''Cythereia'',{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=27}} which derive from her associations with the islands of Cyprus and Cythera respectively.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=27}}

On Cyprus, Aphrodite was sometimes called ''Eleemon'' ("the merciful").{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}} In Athens, she was known as ''Aphrodite en kopois'' ("[[Aphrodite of the Gardens]]").{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}} At Cape Colias, a town along the Attic coast, she was venerated as ''Genetyllis'' "Mother".{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}} The Spartans worshipped her as ''Potnia'' "Mistress", ''Enoplios'' "Armed", ''Morpho'' "Shapely", ''Ambologera'' "She who Postpones Old Age".{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}} Across the Greek world, she was known under epithets such as ''Melainis'' "Black One", ''Skotia'' "Dark One", ''Androphonos'' "Killer of Men", ''Anosia'' "Unholy", and ''Tymborychos'' "Gravedigger",{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=81}} all of which indicate her darker, more violent nature.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=81}}

A male version of Aphrodite known as [[Aphroditus]] was worshipped in the city of [[Amathus]] on Cyprus.{{sfn|Bullough|Bullough|1993|page=29}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=381}}{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=81}} Aphroditus was depicted with the [[Female body shape|figure]] and [[Cross-dressing|dress]] of a woman,{{sfn|Bullough|Bullough|1993|page=29}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=381}} but had a [[beard]],{{sfn|Bullough|Bullough|1993|page=29}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=381}} and was shown lifting his dress to reveal an erect [[phallus]].{{sfn|Bullough|Bullough|1993|page=29}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=381}} This gesture was believed to be an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic symbol]],{{sfn|Koloski-Ostrow|Lyons|2000|pages=230–231}} and was thought to convey [[good fortune]] upon the viewer.{{sfn|Koloski-Ostrow|Lyons|2000|pages=230–231}} Eventually, the popularity of Aphroditus waned as the mainstream, fully feminine version of Aphrodite became more popular,{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=381}} but traces of his cult are preserved in the later legends of [[Hermaphroditus]].{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=381}}

==Worship==
===Classical period===
[[File:The Temple of Aphrodite, built in the Ionic order in stages during the Roman period (from 1st century BC to 2nd century AD) and later converted into a Christian basilica, Aphrodisias, Caria, Turkey (20487630885).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Ruins of the [[Aphrodisias#Temple of Aphrodite|temple of Aphrodite]] at [[Aphrodisias]]]]

Aphrodite's main festival, the [[Aphrodisia]], was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in [[Athens]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]. In Athens, the Aphrodisia was celebrated on the fourth day of the month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]] in honor of Aphrodite's role in the unification of Attica.{{sfn|Rosenzweig|2003|pages=16–17}}{{sfn|Simon|1983|pages=49–50}} During this festival, the priests of Aphrodite would purify the temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwestern slope of the [[Athenian Acropolis|Acropolis]] with the blood of a [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificed dove]].{{sfn|Simon|1983|page=48}} Next, the altars would be [[Anointing|anointed]]{{sfn|Simon|1983|page=48}} and the cult statues of Aphrodite Pandemos and [[Peitho]] would be escorted in a majestic procession to a place where they would be ritually bathed.{{sfn|Simon|1983|pages=48–49}} Aphrodite was also honored in Athens as part of the [[Arrhephoria]] festival.{{sfn|Simon|1983|pages=47–48}} The fourth day of every month was sacred to Aphrodite.{{sfn|Simon|1983|page=49}}

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as ''[[Aphrodite Areia]]'', which means "warlike".{{sfn|Cyrino|2012|pages=51–52}}{{sfn|Budin|2010|pages=85–86, 96, 100, 102–103, 112, 123, 125}} This epithet stresses Aphrodite's connections to Ares, with whom she had extramarital relations.{{sfn|Cyrino|2012|pages=51–52}}{{sfn|Budin|2010|pages=85–86, 96, 100, 102–103, 112, 123, 125}} Pausanias also records that, in Sparta{{sfn|Cyrino|2012|pages=51–52}}{{sfn|Budin|2010|pages=85–86, 96, 100, 102–103, 112, 123, 125}} and on Cythera, a number of extremely ancient cult statues of Aphrodite portrayed her bearing arms.{{sfn|Graz|1984|page=250}}{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}} Other cult statues showed her bound in chains.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}}

Aphrodite was the patron goddess of [[Prostitution in ancient Greece|prostitutes]] of all varieties,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=40}}{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=80}} ranging from ''[[Prostitution in ancient Greece#Pornai|pornai]]'' (cheap [[Street prostitution|street prostitutes]] typically owned as slaves by wealthy [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimps]]) to ''[[hetaira]]i'' (expensive, well-educated hired companions, who were usually self-employed and sometimes provided sex to their customers).{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=40–41}} The city of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] was renowned throughout the ancient world for its many ''hetairai'',{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=41–42}} who had a widespread reputation for being among the most skilled, but also the most expensive, prostitutes in the Greek world.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=41–42}} Corinth also had a major temple to Aphrodite located on the [[Acrocorinth]]{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=41–42}} and was one of the main centers of her cult.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=41–42}} Records of numerous dedications to Aphrodite made by successful courtesans have survived in poems and in pottery inscriptions.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=40–41}} References to Aphrodite in association with prostitution are found in Corinth as well as on the islands of [[Cyprus]], [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], and [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|page=49}} Aphrodite's Mesopotamian precursor Inanna-Ishtar was also closely associated with prostitution.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=109}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=153}}{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|page=49}}

Scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries believed that the cult of Aphrodite may have involved [[ritual prostitution]],{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=153}}{{sfn|Marcovich|1996|page=49}} an assumption based on ambiguous passages in certain ancient texts, particularly a fragment of a ''[[skolion]]'' by the Boeotian poet [[Pindar]],{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=41–43}} which mentions prostitutes in Corinth in association with Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=41–43}} Modern scholars now dismiss the notion of ritual prostitution in Greece as a "historiographic myth" with no factual basis.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=43}}

===Hellenistic and Roman periods===
[[File:Anquises y Afrodita - Afrodisias.jpg|thumb|Greek relief from Aphrodisias, depicting a Roman-influenced Aphrodite sitting on a throne holding an infant while the shepherd [[Anchises]] stands beside her. Carlos Delgado; CC-BY-SA.]]

During the [[Hellenistic period]], the Greeks identified Aphrodite with the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|ancient Egyptian goddesses]] [[Hathor]] and [[Isis]].{{sfn|Witt|1997|page=125}}{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=258}}&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Aphrodite was the patron goddess of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Lagid queens]]{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}} and Queen [[Arsinoe II]] was identified as her mortal incarnation.{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}} Aphrodite was worshipped in [[Alexandria]]{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}} and had numerous temples in and around the city.{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}} Arsinoe II introduced the cult of Adonis to Alexandria and many of the women there partook in it.{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}} The [[Tessarakonteres]], a gigantic [[catamaran]] [[galley]] designed by [[Archimedes]] for [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]], had a circular temple to Aphrodite on it with a marble statue of the goddess herself.{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}} In the second century BC, [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] and his wives [[Cleopatra II of Egypt|Cleopatra II]] and [[Cleopatra III of Egypt|Cleopatra III]] dedicated a temple to Aphrodite Hathor at [[Philae]].{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}} Statuettes of Aphrodite for personal devotion became common in Egypt starting in the early Ptolemaic times and extending until long after [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt became a Roman province]].{{sfn|Dunand|2007|page=257}}

The ancient Romans [[Interpretatio graeca|identified]] Aphrodite with their goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]],{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=127–128}} who was originally a goddess of agricultural fertility, vegetation, and springtime.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=127–128}} According to the Roman historian [[Livy]], Aphrodite and Venus were officially identified in the third century BC{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=128}} when the cult of ''Venus Erycina'' was introduced to Rome from the Greek sanctuary of Aphrodite on [[Monte Erice|Mount Eryx]] in Sicily.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=128}} After this point, Romans adopted Aphrodite's iconography and myths and applied them to Venus.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=128}} Because Aphrodite was the mother of the Trojan hero Aeneas in Greek mythology{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=128}} and Roman tradition claimed Aeneas as the founder of Rome,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=128}} Venus became venerated as ''Venus Genetrix'', the mother of the entire Roman nation.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=128}} [[Julius Caesar]] claimed to be directly descended from Aeneas's son [[Ascanius|Iulus]]{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=128–129}} and became a strong proponent of the cult of Venus.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=128–129}} This precedent was later followed by his nephew [[Augustus]] and the later emperors claiming succession from him.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=128–129}}

This syncretism greatly impacted Greek worship of Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=130}} During the Roman era, the cults of Aphrodite in many Greek cities began to emphasize her relationship with Troy and Aeneas.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=130}} They also began to adopt distinctively Roman elements,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=130}} portraying Aphrodite as more maternal, more militaristic, and more concerned with administrative bureaucracy.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=130}} She was claimed as a divine guardian by many political magistrates.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=130}} Appearances of Aphrodite in Greek literature also vastly proliferated, usually showing Aphrodite in a characteristically Roman manner.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=130–131}}

Aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship, [[Paphos]], on the island of [[Cyprus]], which is why she is sometimes called "Cyprian", especially in the poetic works of [[Sappho]]. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], hence another of her names, "Cytherea".&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' viii. 288; Herodotus i. 105; Pausanias iii. 23. § 1; Anacreon v. 9; Horace, ''Carmina'' i. 4. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between [[Crete]] and the [[Peloponnese|Peloponesus]],{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=21}} so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite's cult from the [[Levant|Middle East]] to mainland [[Greece]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=20–21}}

According to the version of her birth recounted by [[Hesiod]] in his ''[[Theogony]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D173 lines 191-192]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=69}} [[Cronus]] severed [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus']] genitals and threw them behind him into the sea.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=69}}{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=37}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=13–14}} The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} (hence her name, which Hesiod interprets as "foam-arisen"),{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} while the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Giants]], the [[Erinyes]] (furies), and the [[Meliae]] emerged from the drops of his blood.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=69}}{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=37}} Hesiod states that the genitals "were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew." Hesiod's account of Aphrodite's birth following Uranus's castration is probably derived from ''The Song of Kumarbi'',{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=29}}{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=25}} an ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]] epic poem in which the god [[Kumarbi]] overthrows his father [[Anu]], the god of the sky, and bites off his genitals, causing him to become pregnant and give birth to Anu's children, which include Ishtar and her brother [[Teshub]], the Hittite storm god.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=29}}{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=25}}

In the ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.%20Il.%205.370&amp;lang=original v. 370] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D20%3Acard%3D86 xx. 105]&lt;/ref&gt; Aphrodite is described as the daughter of Zeus and Dione.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} Dione's name appears to be a feminine cognate to ''Dios'' and ''Dion'',{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} which are oblique forms of the name ''Zeus''.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} Zeus and Dione shared a cult at [[Dodona]] in northwestern Greece.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} In ''Theogony'', Hesiod describes Dione as an [[Oceanid]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=14–15}}

===Marriage===
[[File:Ares e Afrodite.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|First-century AD Roman fresco of Mars and Venus from [[Pompeii]]]]
Aphrodite is consistently portrayed as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult, having had no childhood.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=53–61}} She is often depicted nude.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=73–78}} In the ''Iliad'', Aphrodite is the apparently unmarried consort of [[Ares]], the god of war,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=50, 72}} and the wife of [[Hephaestus]] is a different goddess named [[Charis (name)|Charis]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=72}} Likewise, in Hesiod's ''Theogony'', Aphrodite is unmarried and the wife of Hephaestus is [[Aglaea]], the youngest of the three [[Charites]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=72}}

In Book Eight of the ''[[Odyssey]]'',{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=279}} however, the blind singer [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]] describes Aphrodite as the wife of Hephaestus and tells how she committed [[adultery]] with Ares during the [[Trojan War]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=72}}{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=72}} The sun-god [[Helios]] saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus's bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a net of gold.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=72}} The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=72}} Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to laugh at the captured adulterers,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=72–73}} but [[Apollo]], [[Hermes]], and [[Poseidon]] had sympathy for Ares{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=73–74}} and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares's release.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=74}} Humiliated, Aphrodite returned to Cyprus, where she was attended by the [[Charites]].{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=74}} This narrative probably originated as a Greek [[fairy tale|folk tale]], originally independent of the ''Odyssey''.{{sfn|Anderson|2000|pages=131–132}}

Later stories were invented to explain Aphrodite's marriage to Hephaestus. In the most famous story, Zeus hastily married Aphrodite to Hephaestus in order to prevent the other gods from fighting over her.{{sfn|Stuttard|2016|page=86}} In another version of the myth, Hephaestus gave his mother [[Hera]] a golden throne, but when she sat on it, she became trapped and he refused to let her go until she agreed to give him Aphrodite's hand in marriage.{{sfn|Slater|1968|pages=199–200}} Hephaestus was overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forged her beautiful jewelry, including a ''[[History of bras#Greece|strophion]]'' known as the ''kestos imas'',{{sfn|Bonner|1949|page=1}} a saltire-shaped undergarment (usually translated as "girdle"),{{sfn|Bonner|1949|pages=1–6}} which accentuated her breasts{{sfn|Bonner|1949|pages=1–2}} and made her even more irresistible to men.{{sfn|Bonner|1949|pages=1–6}} Such ''strophia'' were commonly used in depictions of the Near Eastern goddesses Ishtar and [[Atargatis]].{{sfn|Bonner|1949|pages=1–6}}

===Attendants===
Aphrodite is almost always accompanied by [[Eros]], the god of lust and sexual desire.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=44}} In his ''Theogony'', Hesiod describes Eros as one of the four original primeval forces born at the beginning of time,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=44}} but, after the birth of Aphrodite from the sea foam, he is joined by [[Himeros]] and, together, they become Aphrodite's constant companions.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=44–45}} In early Greek art, Eros and Himeros are both shown as idealized handsome youths with wings.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=45}} The Greek [[Lyric poetry|lyric poets]] regarded the power of Eros and Himeros as dangerous, compulsive, and impossible for anyone to resist.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=45–46}} In modern times, Eros is often seen as Aphrodite's son,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=47}} but this is actually a comparatively late innovation.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=47–48}} A ''[[Scholia|scholion]]'' on [[Theocritus]]'s ''[[Idyll]]s'' remarks that the sixth-century BC poetess Sappho had described Eros as the son of Aphrodite and Uranus,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=48}} but the first surviving reference to Eros as Aphrodite's son comes from [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'', written in the third century BC, which makes him the son of Aphrodite and Ares.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=48–49}} Later, the Romans, who saw Venus as a mother goddess, seized on this idea of Eros as Aphrodite's son and popularized it,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=48–49}} making it the predominant portrayal in works on mythology until the present day.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=48–49}}

Aphrodite's main attendants were the three [[Charites]], whom Hesiod identifies as the daughters of Zeus and [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]] and names as [[Aglaea]] "Splendor", [[Euphrosyne]] "Good Cheer", and [[Thalia (Grace)|Thalia]] "Abundance".{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=71–72}} The Charites had been worshipped as goddesses in Greece since the beginning of Greek history, long before Aphrodite was introduced to the pantheon.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=72}} Aphrodite's other set of attendants was the three [[Horae]] (the "Hours"),{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=72}} whom Hesiod identifies as the daughters of Zeus and [[Themis]] and names as [[Eunomia]] (Good Order), [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] (Justice), and [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]] (Peace).{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=72–73}} Aphrodite was also sometimes accompanied by [[Harmonia]], her daughter by Ares, and [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], the daughter of Zeus and Hera.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=73}}

The fertility god [[Priapus]] was usually considered to be Aphrodite's son by [[Dionysus]],{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=176}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=214}} but he was sometimes also described as her son by Hermes, Adonis, or even Zeus.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=176}} A ''[[scholia|scholion]]'' on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]''{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=283}} states that, while Aphrodite was pregnant with Priapus, Hera envied her and applied an evil potion to her belly while she was sleeping to ensure that the child would be hideous.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=176}} When Aphrodite gave birth, she was horrified to see that the child had a [[Human penis size#Historical|massive, permanently erect penis]], a [[abdominal obesity|potbelly]], and a huge tongue.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=176}} Aphrodite [[Child abandonment|abandoned the infant to die]] in the wilderness, but a herdsman found him and raised him, later discovering that Priapus could use his massive penis to aid in the growth of plants.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=176}}

===Anchises===
[[File:William Blake Richmond - Venus and Anchises - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Venus and Anchises'' (1889 or 1890) by [[William Blake Richmond]]]]
{{main|Anchises}}
The ''First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH%205 Hymn 5]), which was probably composed sometime in the mid-seventh century BC,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=89}} describes how Zeus once became annoyed with Aphrodite for causing deities to fall in love with mortals,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=89}} so he caused her to fall in love with [[Anchises]], a handsome mortal shepherd who lived in the foothills beneath [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]] near the city of [[Troy]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=89}} Aphrodite appears to Anchises in the form of a tall, beautiful, mortal virgin while he is alone in his home.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=90}} Anchises sees her dressed in bright clothing and gleaming jewelry, with her breasts shining with divine radiance.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=90–91}} He asks her if she is Aphrodite and promises to build her an altar on top of the mountain if she will bless him and his family.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=91}}

Aphrodite lies and tells him that she is not a goddess, but the daughter of one of the noble families of [[Phrygia]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=91}} She claims to be able to understand the [[Trojan language]] because she had a Trojan nurse as a child and says that she found herself on the mountainside after she was snatched up by Hermes while dancing in a celebration in honor of [[Artemis]], the goddess of virginity.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=91}} Aphrodite tells Anchises that she is still a virgin{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=91}} and begs him to take her to his parents.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=91}} Anchises immediately becomes overcome with mad lust for Aphrodite and swears that he will have sex with her.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=91}} Anchises takes Aphrodite, with her eyes cast downwards, to his bed, which is covered in the furs of lions and bears.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=92}} He then strips her naked and makes love to her.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=92}}

After the lovemaking is complete, Aphrodite reveals her true divine form.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=92–93}} Anchises is terrified, but Aphrodite consoles him and promises that she will bear him a son.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=92–93}} She [[Prophecy|prophecizes]] that their son will be the [[demigod]] [[Aeneas]], who will be raised by the [[nymph]]s of the wilderness for five years before going to Troy to become a nobleman like his father.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=93}} The story of Aeneas's conception is also mentioned in Hesiod's ''Theogony'' and in Book II of Homer's ''Iliad''.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=93}}&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' lines 1008-10; ''Iliad'' II.819-21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Adonis}}
The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably derived from the ancient [[Sumer]]ian legend of [[Inanna]] and [[Dumuzid]].{{snf|West|1997|page=57}}{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=67}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] name {{lang|grc|Ἄδωνις}} (''Adōnis'', {{IPA-el|ádɔːnis}}) is derived from the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] word ''ʼadōn'', meaning "lord".{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=176–177}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The earliest known Greek reference to [[Adonis]] comes from a fragment of a poem by the [[Lesbos|Lesbian]] poetess [[Sappho]], dating to the seventh century BC, in which a chorus of young girls asks Aphrodite what they can do to mourn Adonis's death.{{sfn|West|1997|pages=530–531}} Aphrodite replies that they must beat their breasts and tear their tunics.{{sfn|West|1997|pages=530–531}} Later references flesh out the story with more details:{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=95}} [[Adonis]] was the son of [[Myrrha]], who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King [[Cinyras]] of [[Cyprus]], after Myrrha's mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=75}} Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a [[myrrh]] tree, but still gave birth to Adonis.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=75–76}}

Aphrodite found the baby, and took him to the underworld to be fostered by [[Persephone]].{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}} She returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}} Persephone wanted to keep Adonis, resulting in a custody battle between the two goddesses over whom should rightly possess Adonis.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}} Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}} Adonis chose to spend that time with Aphrodite.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}} Then, one day, while Adonis was hunting, he was wounded by a wild boar and bled to death in Aphrodite's arms.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}}

In different versions of the story, the boar was either sent by Ares, who was jealous that Aphrodite was spending so much time with Adonis, or by Artemis, who wanted revenge against Aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} The story also provides an [[etiology]] for Aphrodite's associations with certain flowers.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} Reportedly, as she mourned Adonis's death, she caused [[anemone]]s to grow wherever his blood fell,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}} In one version of the story, Aphrodite injured herself on a [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]] from a [[rose]] bush and the rose, which had previously been white, was stained red by her blood.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} According to [[Lucian]]'s ''[[On the Syrian Goddess]]'',{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=279}} each year during the festival of Adonis, the Adonis River in [[Lebanon]] (now known as the [[Abraham River]]) ran red with blood.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=76}}

The myth of Adonis is associated with the festival of the [[Adonia]], which was celebrated by Greek women every year in midsummer.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The festival, which was evidently already celebrated in Lesbos by Sappho's time, seems to have first become popular in Athens in the mid-fifth century BC.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} At the start of the festival, the women would plant a "garden of Adonis", a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick-growing plants, such as [[lettuce]] and [[fennel]], or even quick-sprouting grains such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses, where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The plants would sprout in the sunlight,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} but wither quickly in the heat.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=97–98}} Then the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of Adonis,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=98}} tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=98}}

===Divine favoritism===
[[File:Pygmalion (Raoux).jpg|thumb|''Pygmalion and [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]]'' (1717) by [[Jean Raoux]], showing Aphrodite bringing the statue to life]]
In Hesiod's ''[[Works and Days]]'', Zeus orders Aphrodite to make [[Pandora]], the first woman, physically beautiful and sexually attractive,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=81}} so that she may become "an evil men will love to embrace".{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=80}} Aphrodite "spills grace" over Pandora's head{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=81}} and equips her with "painful desire and knee-weakening anguish", thus making her the perfect vessel for evil to enter the world.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=81–82}} Aphrodite's attendants, Peitho, the Charites, and the Horae, adorn Pandora with gold and jewelry.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=82–83}}

According to one myth, Aphrodite aided [[Hippomenes]], a noble youth who wished to marry [[Atalanta]], a maiden who was renowned throughout the land for her beauty, but who refused to marry any man unless he could outrun her in a [[running|footrace]].{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}}{{sfn|McKinley|2001|page=43}} Atalanta was an exceedingly swift runner and she beheaded all of the men who lost to her.{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}}{{sfn|McKinley|2001|page=43}} Aphrodite gave Hippomenes three [[golden apple]]s from the [[Hesperides|Garden of the Hesperides]] and instructed him to toss them in front of Atalanta as he raced her.{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}}{{sfn|Wasson|1968|page=128}} Hippomenes obeyed Aphrodite's order{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}} and Atalanta, seeing the beautiful, golden fruits, bent down to pick up each one, allowing Hippomenes to outrun her.{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}}{{sfn|Wasson|1968|page=128}} In the version of the story from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Hippomenes forgets to repay Aphrodite for her aid,{{sfn|McKinley|2001|pages=43–44}}{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}} so she causes the couple to become inflamed with lust while they are staying at the temple of [[Cybele]].{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}} The couple [[Desecration|desecrate]] the temple by having sex in it, leading Cybele to turn them into lions as punishment.{{sfn|McKinley|2001|pages=43–44}}{{sfn|Ruck|Staples|2001|pages=64–70}}

The myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] is first mentioned by the third-century BC Greek writer [[Philostephanus|Philostephanus of Cyrene]],{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=90–91}}&lt;ref&gt;Clement, '' Exhortation to the Greeks'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; but is first recounted in detail in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=90–91}} According to Ovid, Pygmalion was an exceedingly handsome sculptor from the island of Cyprus, who was so sickened by the immorality of women that he refused to marry.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=215}} He fell madly and passionately in love with the ivory cult statue he was carving of Aphrodite and longed to marry it.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|pages=215–217}} Because Pygmalion was extremely pious and devoted to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=217}} the goddess brought the statue to life.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=217}} Pygmalion married the girl the statue became and they had a son named Paphos, after whom the [[Paphos|capital of Cyprus]] received its name.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=217}} [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]] later mentions "Metharme, daughter of Pygmalion, king of Cyprus".&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheke'', iii.14.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anger myths===

Aphrodite generously rewarded those who honored her, but also punished those who disrespected her, often quite brutally.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=98–99}} A myth described in Apollonius of Rhodes's ''Argonautica'' and later summarized in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus tells how, when the women of the island of [[Lemnos]] refused to sacrifice to Aphrodite, the goddess cursed them to stink horribly so that their husbands would never have sex with them.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} Instead, their husbands started having sex with their [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Sexual slavery|slave-girls]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} In anger, the women of Lemnos murdered the entire male population of the island, as well as all the Thracian slaves.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} When [[Jason]] and his crew of [[Argonauts]] arrived on Lemnos, they mated with the sex-starved women under Aphrodite's approval and repopulated the island.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} From then on, the women of Lemnos never disrespected Aphrodite again.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}}

In [[Euripides]]'s tragedy ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', which was first performed at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] in 428 BC, Theseus's son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]] worships only [[Artemis]], the goddess of virginity, and refuses to engage in any form of sexual contact.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} Aphrodite is infuriated by his prideful behavior{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=100}} and, in the prologue to the play, she declares that, by honoring only Artemis and refusing to venerate her, Hippolytus has directly challenged her authority.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=100–101}} Aphrodite therefore causes Hippolytus's stepmother, [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus will reject her.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=101}} After being rejected, Phaedra commits suicide and leaves a [[suicide note]] to Theseus telling him that she killed herself because Hippolytus attempted to rape her.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=101}} Theseus prays to Poseidon to kill Hippolytus for his transgression.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=102}} Poseidon sends a [[wild bull]] to scare Hippolytus's horses as he is riding by the sea in his chariot, causing the horses to bolt and smash the chariot against the cliffs, dragging Hippolytus to a bloody death across the rocky shoreline.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=102}} The play concludes with Artemis vowing to kill Aphrodite's own mortal beloved (presumably Adonis) in revenge.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=102–103}}

[[Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)|Glaucus]] of Corinth angered Aphrodite by refusing to let his horses for [[chariot racing]] mate, since doing so would hinder their speed.&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Georgics'' 3.266–288, with Servius's note to line 268; Hand, ''The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology'', pp. 432, 663.&lt;/ref&gt; During the chariot race at the funeral games of King [[Pelias]], Aphrodite drove his horses mad and they tore him apart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 250.3, 273.11; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Guide to Greece'' 6.20.19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphonte]] was a young woman who chose a virginal life with Artemis instead of marriage and children, as favoured by Aphrodite. Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately, he transformed all the members of the family into birds of ill omen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of the Judgement of Paris is mentioned briefly in the ''[[Iliad]]'',{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=31}} but is described in depth in an [[epitome]] of the ''[[Cypria]]'', a lost poem of the [[Epic Cycle]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31–32}} which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]).{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=31}} Only [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, was not invited.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31–32}} She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, "for the fairest"), which she threw among the goddesses.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}

The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always fully clothed.{{sfn|Bull|2005|pages=346–347}} Since the [[Renaissance]], however, western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.{{sfn|Bull|2005|pages=346–347}}

All three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all [[Asia]] and [[Europe]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} and Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle,{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} but Aphrodite promised Paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}} This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]].{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}} Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}} The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the [[Trojan War]].{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}}

Aphrodite plays an important and active role throughout the entirety of Homer's ''Iliad''.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=85}} In Book III, she rescues Paris from Menelaus after he foolishly challenges him to a one-on-one [[duel]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=85–86}} She then appears to Helen in the form of an old woman and attempts to persuade her to have sex with Paris,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=35–36, 86–87}} reminding her of his physical beauty and athletic prowess.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=36, 86–87}} Helen immediately recognizes Aphrodite by her beautiful neck, perfect breasts, and flashing eyes{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=87}} and chides the goddess, addressing her as her equal.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=87–88}} Aphrodite sharply rebukes Helen, reminding her that, if she vexes her, she will punish her just as much as she has favored her already.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=88}} Helen demurely obeys Aphrodite's command.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=88}}

In Book V, Aphrodite charges into battle to rescue her son Aeneas from the Greek hero [[Diomedes]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=49}} Diomedes recognizes Aphrodite as a "weakling" goddess{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=49}} and, thrusting his spear, nicks her wrist through her "ambrosial robe".{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=49–50}} Aphrodite borrows Ares's chariot to ride back to Mount Olympus.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=50}} Zeus chides her for putting herself in danger,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=50}}{{sfn|Burkert|2005|page=300}} reminding her that "her specialty is love, not war."{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=50}} According to [[Walter Burkert]], this scene directly parallels a scene from Tablet VI of the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' in which Ishtar, Aphrodite's Akkadian precursor, cries to her mother [[Antu (goddess)|Antu]] after the hero [[Gilgamesh]] rejects her sexual advances, but is mildly rebuked by her father [[Anu]].{{sfn|Burkert|2005|pages=299–300}} In Book XIV of the ''Iliad'', during the ''[[Deception of Zeus|Dios Apate]]'' episode, Aphrodite lends her ''kestos himas'' to [[Hera]] for the purpose of seducing Zeus and distracting him from the combat while Poseidon aids the Greek forces on the beach.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=36}} In the ''[[Theomachy|Theomachia]]'' in Book XXI, Aphrodite again enters the battlefield to carry Ares away after he is wounded.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=50}}&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' XXI.416-17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-32-51 DxO.jpg|thumb|250px|The so-called "[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in a [[bikini]]", from the [[house of Julia Felix]], [[Pompeii]], Italy actually depicts [[Interpretatio Graeca|her Greek counterpart]] Aphrodite as she is about to untie her [[sandal]], with a small [[Eros]] squatting beneath her left arm, 1st-century AD{{efn|Museo Archeologico Nazionale (Napoli). "[http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/thematic-views/image-gallery/RA49?set so-called Venus in a bikini]." ''Cir.campania.beniculturali.it''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The statuette portrays Aphrodite on the point of untying the laces of the sandal on her left foot, under which a small Eros squats, touching the sole of her shoe with his right hand. The Goddess is leaning with her left arm (the hand is missing) against a figure of Priapus standing, naked and bearded, positioned on a small cylindrical altar while, next to her left thigh, there is a tree trunk over which the garment of the Goddess is folded. Aphrodite, almost completely naked, wears only a sort of costume, consisting of a corset held up by two pairs of straps and two short sleeves on the upper part of her arm, from which a long chain leads to her hips and forms a star-shaped motif at the level of her navel. The 'bikini', for which the statuette is famous, is obtained by the masterly use of the technique of gilding, also employed on her groin, in the pendant necklace and in the armilla on Aphrodite's right wrist, as well as on Priapus' phallus. Traces of the red paint are evident on the tree trunk, on the short curly hair gathered back in a bun and on the lips of the Goddess, as well as on the heads of Priapus and the Eros. Aphrodite's eyes are made of glass paste, while the presence of holes at the level of the ear-lobes suggest the existence of precious metal ear-rings which have since been lost. An interesting insight into the female ornaments of Roman times, the statuette, probably imported from the area of Alexandria, reproduces with a few modifications the statuary type of Aphrodite untying her sandal, known from copies in bronze and terracotta.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aphrodite's most prominent avian symbol was the dove,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=121–122}} which was originally an important symbol of her Near Eastern precursor Inanna-Ishtar.{{sfn|Lewis|Llewellyn-Jones|2018|page=335}}{{sfn|Botterweck|Ringgren|1990|page=35}} (In fact, the ancient Greek word for "dove", ''peristerá'', may be derived from a Semitic phrase ''peraḥ Ištar'', meaning "bird of Ishtar".{{sfn|Lewis|Llewellyn-Jones|2018|page=335}}{{sfn|Botterweck|Ringgren|1990|page=35}}) Aphrodite frequently appears with doves in [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek pottery]]{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=121–122}} and the temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwest slope of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]] was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted [[Annulet (architecture)|fillets]] in their beaks.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=122}} Votive offerings of small, white, marble doves were also discovered in the temple of Aphrodite at [[Dafni, Attica|Daphni]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=122}} In addition to her associations with doves, Aphrodite was also closely linked with sparrows{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=121–122}} and she is described riding in a chariot pulled by sparrows in Sappho's "[[Ode to Aphrodite]]".{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=122}}

Because of her connections to the sea, Aphrodite was associated with a number of different types of [[Anatidae|water fowl]],{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=120–123}} including swans, geese, and ducks.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=120–123}} Aphrodite's other symbols included the sea, conch shells, and roses.{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} The rose and [[Myrtus|myrtle]] flowers were both sacred to Aphrodite.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=63, 96}} Her most important fruit emblem was the apple,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=64}} but she was also associated with [[pomegranate]]s,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=63}} possibly because the red seeds suggested sexuality{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=63–64}} or because Greek women sometimes used pomegranates as a method of [[birth control]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=63–64}} In Greek art, Aphrodite is often also accompanied by [[dolphin]]s and [[Nereid]]s.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=123–124}}

}}

A scene of Aphrodite rising from the sea appears on the back of the [[Ludovisi Throne]] ({{circa}} 460 BC),{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=106}} which was probably originally part of a massive altar that was constructed as part of the Ionic temple to Aphrodite in the Greek polis of [[Locri|Locri Epizephyrii]] in [[Magna Graecia]] in southern Italy.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=106}} The throne shows Aphrodite rising from the sea, clad in a diaphanous garment, which is drenched with seawater and clinging to her body, revealing her upturned breasts and the outline of her navel.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=106–107}} Her hair hangs dripping as she reaches to two attendants standing barefoot on the rocky shore on either side of her, lifting her out of the water.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=106–107}} Scenes with Aphrodite appear in works of classical [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek pottery]],{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=124}} including a famous [[White ground technique|white-ground]] ''[[kylix]]'' by the [[Pistoxenos Painter]] dating the between {{circa}} 470 and 460 BC, showing her riding on a swan or goose.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=124}}

In {{circa|364/361}} BC, the Athenian sculptor [[Praxiteles]] carved the [[Marble sculpture|marble statue]] ''[[Aphrodite of Knidos]]'',{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=224}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=76–77}} which [[Pliny the Elder]] later praised as the greatest sculpture ever made.{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=224}} The statue showed a nude Aphrodite modestly covering her pubic region while resting against a water pot with her robe draped over it for support.{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=225}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=77}} The ''Aphrodite of Knidos'' was the first ever full-sized statue to depict Aphrodite completely naked{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=76}} and one of the first sculptures that was intended to be viewed from all sides.{{sfn|Grant|1989|pages=224–225}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=76}} The statue was purchased by the people of [[Knidos]] in around 350 BC{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=76}} and proved to be tremendously influential on later depictions of Aphrodite.{{sfn|Grant|1989|pages=224–225}} The original sculpture has been lost,{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=224}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=77}} but written descriptions of it as well several depictions of it on coins are still extant{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=98}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=224}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=77}} and over sixty copies, small-scale models, and fragments of it have been identified.{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=98}}

The Greek painter [[Apelles of Kos]], a contemporary of Praxiteles, produced the [[panel painting]] ''[[Venus Anadyomene|Aphrodite Anadyomene]]'' (''Aphrodite Rising from the Sea'').{{sfn|Havelock|2007|page=86}} According to [[Athenaeus]], Apelles was inspired to paint the painting after watching the courtesan [[Phryne]] take off her clothes, untie her hair, and bathe naked in the sea at [[Eleusis]].{{sfn|Havelock|2007|page=86}} The painting was displayed in the [[Asclepeion]] on the island of [[Kos]].{{sfn|Havelock|2007|page=86}} The ''Aphrodite Anadyomene'' went unnoticed for centuries,{{sfn|Havelock|2007|page=86}} but [[Pliny the Elder]] records that, in his own time, it was regarded as Apelles's most famous work.{{sfn|Havelock|2007|page=86}}

During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, statues depicting Aphrodite proliferated;{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=77–78}} many of these statues were modeled at least to some extent on Praxiteles's ''Aphrodite of Knidos''.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=77–78}} Some statues show [[Crouching Venus|Aphrodite crouching naked]];{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=78}} others show her wringing water out of her hair as she rises from the sea.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=78}} Another common type of statue is known as ''[[Venus Callipyge|Aphrodite Kallipygos]]'', the name of which is Greek for "Aphrodite of the Beautiful [[Buttocks]]";{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=78}} this type of sculpture shows Aphrodite lifting her ''[[peplos]]'' to display her buttocks to the viewer while looking back at them from over her shoulder.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=78}} The ancient Romans produced massive numbers of copies of Greek sculptures of Aphrodite{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=77–78}} and more sculptures of Aphrodite have survived from antiquity than of any other deity.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=78}}

[[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] frequently adapted pagan iconography to suit Christian purposes.{{sfn|Taylor|1993|pages=96–97}}{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=80}}{{sfn|Link|1995|pages=43–45}}{{efn|This does not in any way indicate that Christianity itself was derived from paganism, only that early Christians made use of the pre-existing symbols that were readily available in their society.{{sfn|Taylor|1993|pages=96–97}}}} In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christians adapted elements of Aphrodite/Venus's iconography and applied them to [[Eve]] and prostitutes,{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=80}} but also female saints and even the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=80}} [[Eastern Christianity|Christians in the east]] reinterpreted the story of Aphrodite's birth as a metaphor for [[baptism]];{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=97}} in a Coptic stele from the sixth century AD, a female [[orans|orant]] is shown wearing Aphrodite's conch shell as a sign that she is newly baptized.{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=97}} Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], villages and communities across Europe still maintained folk tales and traditions about Aphrodite/Venus{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|pages=80–81}} and travelers reported a wide variety of stories.{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|pages=80–81}} Numerous Roman mosaics of Venus survived in Britain, preserving memory of the pagan past.{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} In North Africa in the late fifth century AD, [[Fulgentius of Ruspe]] encountered mosaics of Aphrodite{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} and reinterpreted her as a symbol of the sin of [[Lust]],{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} arguing that she was shown naked because "the sin of lust is never cloaked"{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} and that she was often shown "swimming" because "all lust suffers shipwreck of its affairs."{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} He also argued that she was associated with doves and conchs because these are symbols of copulation,{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} and that she was associated with roses because "as the rose gives pleasure, but is swept away by the swift movement of the seasons, so lust is pleasant for a moment, but is swept away forever."{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}}

While Fulgentius had appropriated Aphrodite as a symbol of Lust,{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} [[Isidore of Seville]] ({{circa}} 560–636) interpreted her as a symbol of marital procreative sex{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} and declared that the moral of the story of Aphrodite's birth is that sex can only be holy in the presence of semen, blood, and heat, which he regarded as all being necessary for procreation.{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} Meanwhile, Isidore denigrated Aphrodite/Venus's son Eros/Cupid as a "demon of fornication" (''daemon fornicationis'').{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} Aphrodite/Venus was best known to Western European scholars through her appearances in Virgil's ''Aeneid'' and Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|pages=106–108}} Venus is mentioned in the Latin poem ''[[Pervigilium Veneris]]'' ("The Eve of Saint Venus"), written in the third or fourth century AD,{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|pages=107–108}} and in [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium]]''.{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=108}}

===Art===
Aphrodite is the central figure in [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', which has been described as "one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world",{{sfn|Fossi|1998|page=5}} and "one of the most popular paintings in Western art".{{sfn|Cunningham|Reich|2009|page=282}} The story of Aphrodite's birth from the foam was a popular subject matter for painters during the [[Italian Renaissance]],{{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|pages=193–195}} who were attempting to consciously reconstruct Apelles of Kos's lost masterpiece ''Aphrodite Anadyomene'' based on the literary ''[[ekphrasis]]'' of it preserved by [[Cicero]] and Pliny the Elder.{{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|page=193}} Artists also drew inspiration from [[Ovid]]'s description of the birth of Venus in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.{{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|page=193}} Sandro Botticelli's ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' ({{circa}} 1485) was also partially inspired by a description by [[Poliziano]] of a relief on the subject.{{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|page=193}} Later Italian renditions of the same scene include [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' ({{circa}} 1525){{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|page=193}} and [[Raphael]]'s painting in the ''[[Stufetta del cardinal Bibbiena]]'' (1516).{{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|page=193}} Titian's biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] identified all of Titian's paintings of naked women as paintings of "Venus",{{sfn|Tinagli|1997|page=148}} including an erotic painting from {{circa}} 1534, which he called the ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', even though the painting does not contain any of Aphrodite/Venus's traditional iconography and the woman in it is clearly shown in a contemporary setting, not a classical one.{{sfn|Tinagli|1997|page=148}}

[[Jacques-Louis David]]'s final work was his 1824 ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[Mars Being Disarmed by Venus]]'',{{sfn|Bordes|2005|page=189}} which combines elements of classical, Renaissance, traditional French art, and contemporary artistic styles.{{sfn|Bordes|2005|page=189}} While he was working on the painting, David described it, saying, "This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush."{{sfn|Hill|2007|page=155}} The painting was exhibited first in Brussels and then in Paris, where over 10,000 people came to see it.{{sfn|Hill|2007|page=155}} [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]'s painting ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Ingres)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was one of his major works.{{sfn|Tinterow|1999|page=358}} Louis Geofroy described it as a "dream of youth realized with the power of maturity, a happiness that few obtain, artists or others."{{sfn|Tinterow|1999|page=358}} [[Théophile Gautier]] declared: "Nothing remains of the marvelous painting of the Greeks, but surely if anything could give the idea of antique painting as it was conceived following the statues of Phidias and the poems of Homer, it is M. Ingres's painting: the ''Venus Anadyomene'' of Apelles has been found."{{sfn|Tinterow|1999|page=358}} Other critics dismissed it as a piece of unimaginative, sentimental [[kitsch]],{{sfn|Tinterow|1999|page=358}} but Ingres himself considered it to be among his greatest works and used the same figure as the model for his later 1856 painting ''[[The Source (Ingres)|La Source]]''.{{sfn|Tinterow|1999|page=358}}

Paintings of Venus were favorites of the late nineteenth-century [[Academic art]]ists in France.{{sfn|McPhee|1986|pages=66–67}}{{sfn|Gay|1998|page=128}} In 1863, [[Alexandre Cabanel]] won widespread critical acclaim at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] for his painting ''[[The Birth of Venus (Cabanel)|The Birth of Venus]]'', which the French emperor [[Napoleon III]] immediately purchased for his own personal art collection.{{sfn|McPhee|1986|page=66}} [[Édouard Manet]]'s 1865 painting ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' [[parody|parodied]] the nude Venuses of the Academic painters, particularly Cabanel's ''Birth of Venus''.{{sfn|Gay|1998|page=129}} In 1867, the English Academic painter [[Frederic Leighton]] displayed his ''Venus Disrobing for the Bath'' at the Academy.{{sfn|Smith|1996|pages=145–146}} The art critic J. B. Atkinson praised it, declaring that "Mr Leighton, instead of adopting corrupt Roman notions regarding Venus such as Rubens embodied, has wisely reverted to the Greek idea of Aphrodite, a goddess worshipped, and by artists painted, as the perfection of female grace and beauty."{{sfn|Smith|1996|page=146}} A year later, the English painter [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], a founding member of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], painted ''Venus Verticordia'' (Latin for "Aphrodite, the Changer of Hearts"), showing Aphrodite as a nude [[Red hair|red-headed]] woman in a garden of roses.{{sfn|Smith|1996|pages=145–146}} Though he was reproached for his ''outré'' subject matter,{{sfn|Smith|1996|pages=145–146}} Rossetti refused to alter the painting and it was soon purchased by [[J. Mitchell]] of Bradford.{{sfn|Smith|1996|page=146}} In 1879, [[William Adolphe Bouguereau]] exhibited at the Paris Salon his own ''[[The Birth of Venus (Bouguereau)|Birth of Venus]]'',{{sfn|McPhee|1986|page=66}} which imitated the classical tradition of ''[[contrapposto]]'' and was met with widespread critical acclaim, rivalling the popularity of Cabanel's version from nearly two decades prior.{{sfn|McPhee|1986|page=66}}

===Literature===
[[File:Edouard Zier illustration for Pierre Louys Aphrodite.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration by Édouard Zier for [[Pierre Louÿs]]'s 1896 erotic novel ''[[Aphrodite: mœurs antiques]]'']]

[[William Shakespeare]]'s erotic [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1593), a retelling of the courtship of Aphrodite and Adonis from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'',{{sfn|Lákta|2017|pages=56–58}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=131}} was the most popular of all his works published within his own lifetime.{{sfn|Lákta|2017|page=58}}{{sfn|Hiscock|2017|page=unpaginated}} Six editions of it were published before Shakespeare's death (more than any of his other works){{sfn|Hiscock|2017|page=unpaginated}} and it enjoyed particularly strong popularity among young adults.{{sfn|Lákta|2017|page=58}} In 1605, [[Richard Barnfield]] lauded it,{{sfn|Hiscock|2017|page=unpaginated}} declaring that the poem had placed Shakespeare's name "in fames immortall Booke".{{sfn|Hiscock|2017|page=unpaginated}} Despite this, the poem has received mixed reception from modern critics;{{sfn|Lákta|2017|page=58}} [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] defended it,{{sfn|Lákta|2017|page=58}} but [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] complained that it bored him{{sfn|Lákta|2017|page=58}} and [[C. S. Lewis]] described an attempted reading of it as "suffocating".{{sfn|Lákta|2017|page=58}}

Aphrodite appears in [[Richard Garnett (writer)|Richard Garnett]]'s short story collection ''[[The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales]]'' (1888),{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=354–355}} in which the gods' temples have been destroyed by Christians.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=355}} Stories revolving around sculptures of Aphrodite were common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=364}} Examples of such works of literature include the novel ''The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance'' (1885) by [[Thomas Anstey Guthrie]] and the short story ''[[La Vénus d'Ille|The Venus of Ille]]'' (1887) by [[Prosper Mérimée]],{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=361–362}} both of which are about statues of Aphrodite that come to life.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=361–362}} Another noteworthy example is ''Aphrodite in Aulis'' by the Anglo-Irish writer [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]],{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=363}} which revolves around an ancient Greek family who moves to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]].{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=363–364}} The French writer [[Pierre Louÿs]] titled his erotic historical novel ''[[Aphrodite: mœurs antiques]]'' (1896) after the Greek goddess.{{sfn|Brooks|Alden|1980|pages=836–844}} The novel enjoyed widespread commercial success,{{sfn|Brooks|Alden|1980|pages=836–844}} but scandalized French audiences due to its sensuality and its decadent portrayal of Greek society.{{sfn|Brooks|Alden|1980|pages=836–844}}

In the early twentieth century, stories of Aphrodite were used by [[Feminism|feminist]] poets,{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=369}} such as [[Amy Lowell]] and [[Alicia Ostriker]].{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=369–371}} Many of these poems dealt with Aphrodite's legendary birth from the foam of the sea.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=369}} Other feminist writers, including [[Claude Cahun]], [[Thit Jensen]], and [[Anaïs Nin]] also made use of the myth of Aphrodite in their writings.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=372–374}} Ever since the publication of [[Isabel Allende]]'s book ''Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses'' in 1998, the name "Aphrodite" has been used as a title for dozens of books dealing with all topics even superficially connected to her domain.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=134–135}} Frequently these books do not even mention Aphrodite,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=134–135}} or mention her only briefly, but make use of her name as a selling point.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=135}}

===Modern worship===
In 1938, [[Gleb Botkin]], a Russian immigrant to the United States, founded the [[Church of Aphrodite]], a [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] religion centered around the worship of a [[Mother Goddess]], whom its practitioners identified as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=139}}{{sfn|Pizza|Lewis|2009|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rwzttsI9–NwC&amp;pg=PA327 327&amp;ndash;328]}} The Church of Aphrodite's theology was laid out in the book ''In Search of Reality'', published in 1969, two years before Botkin's death.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} The book portrayed Aphrodite in a drastically different light than the one in which the Greeks envisioned her,{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} instead casting her as "the sole Goddess of a somewhat Neoplatonic Pagan monotheism".{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} It claimed that the worship of Aphrodite had been brought to Greece by the [[Mysticism|mystic teacher]] [[Orpheus]],{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} but that the Greeks had misunderstood Orpheus's teachings and had not realized the importance of worshipping Aphrodite alone.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}}

Aphrodite is a major deity in [[Wicca]],{{sfn|Gallaher|2005|pages=109–110}}{{sfn|Sabin|2010|page=125}} a contemporary nature-based [[syncretism|syncretic]] Neopagan religion.{{sfn|Sabin|2010|pages=3–4}} Wiccans regard Aphrodite as one aspect of the [[Wiccan views of divinity|Goddess]]{{sfn|Sabin|2010|page=125}} and she is frequently invoked by name during [[Spell (paranormal)|enchantments]] dealing with love and romance.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=110}}{{sfn|Sabin|2010|page=124}} Wiccans regard Aphrodite as the ruler of human emotions, erotic spirituality, creativity, and art.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|pages=109–110}} As one of the twelve Olympians, Aphrodite is a major deity within [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenismos]] (Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22972610|title=The Greeks who worship the ancient gods|first1=Matthew Brunwasser PRI's The|last1=World|first2=Mount|last2=Olympus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Alexander|2007|page=23}} a Neopagan religion which seeks to authentically revive and recreate the religion of ancient Greece in the modern world.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|page=9}} Unlike Wiccans, Hellenists are usually strictly polytheistic or pantheistic.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|pages=22–23}} Hellenists venerate Aphrodite primarily as the goddess of romantic love,{{sfn|Alexander|2007|page=23}} but also as a goddess of sexuality, the sea, and war.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|page=23}} Her many epithets include "Sea Born", "Killer of Men", "She upon the Graves", "Fair Sailing", and "Ally in War".{{sfn|Alexander|2007|page=23}}

'''Badwa''' is one of the names given to male spiritual leaders among the [[Bhil]] tribes of the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The religious sphere of Bhils is represented by variety of spirits, ghosts, gods, goddess, and deities. The Deovera (place of pray) is a popular religious centre and commands full respect and recognition (Mann, 1982). The Deovra are erected in the names of lineage, hamlets or village as a whole. In general, a Bhil [[Deovera]] contains images of [[Devi]], [[Mataji|Mata]], [[Bhomia]], [[Dharam Raj]], [[Robari Baba]] etc., such religious spots are specially taken care of by the popular religious man known as [[Bhopa]] (Nagda, 1992). The chief of a Deovera is called Pat Bhopa or Badwa. He is fully competent to invoke deity. A Bhopa is used to search the cause and cure of morbidity and sterility.&lt;ref&gt;BL Nagda, ''Ethno-Demographic Determinats of High Fertility Among Tribes'', ''Anthropologist'', '''5''' (2003): 185–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yi Bimoism symbol.svg|thumb|150px|A symbol used to represent the Bimoist faith]]
'''Bimoism'''&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jiao, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|c=毕摩教|p=Bìmójiào}}, [[Yi language|Yi]]:{{lang|ii|ꀘꂾ}}) is the [[indigenous religion]] of the [[Yi people]], the largest ethnic group in [[Yunnan]] after the [[Han Chinese]]. It takes its name from the ''bimo'', [[shaman]]-[[priest]]s who are also masters of [[Yi language]] and scriptures, wearing distinctive black robes and large hats.

Since the 1980s, with the loosening of religion restrictions in [[China]], Bimoism has undergone a revitalisation.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jiao, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the Bimo Culture Research Center was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jiao, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2010s, the government of China has helped the revival of the Bimoist faith through the construction of large temples and ceremonial complexes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ztta.gov.cn/Pages_90_5762.aspx 彝族六祖分支].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yizuren.com/plus/view.php?aid=13357 彝族分支圣地，神奇乌蒙昭通].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qcyn.sina.com.cn/dali/shxw/2012/0302/10041572063.html 2012年中华彝族祭祖节祭祖大典在南诏土主庙举行].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priesthood==

===The ''bimo'' priests===

The ''bimo'', once considered by the Chinese government to be promoting a "backwards religion", are now being promoted as ambassadors of Yi culture. They organise large-scale rituals for the yearly [[Torch Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jiao, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''suni'' priests===
Nosu Bimoism, the religion of the Nosu or Nuosu subgroup of the Yi, distinguishes two sorts of shamans: the ''bimo'' and the ''suni'', respectively hereditary and ordained priests. One can become bimo by patrilineal descent after a time of apprenticeship or formally acknowledging an old bimo as the teacher. A suni must be elected.

Bimo can read Yi scripts while suni cannot. Both can perform rituals, but only bimo can perform rituals linked to death. In most cases, suni only perform some exorcisms to cure diseases. Generally, suni can only be from humble civil birth while bimo can be of both aristocratic and humble families.

==Features==

===Deities and rites===
Bimo officiate at births, funerals, weddings and holidays. They are often seen along the street consulting ancient scripts. The Yi worship deified ancestors similarly to the [[Chinese traditional religion]] practitioners, besides gods of local nature: fire, hills, trees, rocks, water, earth, sky, wind, and forests.

Ritual performances play a major role in daily life through healing, exorcism, blessing, divination and analysis of one's relationship with the gods. They believe dragons (symbols of generation) protect villages against bad spirits. The Yi dragon is represented in Yi art differently from that in [[Han Chinese|Han]] art.

===Psychology===
After someone dies, a pig or sheep is sacrificed at the doorway to maintain relationship with the deceased spirit. The Yi believe in numerous evil spirits. They believe that spirits cause illness, poor harvests and other misfortunes and inhabit all material things. The Yi also believe in multiple souls. At death, one soul remains to watch the grave while the other is eventually [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] into some living form.

'''Black drink''' is a name for several kinds of ritual beverages brewed by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Traditional ceremonial people of the [[Yuchi people|Yuchi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|page=59|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caddo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=70–71 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chickasaw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=61–62 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee people|Muscogee]] and some other [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]] use the black drink in purification ceremonies.  It was occasionally known as ''white drink'' because of the association of the color white with peace leaders in some Native cultures in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson, |first= Charles, M|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher=  University of Georgia Press.|pages=2, 131 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preparation and protocols vary between tribes and ceremonial grounds; a prominent ingredient is the roasted leaves and stems of ''[[Ilex vomitoria]]'' (commonly known as yaupon holly), a plant native to the [[Atlantic]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]s. Black drink also usually contains [[emetic]] herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gibbons |first= E|date=  1964|title= Stalking the Blue-eyed Scallop|url= |location= |publisher=  David McKay Company, Inc |page= |isbn=  0-911469-05-2|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Makingblackdrink.png|thumb|''Preparing Black Drink'', engraving by [[Joseph-François Lafitau]], 1723]]
[[File:Ilex vomitoria fws.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Yaupon holly]]

According to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon leaves and branches used for the black drink were traditionally picked as close to the time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason [[coffee]] beans are roasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merck Index |edition=12th |editor=Susan Budavari |publisher=Merck &amp; Co., Inc. |place=Whitehouse Station, NJ |year=1996 |page=1674}}&lt;/ref&gt; After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Hudson, Charles M.  |  title =The Southeastern Indians| year =1976 | page = 226 | authorlink = Charles M. Hudson (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent &lt;ref&gt;Owen, Daiel, 2006. Coffee and Cafeine FAQ: How much caffeine there is in X coffee? Access at http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/23&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''Ilex vomitoria'' leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Adam, 2002. [http://www.econbot.org/_about_/06_awards/awards_ morton/pdfs/a_edwards.pdf "Variation of caffeine and related alkaloids in Ilex vomitoria Ait. (Yaupon holly): A model of intraspecific alkaloid variation."] ''Society for Economic Botany'' Julia F. Morton Award.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes.

While the general method of production is known, not all details of the preparation and ceremonial usage of the black drink are. The source of the emetic effect of black drink is not known and has been speculated upon by historians, archaeologists, and botanists. Some professionals believe it to be caused by the addition of poisonous [[Liatris aspera|button snakeroot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Hudson, Charles M.  |  title =The Southeastern Indians| year =1976 | pages = 4, 59, 62, 138, 140–141, | authorlink = Charles M. Hudson (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary preparation and usage of the black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Mac|title=Landscaping in Florida|date=1990|publisher=Pineapple Press|isbn=978-1561640577|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOcueAUoOuwC&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=yaupon%20toxic&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q=yaupon%20toxic&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible toxic substance was [[theobromine]], an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more theobromine than yaupon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Adam L. | last2 = Bennett | first2 = Bradley C. | year = 2005 | title = Diversity of Methylxanthine Content in Ilex cassine L. and Ilex vomitoria Ait.: Assessing Sources of the North American Stimulant Cassina | url = | journal = Economic Botany | volume = 59 | issue = 3| pages = 275–285 | doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2005)059[0275:domcii]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological accounts==
[[File:Black Drink map HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the geographical extent of black drink use by [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands]], prior to 19th century [[Indian Removal]] ]]
Archaeologists have demonstrated the use of various kinds of black drink among Native American groups stretching back far into antiquity, possibly dating to [[Archaic period in the Americas|Late Archaic times]]. During the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell period]], the shell cups known from later black drink rituals become common in high-status burials along with mortuary pottery and engraved stone and copper tablets. The significance of the shell cups may indicate the beginning of black drink ceremonialism. The fact that both the shells and the yaupon holly come from the same geographical location may indicate they were traded together in the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell Interaction Sphere]].&lt;ref name=HUDSONBLACK&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Charles M. Hudson (author)|last=Hudson|first=Charles M.|title =Black Drink: A Native American Tea|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|year=1979|pages=83–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of shell cups can be used as a virtual marker for the advent of Hopewell Culture in many instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  author = Griffin, James B.  |  title =Culture Periods in Eastern United States Archaeology| publisher = University of Chicago Press|year =1952 | page = 360|authorlink = James Bennett Griffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Mississippian culture]] period, the presence of items associated with the black drink ceremony had spread over most of the south, with many hundreds of examples from [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]], [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]], [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and Hiwassee Island.

===Black drink at Cahokia===
[[File:Woodhenge motif black drink beaker HRoe 2013.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ceramic beaker from Cahokia with [[Cahokia Woodhenge|woodhenge]] motif]]
Archaeologists working at [[Cahokia]], the largest Mississippian culture settlement located near the modern city of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle on one side and a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain [[theobromine]], caffeine and [[ursolic acid]] in the right proportions to have come from the ''Ilex vomitoria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crown|first= Patricia L.|last2= Emerson|first2= Thomas E.|last3= Gu|first3= Jiyan|last4=Hurst |first4= W.

The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/12/0806Cahokia_ThomasEmerson.html|title=Researchers find evidence of ritual use of 'black drink' at Cahokia|date=2012-08-06|author= Diana Yates|publisher=[[University of Illinois]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-black-drink-cahokia-20120806,0,4734623.story?track=rss |author=Thomas H.

===Shell cups===
[[File:Spiro s.e.c.c. tattooed figure HRoe 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Engraved conch shell cup from [[Spiro Mounds]]]]
In historic accounts from the 16th and 17th century, the black drink is usually imbibed in rituals using a cup made of marine shell. Three main species of marine shells have been identified as being used as cups for the black drink, [[lightning whelk]], emperor helmet, and the [[Pleuroploca gigantea|horse conch]]. The most common was the lightning whelk, which has a left-handed or sinistral spiral. The left-handed spiral may have held religious significance because of its association with dance and ritual.  The center columnella, which runs longitudinally down the shell, would be removed, and the rough edges sanded down to make a dipper-like cup. The columnella would then be used as a pendant, a motif that shows up frequently in [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] designs. In the archaeological record columnella pendants are usually found in conjunction with bi-lobed arrows, stone maces, [[earspool]]s, and necklace beads(all of which are motifs identified with the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player]]'' mythological figure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F. Kent Reilly and James Garber  |  title = Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | year = 2004 | pages = 86–96 |  isbn = 978-0-292-71347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts made from these marine shells have been found as far north as [[Wisconsin]] and as far west as [[Oklahoma]]. Several examples of cups from [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] have been found to have rings of black residue in the bottoms, suggesting they were used for black drink rituals. Many examples of shell cups found in Mississippian culture mounds are engraved with [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|S.E.C.C.]] imagery. A few examples portray what is theorized to be black drink rituals, including what some anthropologists have interpreted as vomit issuing from the mouths of mythological beings.&lt;ref name=HUDSONBLACK/&gt;{{Clear}}

===Archaeological evidence for use in pre-Hispanic US Southwest and Mexican Northwest===
Pottery samples recovered from sites in modern [[Southwestern United States]] and Northwestern Mexico have tested positive for the ratio of [[Xanthine|methylxanthines]] associated with those produced by ''Ilex vomitoria''. The same study also identified methylxanthines ratios associated with ''[[Theobroma cacao]]''. Neither plants are native to the areas from which the pottery samples were recovered, which suggests trading between areas where those plants are native. The chemical analysis also suggests a possible increase in drinks prepared from cacao after the year 1200, and a decrease in the use of drinks prepared from ''Ilex vomitoria''. Freshwater shells from Texas and Arkansas have been recovered from [[Pueblo Bonito]], which have been used as possible evidence for the trade of ''Ilex vomitoria'' from the east. There are also some stands of ''Ilex vomitoria'' in [[Mesoamerica]], so the exact origins of the ''Ilex vomitoria'' used to prepare the drinks is currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crown|first= Patricia|last2= |first2= |date= 2015|title= Ritual drinks in the pre-Hispanic US Southwest and Mexican Northwest|url= http://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/11436.full|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|publisher= HighWire Press|volume= 112|issue= 37|pages= 11436–11442|doi= 10.1073/pnas.1511799112 |access-date=22 March 2016 |pmid=26372965 |pmc=4577151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
A number of tribes across the Southeastern United States use a form of the black drink in their ceremonies. [[Muscogee Creeks]], [[Cherokee]]s, [[Choctaw]]s, [[Ais people|Ais]], [[Guale]], [[Chickasaw]]s, [[Chitimacha]], [[Timucua]] and others are documented users of a type of black drink. Although rituals vary amongst the different tribes, there are some common traits among them. Black drink is most commonly drunk by men, who also prepare it, but there are some accounts of its preparation and use by women among some groups. Removal of tribes to areas outside the natural range of ''Ilex vomitoria'' has been partially responsible for a decline in the preparation of the black drink among present Native Americans.

===Ais===
In 1696, [[Jonathan Dickinson]] witnessed the use of a beverage brewed from the [[Yaupon Holly]] among the [[Ais (tribe)|Ais]] of [[Florida]]. Dickinson later learned that the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] called the plant ''casseena''. The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred to a large bowl using a [[gourd]] that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson|first= Charles M.|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher= University of Georgia Press|pages= 45–46|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cherokee===
[[Cherokee]] black drink is taken for purification at several traditional ceremonies. Made with [[emetics]], the complete recipe is not shared with the public. The black drink induces vomiting for purification purposes. Other ritual medicinal beverages are also used in the ceremonies. ''Ilex vomitoria'' was not native to the traditional area controlled by the Cherokee before removal, but it was brought in to the area through trade and then transplanted.

===Muscogean peoples===
Among the [[Muscogee people|Muscogee]] the black drink is called ''ássi''.  In the ceremonies of some cultures that use the drink, after its preparation it is passed out to the highest-status person first, then the next highest status, and so forth. During each person's turn to drink, ritual songs may be sung ''Yahola''. Its use was traditionally limited to only adult men.&lt;ref name=HUDSONDRINK&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Charles M.

===Timucua===
[[File:Black drink.jpg|thumb|right|300px|16th-century engraving by [[Jacques le Moyne]] of a [[Timucua]] ceremony involving the black drink]]
Among the [[Timucua]], a type of black drink was called ''cacina'' by the Spanish. The preparation and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the ''cacina''. In 1678 a bedridden ''cacica'' (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume ''cacina'' in her house, on the condition that no one else could be present while she did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=John H.|title=A History of the Timucua Indians and Missions|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1424-7|pages=2, 26, 90–91, 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cassina or yaupon tea==
After European contact with tribes in what is today the Southeastern United States, colonists began using the charred leaves of the yaupon holly to make a tea similar to the black drink, but without the ritual vomiting of it. Its use by colonists in [[Spanish Florida]] is documented as far back as 1615. An account from that year describes Spaniards as experiencing symptoms that would now be described as caffeine dependence due to daily consumption of what they called ''cacina'' or ''té del indio''. The use of ''Ilex vomitoria'' by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early eighteenth century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. It was commonly believed to be and used as a [[diuretic]]. By the late 1700s, yaupon tea was described as being more commonly used in North Carolina at breakfast than tea made with ''[[Camellia sinensis]]''. In addition to using it on their own, Spanish and British colonist often drank black drink when engaging in discussions and treaties with Natives. Its preparation by British and Spanish colonists was nearly identical to the method of preparation used by their Native neighbors. Its use by colonists in [[French Louisiana]] is speculated to have occurred, but lacks documentation other than one source describing its medicinal uses from 1716.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson|first= Charles M.|date= 1979|title= Black Drink: A Native American Tea|url= |location= |publisher= University of Georgia Press|pages= 6–7, 150–155|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War, yaupon tea was used as a substitute for coffee and tea throughout the South. Yaupon continued to be used in North Carolina for medicinal purposes and as a common drink until the late 1890s. At that point, its use was stigmatized because of its natural abundance as being a habit associated with rural poor people. By 1928 it was described as only being in common use by on [[Knotts Island, North Carolina]]. During the [[Interwar period]] the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] investigated the use of cassina tea as a substitute for coffee and tea. There were also a few attempts at the commercialization of cassina tea during that same period. By 1973 it was believed that cassina tea was only being served at the Pony Island Restaurant on [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke Island, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the early 2000s yaupon tea began witnessing a resurgence in its popularity, and can now be purchased online and at several historical sites related to Native Americans.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/04/429071993/heres-the-buzz-on-americas-forgotten-native-tea-plant | title= Here's The Buzz On America's Forgotten Native 'Tea' Plant| author = Murray Carpenter | date = 4 August 2015 | newspaper = The Salt |  accessdate=  31 May 2018  |publisher= National Public Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Kenneth Beausoleil''' (born November 6, 1947), better known as '''Bobby Beausoleil''', is an American musician and multidiscipline artist&lt;ref&gt;https://bbreferencearchive.tumblr.com/post/156811353900/its-psychedelic-baby-magazine-interview-with&lt;/ref&gt; serving a life sentence in the [[California state prison system]] for the murder of music teacher and [[Manson Family]] friend [[Gary Hinman]] on July 27, 1969, a crime that also involved [[Charles Manson]] and several members of his commune.&lt;ref&gt;https://bbreferencearchive.tumblr.com/post/155497536835/2016-parole-hearing-transcript&lt;/ref&gt; Beausoleil has continued to be a professional musician as well as developing into a visual artist and creative media technologist during the years of his incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;https://bbreferencearchive.tumblr.com/post/162482353520/robert-beausoleil-resumé&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;|http://bobbybeausoleil.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Beausoleil was born on November 6, 1947, in [[Santa Barbara, California]] to a working-class family. Beausoleil's father was a milkman. Beausoleil was a good-looking and rebellious youth. By 15, he was sent to reform school. After reform school, he drifted between [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]]. Beausoleil was involved in music and acting. He joined several rock bands in 1966, including The Milky Way and [[Love (band)|Love]]. In the following year he met [[Kenneth Anger]], and had a part in Anger's film ''[[Lucifer Rising (film)|Lucifer Rising]]''. In 1969, Beausoleil was living with Gary Hinman when Beausoleil began associating with Charles Manson and his cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/bobby-beausoleil-20902783#the-manson-family |title=Bobby Beausoleil |website=www.biography.com |publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks]] |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Gary Hinman==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
As described in the book ''[[Helter Skelter (book)|Helter Skelter]]'' by Manson prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]], Gary Hinman was killed over money and property that Manson claimed Hinman owed to the Family. It was also intended to serve as the first of a series of murders committed by the Family to start "[[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|Helter Skelter]]", a "war" that Manson had preached to his Family would happen in the summer of 1969. Accompanying Beausoleil that night were [[Susan Atkins]] and [[Mary Brunner]], both of whom were later involved in other murders and crimes as well.

More than a decade later, Beausoleil said that Hinman had supplied him with a batch of bad [[mescaline]] that Beausoleil in turn had sold to the [[Straight Satans]] [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]].  When the bikers demanded their money back, Manson ordered Beausoleil to Hinman's residence to get the money. Hinman is said to have refused to pay, saying "I don't have any money to give you." Beausoleil called Manson back at [[Spahn Ranch]] to tell him that no money was forthcoming. Beausoleil, Atkins and Brunner then held him captive in his own home to convince him to refund the money.

Manson arrived and proceeded to slice off a part of Hinman's ear with a sword. Atkins and Brunner stitched it up with dental floss afterwards. Manson then ordered Beausoleil to kill Hinman and told him to make it look as if the crime had been committed by black revolutionaries, as he had been predicting to his Family that a race war was imminent. Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death as Hinman chanted a Buddhist chant. Afterwards, he wrote the words "Political piggy" on a wall in Hinman's blood in an attempt to lead police to believe the murder was done by a group of [[Political radicalism|radicals]]. After he wrote the words, Beausoleil dipped his hand in Hinman's blood and left a paw print, symbolizing [[The Black Panthers]], in order to mislead the investigators of Hinman's murder. Beausoleil was subsequently arrested on August 6, 1969&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cielodrive.com/bobby-beausoleil-arrest-report-08-06-69.php "Bobby Beausoleil Arrest Report "]. ''Cielodrive.com''. Retrieved October 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, after falling asleep in Hinman's broken down [[Fiat]] alongside the highway at Cuesta Grade, a steep segment of [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] between [[San Luis Obispo]] and [[Atascadero]].

At Beausoleil's two trials for the murder, the defense mentioned nothing about the murder being the result of a drug transaction gone wrong. His first revelation of this came in 1981, 12 years after the murders, in an interview published in [[Oui (magazine)|''Oui'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="Jailhouse Interview: Bobby Beausoleil and the Manson Murders"&gt;{{cite news|journal=Oui Magazine|date=November 1981|title=Jailhouse Interview: Bobby Beausoleil and the Manson Murders|author=A. L. Bardach|url=http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/oa_19811100.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that interview, he also denied that Manson had come to the Hinman residence during the event that led to the murder, although he later reversed himself about that aspect. This{{which|date=August 2015}} is the version that Beausoleil currently maintains as truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/bobbybeausoleilmusic/blog/245354250 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203223339/http://www.myspace.com/bobbybeausoleilmusic/blog/245354250 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-03 |title=Bobby BeauSoleil Interview with Seconds, 1998 |work=Seconds Magazine |year=1998 |publisher=Bobby Beausoleil MySpace page |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, conspirator Susan Atkins had stated before her death that she never heard any mention by Beausoleil indicating that the reason they went to Hinman's residence had anything to do with a drug transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansonfamilytoday.info/atkins-1985-parole-hearing-transcript.htm|title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 10, 2007|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910203558/http://www.mansonfamilytoday.info/atkins-1985-parole-hearing-transcript.htm|archivedate=September 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)]] for more details on the murders perpetrated by Charles Manson and members of his Family.

==Imprisonment==
On April 18, 1970, a Superior Court jury in Los Angeles found Beausoleil, aged 22, guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. His sentence was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]] when the [[California]] Supreme Court ruled the then-prevailing [[death penalty]] statutes unconstitutional in 1972.

Beausoleil began serving his sentence on June 23, 1970. He was incarcerated in Oregon between May 1994 and August 2015. He is currently housed at California Medical Facility in [[Vacaville, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/ |title=State of California Inmate Locator (CDCR number B28302) |publisher=[[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] |accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beausoleil's initial parole suitability hearing was held on August 15, 1978. He has had 18 subsequent suitability hearings and has been denied at each one. Beausoleil's 2010 parole was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lindsay William-Ross |url=http://laist.com/2010/12/14/manson_follower_denied_parole_cant.php |title=Manson Follower Denied Parole, Can't Ask Again for 5 Years |publisher=LAist |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109223358/http://laist.com/2010/12/14/manson_follower_denied_parole_cant.php |archivedate=2016-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs2.com/local/Manson.parole.Robert.2.893254.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225210436/http://cbs2.com/local/Manson.parole.Robert.2.893254.html |date=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 2016, California parole authorities announced that Beausoleil's 2016 bid was also denied. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-manson-follower-parole-denied-20161014-snap-story.html |title=Manson follower denied parole for 1969 murder of musician |publisher=LA Times |date=2016-10-14 |accessdate=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film roles==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
Beausoleil was to star in [[Kenneth Anger]]'s film ''[[Lucifer Rising (film)|Lucifer Rising]]'', but little was shot before Beausoleil and Anger had a falling out and the project was abandoned. Some of the footage later appeared in ''[[Invocation of My Demon Brother]]'' (and again in the resurrected ''Lucifer Rising'' film). He appeared in a [[softcore porn]] film titled ''The Ramrodder'' (a.k.a. ''Savage Passion''), which also featured his friend [[Catherine Share]], who went on to become a full-fledged member of the Manson Family. This film was shot, in part, at the infamous [[Spahn Ranch]]. 

Beausoleil had a brief appearance as [[Cupid]] in the 1967 film ''[[Mondo Hollywood]]'', a documentary about the social, political and cultural climate of Los Angeles featuring a wide cast of Hollywood figures, including hair stylist [[Jay Sebring]], who was also murdered by the Family.

==Music career==
{{moresources|section|date=March 2017}}
Around 1965, Beausoleil was a member of [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]]'s band the Grass Roots, not to be confused with the successful recording artists of the same name. To avoid confusion, the band later changed its name to [[Love (band)|Love]]. Lee claimed to have bestowed the nickname "Bummer Bob" on Beausoleil due to a drug burn. Beausoleil claims that Lee named his band Love in reference to another of his many nicknames{{snd}} "[[Cupid]]". Around 1966, Beausoleil joined a band called The [[Orkustra]]; bandmate [[David LaFlamme]] went on to greater success with [[It's a Beautiful Day]]. Following his stint in The Orkustra, Beausoleil put together the band he called The Magick Powerhouse of Oz.

In the late 1970s, with the permission of the prison, he composed and recorded the [[soundtrack]] for [[Kenneth Anger]]'s film ''Lucifer Rising''. The official Beausoleil soundtrack was released on CD (along with archival material from The Orkustra and The Magick Powerhouse of Oz) in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bobbybeausoleil.com/the-lucifer-rising-suite-a-journey-out-of-darkness.html&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded and released two albums of instrumental material (''Orb'' and ''Mantra'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bobbybeausoleil.com/orb.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bobbybeausoleil.com/mantra.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a selection of his artwork was exhibited in [[Clair Obscur Gallery]], Los Angeles. Just before the exhibition, the gallery exhibited photos of [[Sharon Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clairobscurgallery.com/gallery_sharontate.htm|title=Archived copy|accessdate=September 25, 2007|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925042932/http://www.clairobscurgallery.com/gallery_sharontate.htm|archivedate=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parole board, in denying parole in 2005, stated that this display and marketing of Beausoleil's artwork was exploitative of the victims and showed a lapse of judgment by Beausoleil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansonfamilytoday.info/beausoleil-2005-parole-hearing-transcript-2.htm 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310050550/http://www.mansonfamilytoday.info/beausoleil-2005-parole-hearing-transcript-2.htm|date=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''The Lucifer Rising Suite'' was rereleased for the last time on LP.  This anthology documents the entire ''Lucifer Rising'' soundtrack project from its earliest beginnings in 1967 to its ultimate completion and delivery to the filmmaker in 1979. In addition to the actual soundtrack, alternate themes, musical and soundscape experiments, and some live performances are contained in the boxed set. All of those recordings were acquired from the original reel-to-reel tapes and meticulously restorceed and mastered for vinyl by Robert Ferbrache. In 2014, a CD version of the boxed set was released. This album package has all of the features of the LP version scaled down to compact disc size.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theajnaoffensive.com/products/bobby-beausoleil-1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a compilation titled ''Whispers Through The Black Veil'' was released on the Wyrd War label containing the song "The Wailing On Witch Mountain," recorded in 2012, which was composed, performed and recorded by Beausoleil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Whispers-Through-The-Black-Veil/release/6456563|title=Whispers Through The Black Veil|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 with [[The Ajna Offensive]], Bobby Beausoleil released his 2-disk concept album, ''Voodooo Shivaya'', featuring vocal and instrumental tracks that showcase his journey to spiritual understanding. Among the vocal tracks performed by BeauSoleil are both covers and original songs. Guest performances include Annabel Lee Moynihan, [[Michael Moynihan (author)|Michael Moynihan]], Robert Ferbrache, (who are all also in [[Blood Axis]]) and Mike Behrenhausen. The triple gatefold LP and CD packaging integrates Nicholas Syracuse's photography with calligraphy by Timo Ketola. This album was recorded at Oregon State Penitentiary between 2008 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://pleasekillme.com/bobby-beausoleils-ghost-highway/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theajnaoffensive.com/products/bobby-beausoleil-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bobby Beausoleil in literature==
[[Truman Capote]] interviewed Beausoleil while the latter was imprisoned in [[San Quentin State Prison]]. Capote then published the interview in the form of a short story "Then It All Came Down," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bardach Reports|journal=Oui Magazine|date=November 1981|title=Jailhouse Interview: Bobby Beausoleil|author=A.L.

[[Image:VairochanaMingCopper.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vairocana]] as described in the ''Brahmajala Sutra'']]
The '''''{{IAST|Brahmajāla Sūtra}}''''' ({{CJKV|t=梵網經|p=Fànwǎng jīng|r=Bonmōkyō}}), also called the '''''Brahma's Net Sutra''''', is a [[Mahayana]] Buddhist [[Vinaya]] [[Sutra]].  The Chinese translation can be found in the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]].&lt;ref&gt;Taisho 1484 is found in Volume 24 of the Taisho Tripitaka.{{cite web |url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=T |website=CBETA 漢文大藏經 |script-title=大正新脩大藏經 |title=Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō |language=Chinese |trans-title=Taishō Shinshū Tripitaka |quote=This is an index to the Taisho Tripitaka - nb Volume 24 is listed as the last volume in the 律部 or Vinaya Section.

It is known alternatively as the '''''{{IAST|Brahmajāla Bodhisattva Śīla Sūtra}}''''' ({{CJKV|t=梵網菩薩戒經 |p=Fàn Wǎng Púsà Jiè Jīng}}).

The ''Brahmajāla Sūtra'' is related to the important [[Huayan]] metaphor of [[Indra's net]].

It is not related to the ''[[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]'' of the [[Pāli Canon]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]].

==History==
The sutra is traditionally regarded as having been recorded in Sanskrit and then translated into Chinese by [[Kumārajīva]] in 406. Several scholars assume that it was composed in East Asia by unknown authors in the mid-5th century, and is [[Buddhist apocrypha|apocryphal]].&lt;ref name="eob"&gt;Cho, Eunsu.

Therefore the possibility for the Brahmajala Sutra to be an apocryphal sutra is very low.) |page=5,18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
This sutra introduces [[Vairocana]] and his relationship to [[Gautama Buddha]]. It also states [[Bodhisattva Precepts#Brahma Net Sutra|ten major precepts for Bodhisattvas]] ({{CJKV|c=十重戒}}) and the 48 minor precepts to follow to advance along the bodhisattva path.

The bodhisattva precepts of the ''Brahmajala Sutra'' came to be treated in China as a higher ethic a monastic would adopt after ordination in addition to the [[prātimokṣa]] vows. In Japan, the ten precepts came to displace monastic rules almost completely starting with [[Saichō]] and the rise of the [[Tendai]].&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (2008). "Fang wang ching", in A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|0192800620}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the sutra derives from the vast net that the god [[Brahma]] hangs in his palace and how each jewel in the net reflects the light of every other jewel:
{{quote| At that time, he [Shakyamuni Buddha] contemplated the wonderful Jewel Net hung in Lord Brahma's palace and preached the Brahmajala Sutta for the Great Assembly. He said: "The innumerable worlds in the cosmos are like the eyes of the net. Each and every world is different, its variety infinite. So too are the Dharma Doors (methods of cultivation) taught by the Buddhas.&lt;ref name="online_sutra"&gt;Sutra Translation Committee of the US and Canada (2000).

The sutra is also noteworthy for describing who Vairocana is as personification of the [[dharma]] or [[Dharmakāya]]:&lt;ref name="online_sutra"/&gt;
{{quote| Now, I, Vairocana Buddha, am sitting atop a lotus pedestal; on a thousand flowers surrounding me are a thousand Sakyamuni Buddhas. Each flower supports a hundred million worlds; in each world a Sakyamuni Buddha appears. All are seated beneath a Bodhi-tree, all simultaneously attain Buddhahood. All these innumerable Buddhas have Vairocana as their original body.&lt;ref name="online_sutra"&gt;Sutra Translation Committee of the US and Canada (2000). [https://web.archive.org/web/20140106041847/http://www.ymba.org/books/brahma-net-sutra-moral-code-bodhisattva The Brahma Net Sutra], New York&lt;/ref&gt;}}
==Bodhisattva Precepts==

The ''Brahmajala Sutra'' has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor rules known as the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism (bodhisattvaśīla)|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the "Brahma Net Precepts" ({{zh|c=梵網戒|p=Fànwǎng Jiè}}), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the 10 Major Precepts are considered the Bodhisattva Precepts. According to the sutra, the 10 Major Bodhisattva Precepts are in summary:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanh |first=Minh |title=The Brahma Net Sutra |year=2000 |url=http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |publisher=New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151922/http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Not to kill or encourage others to kill.
# Not to steal or encourage others to steal.
# Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely.
# Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so.
# Not to broadcast the misdeeds or faults of the Buddhist assembly, nor encourage others to do so.
# Not to praise oneself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to be stingy, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry.
# Not to speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha (lit. the Triple Jewel) or encourage others to do so.

Breaking any of these precepts is described as a prarajika (Skt. Unforgivable) offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ymba.org/books/brahma-net-sutra-moral-code-bodhisattva/brahma-net-sutra/major-precepts |website=Young Men Buddhist Association of America |translator-last1=Thanh |translator-first1=Minh |translator-last2=Leigh |translator-first2=P.D. |title=Brahma Net Sutra:Moral Code of the Bodhisattva |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is led by an International Council, which operates in the Philippines under the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] and can report directly to the Vatican. The community is made up of family ministries, social arms, and a pro-life ministry.

==History==
Couples for Christ (CFC) was established in 1981 by the charismatic community Ang Ligaya ng Panginoon (LNP; [[Filipino language|Filipino]] for "The Joy of the Lord") in [[Manila]]. Its target groups were married couples. The organisation would invite prospective couples to a private home for a series of weekly gospel discussions.

Since 1993, CFC has also started other groups, including "Kids for Christ", "Youth for Christ, "Singles for Christ", "Handmaids of the Lord" and "Servants of the Lord".

In 1996, CFC was approved by the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] as a National Private Association of Lay Faithful and in 2000, was recognized by the Holy See (Vatican) as a private [[Directory of International Associations of the Faithful|international association of the lay faithful]] of [[Pontifical right|Pontifical Right]].

CFC claims to have a presence in dioceses across all 81 Philippine provinces and 163 countries. It sent participants to the [[Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Extraordinary Synod on the Family]], an event organized by [[Pope Francis]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/synod-the-church-assembles-for-the-family|title=Synod: The Church assembles for the family|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=42919|title=Campos couple brings CFC to the Synod|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any validly married Catholic couple can become members of CFC. Although a Catholic movement/organization, CFC remains open to having non-Catholic Christians as members.

===Christian Life Program===

Those who want to join CFC will have to go through a weekly seminar series called the Christian Life Program (CLP), which usually spans 13 weeks or sessions. The CLP serves as the primary Evangelization approach, a core activity of CFC members.

At the end of the CLP, couple-participants are invited to dedicate themselves to the Lord as CFC members and to commit to participating actively in the life of the community and of the Church through regular prayer meetings, attendance in community assemblies and teachings, participation in parish life.

CLP graduates are then grouped into cell groups called "households," consisting of at least 4 and up to 7 couples under the pastoral care supervision of a family head.

The CLP is also the point of entry for those who wish to join CFC's Family Ministries:
* Singles for Christ, for single young professionals
* Handmaids of the Lord and Servants of the Lord, for women and men who are widowed, single parents or those whose spouses choose not to join
* Youth for Christ (for teenagers) and Kids for Christ (for pre-teens) through attendance in a regular camp or similar activity.

===Household Groups===

The household groups or simply 'households' meet once a week or bi-weekly. Each member of the household is encouraged to host meetings at their home, when not held in Church meeting spaces. A household group operates as a 'family of families'.

==Divisions==

Over the course of CFC's existence, there has been some restructuring and changes of leadership, and occasionally, divisions.  Despite these, the members at large are mostly unaffected, and the respective communities continue to flourish.

===CFC and FFL===

In 1993, a group led by Francisco Padilla{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, one of the original members recruited by LNP in 1981, severed CFC's ties from LNP citing differences in evangelization approaches.  Padilla was CFC's Executive Director until 2007.

In August 2007, the same group of leaders{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} announced the creation of a separate group known as [[Foundation for Family and Life|Couples for Christ Foundation for Family and Life]] (CFC-FFL). This development, particularly since it was a direct offshoot of the bi-annual CFC elections that saw Frank Padilla and his group defeated{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, caused a division of membership within CFC{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, as some of its membership migrated to Foundation for Family and Life (FFL).
FFL applied and was granted approval by SEC to use a defunct CFC foundation created in the 1980s, the Couples for Christ Foundation, Inc.  The group continues to use the name, despite a Vatican admonition that "no other group may use Couples for Christ" in their name other than Couples For Christ Global Mission's Foundation, Inc.

CFC leaders have stated that they are open to reconciliation with FFL, but do not expect a quick resolution, particularly since Padilla, current FFL Servant-General, continues to insist that only FFL is recognized by the Vatican. He bases this assertion on a statement issued by one official of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines who stated that “in the dioceses in the Philippines there can be two groups of the CFC provided again the bishop of the place will permit. Abroad, FFL may not use CFC in their names."  The Vatican has not revoked the recognition given to CFC, evidence cited by CFC that indeed it is the Vatican-recognized CFC.

Padilla's claim to be the founder of CFC{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, which is supported by FFL, is questioned by CFC. CFC's publication Origins of Couples for Christ directly responds to this claim by including the point of view of Vic Gutierrez, a former LNP leader who was responsible for the conceptualization of CFC in 1981.

Although FFL has received support from some Philippine and foreign dioceses, CFC still retains its recognition as a Catholic ministry nationally in the Philippines and internationally. Many bishops have also declared recognition of CFC in their dioceses, including John J. Myers, Archbishop of Newark.

===CFC and Gawad Kalinga===

In 2009, CFC-Global found itself being split again into 2 groups, CFC-IC and [[Gawad Kalinga|CFC-Gawad Kalinga]]. This was triggered when the existing conflict between CFC and GK leaders resurfaced{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

==Evangelization Approaches==

===Christian Life Program Revised===

In 2014, an update of the Christian Life Program has been released to reflect that CFC is explicitly [[Catholicism|Catholic]], truly global, and devotedly [[Marian devotions|Marian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Life Program Manual, The Complete Handbook |url=http://cfcablaze.com/product/christian-life-programmanual/ |year=2014 |publisher=CFC Ablaze Communications |location=Quezon City, Philippines |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ANCOP===

ANCOP stands for Answering the Cry of the Poor. It is an umbrella program made for the purpose of consolidating CFC's efforts in 'Building the Church of the Poor,' essentially a social outreach undertaking. Shelter-building for the poor and child-education sponsorship are among its dominant sub-programs. Certain aspects affecting the society are also being addressed through the ANCOP program, such as health, education, livelihood and community development activities.

As a social outreach program, ANCOP also involves sectors such as migrants and their families, uniformed personnel, those in prison, and environment stakeholders. Through ANCOP, sub-organizations like cooperatives and mini-programs like The Cornerstone have materialized.

===Ablaze Communications===

ABLAZE Communications, or simply "ABLAZE" is registered as a subsidiary of Couples for Christ. It is involved in the production of audio-visual presentations and merchandizing of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couplesforchristglobal.org/ablaze.aspx|title=Ablaze Communications|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:JoaoIVPortugal.jpg|500px|thumb|right|King John IV of Portugal, the first Braganza to reign.]]
'''The Curse of the Braganzas''' (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''a Maldição dos Braganças'') is a [[myth]], referred to in several historical chronicles, concerning the '''[[House of Braganza]]''', that ruled the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] (1640–1910), the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (1815–1822) and the [[Empire of Brazil]] (1822–1889) and, therefore, all the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Overseas Empire]].

This "curse" began in the reign of king [[John IV of Portugal]], in the [[17th century]], when the monarch allegedly kicked a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] [[friar]] who was begging for [[Alms]]. In reply, the friar cast a curse, saying that never again would a first-born male of his family live long enough to reach the throne. Since then&amp;mdash;with three exceptions&amp;mdash;all the first-born males of this dynasty died before they reigned.

With the end of the Braganzas' reigns, firstly in Brazil (1889) and later in Portugal (1910), the curse appears to have ended.

==Alleged victims==
===In Portugal===
*[[Teodósio, Prince of Brazil|Theodosius]] (1634–1653) - King John IV first-born child, died 3 years before his father and it was his younger brother, [[Afonso VI of Portugal|Afonso VI]] who succeeded in the throne;
*[[João, Prince of Brazil|John]] (1688–1688) – King [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter II]] first-born child, lived less than a year and it was his younger brother, [[John V of Portugal|John V]], who succeeded in the throne;
*[[Pedro, Prince of Brazil|Peter]] (1712–1714) – King [[John V of Portugal|John V]] first-born child, died when he was two and it was his younger brother, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] who succeeded in the throne. Joseph didn’t have any male issue and it was his daughter, [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]], who succeeded him;
*[[José, Prince of Brazil|Joseph]] (1761–1788) – Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] first-born child, died before his mother and it was his younger brother, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] who succeeded in the throne;
*[[Francisco António, Prince of Beira|Francis Anthony]] (1795–1801) – King [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] first-born child, he was 6 when he died and it was his young brother, [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Pedro IV]] who succeeded in the throne.
*[[Miguel, Prince of Beira|Michael]] (1820) - King [[Peter IV of Portugal|Peter IV]] first-born child, died at birth and it was his older sister, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] who succeeded in the Portuguese throne.
*[[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Louis Philip]] (1887–1908) – King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles I]] first-born child, murdered together with his father on 1 February 1908 and it was his younger brother [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]] who succeeded in the throne.

===In Brazil===
*[[Miguel, Prince of Beira|Michael]] (1820) – Emperor [[Peter I of Brazil|Peter I]] first-born child, died at birth and it was his younger brother, [[Peter II of Brazil|Peter II]] who succeeded in the Brazilian throne.
*[[Afonso, Prince Imperial of Brazil|Alphonse]] (1845–1847) – Emperor [[Peter II of Brazil|Peter II]] first-born child, died when he was two and it was his sister, [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Isabel]] who succeeded him as the Empire’s heir.

==Exceptions==
[[File:PedroV.JPG|200px|thumb|right|King Peter V of Portugal]]
===In Portugal===
*[[Peter V of Portugal|Peter V]] (1837–1861) - first-born child of Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]], was an exception; he became king in 1853, when he was sixteen. However, he died some years later, in 1861, when he was only twenty four, childless. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Louis I of Portugal|Louis I]];
*[[Charles I of Portugal|Charles I]] (1863–1908) - first-born child of King [[Louis I of Portugal|Louis I]], was the second exception; he became king in 1889 but was murdered in 1908 together with his older son. He was succeeded by his younger son [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], the last King of Portugal.

===In Brazil===
*[[Prince Pedro Augusto of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Pedro Augusto]], Prince of Brazil and of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1866–1934) - first-born child of Princess [[Leopoldina of Brazil|Leopoldina]], was also an exception; he was the heir apparent of the Imperial throne until 1875, when Leopoldina’s older sister (Princess Isabel) finally gave birth to an heir. In spite he’s consider an exception, the so-called "cursed prince" became psychological ill and tried suicide, dying single in a [[sanatorium]] in [[Vienna]].

==Curiosities==
*One century after this curse, king [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] and his consort [[Carlota Joaquina of Spain|Charlotte of Bourbon]], tried to revert it, visiting annually Franciscan monasteries first in [[Lisbon]] and later in [[Rio de Janeiro]].
[[File:ConventoSantoAntonio-CCBY.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''"Convento de Santo Antônio"'', in Rio de Janeiro.]]
*All the first-born children that died in Brazil due to the curse, were buried in ''“Convento de Santo Antônio”'', a Franciscan monastery in Rio de Janeiro.
*This curse also affected Pedro I of Brazil illegitimate children. It was the case of:
**''unknown name'', as stillborn with the [[Domitila de Castro, Marchioness of Santos|marchioness of  Santos]];
**Pedro, his first-born child with Noémi Thierry, died before he reached one year old;
**''unknown name'', a stillborn with the [[Uruguay]]an María del Carmen García.
*In spite this curse refers only to male descendants, some Portuguese infantas and Brazilian princesses were also "victims". That’s the case of:
**[[Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira|Isabel Louise]] (1669–1690) - King Peter II first-born daughter (from the King’s first marriage), died single before his father;
**Louise Victoria (1874) – Princess Isabel first-born child, stillborn.

==Post-monarchy period==
===In Portugal===
*Concerning the descendants of king Charles I:&lt;ref&gt;assassinated together with his heir-apparent in 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
**his second son, king Manuel II died in 1932, childless, in exile;
**king Carlos’ allegedly natural daughter, [[Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Braganza]], also died of natural causes, with 88 years old.
*The line of succession passed, then, to [[Miguel I of Portugal|king Miguel]] descendants. His only son, [[Miguel II, Duke of Braganza|Miguel (II)]] had three sons:[[File:Pedro alcantara filho isabel.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará.]]
**[[Prince Miguel, Duke of Viseu|Miguel]] (abdicated and married to an American commoner);
**[[Prince Francis Joseph of Braganza|Francis Joseph]] (died childless before his father); and
**[[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Duarte Nuno]] who succeeded his father as Duke of Braganza.

===In Brazil===
*Concerning the descendants of Princess Isabel:
**her first-born son, [[Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará|Pedro de Alcântara]], abdicated his rights to make an unequal marriage;
**his brother, [[Prince Luís of Orléans-Braganza (1878–1920)|Luís]] became Imperial Prince but died before his mother in 1920;
**his oldest son, [[Prince Pedro Henrique of Orléans-Braganza|Prince Pedro Henrique]], became the Imperial heir, following Isabel’s death (1921);
*More recently, [[Prince Pedro Luiz of Orléans-Braganza|Prince Pedro Luíz]], Prince Antônio first born child&lt;ref&gt;fourth in the Brazilian line of succession&lt;/ref&gt; died in the crash of [[Air France Flight 447]], on 1 June 2009.&lt;ref name="typepad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpdhome.typepad.com/royalblognl_news_summary/2009/06/brazilian-prince-dies-in-air-france-air-crash.html|title=Brazilian prince dies in Air France air crash|website=gpdhome.typepad.com|accessdate=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy, object 72 Butlin 812-69 recto Lucifer.jpg|thumb|[[William Blake]]'s depiction of a scene featuring Lucifer from Canto XXXIV of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s [[Divine Comedy]]]]
[[File:Lucifer Liege Luc Viatour.jpg|alt=|thumb|''Lucifer ([[Le génie du mal]])'' by [[Guillaume Geefs]] ([[Liège Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Paul]], Liège, Belgium)]]

In mainstream [[Christianity]], the [[Devil]] (or [[Satan]]) is a [[fallen angel]] who [[War in Heaven|rebelled]] against [[God in Christianity|God]]. Satan was expelled from Heaven and sent to Earth. The devil is often identified as the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], whose persuasions led to the two corresponding Christian [[doctrine]]s: the [[Original Sin]] and its cure, the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redemption of Jesus Christ]]. He is also identified as the [[Satan#Book of Job|accuser of Job]], the [[Temptation of Christ|tempter of the Gospels]], [[Leviathan]] and the [[dragon]] in the [[Book of Revelation]].

==Christian teachings==
In Christianity, the title Satan (Hebrew: הַשָּׂטָן ''ha-Satan''), "the adversary", is a title of various entities, both divine&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Job|2:1|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human, who challenge the faith of humans in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. "Satan" later became the name of the personification of evil. Christian tradition and theology changed "Satan" from an accuser appointed by God to test men's faith to [[God]]'s godlike [[fallen angel|fallen opponent]]: "the devil", "[[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]]" in Arabic (the term used by Arab Christians and Muslims).

Traditionally, Christians have understood the devil to be the author of lies and promoter of [[evil]]. However, the devil can go no further than the word of [[Logos (Christianity)|Christ the Logos]] allows, resulting in [[Problem of evil#Christianity|the problem of evil]].

[[Liberal Christianity]] often views the devil metaphorically. This is true of some [[Christian fundamentalism|Conservative Christian]] groups too, such as the [[Christadelphians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_delp.htm|title=About the Christadelphians: 1848 to now|author=B.A. Robinson|series=Individual Christian denominations, from the ''Amish'' to ''The Way''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Blessed Hope]]. Much of the popular lore of the devil is not [[biblical]]; instead, it is a post-medieval Christian reading of the scriptures influenced by medieval and pre-medieval Christian popular mythology.

==Sources==
===Old Testament===

====The serpent (Genesis 3)====
In the view of many Christians, the devil's first appearance in the Old Testament is as the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The serpent tempts [[Adam and Eve]] into eating the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], which God had forbidden them to eat, thus causing their [[The Fall of Man|expulsion from the Garden]] and indirectly causing [[sin]] to enter the [[World (theology)|world]]. In God's rebuke to the serpent, he tells it "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel." ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:14-15}})

Christian scriptures are often interpreted to identify the serpent with the Devil. The [[deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Wisdom]] says, "But by the envy of the devil, death entered the world and they who are in his possession experience it." (Wisdom 2:24) Satan is implicitly identified, in the [[New Testament]], with the serpent in Eden, in [[Revelation]] 12:9: "This great dragon &amp;mdash; the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world &amp;mdash; was thrown down to the earth with all his angels."

==== Job's adversary (Job 1-2) ====
{{Main article|Book of Job}}

Christian teaching about the Satan ([[Hebrew]] {{lang|he|שָׂטָן}}, ''Adversary''), to whom God proposes his servant [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] is that he appears in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]] to challenge Job, with God's permission.  This is one of two Old Testament passages, along with [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 3, where Hebrew ''ha-Satan'' (the Adversary) becomes [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ho diabolos'' (the Slanderer) in the Greek [[Septuagint]] used by the early Christian church.{{end|Originally, only the epithet of "the satan" ("the adversary") was used to denote the character in the Hebrew deity's court that later became known as "the devil." (The term "satan" was also used to designate human enemies of the Hebrews that [[Yahweh]] raised against them.) The article was lost and this title became a proper name: '''Satan'''. There is no unambiguous reference to the devil in the [[Torah]], the Prophets, or the Writings.}}

====David's satan====
Christian teaching about the involvement of Satan in [[King David|David]]'s census varies, just as the pre-exilic account of 2 [[Samuel (Biblical figure)|Samuel]] and the later account of 1 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] present differing perspectives:
* {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|24:1}} And the anger of the LORD was again kindled against Israel, and stirred up David against them, saying: Go, number Israel and Judah.
* {{bibleref|1 Chronicles|21:1}} However, Satan rose up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.

====Zechariah 3====
Zechariah's vision of recently deceased [[Joshua the High Priest]] depicts a dispute in the heavenly throne room between Satan and the [[Angel of the Lord]] ({{bibleref2|Zechariah|3:1–2}}). Goulder (1998) views the vision as related to opposition from [[Sanballat the Horonite]].&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Goulder ''The Psalms of the return (book V, Psalms 107-150) 1998 p197 "The vision of Joshua and the Accuser in Zechariah 3 seems to be a reflection of such a crisis."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Isaiah's Lucifer (Isaiah 14) ====
{{Main article|Lucifer|Isaiah 14}}

Since the time of [[Origen]] and [[Jerome]],&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, "To Eustochium", Letter 22.4, To Eustochium&lt;/ref&gt; some Christian concepts of the devil have included the [[Lucifer#The Morning Star in Isaiah 14:12|Morning Star]] in Isaiah 14:12, which is translated Lucifer ("Morning Star" as a noun, "light-bringing" as an adjective)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=lucifer Lewis and Short: lūcĭfer]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]], and transferred directly from Latin into the [[King James Version]] as a name "Lucifer"{{efn|(analogous to the Greek, [[Phosphorus]]) and is also used symbolically to mean the "Morning Star", (i.e. Venus), which held some significant meanings{{what|date=November 2018}} for Babylonians as mentioned{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in Isaiah 14:12.}} When the [[Bible]] was translated into Latin (the Vulgate), the name Lucifer appeared as a translation of "Morning Star", or the planet [[Venus]], in [[Isaiah]] 14:12. Isaiah 14:1-23 is a passage concerned with the plight of [[Babylon]], and its king is referred, in sarcastic and hyperbolic language to as "morning star, son of the dawn". This is because the Babylonian king was considered to be of godly status and of symbolic divine parentage ([[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] and [[Ishtar]], associated with the planet Venus).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

While this information is available to scholars today via translated [[Babylon]]ian [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] text taken from clay tablets,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} it was not as readily available at the time of the Latin translation of the Bible. At some point{{when|date=November 2018}} the reference to "Lucifer" was interpreted as a reference to the moment Satan was thrown from [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]]. And despite the clarity of the chapter as a whole, the 12th verse continues to be put forth as proof that Lucifer was the name of Satan before the fall. Thus Lucifer became another name for Satan and has remained so, owing to popular tradition.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] word for the morning star, which was later translated to "Lucifer" in [[English language|English]], is הילל (transliterated HYLL), meaning "morning star".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H1966&amp;t=NIV Blue Letter Bible: Lexicon : Strong's H1966 - heylel]&lt;/ref&gt; Although this word, ''Heilel'', has come to be translated as "morning-star" from the Septuagint's translation of the Scriptures, the letter ה in Hebrew often indicates singularity, much as the English "the," in which case the translation would be ה "the" ילל "yell," or "the wailing yell."{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Later, for unknown reasons, [[Christian demonology|Christian demonologists]] appeared to designate "Satan", "Lucifer", and "[[Beelzebub]]" as different entities, each with a different rank in the demonic hierarchy. One hypothesis is that this might have been an attempt to establish a demonic trinity with the same person, akin to the Christian [[Trinity]] of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]], but most demonologists do not carry this view.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====Cherub in Eden (Ezekiel 28)====
{{main article|Ezekiel's cherub in Eden}}
The cherub in Eden is a figure mentioned in {{bibleref2|Ezekiel|28:13-14}}, identified with the King of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], specifically [[Ithobaal III]] (reigned 591–573 BCE) who according to [[Josephus]]' [[list of kings of Tyre]] was reigning contemporary with Ezekiel at the time of the first [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|fall of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Old Testament'', John F. Walvoord, Walter L. Baker, Roy B. Zuck - 1985. Ezekiel had prophesied against the whole city; he was now singling out the city's leader for a special word from God. This ruler then was [[Ithobaal III|Ethbaal III]], who ruled from 591-590 bc to 573-572 bc The underlying sin of Tyre's king was his ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel p. 249  Brandon Fredenburg - 2002 EZEKIEL 28 Indictment and Sentence against Tyre's Ruler (28:1-10) This oracle indicts (w. 2-5) and sentences (w. ... All that was true of the city-state has been concentrated into the description of the ruler of Tyre, Ethbaal III.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] has traditionally linked the reference to the fall of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Old Testament'', p. 1283 [[John F. Walvoord]], Walter L. Baker, Roy B. Zuck - 1985 "This "king" had appeared in the [[Garden of Eden]] (v. 13), had been a guardian [[cherub]] (v. 14a), had possessed free access ... The best explanation is that Ezekiel was describing Satan who was the true "king" of Tyre, the one motivating."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satan-traditional-arms.svg|thumb|175px|right|Arms of Satan - based on [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+16%3A13-14&amp;version=KJV Revelation 16:13-14]: "And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."]]

* '''The Devil''' (Greek ''ho diabolos''): Following the use in Job and Zechariah in the [[Septuagint]] this title, "the Accuser", is ascribed to Satan 32 times in the [[New Testament]]. The three other uses of the word are for humans - [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], and gossips.({{bibleverse||Revelation|12:9}}).
* '''Satan''' (Greek ''ho satanas''): {{bibleverse||Luke|10:18}} "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|right|The Devil depicted in ''The Temptation of Christ'', by [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]
{{Main article|Temptation of Christ}}

The devil figures much more prominently in the [[New Testament]] and in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]] than in the Old Testament and [[Judaism]]. The New Testament records numerous accounts of the devil working against God and his plan. The [[Temptation of Christ]] features the devil, and is described in all three [[synoptic gospel]]s, ({{bibleverse|Matthew|4:1-11|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|Mark|1:12-13|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse|Luke|4:1-13|NIV}}), although in Mark's gospel he is called Satan. In all three [[synoptic gospel]]s, ({{bibleverse||Matthew|9:22-29}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|3:22-30}}, and {{bibleverse||Luke|11:14-20}}), Jesus' critics accuse him of gaining his power to cast out demons from Beelzebub, the chief demon (often identified with Satan in mainstream Christendom). In response, Jesus says that a house divided against itself will fall, so, logically speaking, why would the devil allow one to defeat the devil's works with his own power?

The New Testament includes numerous instances of [[demonic possession]]. Satan himself is said to have entered [[Judas Iscariot]] [[The kiss of Judas|before Judas's betrayal]]. ({{bibleverse|Luke|22:3|NIV}}) Jesus encounters those who are possessed and casts out the evil spirit(s). A person may have one demon or multiple demons inhabiting their body. Jesus encountered a man filled with numerous demons in Mark 5:1-20.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessie Penn-Lewis]]'s ''War On The Saints'' (1912) includes dates and recorded examples of alleged demon possession in recent history: https://books.google.com/books?id=iF9LAwAAQBAJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acts and epistles====
The [[Epistle of Jude]] makes reference to an incident where the [[Archangel Michael]] argued with the devil over the body of [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Jude|1:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[First Epistle of Peter]], "Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Peter|5:8|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Revelation====
[[File:Codex Gigas devil.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the Devil in the ''[[Codex Gigas]]''.]]

According to most [[Christian eschatology]], Satan will wage a final war against [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], before being cast into Hell for ''aeonios''.{{efn|''Aeonios'', literally translated, means "of or pertaining to an age", which is incorrectly translated{{by whom|date=January 2017}} as "all eternity".}} A few early [[Church Fathers]] are known to have prayed for Satan's eventual repentance&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; but it was not generally believed that this would happen. On the other hand, [[Dispensationalism|Dispensationalists]] teach that Jesus returns to earth before the [[Great Tribulation]] to reclaim the righteous, dead and living, to meet him in the air (known as the [[Rapture]].&lt;ref&gt;see {{bibleverse|1|Thess|4:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Fundamentalists believe that immediately following this, the Tribulational period will occur as prophesied in the book of Daniel, while others (especially [[Seventh-day Adventists]]) believe that immediately following Jesus' Second Coming, Satan will be bound on this Earth for a thousand years, after which he will be "loosed for a little season"&lt;ref&gt;
a short time, see {{bibleverse||Rev|20:1-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&amp;ndash;this is when the battle of [[Armageddon]] (the final confrontation between good and evil) will be waged&amp;ndash;and Satan and his followers will be destroyed once and for all, the Earth will be cleansed of all evil and there will be "a new Heaven and a new Earth" where sin will reign no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rev|21:1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Devil and Woman on Horseback (CLXXXIXv).jpg|thumb|left|The Devil on horseback. ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493).]]

Particularly in the medieval period, Satan was often shown as having horns and a goat's hindquarters (though occasionally with the legs of a chicken or a mule), and with a tail. He was also depicted as carrying a [[pitchfork]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Clifford|title=Iconography of Hell|year=1992|publisher=Western Michigan University|location=Kalamazoo, MI|isbn=1-879288-02-8|page=25|quote=medieval devils' weapons...far exceed in variety the stereotypical pitchfork}}&lt;/ref&gt; the implement used in Hell to torment the damned, or a [[trident]], deriving from the regalia of the sea-god [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref name="Russell1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey Burton|authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell|title=The Devil: perceptions of evil from antiquity to primitive Christianity|year=1977|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=0-8014-9409-5|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally more imaginative depictions were illustrated: Sometimes the Devil was depicted as having faces all over his body, as in the painting of a [[Deal with the Devil]]. Depictions of the Devil covered in boils and scars, animal-like hair, and monstrous deformities were also common. None of these images seem to be based on biblical materials, as Satan's physical appearance is never described in the Bible or any other religious text. Rather, this image is apparently based on pagan [[Horned God]]s, such as [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[Cernunnos]], [[Molek]], [[Selene]] and [[Dionysus]], common to many [[pagan|pagan religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Barry B. Classical Myth. Second ed. With new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Pan in particular looks very much like the images of the medieval Satan. These images later became the basis for [[Baphomet]], which is portrayed in [[Eliphas Levi]]'s 1854 ''Dogme et rituel de la haute magie'' (English translation Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templarhistory.com/levi.html |title=Eliphas Lévi: The Man Behind Baphomet |publisher=Templarhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some Satanists use Baphomet as the image of Satan in Satanic worship. It has been alleged that this image was chosen specifically to discredit the [[Horned God]].&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, Henry A. ''Satan: A Biography''. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathars===
What is known of the [[Catharism|Cathars]] largely comes in what is preserved by the critics in the Catholic Church which later destroyed them in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. [[Alain de Lille]], c.1195, accused the Cathars of believing in two gods - one of light, one of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Costen ''The Cathars and the Albigensian Crusade'' p61&lt;/ref&gt; Durand de Huesca, responding to a Cathar tract c.1220 indicates that they regarded the physical world as the creation of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm D. Lambert ''The Cathars'' p162&lt;/ref&gt; A former Italian Cathar turned [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], Sacchoni in 1250 testified to the [[Inquisition]] that his former co-religionists believed that the devil made the world and everything in it.&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Peters ''The Monotheists: The peoples of God'' p175&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Reformation===
[[Martin Luther|Luther]] taught the traditional personal devil. Among his teachings was a recommendation of music since "the devil cannot stand gaiety."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland H. Bainton]] ''Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther" p377&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Norwich Cathedral cloister ceiling detail 9.jpg|thumb|The devil being fought by Christian using a gold sword, [[Norwich Cathedral]] cloisters ceiling detail.]]

[[John Calvin|Calvin]] taught the traditional view of the devil as a fallen angel. Calvin repeats the simile of [[Saint Augustine]]: "Man is like a horse, with either God or the devil as rider."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Thomas Henry Louis ''Calvin: an introduction to his thought'' 1995 Page 56&lt;/ref&gt; In interrogation of [[Servetus]] who had said that all creation was part of God, Calvin asked what of the devil? Servetus responded "all things are a part and portion of God".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cottret ''Calvin, a Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anabaptists and Dissenters===
[[David Joris]] was the first of the Anabaptists to venture that the devil was only an allegory (c.1540), his view found a small but persistent following in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;'"Man is a Devil to himself: David Joris and the rise of a sceptical tradition towards the Devil in the Early Modern Netherlands, 1540–1600', Nederlands Archief voor Kerkgeschiedenis, 75(1995):1–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The view was transmitted to England and Joris's booklet was reprinted anonymously in English in 1616, prefiguring a spate of non-literal devil interpretations in the 1640s-1660s: [[Joseph Mede|Mede]], [[Jacob Bauthumley|Bauthumley]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Lodowick Muggleton|Muggleton]] and the private writings of [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;Carus P. ''History of the Devil and the Idea of Evil''&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany such ideas surfaced later, c.1700, among writers such as [[Balthasar Bekker]] and [[Christian Thomasius]].

However the above views remained very much a minority. [[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''The Political History of the Devil'' (1726) describes such views as a form of "practical [[atheism]]". Defoe wrote "that to believe the existence of a God is a debt to nature, and to believe the existence of the Devil is a like debt to reason".

===John Milton in ''Paradise Lost''===
Until [[John Milton]] created the character of Satan for his ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', the different attributes of Satan were usually ascribed to different entities.  The angel who rebelled in Heaven was not the same as the ruler in Hell.  The ruler of Hell was often seen as a sort of jailer who never fell from grace. The tempting serpent of Genesis was just a serpent.  Milton combined the different parts of the character to show his fall from near-divine beauty and grace to his eventual skulking role as a jealous tempter.  He was so successful in his characterization of Satan as a romantic hero who "would rather rule in Hell than serve in Heaven" that his version of Satan has displaced all others.

===Rudolf Bultmann and modernists===
[[Rudolf Bultmann]] taught that Christians need to reject belief in a literal devil as part of first century culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bultmann, R., ''Theology of the New Testament, II'' (trans. K. Grobel; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  This line is developed by [[Walter Wink]].&lt;ref&gt;Wink, W. ''Naming the Powers'' 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this come the works of writers like [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], a believer in a literal personal fallen being of some kind. In ''Lucifer, the Devil in the Middle Ages'', the third volume of his five volume history of the devil,&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 ''The Existence of the Devil''.pp302-&lt;/ref&gt; Russell argues that such theologians [as Bultmann, unnamed] are missing that the devil is part and parcel of the New Testament from its origins.

==Modern Christian doctrines by denomination==

===Roman Catholic views===
[[File:GIORDANO, Luca fallen angels.jpg|thumb|[[Luca Giordano]]'s painting of [[Archangel Michael]] and [[Fallen angel|Fallen Angels]], [[Vienna]], 1666]]
A number of prayers and  practices against the devil exist within the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Geddes 2002, ''Christian Belief and Practice - The Roman Catholic Tradition'' Heinemann Publishers {{ISBN|0-435-30691-X}} page 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns and Oats, 2000, ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' {{ISBN|978-0-86012-327-9}} page 607&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord's Prayer]] includes a petition for being delivered from evil, but a number of other specific prayers also exist.

The [[Prayer to Saint Michael]] specifically asks for Catholics to be defended "against the wickedness and snares of the devil."
Given that some of the [[Our Lady of Fatima]] messages have been linked by the [[Holy See]] to the  "''end times''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatima.org/thirdsecret/ratzinger.asp |title=Cardinal Ratzinger's Interview on Fatima |publisher=Fatima.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; some Catholic authors have concluded that the angel referred to within the Fatima messages is St. Michael the Archangel who defeats the devil in the [[War in Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Petrisk, 1998, ''The Fatima Prophecies'', St. Andrews Press, {{ISBN|978-1-891903-30-4}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Petrisko 2001 ''Fatima's Third Secret Explained'' St. Andrews Press, {{ISBN|978-1-891903-26-7}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; Author Timothy Robertson takes the position that the [[Consecration of Russia]] was a step in the eventual defeat of Satan by the Archangel Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Robertson ''Fatima, Russia and Pope John Paul II'' ISBN page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of [[exorcism]] is used within the Catholic Church against the devil. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: "''Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and office of exorcizing''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm |title=Vatican Catechism |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church views the battle against the devil as ongoing. During a May 24, 1987 visit to the [[Sanctuary of Saint Michael the Archangel]], [[Pope John Paul II]] said:&lt;ref name="Ignatius Insight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features/framorth_excerpt1_aug04.asp |title=Ignatius Insight |publisher=Ignatius Insight |date=1987-05-24 |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The battle against the devil, which is the principal task of Saint Michael the archangel, is still being fought today, because the devil is still alive and active in the world. The evil that surrounds us today, the disorders that plague our society, man's inconsistency and brokenness, are not only the results of original sin, but also the result of Satan's pervasive and dark action."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pope Paul VI]] expressed concern about the influence of the devil and in 1972 stated that: "''Satan's smoke has made its way into the Temple of God through some crack''".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cuneo, 1999 ''The Smoke of Satan'' {{ISBN|0-8018-6265-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pope John Paul II viewed the defeat of Satan as inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19860820en.html |title=Vatican website: '&amp;#39;Christ's Victory Conquers Evil'&amp;#39; |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1986-08-20 |accessdate=2014-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019013220/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19860820en.html |archivedate=2014-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father [[Gabriele Amorth]], the chief [[exorcist]] of the [[Diocese of Rome]], warned about ignoring Satan, saying, "Whoever denies Satan also denies sin and no longer understands the actions of Christ".&lt;ref name="Ignatius Insight"/&gt;

The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' states that the Church regards the devil as being created as a good angel by God, and by his and his fellow fallen angels choice fell out of God's grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904224955/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206103358/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satan is not an infinitely powerful being. Although he was an angel, and thus pure spirit, he is considered a creature nonetheless. Satan's actions are permitted by divine providence. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM 395]&lt;ref name="vatican.va"/&gt;

===Eastern Orthodox===
In [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], Satan is one of humanity's three enemies, along with sin and death (in some other forms of [[Christianity]] the other two enemies of mankind are "the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jas|4:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and self (or the [[flesh]]), which is to be taken as man's natural tendency to [[sin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rom|6:6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical Protestants===
Evangelicals agree with the Protestant orthodox of theology that Satan is a real, created being given entirely over to evil and that evil is whatever opposes God or is not willed by God. Evangelicals emphasize the power and involvement of Satan in history in varying degrees; some virtually ignore Satan and others revel in speculation about spiritual warfare against that personal power of darkness.
&lt;ref&gt;''Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology'', 
Roger E. Olson, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican Church===
The literal existence of the Devil is referred to in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]].

===Unitarians and Christadelphians===
Some Christian groups and individuals view the devil in Christianity [[literal and figurative language|figuratively]]. They see the devil in the Bible as representing human sin and temptation, and any human system in opposition to God. Early Bible fundamentalist [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Dissenters]] like [[Nathaniel Lardner]], [[Richard Mead]], [[Hugh Farmer]], [[William Ashdowne]] and [[John Simpson (Unitarian)|John Simpson]], and [[John Epps]] taught that the miraculous healings of the Bible were real, but that the devil was an [[allegory]], and demons just the medical language of the day. Simpson in his ''Sermons'' (publ. posthumously 1816) went so far as to comment that the devil was "really not that bad", a view essentially echoed as recently as 2001 by Gregory Boyd in ''Satan and the Problem of Evil: Constructing a Trinitarian Warfare Theodicy''. Such views today are taught today by [[Christadelphians]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/devil.htm 'Do you believe in a devil?'] (CMPA)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Blessed Hope]].

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
{{See also|Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that [[Satan]] was originally a perfect [[angel]] who developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship that belonged to God. Satan persuaded Adam and Eve to obey him rather than God, raising the issue&amp;mdash;often referred to as a "controversy"&amp;mdash;of whether people, having been granted [[free will]], would obey God under both temptation and persecution. The issue is said to be whether God can rightfully claim to be sovereign of the universe.&lt;ref name="proclaimers144"&gt;{{cite book|title=Jehovah's Witnesses—Proclaimers of God's Kingdom|year=1993|publisher=[[Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society]]|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible Teach"&gt;{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|year=2005|page=32|publisher=Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of destroying Satan, God decided to test the loyalty of the rest of humankind and to prove to the rest of creation that Satan was a liar.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=24}}&lt;ref name="Watchtower 1973, page 724"&gt;"Declaration and resolution", ''[[The Watchtower]]'', December 1, 1973, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Satan is God's chief adversary&lt;ref name="Watchtower 1973, page 724"/&gt; and the invisible ruler of the world.&lt;ref name="proclaimers144"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible Teach"/&gt; They believe that demons were originally angels who rebelled against God and took Satan's side in the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=January 15, 2006|pages=7|title=Angels—How They Affect Us|publisher=Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Satan lives in [[Hell]] or that he has been given responsibility to punish the wicked. Satan and his demons are said to have been cast down from heaven to the earth in 1914, marking the beginning of the "[[End time#Jehovah's Witnesses|last days]]".&lt;ref name="proclaimers144"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|year=2005|publisher=Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|pages=87,216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses believe that Satan and his demons influence individuals, organizations and nations, and that they are the cause of human suffering. At Armageddon, Satan is to be bound for 1,000 years, and then given a brief opportunity to mislead perfect humanity before being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;“Be Vigilant”, ''The Watchtower'', 2009, 15 March, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter Day Saints===
{{See also|Latter Day Saint movement}}
In [[Mormonism]], the Devil is a real being, a literal [[Mormon cosmology#Spirit intelligences|spirit son]] of God who once had angelic authority, but rebelled and fell prior to the creation of the Earth in a [[Pre-existence#Mormonism|premortal life]]. At that time, he persuaded a third part of the spirit children of God to rebel with him.  This was in opposition to the [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] championed by [[God in Mormonism|Jehovah]] (Jesus Christ). Now the devil tries to persuade mankind into doing evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|76|24|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind can overcome this through faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/devil |title=Devil  |work= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] |publisher= [[LDS Church]] }} , [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Latter-day Saints traditionally regard [[Lucifer]] as the [[Mormon cosmology#Pre-mortality|pre-mortal]] name of the devil. [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon theology]] teaches that in a [[Mormon cosmology#Council in Heaven|heavenly council]], Lucifer rebelled against the plan of [[God in Mormonism|God the Father]] and was subsequently cast out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Lucifer|title=Devils – Encyclopedia of Mormonism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon scripture reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, and was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning! And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ—Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.25-29?lang=eng#p24|title=D&amp;C 76:25–29|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After becoming Satan by his fall, Lucifer "goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.27?lang=eng|title=D&amp;C 10:27|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons consider Isaiah 14:12 to be referring to both the king of the Babylonians and the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/lucifer?lang=eng|title=Lucifer - lds.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/14.12?lang=eng|title=Isaiah 14:12, footnote c|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unification Church===
The [[Unification Church]] teaches that Satan will be restored in the [[eschatology|last days]] and become a good angel again.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.tparents.org/library/unification/books/lcah/0-toc.htm Lucifer, A Criminal Against Humanity]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2011}}
Teachings about the Devil vary, depending on the local folklore. Still, the characteristics present in the Bible are present in most depictions.

===Rebel===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
According to the gospels of Matthew (chapter 4), Mark (chapter 1), and Luke (chapter 4), the devil tempted Jesus at the beginning of his ministry. After Jesus fasted forty days and forty nights in the wilderness, the devil approached Jesus with offers of stones turned to bread, rulership over the kingdoms of the Earth (but with subservience to the Devil himself), and spectacular protection from physical harm. Satan uses the Scripture of the Old Testament to solidify his arguments. This would indicate Satan's full knowledge of all of Scripture and a use of that knowledge to tempt and deceive man (Mat 4). Jesus refused all three temptations, rebuking Satan with his own knowledge of Scripture (Mat 4).

Christianity holds several different views on Christ's role in defeating Satan. Some emphasize Christ's death and resurrection as sealing Satan's fate, so that the devil is already defeated though not banished. Others emphasize the devil's final judgment when Christ returns, at which time the terror and deceit of Satan will have no more effect on the world. This is because mankind will face final judgment and the earth will be purged or cleansed with fire. Satan will be bound to the [[lake of fire]] (Rev 20) with the Beast, the false prophet and all those whose names are not in the [[Book of Life]].

===Possession===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
The devil and his demons are portrayed as able to possess and control humans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Roman Catholic Church]] occasionally performs [[exorcism]]s, usually only after medical and psychological evaluations have taken place to rule out a mental or physical ailment.

===Black magic===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{see also|Black magic}}
The Devil has been described as granting magical powers to sorcerers and [[witches]], usually in exchange for worship or souls. In [[Acts of the Apostles]] 16:16 [[Paul the Apostle]] meets 'a slave girl who had an evil spirit that enabled her to predict the future'. He performs an exorcism using the name of [[Jesus Christ]].

===Christian tradition===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Christian tradition differs from that of Christian demonology in that ''[[Satan]]'', ''[[Lucifer]]'', ''[[Samael]]'' and ''[[Beelzebub]]'' all are names that refer to "''the devil''", and ''Prince of this World'', ''The Beast'' and ''Dragon'' (and rarely ''Serpent'' or ''The Old Serpent'') used to be elliptic forms to refer to him. ''The Enemy'', ''The Evil One'' and ''The Tempter'' are other elliptic forms to name the Devil. ''[[Belial]]'' is held by many to be another name for the devil. Christian demonology, in contrast, does not have several nicknames for Satan.

The name ''[[Mephistopheles]]'' is used by some people to refer to the Devil, but it is a mere folkloric custom, and has nothing to do with Christian demonology and Christian tradition. ''Prince of Darkness'' and ''Lord of Darkness'' are also folkloric names, although they tend to be incorporated to Christian tradition.

In English, the devil has a number of [[epithet]]s, including Old Scratch and Old Nick.

==Theological disputes==
&lt;!-- Before deleting this section, please include actual reasons for deletion in the discussion page.  This section is not a dispute between two editors (which would be against the rules), but is about issues that commonly come up in theological discussions about the devil (which is as appropriate as discussing the differing interpretations of Finnegans Wake). --&gt;

===Hell===
The Bible states that Satan roams Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|1:6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also states that Satan appeared with other angels "before the Lord," presumably in heaven. When God asked Satan where he had been, Satan replied, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|1:7}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|5:8}} declares, "Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour". The only point in the Bible where Satan is in [[Christian views on hell|Hell]] is at the end of the [[Book of Revelation]], where he is thrown into Hell to face his eternal punishment along with [[The beast (Revelation)|the beast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|20:10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As demonstrated by Dante, Milton, and several other writings, the Devil is commonly thought to be in Hell.

===Sinfulness of angels===
Some theologians believe that angels cannot sin because sin brings death and angels cannot die,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realdevil.info/a1-5.htm |title=Angels As Ministering Spirits |publisher=Realdevil.info |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because they are spiritual beings that are completely aware of God's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raptureready.com/faq/faq373.html |title=Do angels have a sin nature? |publisher=Raptureready.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting the idea that an angel may sin, [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"An angel or any other rational creature considered in his own nature, can sin; and to whatever creature it belongs not to sin, such creature has it as a gift of grace, and not from the condition of nature. The reason of this is, because ''sinning is nothing else than a deviation from that rectitude which an act ought to have''; whether we speak of sin in nature, art, or morals. That act alone, the rule of which is the very virtue of the agent, can never fall short of rectitude. Were the craftsman's hand the rule itself engraving, he could not engrave the wood otherwise than rightly; but if the rightness of engraving be judged by another rule, then the engraving may be right or faulty." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Fontes Tamarici''', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Fuentes Tamáricas'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Tamaric Fountains'') are  three nearby [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] located by the geographer and Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder]] in [[cantabri|classical Cantabria]], and since the 18th century are being identified with the source of ''La Reana'' in [[Velilla del Río Carrión]] ([[province of Palencia|Palencia]]), [[Spain]]. The first news of the spring, by Pliny, dating from the time of the [[Cantabrian Wars|Roman conquest]] of [[Cantabria]], it has the peculiarity that water emanating from the earth, and its intermittence was considered [[omen]] at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Santa María la Real ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=vkvVGmldTVYC&amp;dq=fuentes+tam%C3%A1ricas+plinio+el+viejo&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Todo el románico de Palencia''] (2015). {{ISBN|8415072406}}, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is known that the tamarics [[cantabri]] was who inhabited the area from the 3rd century BC. They worshiped waters and the sacred springs. It is not known the exact year of its construction, but it is clear that when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered [[Cantabria]] (year 19 BC), they found these sources that drew wide attention. The outbreak irregular emptying its waters and unexpected, accompanied by the noise that precedes underground filling, had to be at that time matter of respect and adoration. Possibly they were used as [[Thermae|baths]], [[laundry]] and [[omen]].&lt;ref&gt;Torres Martínez, Juan. ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=KmF4i8PgawwC&amp;dq=fuentes+tam%C3%A1ricas+augurio&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s El Cantábrico en la Edad del Hierro: medioambiente, economía, territorio y sociedad]''. Real Academia de la Historia (2011). {{ISBN|8415069286}}, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also suggested that the fountain could be dedicated to a god of the waters, where predictions were made based on their irregular filling and emptying cycle. In the thirteenth century it was built beside a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] devoted to [[John the Baptist]], to Christianize the place and delete all relations with [[pagan]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;Palencia Turismo [http://www.palenciaturismo.es/contenido/ec1eeded-d5f4-11de-b283-fb9baaa14523?seccion=fc27d943-d5f4-11de-b283-fb9baaa14523 Velilla del Río Carrión].

== The ''curse'' of Pliny ==

[[File:Arco original.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of the original [[arch]] still preserved. The other two were rebuilt in the 1980s.]]
Studies of the [[naturalist]] and [[geographer]] [[Pliny the Elder]] on the lands occupied by the [[Roman Empire]] are crucial for knowledge and location of Tamaric Fountains. In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historiae]]'', XXXI, 3, is where he alludes its particularity:

{{Quote|''Tamaric Fountains, in Cantabria serves as omen. They are three, to eight feet of distance. They come together in one bed, each carrying a large flow. Usually dry for twelve days and sometimes up to twenty, leaving no sign of water, while another adjoining source still flowing without interruption and in abundance. It's bad luck try to see them when they run, as happened recently has the legacy Lartius Licinius, who, after his praetorship, he went to see them when they run dry, and he died seven days later.|author=Pliny the Elder|source= Naturalis historia, XXXI, 23}}

[[Lartius Licinius]] was a great supporter of the work of Pliny, with his intense desire for knowledge of new discoveries, he visited the spring when it were in their dry phase, and died a week after in 70 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny XXXI 24: «sicut proxime Lartio Licinio legato post praeturam; post septem enim dies occidit».&lt;/ref&gt;

| headquarters = [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]}}
'''Fraternité Notre-Dame''' is a [[Traditional Catholic]] order of  priests and nuns that is not in union with the [[Pope]].

==Origins==
The origins of Fraternité Notre-Dame are in the reported [[Marian apparitions|apparitions of the Virgin Mary]] in [[Fréchou]], [[France]]. They were received in 1977 by Jean Marie Kozik, a [[Polish minority in France|Frenchman of Polish origin]] who was consecrated as a [[bishop]] in 1978 by the dissident and excommunicated [[Vietnam]]ese Archbishop [[Ngô Đình Thục]].&lt;ref name="fraternitenotredame1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraternitenotredame.com/Pages/EN_Pages/EN_History/EN_History-01.html |title=History of Fraternite Notre Dame |publisher=Fraternitenotredame.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rite==
The general religious practices of followers of Fraternité Notre-Dame are in line with other Traditionalist Catholics, who prefer the pre-[[Vatican II]] Church, especially the [[Tridentine Mass]] in [[Latin]] as opposed to the [[Novus Ordo Mass]] in [[vernacular languages]].

==Today==
Fraternité Notre-Dame operates religious and humanitarian missions on four continents. The order operates soup kitchens and weekly food pantries in [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Ulan Bator]], [[Chicago]], and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleteia.org/2016/03/01/self-help-guru-tony-robbins-saves-small-soup-kitchen-run-by-three-nuns/|title=Self-Help Guru Tony Robbins Saves Small Soup Kitchen Run by 3 Nuns|date=1 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-nuns-win-new-spot-soup-kitchen-mission/|title=SF nuns win new spot for soup kitchen in the Mission|last=|first=|date=Jan 2017|work=SF Chronicle|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally, a hospital for the poor has been opened in [[Mongolia]], and it has also operated humanitarian convoys to benefit those victimized by war in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref name="fraternitenotredame1"/&gt;  The Fraternité opened a new mission in Detroit during the summer of 2018.  The mission is in what was Most Holy Name of Jesus parish until 1990, and most recently Shield of Faith Ministries.

===Chicago===
In 2000, The movement opened its [[Mother Church|Mother House]] for [[North America]] in Chicago's [[Austin, Chicago|Austin]] neighborhood in the former '''Gammon United Methodist Church''', a structure built by noted Cleveland architect [[Sidney Badgley]] and featured in a number of books on [[Chicago architecture]], notably "The [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] Guide to Chicago" by Alice Sinkevitch (Harvest Books 2004). Fraternité Notre-Dame uses the complex as a Novitiate/Seminary for religious [[friars]] and future priests, as well as a Novitiate for religious nuns out of the complex.

Since then Fraternité Notre-Dame nuns have become a fixture at numerous [[Chicago area]] farmer's markets selling traditional French [[pastries]] to raise funds for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierri |first=Vince |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=311214 |title=Sales of French pastries aid nuns' mission work |publisher=Daily Herald |date= |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ancient synagogue of Gaza''' was built in 508 AD during the [[Byzantine]] period and was discovered in 1965. It was located in the ancient port city of Gaza, then known as "[[Maiuma]]s", currently the [[Rimal]] district of [[Gaza City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ancient synagogues'']. Dan Urman, Paul Virgil McCracken Flesher. pg. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:PikiWiki Israel 15077 Mosaic from the ancient synagogue in Gaza.JPG|thumb|Section of the synagogue's mosaic floor]]
In 1965, [[Egypt]]ian archaeologists discovered the site and announced they had uncovered a church.&lt;ref&gt;Connie Kestenbaum Green. [http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Gaza_Synagogue_Mosaic,_6th_century_CE King David’s Head from Gaza Synagogue Restored], ''Biblical Archaeology Review Magazine'' (Mar/Apr 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Later a mosaic of [[King David]] wearing a crown and playing a lyre, labelled in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], was found. The mosaic was dated to 508-09 CE and measured {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high by {{convert|1.9|m|ft|sp=us}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ancient synagogues''].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=yklDk6Vv0l4C&amp;pg=PA418 International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J], p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally described as depicting a female saint playing the harp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=20&amp;Issue=2&amp;ArticleID=5 King David’s Head from Gaza Synagogue Restored]&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian archaeologists stated that the mosaic was in fact an [[Orpheus mosaic]], a [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] who was commonly associated with Christ or David and used in [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref name="IsraelMuseum"&gt;[http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/article_21.aspx?c0=13031&amp;bsp=13013 Israel Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the mosaic's discovery, the main figure's face was gouged out. When Israel captured the [[Gaza Strip]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the mosaic was transferred to the [[Israel Museum]] for restoration.&lt;ref name="IsraelMuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=838459&amp;ct=1104189 The Arab Campaign to Destroy Israel], ''American Jewish Committee''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''General Jewish Labour Bund in Latvia''' was a [[History of the Jews in Latvia|Jewish]] [[socialist]] party in [[Latvia]], adhering to the political line of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund]] and existed from 1900 until 1940, when it was banned shortly after the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940]].

==The beginnings of the Latvian Bund==
The first local Bund organizations were established on 1900 in [[Daugavpils]] and on 1902 in [[Riga]]. In the autumn of 1904, the Riga Committee of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party and the Riga Committee of the Bund signed a co-operation agreement and founded the Riga Federative Committee. The main liaisons were the engineer Jānis Ozols ("Zars") and the railwayman Samuel Klevansky ("Maksim"). Bund was active during the 1905 Russian revolution, organizing demonstrations and fighting units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/about-the-ministry/publications/latvia Jews During the Revolution of 1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Bundist activities in independent Latvia began with a congress of members of ''Unzer Tsayt'' in [[Riga]] in December 1918, soon after Riga was conquered by Soviet Russia.&lt;ref name=blatman/&gt; After the conclusion of [[Latvian War of Independence]], in the fall of 1920 a Central Bureau of the Latvian Bund was constituted. The Latvian Bund became an autonomous organization affiliated with the [[Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]]. The Bund had one seat in the Central Committee of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party.&lt;ref name="mic"&gt;Minczeles, Henri. ''Histoire générale du Bund: un mouvement révolutionnaire juif''. Paris: Editions Austral, 1995. p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; The Bund, as well as other left-wing groups in Latvia after the [[Latvian War of Independence]], was under suspicion as Communist supporters. On June 20, 1921 the president of the party [[Abraham Braun]] "Sergei" (1881-1940) was sentenced to death by a military tribunal for spreading Communist propaganda but released after international socialist outcry over the sentence.&lt;ref name="mic"/&gt;

The relations among Jewish socialists and with the rest of the socialist movement were far better than in [[Poland]]; during elections of 1918 two Bundists were elected, then four at the Riga municipal council election in 1919, on a common list of the Social Democratic bloc, which gained 36 of the 96 seats.

The party published the biweekly ''Di naye tsayt'' for seven years.&lt;ref name="mic"/&gt; According to Daniel Blatman, there were 500 active members of the Latvian Bund in 1934.&lt;ref name=blatman&gt;Daniel Blatman, [http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/bund.pdf Bund], The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bundist members of the Latvian Parliament==
[[File:Bundelectionposter.jpg|right|thumb|Bilingual Bundist election poster from [[Latvia]], announcing a meeting in 1931 with member of [[Saeima]] [[Noah Meisel|Dr. Noah Meisel]]]]
As pointed out by Frank Gordon, "Between the two world wars Latvia was the only country where the Bund had a parliamentary representative of its own.".,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Frank (Efrayim)|title=Latvians and Jews Between Germany and Russia|publisher=Memento|location=Stockholm|year=1990|isbn=91-87114-08-9|url=http://vip.latnet.lv/lpra/frank_gordon.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229132823/http://vip.latnet.lv/lpra/frank_gordon.htm|archivedate=2009-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bind was only one of a few Jewish parties represented in the [[1st Saeima]], [[2nd Saeima]], [[3rd Saeima]] and [[4th Saeima]].

Itzhak Berss (Īzaks Berss), father of [[Lipman Bers]], represented the interests of the Bund in the [[Constitutional Assembly of Latvia]], elected in April 1920. He was later the director of Riga Jewish [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] where Yiddish was the language of education. From 1922 until 1934 he was Riga City councilman.  He was removed from office after the [[1934 Latvian coup d'état]] on the grounds of "political unreliability".&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Press|first=Bernhard|title=The murder of the Jews in Latvia: 1941-1945|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8101-1729-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOvWYblJMSUC&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, 1941 he was arrested and deported by Soviets to Siberia from where he was released only in 1956.

Dr. [[Noah Meisel]], [[Daugavpils]] city council member, was subsequently elected for the Bund in the [[1st Saeima]] in 1922, and again in 1925 and 1928, but was not reelected in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11931.html Latvia], [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested and deported by the Soviet authorities after the Soviet invasion and annexation of Latvia in 1940 and died in exile in far Northern Russia in 1956.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

According to Valdis Lumans, "the leftist Bund more often than not sided with [[Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] more than with the [[Jewish National Bloc|Jewish bloc]]" (comprising [[Agudas Israel (Latvia)|Agudath Israel]], the Zionists and the [[Jewish National Democratic Party]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumans|first=Valdis |title=Latvia in World War II|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2006|pages=547|isbn=978-0-8232-2627-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPv1gjLhtZ4C&amp;pg=PA217|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International affiliation==
After World War I, the Latvian Bund sent a representative, [[Raphael Abramovitch]], to the [[Menshevik|Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Menshevik)]] delegation at the founding Vienna conference of the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] in 1921, where he was particularly active in association with the Menshevik leader [[Julius Martov]]. He "emerged as one of the recognized leaders of the Vienna Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liebich|first=André|title=From the other shore: Russian social democracy after 1921|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1997|isbn=978-0-674-32517-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1zdl9K7GGAC&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist splinter group==
In 1920 Jewish communists also formed the illegal underground battle organisation ''Kamp Bund'' (The Bund of Struggle), which functioned as the Jewish section of the banned [[Communist Party of Latvia]]. Its leading members included Mark Donskoy, Iosif Lensky and Abraham Gurevich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/ministry/4265/4299/ |title=The history of the Jewish Community in Latvia |last=Dribins |first=Leo |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia |accessdate=2009-10-31 |location=Riga |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729084612/http://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/ministry/4265/4299 |archivedate=2009-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hapeles''''' ({{lang-he|הפלס}} – "''the leveler''") is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] daily newspaper published in [[Jerusalem, Israel]] and directed to the [[Haredi]] community. The newspaper's slogan is "[[Torah]]-world's newsletter". The newspaper  is published daily except on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. On weekends the newspaper comes out in an enlarged free edition. ''Hapeles'' was founded by leading Rabbinical authorities of our times in order to fairly represent the Torah view on different subjects.

==History==
''Hapeles'' is a continuation of the ideology underlying line adopted by the founders of the newspaper [[Yated Ne'eman (Israel)|''Yated Ne'eman'']]. ''Yated Ne'eman'' was part of a broad initiative to create communal organizations to serve the [[Misnagdim|Lithuanian Torah]] community. ''Yated Ne'eman'' rejected secular life and displayed an ambivalent attitude towards the [[State of Israel]] and [[Zionism]]. They recognized them as a de facto political entity, but denied that Zionism was the destiny of the Jewish people. Instead the newspaper emphasized pious observance of the [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]] of the Torah and Jewish law.

In 2012 the paper was taken over by more moderate ultra-Orthodox elements. The CEO, the editor-in-chief and some of its guiding rabbinical board members (the "spiritual committee"), who were considered to represent the more strict ideological line, were fired during the changes. ''Hapeles'' was created to continue the original direction of ''Yated Ne'eman''. The dismissed CEO and chief editor were appointed to those positions on the new paper.

==Controversy==

===Campaign against recruitment of haredim===
Hapeles leads an extensive campaign against recruitment of haredim to [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/225073 ''Hapeles'' and IDF]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it faced criticism from the Israeli government, including Minister of Defense [[Avigdor Lieberman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/printarticle.aspx?id=481636 Jerusalem Post] Yisrael Beytenu targets extremist haredi newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspicion of criminal activity===
In April 2017, ''Hapeles'' editors were arrested and all the computers in the newspaper's HQ were confiscated. The charge was illegal efforts to get large companies in Israel to advertise in the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?fbdid=1001185104|title=28 בכירי העיתון החרדי "הפלס" נעצרו בחשד להטרדות ואיומים - גלובס|website=Globes|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the newspaper claimed that the charges against it were a government persecution, due to his activity against the recruitment of Haredim. The claims relied on controversial quotations of [[Eli Ben-Dahan]], Israeli deputy minister of defence&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iba.org.il/nagish/accessibility_player.aspx?vcode=iba-DnSaP1-X4Yx1&amp;img=1006046.jpg&amp;t=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A8 Radio Moreshet] (Min. 34.

The '''Hidden Stream Temple Cave''' ({{zh|c=潜溪寺洞|p=qián xī sì dòng}} also ''zhai fu tang'') is cave number 20 at the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]], [[China]].

==History==
The cave had wooden structured eaves added in the [[Qing Dynasty]], but these were not maintained.  In 1990 an outer room imitating the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] style was rebuilt and the floor was paved with bricks.

==Features==
The central statue is a large [[Amitabha]] seated on a square pedestal with loose clothes, a naked chest and a plump face.  His hands take the [[abhaya mudra]], symbolising fearlessness.  The bodhisattvas [[Avalokitesvara]] and [[Mahasthamaprapta]] stand to each side. Two armoured heavenly kings protect the entrance.

There are also two line engraved buddhas in a niche on the southern wall outside the cave.

==British Hindus==
The British Hindu population includes those who came directly from the Indian sub-continent, descendants of those Hindus who had originally migrated to other countries but later resettled in the United Kingdom, and those born and raised in the UK. It is not unusual to find third or fourth generation Hindus in the UK.

There have been three main waves of migration of Hindus in the UK, and most of the Hindu migration has occurred after World War II.&lt;ref name=sfhindu&gt;{{cite book | last=Fredman | first=Sandra | title=Discrimination law | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford England New York | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-19-958442-0 | page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave was at the time of British India's independence and partition in 1947. Also, in the early 1960s the Conservative Health Minister the Rt Hon Enoch Powell recruited a large number of doctors from the Indian sub-continent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8128957/Enoch-Powell-was-not-an-out-and-out-racist.html 'Enoch Powell was not an out-and-out racist']&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave occurred in the 1970s mainly from East Africa especially due to the [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda]].&lt;ref name=sfhindu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/uganda-legacy-idi-amins-expulsion-asians-1972-214289&lt;/ref&gt; Later, communities included those from Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius and Fiji. The last wave of migration began in the 1990s and is a result of the United Kingdom's immigration policy, which made studying and immigration to the UK easier. This wave also included Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka and professionals including doctors and software engineers from India.&lt;ref name=sfhindu/&gt;

In terms of relative numbers of South Asian descendants in England and Wales, Hindu population of 806,000 is the second largest group, after 1,628,000 South Asian Muslims according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref name="EW Census 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census: KS209EW Religion, local authorities in England and Wales (Excel sheet 270Kb)|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks209ew.xls|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=7 July 2014|format=xls}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects a growth over the 1991 census, when its Hindu population was 397,000 compared to 703,000 South Asian Muslims and 206,000 South Asian Sikhs in the England and Wales.&lt;ref name=gp2003&gt;R.

==Discrimination and stereotyping of Hindus in the UK==
{{see also|Hinduphobia}}

A report authored by Robert Berkeley of [[Runnymede Trust]] states that the Hindu community groups and organizations in the United Kingdom face systematic disadvantage and discrimination.&lt;ref name=rb6/&gt;  They face a legacy of inequality, targeting and stereotyping in daily life and by the media, which has left the Hindu community isolated, with a limited capacity to engage with other communities, or address the problems they face.&lt;ref name=rb6/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dias (Editor: Charles Westin) | first=Nuno | title=Identity processes and dynamics in multi-ethnic Europe | publisher=Amsterdam University Press | location=Amsterdam | year=2010 | isbn=978-90-8964-046-8 | pages=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars state that the Hindu community in the United Kingdom, and Europe in general, has faced discrimination in immigration policies adopted by the local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Skutsch | first=Carl | title=Encyclopedia of the world's minorities | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-57958-470-2 | page=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Weller | first=Paul | title=Religious discrimination in England and Wales | publisher=Home Office, Research, Development and Statistics Directorate | location=London | year=2001 | isbn=978-1-84082-612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In local councils, construction or expansion permits for Hindu temples and community centers have been turned down for years, while Muslim mosques and Christian churches have been approved by the same councils and built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul Weller et al. (2015)|title=Religion or Belief, Discrimination and Equality: Britain in Global Contexts|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1474237512|pages=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrimination suffered by Hindu communities from the local council officials in Britain has been described by Paul Weller as follows,

{{Cquote|Neighbourhood traffic and parking issues continued to be reported as a problem. For example, a leader of the Hindu community told us that his temple was not given permission or space for worshippers to park outside the temple during festivals – which occurred only a few times a year. By contrast, he drew attention to parking restrictions have been lifted every Friday for the local mosque and identified this as unfair. A Hindu woman in another field research location, described problems with securing planning permission to build an extension and car park for her local temple. She contrasted this with the experience of Muslims who, according to her, had been allowed to build a mosque on 'each and every road'.&lt;br&gt; – Paul Weller et al (2015), Religion or Belief, Discrimination and Equality: Britain in Global Contexts, University of Derby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul Weller et al. (2015)|title=Religion or Belief, Discrimination and Equality: Britain in Global Contexts|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1474237512|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nearly 50% of Hindu children, both boys and girls, in British schools have reported to being victims of bullying for being Hindu and their religious heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gelfand| first=Michele | title=Handbook of Advances in Culture and Psychology, Volume 5 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-19-021897-3 | page=175|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Nesbitt (1993), Gender and religious tradition: The role learning of British Hindu children, Gender and Education, 5(1): 81-91&lt;/ref&gt; However, Claire Monks et al. note that children of various races and religions report being victims of bullying in British schools as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Monks| first=Claire P. | title=Peer victimization in multicultural schools in Spain and England | journal=European Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume=5 | issue=4 | year=2008 | pages=507–535 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1080/17405620701307316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu community in the United Kingdom is not unique in suffering discrimination and stereotyping.&lt;ref name=rb6/&gt;&lt;ref name=pi8/&gt; The similarly small Jewish community of the United Kingdom, and in recent years the much larger Muslim community of the United Kingdom, has also expressed similar concerns. New legislation and institutions to understand and respond to religious discrimination are being debated by British politicians.&lt;ref name=rb6/&gt;&lt;ref name=pi8/&gt;

Private golfing, country clubs and other social clubs in Britain have routinely discriminated against and denied entry to Hindus – in addition to Sikhs, Muslims, women, Africans and other minorities after asserting "freedom of association" principle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lindblom | title=Non-governmental organisations in international law | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge New York | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-521-85088-9 | pages=169–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of EU-wide law to limit this practice were adopted in the United Kingdom in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thane | first=Pat | authorlink = Pat Thane |title=Unequal Britain equalities in Britain since 1945 | publisher=Continuum | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-84706-298-7 | pages=58–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jacobsen | first=Knut | title=South Asians in the diaspora histories and religious traditions | publisher=Brill | location=Leiden Boston | year=2004 | isbn=978-90-04-12488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances of Islamist terrorism, such as after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], Hindus along with Sikhs of the United Kingdom became more targeted and vulnerable for backlash than Muslims.&lt;ref name=pi8&gt;Paul Iganski (2008), Hate crime and the city, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9781861349408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050909/asp/nation/story_5216557.asp 7/7 backlash against Hindus and Sikhs], The Telegraph; Quote - "There have been 932 hate crimes against Indians, predominantly Hindus and Sikhs, compared with around 600 such instances against Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims".&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, it was reported that [[Conservative Party (UK)]] London mayoral candidate [[Shaun Bailey]] had written a pamphlet, entitled ''No Man’s Land'', for the [[Centre for Policy Studies]]. In it, Bailey argued that accommodating Hindus "[robs] Britain of its community" and is turning the country into a "crime riddled cess pool". He also claimed that [[South Asians]] "bring their culture, their country and any problems they might have, with them" and that this was not a problem within the black community "because we’ve shared a religion and in many cases a language". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-london-candidate-mayor-shaun-bailey-hindu-muslim-festival-crime-a8566341.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet, Bailey had confused the [[Hindu]] religion and the [[Hindi]] language: "You don’t know what to do. You bring your children to school and they learn far more about [[Diwali]] than [[Christmas]]. I speak to the people who are from [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] and they’ve been having Hindi &lt;small&gt;(sic)&lt;/small&gt; days off."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-hindu-muslim-views-return-to-haunt-london-mayor-candidate-shaun-bailey/story-woCY6o4owDF4Yp9lnOxNBM.html|title=Anti-Hindu, Muslim views return to haunt London mayor candidate Shaun Bailey|last=Sonwalkar|first=Prasun|date=4 October 2018|website=[[Hindustan Times]]|language=en|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party Deputy Chairman, [[James Cleverly]], defended Bailey and insisted he was misunderstood, and that he was implying black boys were drifting into crime as a result of learning more about Hinduism rather than "their own Christian culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/04/tory-concerns-shaun-bailey-remarks-london-mayoral-race |title=Tory deputy chairman admits concerns about Shaun Bailey remarks |last=Sabbagh |first=Dan |date=4 October 2018 |website=The Guardian |language=en |access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the anti-racism [[Hope Not Hate]] campaign group called Bailey's comments "grotesque".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-45734837|title=Tory London mayor candidate's comments 'Islamophobic'|date=4 October 2018|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments were condemned by the [[Hindu Council UK|Hindu Council of the United Kingdom]] who expressed "disappointment at the misrepresentation of our faith" by Bailey. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2272356569472453&amp;id=788110531230405&amp;__tn__=K-R&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
{{Sunni Islam|collapsed=1}}
{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}}
'''Hojatoleslam''' (from {{Lang-ar|حجة الإسلام|ḥujjatu l-Islām}}, also ''Hujjat al-islam'') is an [[honorific]] title meaning "authority on [[Islam]]" or "proof of [[Islam]]".&lt;ref name="Algar"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Algar |first=Hamid |date=23 March 2012 |title=Ḥojjat-al-Eslām |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |volume=XII |issue=4 |page=426 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hojjat-al-eslam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517040744/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hojjat-al-eslam |archive-date=17 May 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sunni Islam==
In [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] tradition, the title was used exclusively for the scholar [[al-Ghazali]], due to his influential integration of [[Sufism]] and [[sharia]]. However, there is some evidence of application of the term to later Sunni scholars, in imitaion of the Shia usage.&lt;ref name="Algar" /&gt;

==Shia Islam==
In [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] the title is awarded to scholars. It was originally applied as an honorific to leading scholars, but now the use indicates a status in the hierarchy of the learned below [[Ayatollah]].&lt;ref name="Algar" /&gt; It is divided into two sub ranks, ''Hujjatu l-Islām wa l-Muslimīn'' ("Authority on Islam and Muslims") and ''Hujjatu l-Islām'' ("Authority on [[Islam]]"), given to middle-ranking clerics.

==Education==
[[Hawza]] students start their studies learning [[fiqh]], [[kalam]], [[hadith]], [[tafsir]], [[philosophy]] and [[Arabic literature]]. After mastering these levels they are given the ''Hojatoleslam'' title, and can start becoming [[mujtahid]] by studying advanced textbooks known as ''satḥ'', and research courses known as ''kharij''.

'''Iaal''' ({{lang-ar|ايعال}}, also spelt as '''Ī`āl''', '''Iäal''', '''Izal''' or '''I’aal''') is a [[village]] in northern Lebanon.

==Location==
Iaal is located approximately {{convert|12|km}} south-east of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], {{convert|85|km}} from [[Beirut]] and {{convert|5|km}} from [[Zgharta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Maps: Iaal, Lebanon|url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Iaal,+Lebanon/@34.4037721,35.8945183,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x1521f7d9273c7381:0x3fafac6db5a4bef2|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iaal: Geographic coordinate information|url=http://www.tageo.com/index-e-le-v-03-d-m1172097.htm?Iaal|website=Tageo.com|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated within the [[Zgharta District]] of the [[North Governorate]] of [[Lebanon]]. Iaal lies at the foot of the [[Mount Lebanon]] range and has a road that runs up into the mountains (parallel to [[Wadi]] Iaal) passing through its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wādī Ī`āl|url=http://www.getamap.net/maps/lebanon/liban-nord/_ial_wadi/|website=getamap.net|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbouring and nearby communities include [[Jdaydeh]], [[Kfaryachit]], [[Khaldieh]], [[Morh Kfarsghab]] and [[Miziara|Sakhra]]. Iaal is one of only five Sunni towns in the Zgharta District and is the southernmost entirely Sunni Muslim settlement in the whole North Governorate of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caza-zgharta.com/Religious/religious.htm Religious]. caza-zgharta.com. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831055559/http://www.caza-zgharta.com/Religious/religious.htm |date=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
The most identifiable building in Iaal is the castle/fort built on the hilltop of the village centre: the [[Iaal Fortress|Fortress of Iaal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/About+Lebanon.nsf/SectionsBySubAlias/Iaal?OpenDocument Iaal Fortress photo]. naharnet.com. {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I'aal: Fortress details|url=http://www.soualjawab.com/destination/cities_1/iaal.htm|website=Sou'al Jawab Tourism|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 1816 by [[Mustafa Agha Barbar]] (the [[Ottomans|Ottoman]] governor of Tripoli from 1798) because the area was considered strategic thanks to its panoramic views, which extend all the way down to the [[Mediterranean]] coast. The other identifiable building in Iaal is the [[mosque]] along the road that runs up into the mountains called [[Masjid al-Taqwa]] ([[Arabic]] for ''Mosque of [[Taqwa|Piety]]''), built in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zgharta.com/cgi-bin/zgallery/page.cgi?g=Detailed%2F2925.html;d=1 Photo of "Masjid al-Taqwa," built in 1994]. zgharta.com.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310105932/http://zgharta.com/cgi-bin/zgallery/page.cgi?g=Detailed%2F2925.html%3Bd%3D1 |date=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a second mosque located within the confines of the castle.

==History==
It appears that Iaal was inhabited prior to the arrival of Barbar, as evidenced by a census conducted by the Ottomans in 1555 showing that there were 34 males in the village at that time (females were excluded from the census).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caza-zgharta.com/zawie/zawieh%20hist.htm 1555 Iaal census]. caza-zgharta.com. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517100228/http://www.caza-zgharta.com/zawie/zawieh%20hist.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, who these villagers were and where they originated from is unknown. What can be presumably safely deduced is that the modern descendants from Iaal are a product of Barbar, those serving him and those who were counted in the 1555 census. Based upon the 1555 census alone, there should be more than the few thousand people currently claiming an origin from Iaal, i.e. if the population was able to grow without the interference of many unnatural deaths (e.g. killings) and/or significant migration and subsequent loss of identity.

==Agriculture==
The land of Iaal is watered by Iaal Dam and its outflow of Wadi Iaal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://om.ciheam.org/om/pdf/b48/05002293.pdf Participatory Water Saving Management and Water Cultural Heritage: Lebanon Country Report], by K. Karaa, F. Karam, N. Tarabey, pp. 190-91, in ''Fig, 2. Sites of the Master Plan’s main storage structures'' and ''Table 5. Ten Years Master Plan for Dams and ponds construction''.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it fertile, sustaining a variety of produce and grazing animals, and has resulted in making Iaal famous for its [[olive tree]] gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towns and Villages Neighbouring Tripoli Lebanon: I'aal|url=http://tripoli-city.org/neighbour.html#iaal|website=tripoli-city.org|accessdate=23 May 2015|date=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Iaal’s climate is typical of a Mediterranean plain village: with heavy rains, mild winters and hot, dry, arid summers. Its annual rainfall is {{convert|810|mm}}. Its average monthly temperatures are shown below:

==People==
Its inhabitants are entirely [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] and number about 1,000 people (although precise figures are unattainable).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caza-zgharta.com/caza/historical.htm Historical]. caza-zgharta.com. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517131111/http://www.caza-zgharta.com/caza/historical.htm |date=17 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Iaal had a total population of 903, and in 1998 its population increased by almost 20% to 1,082 people. However, these figures relate to all registered citizens originating from the village, including both residents in Lebanon and those who emigrated abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caza-zgharta.com/demography/demographic_study.htm Demographic Study]. by Paul B.M. Douaihy. caza-zgharta.com. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831053138/http://www.caza-zgharta.com/demography/demographic_study.htm |date=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Iaal are also all related to one another through common ancestors. The majority of people who trace their ancestry to the village actually live outside of Iaal. The overwhelming majority of these immigrants and their descendants live in [[Australia]], primarily [[Sydney]], in the [[local government areas]] of the [[Municipality of Kogarah]] (where they operate a mosque in the [[suburb]] of [[South Hurstville, New South Wales|South Hurstville]]) and the [[City of Liverpool (New South Wales)|City of Liverpool]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This diaspora community also runs the Iaal Charitable Association Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strong in Their Weakness or Weak in Their Strength? The Case of Lebanese Diaspora Engagement with Lebanon|journal=Immigrants &amp; Minorities|date=2014|pages=12–14, 17|doi=10.1080/02619288.2013.877347|author1=Skulte-ouaiss, Jennifer |author2=Tabar, Paul |publisher=Routledge|location=The I’aal Village Association|issn=0261-9288|quote=...For the village association of I’aal in North Lebanon (known as the Charitable Association of I’aal in Australia), there is no clear line separating those who reside in the village and those who have emigrated, as there is so much circular migration and other forms of transnational interaction. The Deputy Head of the Municipality, Mr Nasser Al Dein Dieb, who has also been a migrant himself, stated that ‘there is no single family in I’aal who [does] not have at least one relative residing in Australia’. The association is active in a variety of infrastructure and education projects in the village; individual migrants are also active in private or family activities, for example, building elaborate and expensive vacation homes that get used only for a few weeks per year. In the 2009 general elections, almost 500 members of the I’aal Diaspora community in Sydney travelled to Lebanon to participate and vote. What made their participation very significant was the fact that they voted in a district (Zghartah district) where the race between the two major political forces running for this election (March 14 and March 8 alliances) was so close, making their contribution crucial for the final outcome of the elections. This village association is by no means the largest that we encountered in our research but rather is typical of many such tight-knit organizations that seek to address the needs of the homeland community that cannot or will not be met by state authorities. Migrants in Australia from I’aal (the majority of I’aal inhabitants who live abroad are found in Sydney, Australia) have contributed abundantly to the development of the village in Lebanon: they have donated profusely to improve the services of the village school and clinic, and to many families who were in need to provide expensive health care to their sick family members or to support their childrens’ education. As a result, all these activities qualify I’aal, like hundreds of other diasporan villages in Australia, Canada and the USA, to assume the role of a non-state actor...What is striking about the I’aal Village Association, as well as others like it tying the Lebanese Diaspora to villages and towns throughout Lebanon, is that they contribute significantly to the financial, social and even political sustenance of these villages and towns...However, as discussion of the cases of...I’aal Village Association, and Auxilia illustrate, the Diaspora is never completely autonomous in its activities. Rather, it is strongest when...the Diaspora restricts its activities to the local level (e.g. I’aal Village Association) but also takes the lead.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th and early 20th century, most people from Iaal (at the time) emigrated to [[Latin America]]; however, these emigrants fully assimilated into their new environments and lost all connections with their homeland.

Some common surnames of people from Iaal include Affouf, Al-Choukairy, Al-Hage, Ardati, Ayyoub, Dennaoui, Diab, Dib, Elmir, Habib, Hadid, Halbouni, Hammoud, Hussein, Ibrahim, Issa, Jameel, Khidr, Mahrees, Merhi, Nasreddine, Nasser, Shehaddy, Subkhi and Taleb.

&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents are from many religious backgrounds as Kabir never advocated change of religions but highlighted their limitations.&lt;ref&gt;"We''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M7c8AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Dissent,+protest,+and+reform+in+Indian+civilization%22&amp;dq=%22Dissent,+protest,+and+reform+in+Indian+civilization%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YJp7TrWwN47K0AGr9N3SAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA Dissent, protest, and reform in Indian civilization]''.

==Practices and beliefs==

Kabir Panthis  can follow the ethical and social customs of the day according to tradition without hindrance. Lay persons can be cremated according to Hindu law and priests can be buried or cremated depending upon which tradition one wishes to follow . In the [[Caribbean]] and across [[North America]], Kabir Panthis may opt for burning or burial.
Modern Kabir Panthis do not seem to be different from orthodox Vaishanavites; they worship the idol of Kabir, wear sacred thread and sandalwood paste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Subhash Chandra|last=Malik|title=Dissent ,protest and reform in Indian Civilization|publisher=Indian Institute of Advanced Studies|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabir Panthis observe sanctity and purity in their daily lives and behavior. The foundation of their belief and practice is [[Dharma]], or "the natural Law of life",  [[Satya]], or "The primordial and eternal truth", [[Ahimsa]], or "Non-violence towards all beings through word and deed", [[Bhakti]], or "Devotional love for god and a higher spiritual reality", [[Śraddhā|Sraddha]], or "Faith and unswerving loyalty", [[Asteya]], or "Neither hoarding nor coveting", [[Kshama]], or "Forgiveness and patience", [[Daya (Sikhism)|Daya]], or "Compassion, mercy, and conquering feelings of cruelty and insensitivity towards all beings", [[Shaucha]] or "Purity in body, mind and speech", [[Aparigraha]], or "Limiting possessions to what is necessary and being non-materialistic", [[Anekantvada]], or "Acceptance of different beliefs and the multiplicity of viewpoints", [[Vishwa Bandhutva]], or "The universal brotherhood of all beings" and [[Atma Gyan]] or "The awareness of ones true self, which is no different from the one true reality which pervades in everyone, thus making everyone the one and only true reality". These basic set of guidelines gives Kabir Panthis an all-encompassing formula for Love, Humility, Compassion and Unity. A Kabir Panthi lay person is called a [[Bhakta]] and priests are addressed with the honorific title of [[Mahant]]. Spiritual leaders are called [[Acharya]] or [[Guru]]. Monks who are more [[ascetic]] in nature, who do not marry and engage in more severe spiritual pursuits while never living in one place, constantly moving from monastery to monastery are called [[Brahmacharya|Brahmachari]] Sadhus, whereas those monks who do marry, have children and live a more relaxed spiritual life are ''Grihasta'' [[Sadhu]]s. Similarly, women who have chosen to be Nuns are called [[Sadhvi]]s.  God is called by an infinite array of names but some of the more common names are "Satya Purush", "Soham Sadguru", "Adi Guru'', '' Param Satyeshwar", or simply "Sadguru Kabir Saheb". During their religious ceremonies Kabir Panthis sing the songs, ''[[bhajan]]''s and ''Sakhi''s of Kabir to the music of cymbals, drums and other Indian instruments. The [[Guru]] recites various prayers and [[Mantra]]s, all of which remind devotees to remember God in all that they do.

One's mind and body must be kept pure by contemplation and avoiding gross and complicated behaviour. Such practice will allow one to attain salvation while living no matter what ones religion or other personal endeavour may be. A mark of initiation into the Kabir Panth is given in the form of a [[Kanthi Mala]]. It is a necklace made from the sacred [[Tulsi]] beads. It is also made out of holy [[Rudraksha]] beads and can also be made using [[yagyopaveet]] string with just one large Tulsi or Rudraksha bead. It is worn by choice and is typically given to one who has committed to avoiding lust, anger, greed, attachment to perishable things, and ego. [[Sahaja Yoga]] involves remembering God by repeating ''Satyanaam''. Kabir Panthis believe in simplicity of life; simple food, clothing and belongings. One should only acquire what is needed for sustenance. Kabir Panthis are strictly vegetarian and avoid the use of alcohol and tobacco.

Separate organizations have formed over the years. One of the largest groups of Kabir Panthis outside India is in Trinidad and Tobago: three smaller active groups exist in Guyana, Suriname and also in Canada. The Kabir Panth Association in Trinidad and Tobago operates two primary schools and was one of the first religious denominational schools founded in the region. Recently, other groups have been formed in Trinidad and Tobago [like Kabir Chaura Math, Satya Kabir Nidhi], each with their own emphasis on the teachings of Kabir Saheb and with their own affiliations in Trinidad and Tobago, Bhaarat and elsewhere in the World.

==Scriptures==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
===Bijak===
The most sacred books of the Kabir Panth sect are the [[Bijak]], many passages from which are presented in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and the Anurag Sagar. In a blunt and uncompromising style, the Bijak exhorts its readers to shed their delusions, pretensions, and orthodoxies in favor of a direct experience of truth. It satirizes hypocrisy, greed, and violence, especially among the religious.

The Bijak includes three main sections (called ''Ramainī, Shabda'' and ''Sākhī'') and a fourth section containing miscellaneous folksongs. Most of Kabir's material has been popularized through the song form known as Shabda (or pada) and through the aphoristic two-line sākhī (or doha) that serves throughout north India as a vehicle for popular wisdom. In the Anurag Sagar, the story of creation is told to Dharamdas (one of Kabir's disciples), and the Maan Sarowar is another collection of teachings of Kabir from the Dharamdasi branch of the Kabir panth.

{{Jainism}}
'''''Kankali Tila''''' (also '''Kankali mound''' or '''Jaini mound''') is a [[mound]] located at [[Mathura]] in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The name of the mound is derived from a modern temple of Hindu goddess Kankali. The famous Jain [[stupa]] was excavated here in 1890-91 by [[Alois Anton Führer]] (Dr. Führer).{{sfn|Smith|1901|p=Introduction}}

The mound almost rectangular in shape is 500 feet long by 350 feet broad.{{sfn|Smith|1901|p=Introduction}} ''Kankali Tila'' brought forth many treasures of [[Jain art]]. The archaeological findings testifies the existence of two [[Jain temple]]s and ''[[stupas]]''. Numerous [[Jain sculpture]]s, ''Ayagapattas'' (tablet of homage),{{sfn|Das|1980|p=171}} pillars, crossbeams and lintels were found during archaeological excavations.
Some of the sculptures are provided with inscriptions that report on the contemporary society and organization of the [[Jain community]]. 

Most sculptures could be dated from the 2nd century BC to the 12th century CE, thus representing a continuous period of about 14 centuries during which Jainism flourished at Mathura. These sculptures are now housed in the [[State Museum Lucknow|Lucknow State Museum]] and in the [[Mathura Museum]].

== Excavation ==
[[File:Kankali Tila (Jaini mound).jpg|thumb|General view of the excavations in January 1889 at Kankali Tila, Mathura]]
[[Alexander Cunningham]] worked at the western end in March and November 1871. The objects found by Mr. Cunningham were all Jain, with the exception of one ten-armed Brahmanical figure.
Mr. Growse operated on the northern portion in 1875. In Volume XVII of the "Reports" (page 111), Mr. Cunningham noted that in the season of 1881-82 he dug up many Jain figures, including one inscribed with the name of [[Vardhamana]], the last of the 24 Jain ''[[Tirthankara]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1901|p=2}}
Dr. Burgess and Dr. Fuhrer extended the excavations to the eastern end at different times from 1887 to 1896. Mr. Harding, a predecessor of Mr. Growse as Magistrate of Mathura, also made some excavations.
The excavations at Kankali Tila acted as a testimony to the claims made by Jains regarding the great antiquity of their religion.{{sfn|Thomas|1877|p=80}}
== Significance ==
The sculptures and the inscriptions found at Kankali Tila suggest that in that period a clear Digambar-Shwetabar division had not risen. The Tirthankar images are all unclothed and monks are represented as not wearing a loincloth, but with cloth on one forearm. The names of divisions of the monastic orders match exactly with those given in the Shwetambar Kalpasutra.&lt;ref&gt;The Jaina Stupa at Mathura: Art and Icons, Renuka Porwal, Prachya Vidyapeeth, Shajapur, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Her Sanskrit name is of unclear origin.&lt;ref name="Shaw2006"/&gt;

==Representation==
Kurukullā is a goddess whose body is usually depicted in red with four arms, holding a bow and arrow made of flowers in one pair of hands and a hook and noose of flowers in the other pair. She dances in a [[Dakini]]-pose and crushes the [[asura]] [[Rahu]] (the one who devours the sun). According to [[Hindu astrology]], Rahu is a snake with a demon head ([[Navagraha]]) who represents the ascending [[lunar node]].

She is considered either an [[emanation]] of [[Amitābha]], one of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]'s forms, or a transformation of [[Heruka]].

==History==
Kurukullā was likely an Indian tribal deity associated with magical domination. She was assimilated into the Buddhist pantheon at least as early as the ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'', which contains her [[mantra]]. Her function in Tibetan Buddhism is the "red" function of subjugation. Her root tantra is the ''Arya-tara-kurukulle-kalpa'' (''Practices of the Noble Tara Kurukullā'').&lt;ref name="DTC2011"&gt;Dharmachakra Translation Committee (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated by [[Ts'ütr'im jeya]], a disciple of [[Atiśa]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer (1978), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mantra==
[[File:Kurukulla_Mantra.svg|thumb|right|The mantra of Kurukulla]]

The essential mantra of Kurukullā is ''Oṁ Kurukulle Hrīḥ Svāhā''  ({{bo|t=ༀ་ཀུ་རུ་ཀུ་ལླེ་ཧྲཱིཿསྭཱ་ཧཱ }}). This mantra uses the vocative form (Kurukulle) of her name.

This is a '''list of sanghas in San Diego County, California''', which corresponds to the ''[[San Diego metropolitan area|San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos Metropolitan Statistical Area]]''. All major branches of Buddhism, [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]], are represented there, as is the Mahayana form [[Zen]],&lt;ref name="Warth" /&gt; as are ''[[Vipassanā]]'' and [[Jōdo Shinshū]] ([[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]]). There is also a [[secularity|secular]] Zen sangha. The area is home to [[Monastery#Buddhism|monasteries]] as well as to less formally engaged groups who gather for meditation and community. [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] died over 2500 years ago, but the oldest Buddhist organization in San Diego County is less than 100 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rapson, Edward James|title=The Cambridge History of India|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcooAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|page=156|publisher=Univ.

==History==
During 1916, Japanese immigrant Buddhist farmers were killed when what was then named [[Savage Dam|Otay Dam]] gave way and resulted in the Hatfield Flood. The local [[Japanese diaspora]] needed a place to hold religious services and went on to found what they call the oldest Buddhist organization in San Diego County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Partners|url=http://www.jaclsandiego.org/our-partners/|publisher=Japanese American Citizens League|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mellin, Maribeth, Jane Onstott, and Judith C.

First they rented a second-floor room on 6th and Market in May 1926.&lt;ref name=Estes /&gt; Boys and girls in costume paraded through downtown to celebrate.&lt;ref name=Estes /&gt; Later, in 1931, they dedicated today's Buddhist Temple of San Diego at 2929 Market.&lt;ref name=Estes&gt;{{cite journal|author=Estes, Donald H.|title=Before the War: Japanese in San Diego|date=Fall 1978|volume=24|issue=4|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/78fall/before.htm|journal=The Journal of San Diego History|publisher=San Diego History Center|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''magician''' (female: '''magicianess''') also known as an '''enchanter''' (female: '''enchantress'''), '''sorcerer''' (female: '''sorceress'''), '''mage''', '''[[warlock]]''', '''witch''', or '''wizard''' (female: '''wizardess'''), is someone who uses or practices [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]] derived from [[supernatural]], [[occult]], or [[arcane]] sources.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Philip|title=The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest: How to Write Fantasy Stories of Lasting Value|date=2002|publisher=Writer Books|location=Waukesha, Wisconsin|isbn=0871161958|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} Magicians are common figures in works of [[fantasy]], such as [[fantasy literature]] and [[role-playing games]], and enjoy a rich history in [[mythology]], [[legend]]s, [[fiction]], and [[folklore]].

==Character archetypes==
[[File:Arthur-Pyle The Enchanter Merlin.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''The Enchanter Merlin'', by [[Howard Pyle]], from ''The Story of King Arthur and His Knights'' (1903)]]

In medieval chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], the wizard often appears as a [[wise old man]] and acts as a [[mentor]], with [[Merlin]] from the [[Matter of Britain|King Arthur stories]] being a prime example.&lt;ref name="Frye"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Northrop|title=Anatomy of Criticism; Four Essays|date=1971|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0691012989|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|195}} Wizards such as [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[Albus Dumbledore]] from ''[[List of Harry Potter related topics|Harry Potter]]'' are also featured as mentors, and [[Merlin]] remains prominent as both an educative force and mentor in modern works of [[Arthurian legend|Arthuriana]].&lt;ref name="Clute"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clute|first1=John|last2=Westfahl|title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York|isbn=0312198698|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|637}}&lt;ref name="Driver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driver|first1=Martha W.|title=The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=0786419261|pages=167–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other magicians, such as [[Saruman]], from ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' or [[Lord Voldemort]] from "[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]" can appear as hostile [[villain]]s.&lt;ref name="Frye"/&gt;{{rp|193}} Villainous sorcerers were so crucial to [[Pulp magazine|pulp fantasy]] that the genre in which they appeared was dubbed ''[[sword and sorcery]]''.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|885}}

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' explored the question of how wizards learned their art, introducing to modern fantasy the role of the wizard as protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Susan|title=The Language of the Night: Essays On Fantasy and Science Fiction|date=1982|publisher=Berkley Books|location=New York|isbn=0425052052|page=41|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme has been further developed in modern fantasy, often leading to wizards as heroes on their own quests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fike |first=Justin |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/courses/fiction/65/tolkien/fike14.html |title=The Role of Wizards in Fantasy Literature |work=The Victorian Web |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016155839/http://www.victorianweb.org/courses/fiction/65/tolkien/fike14.html |archivedate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such heroes may have their own mentor, a wizard as well.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|637}}

Wizards can be cast similarly to the [[absent-minded professor]]: being foolish and prone to misconjuring. They can also be capable of great magic, both good or evil.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;{{rp|140–141}} Even comical wizards are often capable of great feats, such as those of Miracle Max in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''; although he is a washed-up wizard fired by the villain, he saves the dying hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=Characters and Viewpoint|date=1999|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=0898799279|page=100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Appearance===
Wizards are often depicted as old, white-haired, and with long white beards majestic enough to occasionally host lurking woodland creatures. This depiction predates the modern fantasy genre, being derived from the traditional image of wizards such as Merlin.&lt;ref name="Driver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colbert|first1=David|title=The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter: A Treasury of Myths, Legends, and Fascinating Facts|date=2001|publisher=Lumina Press|location=Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina|isbn=0970844204|page=70|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' campaign setting of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' role-playing game, wizards show their moral [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]] by their robes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hickman|first1=Tracy|last2=Weis|first2=Margaret|title=DragonLance Adventures|date=1987|publisher=TSR|location=Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|isbn=0880384522}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2015}}

Terry Pratchett described robes as a magician's way of establishing to those they meet that they are capable of practicing magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nl.lspace.org/books/analysis/kneidinger-marcio.html#Section4.3 |title=Analysis |work=Terry Pratchett's Discworld |publisher=L-Space Web |date=1948-04-28 |accessdate=2013-10-16 |first=Kneidinger |last=Marcio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607141528/http://www.nl.lspace.org/books/analysis/kneidinger-marcio.html#Section4.3 |archive-date=2013-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===   
To introduce conflict, writers of fantasy fiction often place limits on the magical abilities of wizards to prevent them from solving problems too easily.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|616}} In Larry Niven's ''[[The Magic Goes Away]]'', once an area's [[Mana#Games and fiction|mana]] is exhausted, no one can use magic.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|942}} A common limit used in [[Magic (gaming)|role-playing games]] is that a person can only cast a specific number of spells in a day.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|385}}

Magic can also require various sacrifices or the use of certain materials, such as [[gemstone]]s, blood, or a live sacrifice. Even if the magician lacks scruples, obtaining the material may be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy|date=1990|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=0898794161|pages=47–49|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. K. Moonfire combines these limits in his book ''The Aubrey Stalking Portal''. The magician expends power to fuel his spells, but does not replenish that power naturally; therefore, he must make sacrifices to generate more magical power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The extent of a wizard's knowledge is limited to which spells a wizard knows and can cast.&lt;ref name="Kern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/courses/fiction/65/tolkien/kern14.html |title=The Limits of Magic |last=Kern |first=Michael |date= |website=The Victorian Web |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016135508/http://www.victorianweb.org/courses/fiction/65/tolkien/kern14.html |archive-date=2013-10-16 |access-date=2013-10-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic may also be limited by its danger; if a powerful spell can cause grave harm if miscast, wizards are likely to be wary of using it.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;{{rp|142}} Other forms of magic are limited by consequences that, while not inherently dangerous, are at least undesirable. In ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', every act of magic distorts the equilibrium of the world, which in turn has far-reaching consequences that can affect the entire world and everything in it. As a result, competent wizards do not use their magic frivolously.&lt;ref name="Kern"/&gt; 

In Terry Pratchett's ''Discworld'' series, the Law of Conservation of Reality is a principle imposed by forces wanting wizards to not destroy the world, and works to limit how much power it is humanly possible to wield.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Whatever your means, the effort put into reaching the ends stays the same. For example, when the wizards of Unseen University are chasing the hapless wizard Rincewind in the forest of Skund, the wizards send out search teams to go and find him on foot. The archchancellor beats them to it by using a powerful spell from his own office, and while he gets there first by clever use of his spell, he has used no less effort than the others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Names and terminology==
People who work magic are called by several names in fantasy works, and terminology differs widely from one [[fantasy world]] to another. While derived from real-world vocabulary, the terms ''wizard'', ''witch'', ''[[warlock]]'', ''enchanter/enchantress'', ''sorcerer(ess)'', ''druid(ess)'', ''magician'', ''mage'', and ''magus'' have different meanings depending upon context and the story in question.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|619}}

The term ''archmage'', is used in fantasy works as a title for a powerful magician or a leader of magicians.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|1027}}

===Reasons for distinguishing magicians===
[[File:The Love Potion - Evelyn de Morgan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|''[[The Love Potion]]'' by [[Evelyn De Morgan]]]]

In the ''[[Enchanted Forest Chronicles]]'', [[Patricia Wrede]] depicts wizards who use magic based on their staves and magicians who practice several kinds of magic, including wizard magic;{{Clarify|date=September 2016}} in the ''[[Patricia Wrede#Cecelia and Kate|Regency]]'' fantasies, she and [[Caroline Stevermer]] depict magicians as identical to wizards, though inferior in skill and training.

[[Steve Pemberton]]'s ''The Times &amp; Life of Lucifer Jones'' describes the distinction thus: "The difference between a wizard and a sorcerer is comparable to that between, say, a lion and a tiger, but wizards are acutely status-conscious, and to them, it's more like the difference between a lion and a dead kitten."{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[The Belgariad]]'' and ''[[The Malloreon]]'' series, several protagonists refer to their abilities powered by sheer will as "sorcery" and look down on the term "magician", which specifically refers to summoners of demonic agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In role-playing games, the types of magic-users are more delineated and are named so that the players and game masters can know which rules apply.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|385}} [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]] introduced the term "[[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic-user]]" in the original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' as a generic term for a practitioner of magic (in order to avoid the connotations of terms such as ''wizard'' or ''warlock''); this lasted until the second edition of ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', where it was replaced with ''mage'' (later to become ''wizard''). The exact rules vary from game to game.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wizard or mage]], as a [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character class]], is distinguished by the ability to cast certain kinds of magic but being weak in combat; subclasses are distinguished by strengths in some areas of magic and weakness in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David "Zed"|title=Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook|date=1989|publisher=TSR|location=Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|isbn=0880387165|pages=30–31|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Sorcerers]] are distinguished from wizards as having an innate gift with magic, as well as having mystical or magical ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Skip|title=Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook|date=2003|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|location=Renton, Washington|isbn=0786928867|page=51|edition=Special}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warlock (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Warlocks]] are distinguished from wizards as creating forbidden "pacts" with powerful creatures to harness their innate magical gifts.

''Enchanters'' often practice a type of magic that produces no physical effects on objects or people, but rather deceives the observer or target through the use of illusions. Enchantresses in particular practice this form of magic, often to seduce.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|318}} For instance, the [[Lady of the Green Kirtle]] in [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Silver Chair]]'' enchants [[Prince Rilian|Rilian]] into forgetting his father and Narnia; when that enchantment is broken, she attempts further enchantments with a sweet-smelling smoke and a thrumming musical instrument to baffle him and his rescuers into forgetting them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassham|first1=Gregory|title=The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: the Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview|date=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0812695887|page=171|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sorcerer'' is more frequently used when the magician in question is evil. This may derive from its use in [[sword and sorcery]], where the hero would be the sword-wielder, leaving the sorcery for his opponent.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|885}}

''Witch'' also carries evil connotations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[L. Frank Baum]] named [[Glinda]] the "Good Witch of the South" in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. In ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]], ''he dubbed her "Glinda the Good," and from that point forward and in subsequent books, Baum referred to her as a sorceress rather than a witch to avoid the term that was more regarded as evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Michael O.|title=Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum|date=1997|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kansas|isbn=070060832X|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender-based titles===
''Wizard'' and ''warlock'' usually refer to a male, while ''witch'' usually refers to a female.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In ''[[Witch World (novel)|Witch World]]'', a man who anomalously showed the same abilities as a witch was called a warlock. The term ''warlock'' is sometimes used to indicate a male witch in fiction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, either term may be used in a unisex manner, in which case there will be members of both sexes bearing that title. If both terms are used in the same setting, this can indicate a gender-based title for practitioners of identical magic, such as in ''[[Harry Potter]]'', or it can indicate that the two sexes practice different types of magic, as in ''[[Discworld]]''.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|1027}}

==Traits of magicians==
[[File:Saluzzo-Castello della Manta-mago.jpg|thumb|White-haired and white-bearded wizard with robes and [[Pointed hats|hat]]]]
A common motif in fiction is that the ability to use magic is innate and often rare, or gained through a large amount of study and practice.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|616}} In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], it is mostly limited to non-humans, though some people gain small amounts and become known as sorcerers (wizards being powerful spirits).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In many writers' works, it is reserved for a select group of humans,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} such as in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''Harry Potter'' books, [[Katherine Kurtz]]'s ''[[Deryni novels|Deryni]]'' novels, or [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' universe.

==Education==
[[File:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|''The Alchemist'' by [[William Fettes Douglas]]: studying for arcane knowledge]]

Magicians normally learn spells by reading ancient tomes called [[grimoire]]s, which may have magical properties of their own.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|126}} Sorcerers in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' often gained powers from such books, which are demarcated by their strange bindings. In worlds where magic is not an innate trait, the scarcity of these strange books may be a facet of the story; in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Tempest]]'', Prince Rupert seeks out the books of the magician [[Prospero]] to learn magic. The same occurs in the ''Dungeons and Dragons''-based novel series ''Dragonlance Chronicles'', wherein [[Raistlin Majere]] seeks out the books of the sorcerer Fistandantilus.

Some magicians, even after training, continue their education by learning more spells, inventing new ones (and new magical objects), or rediscovering ancient spells, beings, or objects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} For example, [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] from the [[Marvel Universe]] continues to learn about magic even after being named Sorcerer Supreme. He often encounters creatures that haven't been seen for centuries or more. In the same universe, [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] continues to pursue magical knowledge after mastering it by combining magic with science. [[Weasley twins|Fred and George Weasley]] from ''Harry Potter'' invent new magical items and sell them as legitimate defense items.

==Magical materials==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Crystal Ball.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Crystal Ball (painting)|The Crystal Ball]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]]: using material for magical purposes; besides the crystal, a book and a wand]]
Historically, many self-proclaimed magicians have required rare and precious materials, such as [[crystal ball]]s, rare herbs (often picked by prescribed rituals), and chemicals such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. This is less common in fantasy. Many magicians require no materials at all;&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|617}} those that do may require only simple and easily obtained materials. Role-playing games are more likely to require such materials for at least some spells to prevent characters from casting them too easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Doug|last2=Olson|first2=Donald|title=Battleaxe Rpg: Reforged Edition|date=2004|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781442105935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FLMoKdIMogC|accessdate=19 February 2016|pages=167–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wand#Modern popular culture|Wands]] and staves have long been used as requirements for the magician.&lt;ref name="Frye"/&gt;{{rp|152}} The first magical wand was featured in the ''[[Odyssey]],'' used by [[Circe]] to transform Odysseus's men into animals. Italian [[fairy tale]]s put wands into the hands of powerful fairies by the late [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrItalianF.html |title=Italian Faries: ''Fate'', ''Folletti'', and Other Creatures of Legend |first=Raffaella |last=Benvenuto |work=Journal of Mythic Arts |date=2006 |publisher=Endicott Studio |accessdate=2013-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016212139/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrItalianF.html |archivedate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, magical wands are widespread and are used from ''Witch World'' to ''Harry Potter.'' In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf refuses to surrender his own staff, breaking [[Saruman]]'s, which strips the latter of his power. This dependency on a particular magical item is common, and necessary to limit the magician's power for the story's sake – without it, the magician's powers may be weakened or absent entirely.&lt;ref name="Kern"/&gt; In the ''Harry Potter'' universe, a wizard must expend much greater effort and concentration to use magic without a wand, and only a few can control magic without one; taking away a wizard's wand in battle essentially disarms him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm |title=Comic Relief live chat transcript, March 2001|work=Accio Quote! |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of magic==
Nevertheless, many magicians live in pseudo-medieval settings in which their magic is not put to practical use in society; they may serve as mentors, act as quest companions, or even go on a [[quest]] themselves,&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|1027}} but their magic does not build roads or buildings, provide immunizations, construct indoor plumbing, or do any of the other functions served by machinery; their worlds remain at a medieval level of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brin|first1=David|title=Otherness|date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0553295284|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes this is justified by having the negative effects of magic outweigh the positive possibilities.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;{{rp|8}} In Barbara Hambley's ''[[Barbara Hambley#The Windrose Chronicles|Windrose Chronicles]]'', wizards are precisely pledged not to interfere because of the terrible damage they can do. In ''Discworld'', the importance of [[Wizards (Discworld)|wizards]] is that they actively do not do magic, because when wizards have access to lots of "thaumaturgic energy", they develop many psychotic attributes and may eventually destroy the world. This may be a direct effect or the result of a miscast spell wreaking terrible havoc.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;{{rp|142}}

In other works, developing magic is difficult.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In [[Rick Cook]]'s ''[[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry]]'' series, the extreme danger presented by magic and the difficulty of analyzing the magic have stymied magic and left humanity at the mercy of the dangerous [[elves]] until a wizard summons a computer programmer from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] — ours — to apply the skills he learned in our world to magic.

At other times, magic and technology do develop in tandem; this is most common in the [[Alternate history (fiction)#Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre|alternate history]] genre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Patricia Wrede's ''[[Patricia Wrede#Regency fantasy|Regency]]'' fantasies include a Royal Society of Wizards and a technological level equivalent to the actual Regency; [[Randall Garrett]]'s ''[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]'' series, [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Magic, Inc.|Magic, Incorporated]]'', and [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'' all depict modern societies with magic equivalent to twentieth-century technology. In ''Harry Potter'', wizards have magical equivalents to non-magical inventions; sometimes they duplicate them, as with the [[Hogwarts Express|Hogwarts Express train]].

The powers ascribed to magicians often affect their roles in society.{{Original research inline|date=September 2015}} In practical terms, their powers may give them authority; magicians may advise kings, such as Gandalf in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and [[Belgarath]] and [[Polgara the Sorceress]] in [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[The Belgariad]]''. They may be rulers themselves, as in [[E.R. Eddison]]'s ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'', where both the heroes and the villains, although kings and lords, supplement their physical power with magical knowledge, or as in [[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'', where magicians are the governing class.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|1027}} On the other hand, magicians often live like [[hermit]]s, isolated in their towers and often in the wilderness, bringing no change to society. In some works, such as many of [[Barbara Hambly]]'s, they are despised and outcast specifically because of their knowledge and powers.&lt;ref name="Clute"/&gt;{{rp|745}}

In the magic-noir world of the ''[[Dresden Files]]'', wizards generally keep a low profile, though there is no explicit prohibition against interacting openly with non-magical humanity. The protagonist of the series, [[Harry Dresden]], openly advertises in the Yellow Pages under the heading "Wizard" and maintains a business office, though other wizards tend to resent him for practicing his craft openly. Dresden primarily uses his magic to make a living finding lost items and people, performing [[exorcism]]s, and providing protection against the supernatural.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[File:ביאור על התורה.pdf|thumb|right|Title page of the first edition of Rabbi Recanati's commentary on the Torah (Venice, 1523)|page=7]]
'''Menahem ben Benjamin Recanati''' (1223–1290)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=81pbBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=menahem+recanati+1223&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iRNPX_IUca&amp;sig=Dk8FmpTVPqorfsf9AtdkBQpc2NY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb2MCYq5zYAhWISd8KHZfwAbgQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=menahem%20recanati%201223&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-he|מנחם בן בנימין ריקנטי}}) was an [[Italy|Italian]] rabbi who flourished during the thirteenth century . He devoted the chief part of his writings to the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

== Description ==

Menahem Recanati was born in Recanati in 1223 and he died in Recanati in 1290 . In addition to the halachic rulings collected in Piskei Recanati (his only halachic work), Recanati wrote a kabbalistic commentary on the [[Torah]], a commentary on the [[siddur]], and discussions of the [[613 commandments|commandments]]. Piskei Recanati was first published in [[Bologna]], 1538, and was published several times thereafter.

== Works ==
Recanati wrote:
* ''Perush 'Al ha-Torah'' (Venice, 1523), a work full of mystical deductions and meanings based upon a textual interpretation of the [[Bible]]; it describes many visions and celestial revelations claimed to have been experienced by the author, who was influenced by cabalistic ideas, and expresses the highest respect for all cabalistical authors, even the most recent apocryphal ones. The work was republished with a commentary by [[Mordecai Jaffe]], at Lublin in 1595&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1595|script-title=he:לבֿושׁי אור יקרותֿ|trans-title=Mordecai Jaffe's commentary on Recanati|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/11562|language=he|location=Lublin|oclc=233048483|access-date=Jan 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also translated into [[Latin]] by [[Pico di Mirandola]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
* ''Perush ha-Tefillot'' and ''Ṭa'ame ha-Miẓwot,'' published together (Constantinople, 1543–1544; Basel, 1581). Like the preceding work, these are strongly tinctured with German mysticism. Recanati frequently quotes [[Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg|Judah he-Hasid]] of [[Regensburg]], [[Eleazar of Worms]], and their disciples, and alludes also to the Spanish cabalists, [[Nahmanides]] among them. He is rarely original, quoting almost always other authorities. Although Recanati had a high reputation for sanctity, he exercised less influence on his contemporaries than upon posterity. To assist him in his cabalistic researches, he studied logic and [[philosophy]]; and he endeavors to support the cabala by philosophical arguments.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

'''Minoan religion''' was the religion of the [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization]]  of [[Crete]]. Modern scholars have reconstructed it almost totally on the basis of archaeological remains rather than texts.  Minoan religion is considered to have been closely related to Near Eastern prehistoric religions, and its central deity is generally agreed to have been a goddess. Prominent Minoan sacred symbols include the [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] and its horns of consecration, the [[labrys]] (double-headed axe), and the [[serpent (mythology)|serpent]].

==Cultic practice==
Based on archaeological evidence of such as paintings, statuettes, and seal rings, it is clear that the dominant figure in Minoan religion was a goddess, with whom a younger male figure, perhaps a consort or son, is often associated, usually in contexts suggesting that the male figure is a worshiper.  The Goddess was also often associated with animals, especially the snake, but also with bull, lion, and dove.  She seems to have been served by priestesses, but there is no evidence that Minoan religious practice was centered around formal public temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great|last=Bury|first=J.

''Minoan Kingship and the Solar Goddess: A Near Eastern Koine'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Károly Kerényi]] believed that the most important goddess was [[Ariadne]], daughter of [[Minos|King Minos]] and ''mistress of the labyrinth'' who is identified in [[Linear B]] ([[Mycenean Greek]]) tablets in [[Knossos]]. Though the notorious bull-headed [[Minotaur]] is a purely Greek depiction, seals and seal-impressions reveal bird-headed or masked deities. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
[[Image:The Bull Leaper Knossos 1500BC.jpg|thumb|left|The bull leaper from Knossos ([[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]])]]

Retrieval of metal and clay votive figures, [[labrys|double axes]], miniature vessels, models of artifacts, animals, and human figures has identified sites of cult, such as numerous small shrines in Minoan Crete, and mountain peaks and very numerous sacred caves over 300 have been explored were the centers for some [[cult (religion)|cult]], but  temples, as the Greeks developed them, were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1976, p. 18; Burkert 1985, p. 24ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the palace complex, no central rooms devoted to a cult have been recognized other than the center court, where youths of both sexes would practice the [[bull-leaping]] ritual. There are no Minoan frescoes that depict any deities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

One of the cultic figures of ancient Crete and later of the Mycenaeans is known as the [[Minoan Genius]]. This was a fantastic creature with similarities both to the lion and the hippopotamus, which implies a connection with [[ancient Egypt]]. This deity played a role as a protector of children, and also in various fertility rituals.

==Bull-leaping ritual==
{{further|Bull-Leaping Fresco}}
A major festive celebration was exemplified in the famous athletic [[Bull-leaping|Minoan bull dance]], represented at large in the frescoes of Knossos&lt;ref&gt;In the small courtyard of the east wing of the palace of Knossos.&lt;/ref&gt; and inscribed in miniature [[Minoan seal-stones|seal stone]]s.

There is significant debate among scholars as to whether the athletes actually vaulted over the bull. Sir Arthur Evans argued that the Bull-Leaping Fresco depicts acrobats literally seizing the bull by the horns and leaping over the creature’s back.&lt;ref&gt;Callender, 1987, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Others have asserted that the fresco more likely shows young Minoan people attempting to ride the bull and that the act of catching a charging bull and vaulting over it is unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;Marinatos, 1993, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human sacrifice==
Evidence pertaining to Minoans and the practice of [[human sacrifice]] has been found around three sites: (1) [[Anemospilia]], in a MMII building near [[Mount Juktas]], interpreted as a temple, (2) an EMII sanctuary complex at [[Fournou Korifi]] in south central Crete, and (3) [[Knossos]], in an LMIB building known as the "North House." (''[[Minoan civilization#Chronology and history|explanation of abbreviations]]'')

The temple at Anemospilia was destroyed by earthquake in the MMII period. The building seems to be a tripartite shrine, and terracotta feet and some carbonized wood were interpreted by the excavators as the remains of a cult statue. Four human skeletons were found in its ruins; one, belonging to a young man, was found in an unusually contracted position on a raised platform, suggesting that he had been trussed up for sacrifice, much like the bull in the sacrifice scene on the Mycenaean-era [[Agia Triadha]] sarcophagus. A bronze dagger was among his bones, and the discoloration of the bones on one side of his body suggests he died of blood loss. The bronze blade was fifteen inches long and had images of a boar on each side. The bones were on a raised platform at the center of the middle room, next to a pillar with a trough at its base.

The positions of the other three skeletons suggest that an earthquake caught them by surprise—the skeleton of a twenty-eight-year-old woman was spread-eagled on the ground in the same room as the sacrificed male. Next to the sacrificial platform was the skeleton of a man in his late thirties, with broken legs. His arms were raised, as if to protect himself from falling debris, which suggests that his legs were broken by the collapse of the building in the earthquake. In the front hall of the building was the fourth skeleton, too poorly preserved to allow determination of age or gender. Nearby 105 fragments of a clay vase were discovered, scattered in a pattern that suggests it had been dropped by the person in the front hall when he was struck by debris from the collapsing building. The jar appears to have contained bull's blood.

Unfortunately, the excavators of this site have not published an official excavation report; the site is mainly known through a 1981 article in ''National Geographic'' (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellerakis 1981.)

Not all agree that this was human sacrifice. Nanno Marinatos says the man supposedly sacrificed died in the earthquake that hit at the time he died. She notes that this earthquake destroyed the building, and killed the two Minoans who supposedly sacrificed him. She also argues that the building was not a temple and that the evidence for sacrifice "is far from&amp;nbsp;... conclusive."&lt;ref&gt;Marinatos 1993, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Hughes concurs and argues that the platform where the man lay was not necessarily an altar, and the blade was probably a spearhead that may not have been placed on the young man, but could have fallen during the earthquake from shelves or an upper floor.

At the sanctuary-complex of Fournou Korifi, fragments of a human skull were found in the same room as a small hearth, cooking-hole, and cooking-equipment. This skull has been interpreted as the remains of a sacrificed victim.&lt;ref&gt;Gessell 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations at [[Knossos]] uncovered additional mass burials, revealing the practice of [[child sacrifice]] as well. The British School of Athens, led by [[Peter Warren (archaeologist)|Peter Warren]], excavated a mass grave of sacrifices, particularly children. The findings also suggest they were victims of cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Castleden, Minoans. Life in Bronze Age Crete (illustrated by the author), London-New York, Routledge,pp 170-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=g8eIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=peter+warren+child+sacrifice&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eyOXotbJu0&amp;sig=fvVHn_z1n265pokQ4CvWoRqdHMQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjgs_5sNzaAhWF7VMKHUCTCbMQ6AEwA3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20warren%20child%20sacrifice&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|clear evidence that their flesh was carefully cut away, much in the manner of sacrificed animals. In fact the bones of slaughtered sheep were found with those of the children...Moreover, as far as the bones are concerned, the children appear to have been in good health. Startling as it may seem, the available evidence so far points to an argument that the children were slaughtered and their flesh cooked and possibly eaten in a sacrifice ritual made in the service of a nature deity to assure an annual renewal of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Warren, "Knossos: New Excavations and Discoveries," Archaeology (July /August 1984): p. 48-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minoan Crete and Ecstatic Religion: Preliminary Observations on the 1979 Excavations at Knossos. Peter Warren. 1981&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Furthermore, Rodney Castleden, details the findings at a sanctuary near Knossos where the remains of a seventeen year old boy was sacrificed.
{{quote|His ankles had evidently been tied and his legs folded up to make him fit on the table...He had been ritually murdered with the long bronze dagger engraved with a boar's head that laid besides him.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden, Rodney. (2012). The Knossos labyrinth: A New View of the ‘Palace of Minos’ at Knossos, pp 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the "North House" at Knossos, the bones of at least four children (who had been in good health) were found which bore signs that "they were butchered in the same way the Minoans slaughtered their sheep and goats, suggesting that they had been sacrificed and eaten. The senior Cretan archaeologist Nicolas Platon was so horrified at this suggestion that he insisted the bones must be those of apes, not humans."&lt;ref&gt;MacGillivray 2000, ''Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth"'' p.312-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The bones, found by Peter Warren, date to Late Minoan IB (1580-1490), before the Myceneans arrived (in LM IIIA, c. 1320-1200) according to [[Paul Rehak]] and John G. Younger.&lt;ref&gt;"Review of Aegean Prehistory VII: Neopalatial, Final Palatial, and Postpalatial Crete," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 102 (1998), pp. 91-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Hughes and Rodney Castleden argue that these bones were deposited as a 'secondary burial'. Secondary burial is the not-uncommon practice of burying the dead twice: immediately following death, and then again after the flesh is gone from the skeleton. The main weakness of this argument is that it does not explain the type of cuts and knife marks upon the bones.

==Burial and mortuary practice ==
Like much of the archaeology of the Bronze Age, burial remains constitute much of the material and archaeological evidence for the period. By the end of the Second Palace Period Minoan burial practice is dominated by two broad forms: 'Circular Tombs', or ''Tholoi'', (located in South Crete) and 'House Tombs', (located in the north and the east). Of course, there are many trends and patterns within Minoan mortuary practice that do not conform to this simple breakdown. Over all, [[inhumation]] was the most popular form of burial, cremation does not seem to have been a popular means of burial in Bronze Age Crete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinclair Hood]] (1971) "The Minoans; the story of Bronze Age Crete" pp. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period there is a trend towards individual burials, with some distinguished exceptions. These include the much-debated Chrysolakkos complex, Mallia, consisting of a number of buildings forming a complex. This is located in the centre of Mallia's burial area and may have been the focus for burial rituals, or the 'crypt' for a notable family.

These tombs often evidence group burial, where more than one body is deposited. These may represent the burial crypts for generations of a kin group, or of a particular settlement where the individuals are not closely related and shared in the construction of the tomb. The 'house tomb' at Gournia is a typical example, where the construction consisted of a clay and reed roof, topping a mud-brick and stone base. At Ayia Photia certain rock-cut chamber tombs may have been used solely for the burial of children, indicating complex burial patterns that differed from region to region. Mortuary furniture and grave goods varied widely, but could include storage jars, bronze articles such as tools and weapons, and beauty articles such as pendants. Little is known about mortuary rituals, or the stages through which the deceased passed before final burial, but it has been indicated that 'toasting rituals' may have formed a part of this, suggested by the prevalence of drinking vessels found at some tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, O (1994) pg. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods (EM III) a trend towards singular burials, usually in clay ''Pithoi'' (large storage vessels), is observed throughout Crete, replacing the practice of built tombs. Equally, the introduction of ''Larnake'' or ''Larnax'' burials emerges, where the body was deposited in a clay or wooden sarcophagus. These coffins were often richly decorated with motifs and scenes similar to those of the earlier fresco and vase painting tradition. However, rock-cut tombs and Tholoi remained in use even by the LM III period, including the site of Phylaki.

The distribution of burial sites varies in time and space. Some functional demands may have influenced the decision to locate a cemetery: the Late Minoan rock-cut tombs at Armeni utilise the geography of the area for structural support, where chambers are dug deep into the rock. Generally, cemeteries tend to cluster in regions close to settled areas. The Mochlos cemetery, for example, would have served the inhabitants of that island who settled in the south of the area. The cemetery itself has been interpreted to indicate a visible hierarchy, perhaps indicating social differentiation within the local population; larger, monumental tombs for the 'èlite', and smaller tombs, including some early ''Pithoi'' burials, for the larger part of the population.

The German geologist Hans Georg Wunderlich argued that the Palace of Knossos itself was a mortuary temple.&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret of Crete, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is strongly rejected by mainstream archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Branigan, ''review'' of ''The Secret of Crete'', ''The Geographical Journal'' '''144''':3:502, November, 1978. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/634841 at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy in Mycenaean and classical Greek tradition==
[[Walter Burkert]] warns, "To what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenaean religion is a question which has not yet found a conclusive answer".&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Burkert suggests that useful parallels will be found in the relations between Etruscan and Archaic Greek culture and religion, or between Roman and Hellenistic culture. Minoan religion has not been transmitted in its own language, and the uses literate Greeks later made of surviving Cretan [[mytheme]]s, after centuries of purely oral transmission, have transformed the meager sources: consider the Athenian point of view of the [[Theseus]] legend. A few Cretan names are preserved in [[Greek mythology]], but there is no way to connect a name with an existing Minoan icon such as the familiar [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]-goddess.

However Μ. Nilsson &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Nilsson | first=M. | title=Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion | year=1967 | publisher=C.F. Beck Verlag | location=München, DE|}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that the origin of the Greek goddess [[Athena]] was the Minoan snake-goddess, citing that Athena was closely related with snakes.

[[Plutarch]] (''The Intelligence of Animals'' 983) mentions the horn altar (''keraton'') associated with [[Theseus]], which survived on [[Delos]]: "I saw, the Altar of Horn, celebrated as one of the Seven Wonders of the World because it needs no glue or any other binding, but is joined and fastened together, made entirely of horns taken from the right side of the head."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Plutarch – On the Intelligence of Animals (De sollertia animalium): 975C–985C |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Intelligence_of_Animals*/C.html#note385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisourcelang|ta|நாலடியார்|Nālaṭiyār}}
{{Sangam literature}}
{{Jainism}}
The '''Nālaṭiyār''' ({{lang-ta|நாலடியார்}}) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetic work of [[didacticism|didactic]] nature belonging to the ''[[Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku]]'' anthology of [[Tamil literature]]. This belongs to the post [[Sangam period|Sangam]] period corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. ''Nālaṭiyār'' contains 400 poems, each containing four lines. Every poem deals with morals and ethics, extolling righteous behaviour. 

There is an old Tamil proverb praising the ''Nālaṭiyār'' that says "''Nālaṭiyār'' and the ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' are very good in expressing human thoughts just as the twigs of the banyan and the neem trees are good in maintaining the teeth."

:ஆலும் வேலும் பல்லுக்குறுதி; நாலும் இரண்டும் சொல்லுக்குறுதி.&lt;br&gt;
:(''Aalum vaelum pallukkuruthi; naalum irandum sollukkuruthi'')&lt;br&gt;
:Literal translation: "Banyan and neem maintain oral health; Four and Two maintain moral health."&lt;br&gt;
:(Here "Four" and "Two" refer to the quatrains and couplets of Nālaṭiyār and Tirukkuṛaḷ, respectively.)

==Didactic nature==
''Nālaṭiyār'' was composed by [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]].{{sfn|Sheldon Pollock|2003|p=293}} It is divided into three sections, the first section focusing on the importance of virtuous life, second section on the governance and management of wealth, and the third smaller section on the pleasures.

''Nālaṭiyār'' is unique in the employment of similes, which help to teach the moral codes using simple examples from daily life. For example, one of the poems  states that just like a calf placed in front of a vast herd of cows seeks out its mother unerringly and attaches itself, the deeds of the past home in on the doer and exact their price unfailingly.

==Commentaries and translations==
Naladiyar remains the highly praised ancient didactic text in Tamil next only to the Tirukkural. Several commentaries have appeared on the text, which includes three ancient commentaries. The three ancient commentaries were those by Padumanar, [[Dharumar]] (who has also written commentary on the Tirukkural), and an anonymous poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Patach Eliyahu''''' ({{Hebrew|פָּתַח אֵלִיָּהוּ}}, "[[Elijah]] opened") is an [[Aramaic]], [[Kabbalistic]] discourse from the introduction to [[Tikunei Zohar]] 17a. It is named after its initial words, where it is attributed to [[Elijah]] the Prophet. Considered a foundational text of Kabbalah, Patach Eliyahu is known for enumerating and summarizing the [[sefirot]], corresponding them to parts of the body, and describing the infiniteness and uniqueness of God.&lt;ref&gt;p. 159, ''The Thirteen Petalled Rose'' by R. Adin Steinsaltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in prayer==
[[Sephardim]] recite ''Patach Eliyahu'' every morning as part of the order for the morning blessings before [[Shacharit]]. [[Chassidim]] who pray according to the [[nusach]] of [[Arizal]] as compiled by Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] recite it every Friday before the [[Minchah]] prayer as a preparation for [[Shabbat]]. [[Ashkenazim]] do not generally recite Patach Eliyahu in the course of prayer.

==English translation==
''Paragraph breaks and section headings are the translator's&lt;ref&gt;This is a free translation into English that I, Musashiaharon, created myself from the original Aramaic source. I hereby irrevocably license it under CC-BY-SA 3.0 and GFDL.&lt;/ref&gt; and are not present in the original text. Square brackets [] mark explanatory material inserted by the translator.''

===Opening===
:Elijah opened and said:

:Master of [[Four Worlds|the worlds]]! You are One, but not in number. You are He Who is Highest of the High, Most Hidden of the Hidden; no thought can grasp You at all.

===Introduction to the Sefirot===
:You are He Who dispatched ten rectifications and called them ten [[sefirot]], with which to conduct the hidden worlds which are not revealed and the revealed worlds. And with them You conceal Yourself from humankind. And You are He Who binds them and unifies them, and to the extent that You are within them, anyone who will separate one among these ten [[sefirot]] from its fellows is considered as if he made a separation within You.

:And these ten [[sefirot]] proceed according to their order: one long [the right axis] one short [the left axis] and one intermediate [the middle axis]. And You are He who conducts them, and there is no one who conducts You, neither above, nor below, nor from any side.

:You arranged garments for them, from which fly souls to mankind. And You arranged many bodies for them, which are called "bodies" compared to "garments" which cover them and are named in this arrangement:

===Anatomical arrangement of the Sefirot===
:[[Chesed]] [Loving-kindness], the right arm. [[Gevurah]] [Might, severity], the left arm.

:[[Tiferet]] [Harmony], the torso.

:[[Netzach]] [Victory] and [[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]] [Glory] the two thighs.

:[[Yesod]] [Foundation, bonding], the culmination of the body, the sign of the Holy Covenant [the [[circumcision]]].

:[[Malchut]] [Kingship], the mouth; she is called the [[Oral Torah]].

:[[Chochmah]] [Wisdom], the brain; that is inner thought. [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] [Understanding], the heart; with her, the heart understands. Of these two, it is written ([[Deuteronomy]] 29:28), "The hidden things belong to Havayah Elokeinu [the L‑rd our G‑d]."

:Supernal [[Keter]] [Crown] - this is the Crown of Kingship [Keter of Malchut; alt. this Keter is Malchut], and regarding her it is said ([[Isaiah]] 46:10), "From the beginning [Keter] He tells the end [Malchut]." And this is the skull of the inner [[tefillin]]; that is the 45-Name [the Divine Name "Mah", spelled {{Hebrew|יו"ד ה"א וא"ו ה"א}}], which is the path of [[Atzilut]].

===The nature of the flow of Divine Life-Force===
:And this waters the Tree in its limbs and its branches, just as water waters the Tree and it grows itself with this watering.

:Master of the Worlds! You are He Who is the Cause of causes and the Source of sources, Who waters the Tree with this flow. And this flow - it is like a soul to the body, because it is Life for the body.

:And there is no image or likeness of You, inside or out.

:And You created the Heavens and the earth, and sent out from them the sun, the moon, the stars [planets included] and the constellations. And on earth [You sent out], trees, grasses, the Garden of Eden, shrubs, beasts, animals, birds, fish and humankind - to make known through them the things on High, and how You conduct the things on High and Below, and how You make known to them the things on High from the things Below, and there is none that knows You at all.

===Divine Unity and Uniqueness===
:And aside from You, there is no unity on High or Below. And You are acknowledged [as] the Cause of everything and the Master of everything.

:And every [[sefirah]] has a known Name, and with these are the angels called. But You have no known Name, because You are He Who fills all [[Names of God in Judaism|Names]]. And You are the completion of them all. And as soon as You remove Yourself from them, all the Names remain like a body without a soul.

===Unknowable transcendence and Divine Justice===
:You are He Who is Wise, but not with a knowable wisdom; You are He Who is Understanding, but not with a knowable understanding. You have no known place.

:But rather, to make known Your Power and Might to humankind, and to show them how You conduct the world with Justice and Mercy, because there is Righteousness and Judgement according to the deeds of humankind.

:Justice is [[Gevurah]]; Judgement, the righteous median Pillar; Holy Kingship, the righteous Scales, the two Balance-pans of Truth; the righteous Measure, the sign of the Holy Covenant. All is to show how You conduct the world, but not that You have a known righteousness that is just, nor a known judgement that is merciful, nor any of these attributes at all.

===Conclusion===
:Blessed is Havayah forever, [alt. Draw Havayah down to the world] amen and amen!

Patupaiarehe, also referred to as Turehu, Ngati Hotu and Urukehu (red heads), were said to live in large guarded communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/patupaiarehe/1 "Patupaiarehe and ponaturi"], Te Ara website&lt;/ref&gt; They tended to occur in certain localities, especially hilly or mountainous regions. In the North Island, these included [[Mt Pirongia]] in the [[Waikato]], the [[Coromandel Range]] from [[Mt Moehau]] to Mt [[Te Aroha]], the [[Rotorua]] hills, the [[Urewera Ranges]], and the [[Waitākere Ranges]] near present-day [[Auckland]]. In the [[South Island]], they inhabited the hills of [[Banks Peninsula]], the Takitimu range, and the hills between [[Lake Brunner]] and the [[Arahura River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/first-peoples-in-maori-tradition/5 "Patupaiarehe, tūrehu and other inhabitants"], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cowan, James|authorlink=James Cowan (New Zealand writer)|year=1925 |title=Fairy Folk Tales of the Maori |publisher=[[Whitcombe and Tombs]] |location=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another little-known term for these fairy-like folk was pakehakeha, which has been suggested as a possible origin of the word [[Pākehā]], used to refer to Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_54_1945/Volume_54,_No._4/Origins_of_the_words_Pakeha_and_Maori,_by_Sidney_J._Baker,_p_223-231?action=null "ORIGINS OF THE WORDS PAKEHA AND MAORI"], Sidney J.

'''''Petit Albert''''' (English: ''Lesser Albert'') is an 18th-century [[grimoire]] of natural and cabalistic [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magnus |first=Albertus |authorlink= Albertus Magnus |title= Secrets merveilleux de la magie naturelle et cabalistique du petit Albert.

Brought down to the smallest hamlets in the saddlebags of salesmen, it represents a phenomenal publishing success, despite its evil reputation -- or because of it. It is associated with a second work, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Grand Albert|fr}}''. It is a composite or heterogeneous work, and perhaps a bric-a-brac, collecting texts of unequal value written by (or attributed to) various authors; most of these authors are anonymous, but some are notable such as [[Cardano]] and [[Paracelsus]]. It's a relatively old text, although the attribution to Albertus Magnus is dubious, particularly as it quotes from so many later sources.

'''''Picatrix''''' is the name used today, for a 400-page book of magic and astrology originally written in Arabic under the title غاية الحكيم '''''Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm''''', which most scholars assume was originally written in the middle of the 11th century,&lt;ref&gt;e.g Dozy, Holmyard, Samsó, and Pingree; [[David Pingree]], 'Some of the Sources of the Ghāyat al-hakīm', in'' Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 43, (1980), p. 2; Willy Hartner, 'Notes On Picatrix', in ''Isis'', Vol. 56, No. 4, (Winter, 1965), pp. 438&lt;/ref&gt; though an argument for composition in the first half of the 10th century has been made.&lt;ref&gt;Sex[[Maribel Fierro]], "Bāṭinism in Al-Andalus. Maslama b. Qāsim al-Qurṭubī (died 353/964), Author of the 'Rutbat al- Ḥakīm' and the 'Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm (Picatrix)'" in: ''Studia Islamica'', No. 84, (1996), pp. 87–112.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic title translates as '''''The Aim of the Sage''''' or '''''The Goal of The Wise'''''.&lt;ref&gt;However the Arabic translated as "goal" (''ghaya'', pl. ''ghayat'') also suggests the sense of "utmost limit" or "boundary".&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic work was translated into Spanish and then into Latin during the 13th century, at which time it got the Latin title ''Picatrix''. The book's title ''Picatrix'' is also sometimes used to refer to the book's author.

''Picatrix'' is a composite work that synthesizes older works on [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[astrology]]. One of the most influential interpretations suggests it is to be regarded as a "handbook of talismanic magic".&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', Chicago, 1964; Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', Chicago, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Another researcher summarizes it as "the most thorough exposition of celestial magic in Arabic", indicating the sources for the work as "Arabic texts on [[Hermeticism]], [[Sabianism]], [[Ismailism]], [[Islamic astrology|astrology]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|alchemy]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] produced in the [[Near East]] in the ninth and tenth centuries A.D."&lt;ref&gt;David Pingree, 'Some of the Sources of the Ghāyat al-hakīm', in'' Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 43, (1980), pp. 1–15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugenio Garin]] declares, "In reality the Latin version of the ''Picatrix'' is as indispensable as the [[Hermetica|''Corpus Hermeticum'']] or the writings of [[Albumasar]] for understanding a conspicuous part of the production of the Renaissance, including the figurative arts."&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Garin, ''Astrology in the Renaissance: The Zodiac of Life'', Routledge, 1983, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; It has significantly influenced West European [[esotericism]] from [[Marsilio Ficino]] in the 15th century, to [[Tommaso Campanella|Thomas Campanella]] in the 17th century. The manuscript in the [[British Library]] passed through several hands: [[Simon Forman]], [[Richard Napier]], [[Elias Ashmole]] and [[William Lilly]].

According to the prologue of the Latin translation, ''Picatrix'' was translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] from the Arabic by order of [[Alphonso X of Castile]] at some time between 1256 and 1258.&lt;ref&gt;David Pingree, 'Between the Ghāya and Picatrix. I: The Spanish Version', in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 44, (1981), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin version was produced sometime later, based on translation of the Spanish manuscripts. It has been attributed to Maslama ibn Ahmad [[al-Majriti]] (an Andalusian [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]]), but many have called this attribution into question. Consequently, the author is sometimes indicated as "Pseudo-Majriti".

The Spanish and Latin versions were the only ones known to Western scholars until Wilhelm Printz discovered an Arabic version in or around 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Willy Hartner, 'Notes On Picatrix', in ''Isis'', Vol. 56, No. 4, (Winter, 1965), pp. 438–440; the Arabic text was published for the first time by the Warburg Library in 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and sources==
The work is divided into six books, which exhibit a marked absence of systematic exposition. [[Jean Seznec]] observed, "''Picatrix'' prescribes propitious times and places and the attitude and gestures of the suppliant; he also indicates what terms must be used in petitioning the stars." As an example, Seznec then reproduces a prayer to Saturn from the work, noting that [[Fritz Saxl]] has pointed out that this invocation exhibits "the accent and even the very terms of a Greek astrological prayer to Kronos. This is one indication that the sources of ''Picatrix'' are in large part Hellenistic.":

{{quote|O Master of sublime name and great power, supreme Master; O Master Saturn: Thou, the Cold, the Sterile, the Mournful, the Pernicious; Thou, whose life is sincere and whose word sure; Thou, the Sage and Solitary, the Impenetrable; Thou, whose promises are kept; Thou who art weak and weary; Thou who hast cares greater than any other, who knowest neither pleasure nor joy; Thou, the old and cunning, master of all artifice, deceitful, wise, and judicious; Thou who bringest prosperity or ruin, and makest men to be happy or unhappy! I conjure thee, O Supreme Father, by Thy great benevolence and Thy generous bounty, to do for me what I ask [...]&lt;ref&gt;Jean Seznec (Trans. Barbara F. Sessions), ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods: The Mythological Tradition and its Place in Renaissance Humanism and Art'', Princeton University Press, 1995 (reprint), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Garin:
{{quote|The work's point of departure is the unity of reality divided into symmetrical and corresponding degrees, planes or worlds: a reality stretched between two poles: the original One, God the source of all existence, and man, the microcosm, who, with his science (''scientia'') brings the dispersion back to its origin, identifying and using their correspondences.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Garin, ''Astrology in the Renaissance: The Zodiac of Life'', Routledge, 1983, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the Prologue, the author researched over two hundred works in the creation of ''Picatrix''. &lt;ref&gt;Later in the text, the author specifies two hundred fifty works. Bakhouche, ''Picatrix'', p 37, 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are three significant Near/Middle Eastern influences: [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]], the [[Brethren of Purity]], and [[ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''[[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] Agriculture''. The influence of Jabir ibn Hayyan comes in the form of a cosmological background that removes magical practices from the context of diabolical influences and reasserts these practices as having a divine origin. The author of ''Picatrix'' utilizes [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic theories]] of [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] that mirror the work of ibn Hayyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pingree|first1=David|authorlink1=David Pingree|last2=al-Majriti|first2=Maslama|authorlink2=Maslama al-Majriti|title=Picatrix: The Latin Version of the Ghayat Al-Hakim : Text, Introduction, Appendices, Indices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acnXjgEACAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Warburg Institute University of London|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Bakhouche, ''Picatrix'', pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship and significance of title==
The Arab historian, [[Ibn Khaldun]], ascribed authorship of ''Picatrix'' (referring to the original Arabic version, under the title ''Ġāyat al-Ḥakīm'') to a mathematician called al-Majriti, who died between 1005CE and 1008CE (398 AH).&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Garin, ''Astrology in the Renaissance: The Zodiac of Life'', Routledge, 1983, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Holmyard, the earliest manuscript attribution of the work to Maslama al-Majriti was made by the alchemist [[al-Jildaki]], who died shortly after 1360, while Ibn Khaldun died some 20 years later. However, no biography of al-Majriti mentions him as the author of this work.&lt;ref&gt;Maribel Fierro, Bāṭinism in Al-Andalus. Maslama b. Qāsim al-Qurṭubī (died 353/964), Author of the ''Rutbat al- Ḥakīm'' and the ''Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm (Picatrix)'', in ''Studia Islamica'', No. 84, (1996), p. 93, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent attributions of authorship range from "the Arabic version is anonymous" to reiterations of the old claim that the author is "the celebrated astronomer and mathematician Abu l-Qasim Maslama b. Ahmad Al-Majriti".&lt;ref&gt;H. Kahane et al. 'Picatrix and the talismans', in ''Romance Philology'', xix, 1966, p 575; E.J. Holmyard, 'Maslama al-Majriti and the Rutba 'l-Hakim', in ''Isis'', vi, 1924, p 294.&lt;/ref&gt; One recent study in ''Studia Islamica'' suggests that the authorship of this work should be attributed to Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi (died 353/964), who according to Ibn al-Faradi was "a man of charms and talismans".&lt;ref&gt;Maribel Fierro, 'Bāṭinism in Al-Andalus. Maslama b. Qāsim al-Qurṭubī (died 353/964), Author of the "Rutbat al- Ḥakīm" and the "Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm (Picatrix)"', in ''Studia Islamica'', No. 84, (1996), pp. 87–112&lt;/ref&gt; If this suggestion is correct it would place the work in the context of [[Andalusia]]n [[sufism]] and [[Batin (Islam)|batinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Maribel Fierro, 'Bāṭinism in Al-Andalus. Maslama b. Qāsim al-Qurṭubī (died 353/964), Author of the "Rutbat al- Ḥakīm" and the "Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm (Picatrix)"', in ''Studia Islamica'', No. 84, (1996), pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;

The odd Latin title is sometimes explained as a sloppy transliteration of one "Buqratis", mentioned several times in the second of the four books of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Willy Hartner, 'Notes On Picatrix', in ''Isis'', Vol. 56, No. 4, (Winter, 1965), pp. 438&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested that the title (or the name of the author) is a way of attributing the work to Hippocrates (via a transcription of the name ''Burqratis'' or ''Biqratis'' in the Arabic text).&lt;ref&gt;Bakhouche, Beatrice, Frederic Fauquier, and Brigitte Perez-Jean (Translators), ''Picatrix: Un traite de magie medieval'', Turnhout: Brepols, p. 22 and 141&lt;/ref&gt; Where it appears in the Arabic original, the Latin text does translate the name Burqratis as ''Picatrix'', but this still does not establish the identity of Burqratis. Ultimately, linking the name, Picatrix, with [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, Hellmut and Martin Plessner (translators), ''"Picatrix:" Das Ziel des Weisen von Pseudo-Magriti.'' London: Warburg Institute, 1962. p.XXII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Willy Hartner, 'Notes On Picatrix', in ''Isis'', Vol. 56, No. 4, (Winter, 1965), pp. 438&lt;/ref&gt; has fallen into disfavor because the text separately cites Hippocrates under the name ''Ypocras''.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhouche, ''Picatrix'', p. 22, 193, 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticipation of experimental method==
Martin Plessner suggests that a translator of the ''Picatrix'' established a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] definition of [[Experiment|scientific experiment]] by changing a passage in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of the Arabic original, establishing a theoretical basis for the experimental method: "the invention of an hypothesis in order to explain a certain natural process, then the arranging of conditions under which that process may intentionally be brought about in accordance with the hypothesis, and finally, the justification or refutation of the hypothesis, depending on the outcome of the experiment".

Plessner notes that it is generally agreed that awareness of, "the specific nature of the experimental method–as distinct from the practical use of it–is an achievement of the 16th and 17th centuries." However, as the passage by the translator of the Hebrew version makes clear, the fundamental theoretical basis for the experimental method was here established prior to the middle of the 13th century.

The original passage in Arabic describes how a man who witnessed a treatment for a scorpion's sting (drinking a potion of [[frankincense]] that had received [[Seal (emblem)|seal imprints]]) had gone on to experiment with different types of frankincense, assuming that this was the cause for the cure, but later found that the seal images were the cause for the cure, regardless of the substance upon which they were impressed. The author of the ''Picatrix'' goes on to explain how the explanation of the effectiveness of cures passed on to him by authorities was then proved to him by his own experience.

The Hebrew translator changed the passage in question to include the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And that was the reason which incited me [to devote myself to astrological magic]. Moreover, these secrets were already made known by Nature, and the experience approved them. The man dealing with nature has nothing to do but producing a reason of what the experience has brought out.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plessner also notes that "neither the Arabic psychology of study nor the Hebrew definition of the experiment is rendered in the Latin ''Picatrix''. The Latin translator omits many theoretical passages throughout the work."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Plessner, "A Medieval Definition of Scientific Experiment in The Hebrew ''Picatrix''" in: ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 36, (1973), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pranami'''(Meaning: Those who bows on), also known as '''Dhami''', is a [[Vaishnavism]] sub-tradition within [[Hinduism]], focussed on god [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toffin|first1=Gerard|title=The Politics of Belonging in the Himalayas: Local Attachments and Boundary Dynamics|year =2011|pages= 144–152|publisher= SAGE Publishers| isbn= 978-8132105244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BakshiRalhan2008p205"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma2013p11"/&gt; The tradition emerged in the 17th century in Western India, based on the teachings of [[Bhakti]] saints, Sri Devchandra Maharaj and his foremost disciple Sri Mehraj Thakur (also known as Mahamati Prannath or Prananath, which gives this tradition the name).&lt;ref name=X/&gt;

The tradition grew after [[Mughal Empire]] declined, in the wake of [[Aurangzeb]]'s religious persecution of non-Muslims, when Hindu rebellion led to new kingdoms. King [[Chhatrasal]] of one such kingdom of [[Bundelkhand]] patronized Prannath. The Pranami tradition welcomed Hindus and Muslims to join the Supreme Truth Akshrateet Shri Krishna worship tradition. At conversion initiation, Prannath would invite the new members to dine together regardless of whether they came from Hindu or Muslim background. He would also explain the Pranami ideas by citing Hindu and Muslim texts to make his teachings connect with the background of the converts.&lt;ref name="Sharma2013p11"/&gt;

[[File:Revelation 12 Sign.gif|thumb|The alignment on September 23, 2017]]
The '''Revelation 12 sign prophecy''' was an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic belief]] that suggested an astronomical alignment on September 23, 2017 fulfilled the first two verses of Revelation 12.  This date coincided with the Autumnal equinox and the end of the Catholic September [[Ember days|Ember Days]]. This theory, promoted by a number of Christians and Christian news organizations, proposed that a literal fulfillment of the prophecy made in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:1-2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12:1-2&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 12:1-2 - ,King James Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred on this date over [[Jerusalem]]. Others maintained caution while nevertheless marveling at the coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Can the Church at least be cautious?|url=http://watchfortheday.org/caution.html|website=watchfortheday.org|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the [[New Testament]] in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:1-3 describes "a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth." ([[New International Version|NIV]]).&lt;ref name="Rev12"&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0769.html Saunder, Rev. William.

Some of the most common Christian interpretations of this passage interpret the woman as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] or [[ancient Israel]], the man child as the [[incarnation of Jesus|incarnate Jesus]] and the (''teknon) child being'' the Body of Christ, and the woman's other offspring as the Church that forms during the tribulation.&lt;ref name="Rev12"/&gt;

==Overview==

On April 7, 2011, William Tapley's channel ThirdEagleBooks published the first video about the alignment entitled "Stellarium" giving the 2017 date of the great sign and explaining how the planetary alignment that year matched the text of Revelation 12 better than a 2011 alignments, which he said three earlier videos from other people had mentioned.&lt;ref name="tapley"/&gt; A few months later, on July 30, 2011, Scott Clarke from ERF Ministries posted a video on [[YouTube]] describing the alignment, which some people worldwide have now come to believe is the Revelation 12 sign.
During 2011, Scott Clarke continued to popularize the alignment on YouTube. On December 10, 2012, [[Unsealed World News]] suggested that the purported sign might be connected to the [[rapture]] of the Church, though they have repeatedly stated that the exact date of the rapture is unknown and might happen sometime before, on, or after September 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God's Calendar: A Shocking Story|date=December 10, 2012 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2012/12/gods-redemptive-calendar-shocking-story.html |access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Greg Lauer posted about the astronomical alignment and references Scott Clarke's reports on his website dated May 2017 that Lu Vega claimed that he discovered the sign about 2008 but told no one until after several others posted about it in 2011.&lt;ref name="ALittleStrength"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alittlestrength.com/articles/2017/1705-exit-sign.htm|title=The Exit Sign|last=Lauer|first=Greg|date=May 2017|website=A Little Strength|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2017, Luis ("Lu") B. Vega connected the sign to a "Conception Comet".&lt;ref name="ALittleStrength" /&gt;

The [[Apocalypse of John]] describes "a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head." The proponents of the ''Revelation 12 Sign'' say that the woman represents the constellation Virgo and the crown of twelve stars represents the nine stars of the constellation Leo in conjunction with Mercury, Mars, and Venus. The moon appears to be under the "feet" of the constellation Virgo in September 2017 and the sun will be passing through the constellation, which they say is what is meant by the woman being "clothed with the sun".&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt; The second verse of the twelfth chapter of [[Apocalypse of John|John's Apocalypse]] goes on to say that the woman "was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth."  Some people suggest this will be fulfilled because the planet [[Jupiter]] will be traversing the constellation after having undergone [[apparent retrograde motion]].  After entering what they perceive to be Virgo's "womb" around November 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="FiveDoves"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fivedoves.com/letters/july2017/luisv730.htm|title=Revelation 12 sign - Conception Comet C/2017 E1|website=www.fivedoves.com|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter exits the lower part of the "womb" 42 weeks later, which is the approximate length of a human gestation (normal gestation periods lasting from 37 to 42 weeks).
[[File:Preg web final.gif|right|thumb|400px|The 42 week gestation of Jupiter]]

It was also discovered that the apparent retrograde of [[Jupiter]] in the womb of Virgo was preceded by C/2017 E1 (Comet Borisov) which is being called the ''Conception Comet''.  This comet traveled from the loins of the constellation Leo to the womb of the constellation Virgo on November 17, 2016,&lt;ref name="FiveDoves" /&gt; just before the entrance of Jupiter into the womb.  Some proponents of the Revelation 12 Sign are suggesting that this comet represented the divine insemination of the woman, which subsequently produced the male child (Jupiter). This will be the comet's only trip through our solar system as it is not a solar orbital. The complete astronomical alignment occurred on September 23, 2017, over Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;

The Revelation 12 Sign may have coincided with the [[High Holy Day]] of [[Rosh Hashanah]] on the Jewish calendar, which is also called the ''Feast of Trumpets''. The Feast of Trumpets is the first of the Fall Feasts and its timing is traditionally based on the visibility of the new moon,&lt;ref name=templewitness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeinstitute.org/rosh_hashana/late_arrival.htm |title=The Temple Institute: Rosh HaShana in the Holy Temple: The Late Arrival of a Witness |accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2017 is expected to either begin on the evening of September 21 and end on the evening of the 22nd (if the 2% illuminated moon is sighted) or begin on the evening of the 22nd and end on the evening of the 23rd when the sign is fulfilled.&lt;ref name=jewcal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/month.asp?tdate=9/29/2017 |title=September, 2017 - Jewish Calendar |accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year celebration, in this case marking the end of the year 5777 (sometimes abbreviated to the [[777 (number)#Religious significance|significant number 777]]) and the beginning of 5778. The Feast of Trumpets in Jewish tradition is believed to be a day when the dead will be resurrected and judgement will begin&lt;ref name=judgement&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Holy_Days |title=High Holy Days - Wikipedia |accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Christians believe the period describes the tribulation period found in the Book of Revelation.&lt;ref name=bookrev&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lifehopeandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation/great-tribulation/ |title=Great Tribulation | website=lifehopeandtruth.com|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations of Revelation 12 vary, but the general consensus of those who promoted this theory was that the September 2017 alignment was the Great Sign which is described in this passage of Scripture: that the woman represents the nation of Israel, which they believe is about to enter into a multi-year period of [[Tribulation]], and the male child represents the global [[Church invisible|Church]], which might be [[rapture]]d to [[Heaven]] before the Tribulation period begins according to Revelation 12:5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+12:5&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 12:5 - King James Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proponents say that in order for people to escape before this impending judgment on the world and be "raptured", they must accept that the Christian Messiah [[Jesus Christ]] died for their sins, rose again, and is the only means of being reconciled to God. These views are shared by all of the major proponents of the '''Revelation 12 Sign Prophesy'''.&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revelation 12 – The Sign for Israel|date=February 4, 2017|author=Daniel Matson|work=Signs of the End |url=http://watchfortheday.org/signofisrael.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Salvation - Get Washed Clean!|author=Scott Clarke|work=ERF Ministries |url=http://erfministries.com/blog_salvation.php |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revelation 12 Sign|work=Revelation 12 Daily |url=https://rev12daily.blogspot.com/p/basic.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been pointed out by Revelation 12 Sign proponents that a number of eminent biblical scholars support their particular interpretation of Revelation 12, including [[John Nelson Darby]], [[Harry Ironside]], and more recently Dr. Michael Svigel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proof of the Rapture in Revelation 12|date=June 2, 2017|work=Revelation 12 Daily |url=https://rev12daily.blogspot.com/2017/06/proof-of-rapture-in-revelation-12.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apocalyptic symbol of "a woman in labor" is found throughout Jewish and Christian [[Scriptures]], which proponents suggest is evidence of the September 2017 alignment's importance in prophecy. These particular Scriptures include {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|13:6-13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|26:17-21|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|66:7-11|KJV}},{{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|30:4-11|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|49:23-27|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Micah|5:3|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Matthew|24:8|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Mark|13:8|KJV}} and {{Bibleverse|1 Thessalonians|5:3|KJV}}. According to Isaiah 66 above, the birth of the man-child occurs before the woman travails in labor and pain. Proponents argue that the rapture is the marvel spoken of by Isaiah in the above passage—the man-child representing the Church that will be born before Israel enters the Tribulation. Since the woman apparently has other children according to Revelation 12 (such as Gentile Tribulation Saints and the 144,000), the dragon, since he cannot devour the raptured Church, persecutes the woman's other children spoken of later in Revelation 12.{{npsn|date=September 2018}}

Some, such as Lloyd F. Acree, claim a direct revelation from God brought the event to the world's attention as confirmation of the pre-tribulation Rapture and its timing to be in the year 2017. Shortly after L. Acree claims to have received his message in early Spring of 2017, he then took to preaching the prediction on various social media outlets and with the use of a sandwich board in the streets of Simpsonville, SC. Acree started his prophetic claims by saying the Rapture would occur by the end of Calender year 2017, He strongly directed people to Sept. 23 of that year, and when it did not come to pass, he returned to anytime by the end of the year.  Since this, too, had failed, he claimed that he had presumed God meant the planet's calender and not God's Holy 
Calender, which he then stated the Rapture would happen before the close of the Winter of 2017, or by March 20, 2018.  Since this failed, he, once again, proclaimed that it was, "Pushed back" until the passover, March 30, 2018.  Having failed four times, Lloyd still has not repented of his presumptuous speaking for God, when it is obvious by failure that he has no actual truthful revelation.

Still others, while hailing the sign as an indicator for Rapture, yet emphasize a broader interest in many possible events for its actual manifestation such as the Jewish holidays of September and the solar eclipse of August 21st, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zauzmer|first1=Julie|title=For some, eclipse day showcases God's majesty.

A number of critics have offered rebuttals of the purported sign arguing that the sign is not unique or is only [[astrology]].

Faulkner mentions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Will Happen on September 23, 2017?|date=May 1, 2017 |author=Dr. Danny R. Faulkner|work=[[Answers in Genesis]] |url=https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/stars/what-will-happen-september-23-2017/ |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; several specific points of contention including:

* "...Jupiter appears in the part of Virgo corresponding to her womb, along with the sun in Virgo and the moon at her feet for a day or two every 12 years or so."
* "Since the claim that Leo has nine stars is false, the assertion that the addition of the three planets brings the total number of stars in Leo to 12 is false too."
* "And how do we know that Jupiter must represent the child? There is no evidence for that either."
* "These sorts of claims amount to Rorschach tests—people tend to see in them what they want to see."
* "This year, with the huge popularity of YouTube, it is much easier to propagate these ideas."

Craig C. White is a proponent of a short timeline end of days, but gives several criticisms of the Rev 12 sign theory:&lt;ref name=craigwhiterev12 /&gt;
* "...the Apostle John says that 'there appeared a great wonder in heaven'. He doesn't say 'there will be a great wonder in heaven'. He doesn't tell us to 'look for a great wonder in heaven'."
* "...some proponents confuse the child in Revelation 12 with the Church. The child is obviously Jesus."
* "Some theorists say that Revelation 12:5 is describing the Rapture of the Church. Is the Church "a man child" as described in Rev 12:5? It is so very obvious that the man child who was caught up unto God, and to his throne is describing Jesus Christ at his ascension."
* "No I don't think that Revelation 12:5 describes the Rapture of the Church in any way. The events of Revelation 12:1-5 depict the history of Israel and their Messiah up until Jesus Christ's ascension. The events of Revelation chapter 12:6-17 describe the events that Israel will endure during their great tribulation while the Church watches from heaven."

Tim McHyde mentions several flaws in the Rev 12 theory:&lt;ref name=timmchyderev12/&gt;
* "...scholars have found that the sky on September 11, 3 BC to show the exact picture of Revelation 12:1, pointing to the birth of Christ on that day"
* "Clarke's theory, like all invented prophecy theories, depends on taking a verse out of its context and re-purposing it to serve some new theory. When you ignore the context of a verse, you are set up to misinterpret it. That's how you turn a solid reliable Bible prophecy into an unreliable quasi-biblical man-made prophecy interpretation."
* "The most natural explanation for all this is that the Woman is the faithful church of God among and from whom Jesus, a male person, was born (through blessed Mary). Jesus ascends to heaven and the faithful continue on the earth through the Great Tribulation."
* "For me the next problem is how Clarke has added elements to the biblical text that are not there, allowed for by problem #1 in ignoring verse 2 and 5. When he says this may be the rapture or second coming you would rightly ask, where does it say this in Revelation 12? Nowhere. It's added."
* "I think Scottie Clarke was so excited to find something "extremely rare" to combine with a Bible prophecy (namely, those three planets appearing in Virgo) that he missed something huge. There are already always twelve stars crowning Virgo, depending who you ask it is either the constellation called 'Berenice's hair'."
* "...the position of the sun does not match Rev 12:1 which says the sun clothes the woman. ...the sun is over her left shoulder. For the sun to clothe the woman, it would be on her body. Not at her head like the crown; not at her feet like the moon. In the middle where her body is; where clothing goes. If you want to see what it should look like, compare that to the picture of the sky on September 11, 3 BC when (I and many think) Jesus was born"
* "What we have is once again is another example of how Christian prophecy students can't seem to resist taking something from Scripture and combining it with something extra-biblical they subjectively and/or arbitrarily view as significant. A Jewish holiday. A (brief) historical pattern of economic downturns. A rare conjunction. Or three more blood moons."

Ed Stetzer who holds the Billy Graham Distinguished Chair of Church, Mission, and Evangelism at Wheaton College, and Executive Director of the [[Billy Graham Center]], wrote this about it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stetzer|first1=Ed|title=No, the World Won't End Next Week and There's No Such Thing as a Christian Numerologist|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2017/september/end-times-fake-news.html|website=christianitytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"You basically got a made-up expert in a made-up field talking about a made-up event...it sort of justifies that there's a special secret number codes in the Bible that nobody believes,"}}

In response to the many critics of the Rev 12 sign theory, [[Unsealed World News]] has reiterated their position that the September 2017 alignment perfectly fits the description given in the biblical text and that their interpretation of the events described will be the only such occurrence in human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why The Revelation 12 Sign Can't Be Debunked|date=August 1, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/08/why-revelation-12-sign-cant-be-debunked.html |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Defense Of The Revelation 12 Sign And Its Connection To The Rapture|date=February 14, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/02/a-defense-of-revelation-12-sign-and-its.html |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Celestial C-Section|date=January 11, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/05/the-celestial-c-section-defense-of.html |accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Defense Of The Revelation 12 Sign: Part 4|date=May 22, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/05/a-defense-of-revelation-12-sign-part-4.html |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debunkers Prove Revelation 12 Sign|date=June 16, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/06/debunkers-inadvertently-prove.html |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[AT&amp;T]] original [[documentary film|documentary]], ''The Sign'', explored the intersections of science, religion, and history behind the Revelation 12 debate. It aired on [[Audience (TV network)|Audience]] on September 14, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://about.att.com/story/att_audience_network_premieres_documentary_film_the_sign.html|title=AT&amp;T AUDIENCE Network Premieres Documentary Film "The Sign" on Sept. 14 at 8 p.m.|website=[[AT&amp;T]] Newsroom|date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==The Second Stage of the Sign - 430 days later, 27 November 2018==

There are two signs (or wonders) mentioned in Revelation Chapter 12. The second is {{Bibleverse|Revelation|12:3-5|KJV}} This second sign is regarding the dragon which is now believed to be Scorpio. The everlasting Abrahamic covenant that God made with Abraham was fulfilled 430 years to the day ({{Bibleverse|Exodus|12:41|KJV}}) after Abraham was told to look up to the sky ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|15:5|KJV}}) and completed when Israel exited Egypt, which is confirmed in ({{Bibleverse|Galatians|3:17|KJV}}). Many Christian followers of the sign now recognise that after exactly 430 days, Jupiter which represents the manchild enters into Scorpio and is in perfect alignment with the Sun, Mercury, and the stars that comprise Scorpios left claw. This is widely believed to represent the second part of the sign which takes place on November 27, 2018. This day is also exactly 1260 days after Donald Trump announced his presidency on 16 June, 2015. (1260 days is a number for Biblical calculation based on half the seven year tribulation period 2520 days)

'''Sacred food as offering''' is a concept within [[anthropology]] regarding the study of food as it relates to religious ritual.

Many religions have prescriptions about the correct preparation and cooking of food, besides the [[Taboo food and drink|taboos about forbidden subjects]]. Many religions have special [[spellings]] for the food, which sacralize it and, therefore, who will eat it; but there are foods sacred by its inner nature.
In Brazilian [[Candomblé]] by example, fishes are sacred for their connection to [[Iemanjá]], horns given the relation to [[Iansan|Iansã]].
Consequently, those foods are considered offerings. This takes place in other religions too.
Some examples:
*coconut: [[Ganesha]] in Hinduism 
* milk, betel leaves  Shiva in Hinduism
* flowers, tulsi and fruit Krishna Hinduism
*[[Oxalá]] in candomblé (see above)
*bread: representing the [[body of Christ]] in [[Catholicism]]
*the [[challah]] in Judaism is symbol of divine presence in shabat
*chestnut: [[Befana]]
*[[Coca leaf]]: for the [[Andean culture (disambiguation)|Andean culture]]s
*Leola's Maize Corn: Amerindian goddess of prosperity in [[cajun]] of Louisiana.

It was directed and produced by Ray Laurent{{sfn|Satanism Today|2001||p=147}} and released by [[Something Weird Video]] on 17 June 2003. Filmed in [[San Francisco, California]], the film is a compilation of ritual footage and interviews with LaVey's family, neighbors, and church members, as well [[Christian]] priests and [[Mormon missionaries]]. Display ads at theater showings read: "''Satanis'' is the most pertinent, and perhaps the most shocking film of our time. But it’s definitely not a movie for everyone. If you choose not to see it, we will understand.”{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''''The Calcutta Quran Petition''''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: কলকাতা কোরান মামলা) is a book by [[Sita Ram Goel]] and Chandmal Chopra, and published by Goel under his [[Voice of India]] imprint. The first edition was published in 1986, the second in 1987 and the third in 1999.

The subject matter of this book is [[censorship]], the banning of books and the Quran.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935213876|title=The Calcutta Quran petition|last=Chandmal|first=Chopra,|last2=Ram|first2=Goel, Sita|last3=India)|first3=India. High Court (Calcutta,|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Voice of India|isbn=8185990581|oclc=935213876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Himangshu Kishore Chakraborty letter ==
On July 20, 1984, H.K. Chakraborty wrote to the Secretary, Department of Home Government of West Bengal, demanding the ban of the Quran. He wrote again on 14 August 1984, but received no response. Chakraborty lived in [[Bangladesh]] before moving to Kolkata, and witnessed the behaviour of the Muslims towards the Hindu minority in Bangladesh during the Partition of India and later.

Chakraborty thereafter met Chandmal Chopra, who also wrote to the Department of Home Government of [[West Bengal]] on March 16, 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But also Chopra's letter wasn't answered. Chopra therefore filed a writ Petition at the High Court.

== Chandmal Chopra's petition ==
''Chandmal Chopra'' tried to obtain an order banning the Koran, by filing a Writ Petition at the [[Calcutta]] High Court on 29 March 1985. The petition claimed that Sections 153A and 295A of the [[Indian Penal Code]], and Section 95 of the [[Criminal Procedure|Criminal Procedure Code]] were often used by Muslims to ban or proscribe publications critical of Islam, and stated that "so far it had been the privilege of the [[Peoples of the Book]] to ban and burn the sacred literature of the Pagans."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chandmal Chopra thought that the Koran "on grounds of religion promotes disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities and incite people to commit violence and disturb public tranquility..."

Chandmal Chopra also included a list of several dozens of Quran verses that "promote disharmony" in his petition. The book claims that these Quran verses embody one of the main themes of the book: "Nor have these passages been culled at random from different chapters of the Quran with a view to making the book sound sinister. On the contrary, they provide an almost exhaustive list of Allah’s sayings on a subject of great significance, namely, what the believers should believe about and do to the unbelievers..."

[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]] of May 9, 1985 reported that the Union Government would make itself a party in the case, and the Union law minister Ashoke Sen and the attorney-general of the Government of India were going to take action against the case.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph May 9, 1985. The Telegraph May 10, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim lawyers after a meeting condemned the case. According to [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]] of May 10, the Chief Minister of West Bengal called the petition "a despicable act". Other politicians in the Lok Sabha at New Delhi, and the Minister of State for Law condemned the Petition.&lt;ref&gt;The Statesman 11 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan’s minister of state for religious and minority affairs claimed that the petition was the ‘worst example of religious intolerance’, and he urged the Indian government to ‘follow the example of Pakistan’ in ensuring freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph, May 14, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition was however dismissed in May 1985. The text of the judgment is included in the book. The [[Attorney-General]] of the Government of India and the [[Advocate-General]] of West Bengal appeared in the case and argued against Chopra's petition.

On June 18, 1985 Chandmal Chopra filed a review petition, which was dismissed on June 21.

==Riots==
The petition by Chandmal Chopra also led to many riots in India and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://progressbangladesh.com/quran-day-a-legacy-of-blood-and-impunity/|title=Quran Day: A legacy of blood and impunity {{!}} Progress Bangladesh|website=progressbangladesh.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Statesman reported that "at least 12 people were killed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talukdershaheb.com/2015/05/11/quran-day-a-legacy-of-blood-and-impunity/|title=Quran Day: A legacy of blood and impunity|last=Shaheb|first=Talukder|date=2015-05-11|website=Talukder Shaheb's Blog|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100 wounded all are poor Hindus" in a border town of Bangladesh during a demonstration of 1000 people. In Dhaka, at least 20,000 Jamaat-i-Islami supporters demonstrated against the petition. The demonstrators were trying to storm the office of India's [[High Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;The Statesman, May 13, 1985. May 10, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Other riots followed in [[Kashmir]] and [[Bihar]].

After the case was closed, the Chief Minister of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], during a mass rally in [[Srinagar]], demanded action against Justice [[Padma Khastgir]] who permitted the petition to be filed. During this mass rally, one person was killed and others injured. A "hartal" (strike) against the interference in Muslim personal law was observed during which all shops and colleges were closed.

== Sita Ram Goel ==
On August 31, 1987 Chandmal Chopra was arrested by the police and kept in police custody until September  8 for publishing with Goel this book on the petition. Sita Ram Goel had to abscond to avoid getting arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Elst, Koenraad, Ayodhya and After: Issues Before Hindu Society (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors write in this book that they do "not stand for a ban on the publication of the Quran. We take this opportunity to state unambiguously that we regard banning of books, religious or otherwise, as counterproductive. In the case of the Quran, we believe and advocate that more and more non-Muslims should read it so that they know first hand the quality of its teachings."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The book was received with great interest in India and abroad, according to Goel. Goel also read primary Islamic sources like the Urdu translations of six Hadis during his research for this book.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Third Edition of the Calcutta Quran Petition&lt;/ref&gt; In one chapter, Goel also compares [[Genghis Khan]], the [[Mongol]]s and [[Tengri|Tengiri]] with Islam.

== Media bias ==
[[The Times of India]] published three articles which praised the Quran during the Petition controversy. Goel claims that a rebuttal to these articles could not be published in the Times of India{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Goel claims that the chief editor, [[Girilal Jain]], regretted his inability to do so for reasons he could not reveal.

== The Poster ==
The book also gives an account of the banning of a poster that contained 24 citations from the [[Koran]]. In 1986, after the first edition of the "Calcutta Quran Petition" was published, a Hindi poster by Indra Sain Sharma and Rajkumar Arya was published by the Hindu Raksha Dal, Delhi. Indra Sain Sharma was the president of the Hindu Raksha Dal and the Vice-President of the All India [[Hindu Mahasabha]]. The poster cited 24 ayats from the Quran in Hindi.

The poster with the 24 Ayats also stated that:

:"Some Ayats of the Quran Majid command the believers (Musalmans) to fight against followers of other faiths. ... There are numerous (other) Ayats of the same sort.  Here we have cited only twenty-four Ayats.  Obviously, these Ayats carry commandments which promote enmity, ill-will, hatred, deception, fraud, strife, robbery and murder.  That is why riots take place between Muslims and non-Muslims, in this country as well as [the rest of] the world. In the above-mentioned twenty-four Ayats of the Quran Majid, Musalmans are commanded to fight against followers of other faiths."

The publishers of the poster were arrested under Sections 153A and 295A of the [[Indian Penal Code]]. The metropolitan magistrate of Delhi however discharged Sharma and R. Arya. He concluded  on 31 July 1986, that the poster can "at the most be branded as a fair criticism" and that “with due regard to the holy book of ‘Quran Majeed’, a close perusal of the ‘Aytes’ shows that the same are harmful and teach hatred, and are likely to create differences between Mohammedans on one hand and the remaining communities on the other"{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

'''''The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob'''}}) is a 1973 French-Italian comedy film directed by [[Gérard Oury]], starring [[Louis de Funès]] and Claude Giraud.

==Plot==
Rabbi Jacob ([[Marcel Dalio]]) is one of the most loved rabbis of New York. One day, the French side of his family, the Schmolls, invite him to celebrate the [[bar mitzvah]] of the young David. Rabbi Jacob boards a plane to leave America for his birthland of France after more than 30 years of American life. His young friend Rabbi Samuel comes with him.

In Normandy, the rich businessman Victor Pivert ([[Louis de Funès]]) is also on his way; his daughter ([[Miou-Miou]]) will be married the next day. Pivert is a dreadful man: bad-tempered, rude and a bigot, with a well-honed racism against blacks, Jews, and pretty much all foreigners. He and his driver, Salomon ([[Henri Guybet]]), have a car accident in which Pivert's car (carrying a speed boat) flips upside-down into a lake. When Salomon, who is Jewish, refuses to help because [[Shabbat]] has just begun, Pivert fires him, much to Salomon's content.

Arab revolutionist leader Mohamed Larbi Slimane ([[Claude Giraud]]) is kidnapped by killers who are working for his country's government. The team, led by Colonel Farès, takes him by night to an empty bubble gum factory... the same place where Victor Pivert goes to find assistance. Pivert involuntarily helps Slimane to flee, leaving two killers' corpses behind them. The police, alerted by Salomon, find the bodies and accuse Pivert of the crime.

The next day, Slimane forces Pivert to go to Orly airport to catch a plane to Slimane's country (if the revolution succeeds, he will become President). However, they are followed by a number of people: the jealous Germaine, Pivert's wife, who thinks her husband is going to leave her for another woman; Farès and the killers; and the police commissioner Andréani ([[Claude Piéplu]]), a zealous and overly suspicious cop who imagines that Pivert is the new Al Capone. Farès and his cohorts manage to kidnap Germaine, and they use her own dentist equipment to interrogate her.

Trying to conceal his and Pivert's identities, Slimane attacks two rabbis in the toilets, stealing their clothes and shaving their beards and their [[payot]]. The disguises are perfect, and they are mistaken for Rabbi Jacob and Rabbi Samuel by the Schmoll family. The only one who recognizes Pivert (and Slimane) behind the disguise is Salomon, his former driver, who just happens to be a Schmoll nephew. But Pivert and Slimane are able to keep their identity secret and even manage to hold a sermon in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], thanks to the polylingual Slimane (who is deeply gutted, of course).

After a few misunderstandings, Commissioner Andréani and his two inspectors are mistaken by the Jews for terrorists, attempting to kill Rabbi Jacob. The real Rabbi Jacob arrives at Orly, where no one is waiting for him any more. He is mistaken for Victor Pivert by the police, then by Farès and his killers (both times in a painful way for his long beard).

There is a chaotic, but sweeping happy ending:

*the revolution is a success, and Slimane becomes President of the Republic
*Pivert's daughter falls in love with Slimane and escapes her dull fiance near the altar to go with him
*Pivert learns tolerance towards other religions and cultures, and also Salomon and Slimane make peace with their respective Arab and Jewish colleagues
*the Schmolls finally find the real Rabbi Jacob
*the Piverts and the Schmolls go together feasting and celebrating

'''Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, Republic of China''', known for short as the '''Tzu Chi Foundation''' ({{lang-zh|t=慈濟基金會}}; literally "Compassionate Relief"), is a Taiwanese international humanitarian and non-governmental organization (NGO) with over 10 million members worldwide throughout 47 countries. It is operated by a worldwide network of volunteers and employees and has been awarded a special consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Mark (2010), ''[http://www.books.com.tw/exep/assp.php/jamezku/products/F012089631 Tzu Chi: Serving With Compassion]'', John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Tzu Chi Foundation was founded by Master [[Cheng Yen]], a Taiwanese Buddhist nun, or ''[[bhikkhuni]]'', in 1966 as a Buddhist humanitarian organization. The foundation has several sub-organizations such as the Tzu Chi International Medical Association (TIMA) and also the Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association (Tzu Ching) (慈濟大專青年聯誼會 (慈青)), Tzu Chi volunteers and relief workers are mostly recognizable worldwide by their blue and white uniforms called, in {{zh|s=藍天白雲}}, ''lántiān báiyún'', ( lit. 'blue sky, white clouds'). The foundation's work includes medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental work such as recycling. 

While Tzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] teachings are often integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the "[[Buddhism in Taiwan|Four Heavenly Kings]]" of Taiwanese Buddhism, and Tzu Chi itself is considered to be one of the "Four Great Mountains", or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwanese Buddhism along with [[Fo Guang Shan]], [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], and [[Chung Tai Shan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |title=Come to Taiwan, Return with good memories |publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuai|first=J.

==History==

The Tzu Chi Foundation was founded as a charity organization with [[Buddhist]] origins by the Buddhist nun Master [[Cheng Yen]] on 14 May 1966 in [[Hualien City|Hualien]], Taiwan. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Venerable Master [[Yin Shun]] (印順導師, Yìn Shùn dǎoshī) a proponent of [[Humanistic Buddhism]], who exhorted her to "work for Buddhism and for all sentient beings". The organization began with a motto of "instructing the rich and saving the poor" as a group of thirty [[housewives]] who saved fifty [[New Taiwan dollar|cents]] ([[US$]]0.02) every day and stored them in bamboo savings banks to donate to needy families.&lt;ref name="parabola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parabola.org/the-desire-to-relieve-all-suffering|title=THE DESIRE TO RELIEVE ALL SUFFERING|date=2010|publisher=Parabola Magazine|last1=Wolkstein|first1=Diane|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923002225/http://www.parabola.org/the-desire-to-relieve-all-suffering|archivedate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Dharma Master Cheng Yen|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159%3Aintroduction&amp;catid=81%3Aabout&amp;Itemid=198&amp;lang=en|website=tw.tzuchi.org|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823142309/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159%3Aintroduction&amp;catid=81%3Aabout&amp;Itemid=198&amp;lang=en|archive-date=23 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzu Chi experienced modest growth in the first two decades of its establishment, it grew to 293 members in 1968 and by 1986 had just 8,000 members. However, with the surge in popularity of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in Taiwan in the late 1980s and 1990s, Tzu Chi enjoyed a rapid expansion in membership alongside several other major Taiwanese Buddhist organizations. From 1987 to 1991, Tzu Chi membership doubled in size each year, by 1994, it boasted a membership of 4 million members.&lt;ref name="chinaperspectives.revues.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schak|first1=David|last2=Hsiao|first2=Hsin-Huang Michael|title=Taiwan's Socially Engaged Buddhist Groups|journal=China Perspectives|date=2005|issue=59|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto1n1|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012062338/https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto1n1|archive-date=12 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzu Chi has grown to become a significant actor in civil society, Tzu Chi is not only the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan,&lt;ref name="chinaperspectives.revues.org2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schak|first1=David|last2=Hsiao|first2=Hsin-Huang Michael|date=2005|title=Taiwan's Socially Engaged Buddhist Groups|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto1n1|journal=China Perspectives|issue=59|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012062338/https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto1n1|archive-date=12 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also Taiwan's largest owner of private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=2698712|title=Why Tzu Chi is sparking resentment|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=15 September 2016|agency=Central News Agency|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915192203/http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=2698712|archive-date=15 September 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The foundation achieved much media attention in Taiwan in 2015 with a controversial plan to develop a plot of land in [[Neihu District]] into a disaster relief center and cultural park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201503160028.aspx|title=City officials, Neihu residents welcome Tzu Chi's project pullback {{!}} Society {{!}} FOCUS TAIWAN - CNA ENGLISH NEWS|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2015/03/17/2003613729|title=Tzu Chi retracts controversial project - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project led to the destruction of parts of the Neihu conservation zone and a public outcry in Taiwan that forced the foundation to end the planned development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2015/03/11/2003613258/1|title=Tzu Chi’s Neihu land should be rejuvenated - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414225114/http://chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/taipei/2015/03/17/431281/City-officials.htm|title=City officials, Neihu residents welcome Tzu Chi retreat from project - The China Post|date=2015-04-14|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to widespread critical coverage of Tzu Chi by the Taiwanese media, and scrutiny into its finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/01/24/2003553308|title=Tzu Chi buildings spark protests - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2015/03/17/2003613729|title=Tzu Chi retracts controversial project - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324231306/http://chinapost.com.tw/editorial/taiwan-issues/2015/03/22/431650/Tzu-Chi.htm|title=Tzu Chi needs more transparency in charity work - The China Post|date=2015-03-24|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414173534/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1103&amp;MainCatID=&amp;id=20150319000091|title=Tzu Chi in Tainan school land rental subsidy controversy｜WantChinaTimes.com|date=2015-04-14|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time several [[Fake news|unsubstantiated reports]] circulated in Taiwan about the foundation, including unfounded claims that the foundation invested in tobacco and weapons companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414173530/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20150322000132&amp;cid=1701|title=Tzu Chi has admitted errors; it's time for compassion｜WantChinaTimes.com|date=2015-04-14|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite authorities not finding any illicit activity with its finances, calls for greater transparency were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20150303000052&amp;cid=1103|title=Tzu Chi Foundation urged to publish detailed donation list|last=|first=|date=|work=Want China Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414173317/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20150303000052&amp;cid=1103|archive-date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2013, the organization was estimated to have approximately 10 million members worldwide, and chapters in 47 countries.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzdyNvcRTWk|title=Master Cheng Yen and Tzu Chi|publisher=The Discovery Channel|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=293&amp;Itemid=283&amp;lang=en|title=Tzu Chi Missions|website=tw.tzuchi.org|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109072414/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=293&amp;Itemid=283&amp;lang=en|archive-date=9 November 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The four major causes of Tzu Chi are ''Charity'', ''Medicine'', ''Education'', and ''Humanity'', as highlighted by the official motto, or concept of "Four endeavors, eight footprints" ({{zh|t=四大志業，八大腳印}}). The eight footprints are [[charity (practice)|charity]] causes, medical contributions, [[education]] development, humanities, international disaster assistance, bone-marrow donation, community volunteerism, and environmental protection.

The official website for the organization states that the organization started with Charity, and then extended its aims to include Medicine, Education and Culture. Its stated goal is to promote "sincerity, integrity, trust, and honesty".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=293&amp;Itemid=283&amp;lang=en|title=Tzu Chi Missions|website=tw.tzuchi.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109072414/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=293&amp;Itemid=283&amp;lang=en|archive-date=9 November 2016|dead-url=no|accessdate=15 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzu Chi is notably distinct from the other "Four Great Mountains" and the other major [[Buddhism in Taiwan|Buddhist organizations of Taiwan]] in respect to three main unique characteristics. First of all, the founder of the organization is a female. Secondly, the founder is not a Buddhist scholar who promotes a specific interpretation of Buddhism nor started any kind of religious movement. And finally, the organization is officially a charitable organization and Tzu Chi itself focuses primarily on humanitarianism and community service rather than Buddhist spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsin-Huang Michael|first1=Hsiao|last2=Schak|first2=David|date=2005|title=Taiwan’s Socially Engaged Buddhist Groups|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto2n6|dead-url=no|journal=China Perspectives|issue=59|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815194230/http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto2n6|archive-date=15 August 2016|accessdate=12 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo===

Consisting of a ship that also simultaneously bears the lotus fruit and flower, the Tzu Chi logo symbolizes that the world can be made a better place by planting good karmic seeds. Followers believe that these seeds are required for flowers bloom and bear fruit, which is a metaphor for their beliefs that a better society can be created with good actions and pure thoughts. The ship represents Tzu Chi steering a ship of compassion, representing their goal in saving all beings that suffer, while the Eight Petals represent the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] in [[Buddhism]], which Tzu Chi uses as their guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tzuchi.us/blog/tzu-chi-logo/|title=Tzu Chi Logo - Tzu Chi USA|website=www.tzuchi.us|access-date=2017-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709005113/https://www.tzuchi.us/blog/tzu-chi-logo/|archive-date=9 July 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Noble Eightfold Path consists of:
# [[View (Buddhism)|Right View]]
# [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right resolve|Right Thought]]
# [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right speech|Right Speech]]
# [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|Right Action]]
# [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right livelihood|Right Livelihood]]
# [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right effort|Right Effort]]
# [[Sati (Buddhism)|Right Mindfulness]]
# [[Right concentration|Right Focus]]

===Tzu Chi's Ten Precepts===

In the statue, Buddha is letting the world witness his enlightenment.jpg|thumb|Tzu Chi Foundation's depiction of the Buddha on a wall mural. The image is known as "The Great Awakened of the Universe (宇宙大覺著)".]]Tzu Chi also has its own customized version of the [[Five Precepts|Buddhist Precepts]] as formulated by Master Cheng-Yen. The Ten Precepts of Tzu Chi are:

#No killing
# No stealing
# No fornication
# No lying
# No drinking
# No smoking or use of narcotics or [[betel nuts]]
# No gambling
# Practice [[filial piety]] and develop pleasant manners and speech
# Abide by traffic laws
# No participation in political activities or demonstrations

Master Cheng-Yen has stated that she developed these rules based on the new needs of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ten Precepts of Tzu Chi|url=http://www.tzuchi.net/TCSC.nsf/0adbb3db1b96266f48256ae00021f8ae/9991505677819b0b48256ae8006b85c2|website=tzuchi.net|accessdate=3 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911071105/http://www.tzuchi.net/TCSC.nsf/0adbb3db1b96266f48256ae00021f8ae/9991505677819b0b48256ae8006b85c2|archive-date=11 September 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===The Great Awakened of the Universe===
The Great Awakened of the Universe (宇宙大覺著) is the Tzu Chi Foundation's depiction of the Buddha. In the statue, the Buddha is depicted as a monk, with his palm placed over a globe, letting the world witness his enlightenment. The image has been subject to controversy in Taiwan, the primary criticism being that the image looks more like Cheng Yen rather than a traditional depiction of [[Gautama Buddha]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Medical Mission ==
One of the first major initiatives Tzu Chi took part in was the "Tzu Chi Medical Mission". This effort was inspired in 1970 after Cheng Yen noticed a link between poverty and illness after spending six years among the poor of eastern Taiwan.

Tzu Chi's first medical outreach occurred in 1972 when a free clinic was opened in [[Hualien City|Hualien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://olbios.org/life-of-the-mother-teresa-of-asia/|title=Life of the "Mother Teresa of Asia" {{!}} Olbios|date=2016-01-26|work=Olbios|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319115145/http://olbios.org/life-of-the-mother-teresa-of-asia/|archive-date=19 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tzu Chi Hospital ===
[[File:Hualien Tzu Chi General Hospital.JPG|thumb|Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien in 2011]]
The Foundation established its first Tzu Chi Hospital in [[Hualien City|Hualien]] in 1986. A 600-bed general hospital had been planned in 1979 to service the impoverished eastern coast of Taiwan.  A primary concern for Cheng Yen was that the area was isolated and the people in the area were cut off from aid during disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t--23FOImmIC&amp;dq=Tzu+Chi:+Serving+with+Compassion.&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Tzu Chi: Serving with Compassion.|last=Mark.|first=O'Neill,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470825679|location=|pages=26|oclc=940634655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite setbacks both in funding for the hospital and finding an acceptable site. Ground was broken on the site eventually chosen on 5 February 1983 at a ceremony officiated by then Provincial Governor (later President) [[Lee Teng-Hui]]. However, two weeks after ground was broken, Cheng Yen received a notice from the military telling her that the property was needed by the military and that construction would have to stop.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tzuchi.com.tw/en/index.php/history/7-hualien-tzu-chi-hospital|title=Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320052400/http://www.tzuchi.com.tw/en/index.php/history/7-hualien-tzu-chi-hospital|archive-date=20 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtDRTLTwD88C&amp;dq=The+Life+and+Teachings+of+Venerable+Master+Cheng+Yen&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Challenges The Life and Teachings of Venerable Master Cheng Yen|last=Gary|first=Ho,|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Harbour Publishing|year=|isbn=9781553659921|location=|pages=44|oclc=957463283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new site was obtained for the hospital with help from Minister of the Interior Lin Yang-kang.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t--23FOImmIC&amp;dq=Tzu+Chi:+Serving+with+Compassion.&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Tzu Chi: Serving with Compassion.|last=Mark.|first=O'Neill,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470825679|location=|pages=28|oclc=940634655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second groundbreaking occurred on 2 April 1984 at the new site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eng.tzuchi.my/index.php/culture/culture-news-k2/item/7498-50-years-of-tzu-chi-looking-back-and-striding-forward|title=50 Years of Tzu Chi: Looking Back and Striding Forward|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320052417/http://eng.tzuchi.my/index.php/culture/culture-news-k2/item/7498-50-years-of-tzu-chi-looking-back-and-striding-forward|archive-date=20 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publicity of the project to build the hospital led to a significant increase in the number of Tzu Chi volunteers, with Tzu Chi membership increasing six-fold by the time of the second groundbreaking since the announcement of the project in 1979.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Construction was completed and the hospital opened on 17 August 1986.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Tzu Chi created a [[bone marrow]] registry, the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow Bank, in 1993 after a young follower of Cheng Yen was diagnosed with Leukemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtDRTLTwD88C&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=tzu+chi+bone+marrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMvMaVwoTTAhUB1WMKHZFsCjEQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20bone%20marrow&amp;f=false|title=Challenges: The Life and Teachings of Venerable Master Cheng Yen|last=Gary|first=|date=2012-03-23|publisher=D &amp; M Publishers|year=|isbn=9781553659921|location=|pages=163|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t--23FOImmIC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=tzu+chi+bone+marrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMvMaVwoTTAhUB1WMKHZFsCjEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20bone%20marrow&amp;f=false|title=Tzu Chi: Serving with Compassion|last=O'Neill|first=Mark|date=2010-05-17|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470825679|location=|pages=145|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cheng Yen referred to the concept of bone marrow donation as a way to "save a life without harming yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tzuchi.ca/index.php/en/about-us/tzu-chi-foundation|title=Tzu Chi Foundation|last=慈濟基金會|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402170105/http://www.tzuchi.ca/index.php/en/about-us/tzu-chi-foundation|archive-date=2 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort to register bone marrow donors from an organization with such massive membership like Tzu Chi caused Taiwan to change its laws regarding organ donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t--23FOImmIC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=tzu+chi+bone+marrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMvMaVwoTTAhUB1WMKHZFsCjEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20bone%20marrow&amp;f=false|title=Tzu Chi: Serving with Compassion|last=O'Neill|first=Mark|date=2010-05-17|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470825679|location=|pages=146|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Prior to 1993 Taiwanese law only allowed organ transplants between relatives|group=note}} This registry became a division of the new Tzu Chi Stem Cells Center, which was founded to improve research and treatment capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26vBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Tzu+Chi+Stem+Cells+Center&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmhZbp-ZjTAhVD0GMKHVFSCqMQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Tzu%20Chi%20Stem%20Cells%20Center&amp;f=false|title=Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Children with Cancer|last=Smith|first=Franklin O.|last2=Reaman|first2=Gregory H.|last3=Racadio|first3=Judy M.|date=2013-11-26|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783642399206|location=|pages=17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t--23FOImmIC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=tzu+chi+bone+marrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMvMaVwoTTAhUB1WMKHZFsCjEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20bone%20marrow&amp;f=false|title=Tzu Chi: Serving with Compassion|last=O'Neill|first=Mark|date=2010-05-17|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470825679|location=|pages=145|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 the program had saved the lives of almost 1,500 people in 25 different countries.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; By 2008, Tzu Chi had registered more than 307,657 bone marrow donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtDRTLTwD88C&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=tzu+chi+bone+marrow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMvMaVwoTTAhUB1WMKHZFsCjEQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20bone%20marrow&amp;f=false|title=Challenges: The Life and Teachings of Venerable Master Cheng Yen|last=Gary|first=|date=2012-03-23|publisher=D &amp; M Publishers|year=|isbn=9781553659921|location=|pages=165|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== College of Medicine ===
Tzu Chi established the [[Tzu Chi College of Medicine]] in 1994.  This college became [[Tzu Chi University]] in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for [[Body donation|body donations]] surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country.

In 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Disaster relief ==
Tzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide. In carrying out these projects, Tzu Chi has a policy that forbids public gatherings for the sole purpose of specific political, economic, and religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Tzu Chi FAQs, http://www.us.tzuchi.org/usa/images/other/TzuChiFAQ-global.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725233133/http://www.us.tzuchi.org/usa/images/other/TzuChiFAQ-global.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzu Chi volunteers are not to discuss business, politics, or preach religion while giving aid.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t--23FOImmIC&amp;dq=Tzu+Chi:+Serving+with+Compassion.&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Tzu Chi: Serving with Compassion.|last=Mark.|first=O'Neill,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470825679|location=|pages=28|oclc=940634655}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=Dharma Master Cheng Yen - Discovery Channel Documentary 證嚴法師 - Discovery 頻道 (中文字幕) 480p|date=2014-03-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHsDjv5JqbU|accessdate=2017-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525233639/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHsDjv5JqbU|archive-date=25 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===

Tzu Chi's involvement with providing aid in the People's Republic of China was difficult at first. Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in [[China]] as "Building a Bridge of Love." The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the [[Cross-Strait relations|political tensions]] between Taiwan and China and Communist China's disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] to help the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi. 

Tzu Chi's involvement in the [[People's Republic of China]] began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after [[Eastern China flood of 1991|severe floods hit central and eastern China]]. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi's first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People's Republic of China. Since then, the foundation has built schools, nursing homes and entire villages, including infrastructure in poor inland areas, such as [[Guizhou]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Outline of assistance given to Chinese provinces|url=http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|archivedate=2012-03-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305053915/http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Over the past twenty years, Tzu Chi expanded their humanitarian work and influence to 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China. Projects include relief work after major disasters like the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]]; distribution of rice and goods to the poor; social programs like regular visits to the needy; [[scholarship]] programs to the less privileged students; medical missions like [[bone marrow donation]] and [[free clinics]]; and educational outings of environmental protection and recycling activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=647%3Atzu-chi-opens-chinas-dirst-overseas-ngo-office&amp;catid=77%3Amissionofcharity&amp;Itemid=177&amp;lang=en|title=Tzu Chi Opens China's 1st Overseas NGO Office|date=23 August 2010|publisher=Tzu Chi|access-date=30 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721184701/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=647:tzu-chi-opens-chinas-dirst-overseas-ngo-office&amp;catid=77:missionofcharity&amp;Itemid=177&amp;lang=en|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Tzu Chi became the first organization represented by a non-Mainland resident to be registered with the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/03/11/us-china-taiwan-religion-idUSPEK23024220080311|title=Atheist China gives nod to Taiwan Buddhist group|date=11 March 2008|publisher=Reuters|access-date=2 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924131857/http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/03/11/us-china-taiwan-religion-idUSPEK23024220080311|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Tzu Chi became the first overseas NGO to receive permission from the Ministry of Civil Affairs to set up a nationwide charity foundation. Normally, overseas organizations must register with the Ministry of Commerce as businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2010/08/20/taiwan-buddhist-charity-tzu-chi-sets-up-shop-in-atheist-china/|title=Taiwan Buddhist Charity Tzu Chi Sets Up Shop in Atheist China|date=20 August 2010|publisher=Reuters|access-date=30 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625164510/http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2010/08/20/taiwan-buddhist-charity-tzu-chi-sets-up-shop-in-atheist-china/|archive-date=25 June 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation received the China Charity Award from the Ministry of Civil Affairs for its work in charity and promoting the well-being of society in 2006 and again in 2008.

=== Aid in Taiwan ===
In 1996, Tzu Chi started a nationwide volunteer program where volunteers are registered according to where they live with the goal of "neighbors helping neighbors." The community volunteer initiative began as a disaster relief effort started in response to [[Typhoon Herb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/1999/10/03/0000004923|title=Tzuchi always ready to lend a helping hand - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=379:the-world-is-impermanent&amp;catid=82:miscellaneous&amp;Itemid=326&amp;lang=en|title=The World is  Impermanent|last=Foundation|first=Tzu Chi|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015162351/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=379%3Athe-world-is-impermanent&amp;catid=82%3Amiscellaneous&amp;Itemid=326&amp;lang=en|archive-date=15 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tzuchi.org.sg/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645&amp;Itemid=566|title=Community Volunteers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tzuchi.org.sg|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810185022/http://www.tzuchi.org.sg/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645&amp;Itemid=566|archive-date=2016-08-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzu Chi volunteers were one of the first responders in the [[1999 Jiji earthquake|Jiji earthquake]] (known in Taiwan as the 921 earthquake) of 1999, mobilizing within 2 hours to provide thousands of sets of food and relief supplies to victims. The volunteers followed a strict system of organization where commissioners and teams of volunteers were assigned to specific townships, and teams were assigned to specific areas within the townships. This organizational structure was what allowed the volunteers to be mobilized so quickly and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/1999/10/03/0000004923/1|title=Tzuchi always ready to lend a helping hand - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earthquake prompted Cheng Yen to start "Project Hope", a long term project to rebuild 51 schools for those effected by the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=123&amp;Itemid=366&amp;lang=en|title=Project Hope — Disaster Risk Reduction|website=tw.tzuchi.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610072518/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=123&amp;Itemid=366&amp;lang=en|archive-date=10 June 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1099&amp;Itemid=248|title=Annual Statistics on the Schools Rebuilt by Tzu Chi|last=Foundation|first=Tzu Chi|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627151000/http://www.tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1099&amp;Itemid=248|archive-date=27 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzu Chi raised more relief funds for the earthquake than any other religious organization in Taiwan, raising nearly sixty times as much funds for the relief effort than the next largest fund raiser, [[Fo Guang Shan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBmpT_H3ZFUC&amp;pg=SA9-PA364&amp;dq=tzu+chi+disaster+relief&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXn77TtcrTAhVI8GMKHSJIC1sQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20disaster%20relief&amp;f=false|title=Community Disaster Recovery and Resiliency: Exploring Global Opportunities and Challenges|last=Miller|first=DeMond S.|last2=Rivera|first2=Jason David|date=2016-04-19|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781420088236|location=|pages=452|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 921 earthquake was credited for prompting Tzu Chi to create a disaster relief coordination center at its headquarters to organize quicker disaster response services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBmpT_H3ZFUC&amp;pg=SA9-PA364&amp;dq=tzu+chi+disaster+relief&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXn77TtcrTAhVI8GMKHSJIC1sQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20disaster%20relief&amp;f=false|title=Community Disaster Recovery and Resiliency: Exploring Global Opportunities and Challenges|last=Miller|first=DeMond S.|last2=Rivera|first2=Jason David|date=2016-04-19|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781420088236|location=|pages=454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Disaster Relief ===
Tzu Chi has participated in numerous other relief projects around the world, including sending teams to [[Indonesia]] and [[Sri Lanka]] in the wake of the [[tsunami]] resulting from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] as well as to [[Pakistan]] after the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|2005 earthquake]] in their northern mountains.  The later was done despite poor relations between the governments of the two countries. 

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Sandy]], the organization announced on 18 November 2012 a donation of $10 million in the form of $300 and $600 [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] debit cards to those affected in the [[New York (state)|New York]] and New Jersey area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2012-11-28/Front_Page/Liu_Announces_Buddhist_Tzu_Chi_Donation_Of_10_Mill.html|title=Liu, Announces Buddhist Tzu Chi Donation Of $10 Million|date=28 November 2012|publisher=[[The Queens Gazette]]|accessdate=4 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209064352/http://www.qgazette.com/news/2012-11-28/Front_Page/Liu_Announces_Buddhist_Tzu_Chi_Donation_Of_10_Mill.html|archive-date=9 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers handed out these cards in parts of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]].

===Portfolios===

Tzu Chi's portfolios include case management, medical, educational and [[disaster relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tzu Chi Foundation Finds Good Karma in Disaster Relief and Preparedness|url=https://www.nyredcross.org/?nd=news_room_detail&amp;news_id=53&amp;jid=63915|publisher=[[American Red Cross]]|accessdate=14 October 2012|date=23 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121228094810/https://www.nyredcross.org/?nd=news_room_detail&amp;news_id=53&amp;jid=63915|archivedate=28 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization builds and operates many hospitals and schools, with outreach efforts that range from visits to nursing homes to providing bone marrow surgery, as well as offering items such as washing machines to struggling single mothers. The television "Da Ai" network operates with its own news and television programming. Chinese schools have also been established abroad, such as in Australia and the United States, which apart from teaching Chinese and [[sign language]] also guides students in ways of compassion and [[community service]].

===Recycling===

A significant fraction of funds raised by Tzu Chi revolves around [[environmentally friendly]] goals in encouraging the recycling of items such as water bottles as well as using reusable items or reusing items to reduce waste. 

As of 2014, the foundation operates over 5,600 recycling stations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-recycling-20141117-story.html|title=Taiwan Buddhists transform plastic waste|last=Jennings|first=Ralph|date=17 Nov 2014|website=latimes.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116175356/http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-recycling-20141117-story.html|archive-date=16 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the foundation's projects is the recycling of [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) plastic bottles for the production of textiles. The project, which was started in 2006, collects PET plastic bottles and recycles them into cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Tzu Chi Quarterly, Winter 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The project is handled by the Tzu Chi sponsored non-profit Da Ai Technology Co. The products are all designed by members of the paid staff and recycled plastic bottles make up about half of the raw materials for the products. The project collects about 2,000 tons of plastic bottles each year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tzu Chi's recycling centers have been a source of criticism however, with critics arguing that Tzu Chi's recycling efforts result in lost income for poor trash collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/23/2003588703|title=Tzu Chi said to steal from poor - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, the foundation has produced over 460,000 polyester blankets out of recycled plastic bottles, many of which have been distributed as part of Tzu Chi's disaster relief programs throughout the world. Other items made with the recycled resins include thermal underwear, T-shirts, hospital bed sheets, medical gowns, suitcases, stuffed animals and uniforms for Tzu Chi volunteers. While the project relies on recycled plastic bottles for the production of its products, its leaders have stated that it is still best for people to not use plastic bottles at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=300:a-greener-blanket&amp;catid=59:internationalrelief&amp;Itemid=183&amp;lang=en|title=A Greener Blanket|last=Foundation|first=Tzu Chi|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927052415/http://www.tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=300:a-greener-blanket&amp;catid=59:internationalrelief&amp;Itemid=183&amp;lang=en|archive-date=27 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2013-03-taiwan-plastic-junk-blankets-dolls.html|title=Taiwan turns plastic junk into blankets, dolls|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116183046/https://phys.org/news/2013-03-taiwan-plastic-junk-blankets-dolls.html|archive-date=16 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Dharma===

The teachings of the [[Buddha]] and founder Master Cheng Yen play a core role in the workings of the organization. "Tzu Chi Day" is celebrated every year on the second Sunday of May which generally coincides with the Buddha's birthday ([[Vesak Day]]), and [[Mother's Day]] (as recognised in Taiwan). Celebrations during Tzu Chi Day include the bathing of the Buddha ceremony, the tradition's message is that it is the people that need cleansing before they become better individuals. Tzu Chi promotes many of the teachings of Buddhism, in particular the [[Lotus Sutra]], 
and also has sutra adaptations through the use of sign language on the [[Innumerable Meanings Sutra|Sutra of the Innumerable Meanings]], which teaches that sentient existence is challenging and filled with disasters in the absence of observations of [[Śīla|virtue]], as well as the [[Water Repentence|Sutra of the Water Repentance]], which advocates and symbolizes the need to repent [[karma|karmic transgressions]]. Despite these activities, Tzu Chi has a policy of not proselytizing religion directly at its public activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/visit-to-the-tzu-chi-foundation-in-taiwan/238309/|title=Visit to the Tzu Chi Foundation in Taiwan - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906092112/http://www.manilatimes.net/visit-to-the-tzu-chi-foundation-in-taiwan/238309/|archive-date=6 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalnation.inquirer.net/114046/tzu-chi-foundation-lets-hear-it-for-amazing-buddhist-responders|title=Tzu Chi Foundation: Let’s hear it for amazing Buddhist responders|last=Petilla|first=Danny|website=globalnation.inquirer.net|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116182921/https://globalnation.inquirer.net/114046/tzu-chi-foundation-lets-hear-it-for-amazing-buddhist-responders|archive-date=16 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from being non-proselytist, Tzu Chi's adaptation of Buddhist principles is [[apolitical]].

In disaster regions where a particular religious faith is prominent, Tzu Chi regularly works together with local religious organizations. Tzu Chi has re-built [[mosques]] and [[church (building)|churches]] in disaster zones where faith plays an important role in local society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzdyNvcRTWk|title=Master Cheng Yen and Tzu Chi|publisher=The Discovery Channel|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110210357/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzdyNvcRTWk|archive-date=10 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzu Chi nuns ([[Bhikkhuni|bhikkhunis]]) do not rely on donations for their livelihood, something uncommon among most Buddhist orders. In earlier days, the nuns sustained themselves by farming, weaving and other handicrafts. More recently, they sustained themselves by the manufacture of electrical circuit breakers and other products.

===International branches===

Tzu Chi has branches in 47 countries and regions including USA, Canada, Australia, [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], Malaysia, [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tzu Chi Singapore|url=https://zh-tw.facebook.com/tzuchisingapore|website=Facebook|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various locations in Asia, Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tzuchi.org/global/offices/index.html | title=Tzu Chi Local Chapters and Associations | publisher=Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation | accessdate=29 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404090834/http://www.tzuchi.org/GLOBAL/offices/index.html | archivedate=4 April 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and Satellite Network===

On 17 August 1999, a television network was formed in Taiwan under the Tzu Chi Foundation of the Culture of Communication, Inc with the slogan "Love to make the world light up". Formally known as [[Da Ai Television]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Da Ai Television|url=http://www.daai.tv/daai-web/main/|publisher=Tzu Chi Culture and Communication Foundation|accessdate=10 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020103914/http://www.daai.tv/daai-web/main/|archive-date=20 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the network grew into a global broadcasting presence with offerings of a radio service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=radio.newdaai.tv|url=http://radio.newdaai.tv/aod/index_in.php|accessdate=10 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195337/http://radio.newdaai.tv/aod/index_in.php|archive-date=10 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzu Chi Channel 1, Tzu Chi Channel 2, Da Ai TV Indonesia, Da Ai TV Thailand, and Da Ai TV Egypt.

===Jing Si Books &amp; Café===

Jing Si Books &amp; Café is a chain of non-profit bookstores and cafes operated by Tzu Chi offering Tzu Chi merchandise and publications by [[Cheng Yen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jing Si Books &amp; Cafe|url=http://jingsi.com.tw/|accessdate=10 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002133/http://jingsi.com.tw/|archive-date=11 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==

The Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (慈濟大專青年聯誼會) is the Foundation's college youth organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (Singapore)|url=http://sgtzuching2014en.wordpress.com|website=慈濟大專青年聯誼會（新加坡）|publisher=WordPress.com|accessdate=10 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195926/http://sgtzuching2014en.wordpress.com/|archive-date=10 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially established in Taiwan on 31 May 1992. With chapters at universities worldwide, its goal is to allow university students (known as Tzu Ching or 慈青, literally "compassionate youth") to be involved with Tzu Chi's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Tzu Ching 新加坡慈青|url=http://sgtzuching3in1.blogspot.sg|accessdate=10 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001701/http://sgtzuching3in1.blogspot.sg/|archive-date=11 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Tzu Ching|url=http://www.umich.edu/~tzuching/|work=Tzu Chi Collegiate Association at the University of Michigan|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=22 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222213236/http://www.umich.edu/~tzuching/|archive-date=22 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzu Ching volunteers are given the opportunity to participate in large-scale events such as disaster relief and international NGO conferences such as the annual [[UN Youth Assembly]]. Master Cheng Yen encourages the Tzu Ching volunteers to actively communicate with each other, with the goals of learning and improving. Each year an international Tzu Ching officer training retreat camp is held at the foundation headquarters in [[Hualien City|Hualien]].

Tzu Shao (慈少) is the Tzu Chi branch for youths under the age of 18. 

==Year End Ceremonies==

Each year Tzu Chi conducts a Year End Ceremony attended by Tzu Chi workers, volunteers and members in December where Master [[Cheng Yen]] distributes blessings in the form of red packets that embosses a coin in Taiwanese currency{{Refn|The coin symbolizes the fifty cents the thirty housewives saved at the founding of Tzu Chi|group=note}} together with auspicious words for the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tzu Chi Year End Ceremony 2013|url=http://yeb.tzuchi.org.sg|accessdate=10 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200034/http://yeb.tzuchi.org.sg/|archive-date=10 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Virgen de Copacabana''' (literal translation: '''Virgin of Copacabana'''; figurative translation: '''Our Lady of Copacabana'''; variant: '''Blessed Virgin of the Candelaria, Our Lady of Copacabana''') is the [[patron saint]] of [[Bolivia]]. She is [[venerate]]d in Bolivia during her feast day of 2 February, the day of the [[Purification of Mary]], or feast of the [[Virgin of Candelaria|Virgen de la Candelaria]].  She is also venerated on 5 August with her own liturgy and popular celebration.

==History==
[[Copacabana, Bolivia|Copacabana]] is a Bolivian town located on a peninsula at the southeastern shore of [[Lake Titicaca]]. It is close to [[Isla del Sol]] and [[Isla de la Luna]], islands sacred to the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]]. In the mid 16th century, the inhabitants of Copacabana were divided into two groups: Anansayas, Inca newcomers, and Urinsayas, the traditional residents of the region. Despite conversion to Christianity, they continued an attachment to their original religion. Poor harvests lead them to consider attracting favor from heaven through a new confraternity. The Anansayas resolved to venerate the Virgin Mary while the Urinsayas selected [[Saint Sebastian|San Sebastian]].&lt;ref name="cuny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojs.gc.cuny.edu/index.php/lljournal/rt/printerFriendly/257/221|title=An Indigenous Sculptor on the Spanish Stage: Calderón’s rewriting of Tito Yupanqui in ''La Aurora en Copacabana''|last=McCarl|first=Clayton |publisher=cuny.edu|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Copacabana Bolivia06.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of the sculptor Francisco Tito Yupanqui.]]
[[Francisco Tito Yupanqui]], an amateur sculptor, a descendant of the Inca [[Huayna Capac]], and a member of the Anansayas, did not abandon the idea. He decided to create an image of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], believing it would influence the local people. Using clay, and assisted by his brother Philip, Francisco Tito created the image of the Virgin. The sculpture was placed at the side of the altar by the pastor, Father Antonio de Almedio. After Father Antonio left Copacabana, the priest Don Antonio Montoro took over. Unhappy with the look of the coarse and disproportionate sculpture, he ordered that it be removed from the altar and be placed in a corner of the [[sacristy]].

Francisco Tito was humbled by this setback. Advised by relatives, he went to [[Potosí|Potosi]] which had outstanding teachers of sacred image sculpting. While studying in the workshop of Maestro Diego Ortiz, Francisco Tito gained expertise in sculpture and in [[wood carving]]. With this skill, he resolved to create an improved image of the Candelaria. He looked through the churches of Potosí for an image of the Virgin which could serve as a model, finally finding the best one in the Convent of Santo Domingo to the Virgen del Rosario. He studied it closely to remember it before starting his new piece and held a Mass in honor of the [[Holy Trinity]] as a divine blessing for his work.

The Urinsayas accepted the establishment of the Virgin Mary confraternity, but they did not accept Francisco Tito's carving, and decided to sell it. In La Paz, the picture reached the priest of Copacabana who decided he would bring the image to the people. On 2 February 1583, the image of Mary was brought to the hills of [[Guaçu]]. A series of miracles&lt;ref name="cuny" /&gt; attributed to the icon made it one of the oldest [[Marian shrine]]s in the Americas, along with [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] in Mexico.

On August 1, 1925, during the [[Papal]] visit of [[Pope Pius XI]] to Bolivia, the image of the Virgin of Copacabana was blessed and granted a [[canonical coronation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ihujfu7oK7MC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=our+lady+of+copacabana+canonical+coronation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p-X1lx_sXd&amp;sig=njORxswKxAWs1p2uwi0t_xifUNU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_kuaS8rzNAhVDHh4KHQUvBDEQ6AEIQjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=our%20lady%20of%20copacabana%20canonical%20coronation&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://catholicsaints.mobi/calendar/5-august.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Attending the coronation were three Bolivian bishops, President [[Bautista Saavedra]] and ambassadors representing Argentina and Peru.

From its beginning, the image gained a reputation for being a miracle. The [[Augustinians]] built their first chapel between the 1614 and 1618, and later, the Viceroy of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]], Conde de Lemos, morally and financially supported the construction of a [[basilica]] to honor the Virgin. Construction of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana]] began in 1668, was inaugurated in 1678, and was completed by 1805. Subsequently, the faithful donated embellishments to the image, including valuable jewels, and the temple was filled with gifts and treasures.

In 1825, when Bolivia gained independence, it was attributed to the faith of the population through the Virgin of Copacabana. However, in 1826, [[Antonio José de Sucre|Marshal Antonio José de Sucre]], the President of the Republic of Bolivia, expropriated all the jewels and colonial treasures at the Shrine of the Virgin, using them to create the first coins from Bolivia.

==Carving description==
The body of the image measures about four feet, carved in [[Agave americana|maguey]] wood and is laminated in gold leaf. The clothes are that of an Inca princess. The form is covered with luxurious robes and dresses, and wears a wig of long, natural hair. It holds the Child Jesus in a peculiar position, as if about to fall. In her right hand, she holds a basket and a  gold baton, a gift and souvenir of the visit in 1669 from the Viceroy of Peru. 

The original image never leaves the sanctuary; a copy is used for processions. Those leaving the shrine walk backwards with the intention not to turn their backs on the Virgin.

==Devotion in other countries==
The Bolivian community in [[Argentina]] celebrates the Feast of the Virgin of Copacabana in [[Buenos Aires]] in October.

==April 2013 Robbery==
In the early hours of Monday 22 April 2013 the sanctuary of Copacabana was robbed and the image of the Virgen de Copacabana was stripped of her gold and silver accessories.&lt;ref name="Property of an Anonymous Swiss Collector"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anonymousswisscollector.com/2013/04/the-virgin-of-copacabana-has-been-looted.html|title=The Virgin of Copacabana has been looted''|last=Yates|first=Donna|publisher=anonymousswisscollector.com|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports indicate that twenty-eight items, including the sculpture of the baby Jesus, were removed from the Virgen de Copacabana by thieves who entered the building using a ladder stolen from a nearby telecommunications station.&lt;ref name="La Razon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-razon.com/la_revista/tesoros-Virgen-carecen-seguro-antirrobo_0_1822617812.html|title= Los tesoros de la Virgen carecen de seguro antirrobo''|last=Linarez|first=Iblin|publisher=la-razon.com|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yuna'''|ユウナ|Yūna}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. She was first introduced as the female [[protagonist]] and one of the main [[player character|playable characters]] of the 2001 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', appearing as a summoner embarking on a journey to defeat the world-threatening monster [[Sin (Final Fantasy X)|Sin]] alongside her companions, including the male protagonist [[Tidus]]. Yuna reappears in ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', where she becomes the protagonist, searching for a way to find Tidus two years following his disappearance. Yuna has also been featured in other Square Enix games, notably ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.

[[Tetsuya Nomura]] based Yuna's overall design on [[hakama]], but also wanted to give her outfit something that would flow and so gave her a [[furisode]]. Nomura said that her name means "night" in the [[Okinawan language]], which contrasts with Tidus' name, which is Okinawan for "sun". For ''Final Fantasy X-2'', the game's staff wanted Tetsu Tsukamoto to redesign her costume to reflect her personality and the game's atmosphere. Yuna's character was well received by many media critics and fans and in particular praised for her relationship to Tidus, as well as her characterization and [[sex appeal]]. Despite this positive reception, there was a mixed reception for her role in ''Final Fantasy X-2'' due to her redesign.

==Appearances==
In ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', Yuna is introduced as a summoner who can use healing magic and is able to summon powerful magical entities called [[Spira (Final Fantasy)|aeons]] with help from spirits known as Fayths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Besaid|quote='''Lulu:''' The fayth are people who gave their lives to battle Sin.

S-So what's Yuna doing in there? / '''Wakka:''' She prays with all her heart for a way to defeat Sin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already known throughout Spira as the daughter of High Summoner [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Braska|Braska]], who previously brought a brief respite from Sin's destruction ten years earlier, Yuna decides to embark on the summoner's pilgrimage to become a High Summoner herself.&lt;ref name="day of departure"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Besaid|quote='''Tidus''': We're taking the same boat as Yuna, right?

Unless I'm...fired? / '''Yuna:''' Stay with me until the end. Please. / '''Tidus:''' Not until the end...

It would be so easy...to let my fate just carry me away...following this same path my whole life through. But I know...I can't. What I do, I do...with no regrets.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After entering Sin's body, Yuna and her guardians defeat the disembodied spirit of [[Yu Yevon]], who is responsible for reviving Sin after each defeat, allowing an eternal Calm to start in Spira.&lt;ref name="knowledge"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square  |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|level=Bevelle Temple|quote='''Tidus:''' We'll beat Yu Yevon. / '''Fayth''': If you defeat Yu Yevon, it will end.

He was peerless. Yet now he lives for one purpose: only to summon. ''[...]'' Even if you defeat[ed] Sin with the Final Summoning, Yu Yevon will live. Yu Yevon will join with the Final Aeon. He will transform it into a new Sin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tidus disappears as he is the product of the Fayth, who could not depart until Sin's defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Tidus:''' Yuna, I have to go.

In ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', set two years after ''Final Fantasy X'', Yuna is a member of the [[Sphere Grid|sphere]] hunting group Gullwings, along with [[Rikku]] and [[Paine (Final Fantasy X-2)|Paine]]. In the game's [[international version]], the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game's opening, with Yuna returning to Besaid Island. The trio then reunite to explore a tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission |developer=Square |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 13, 2003|platform=PlayStation 2|level=Yadonoki Tower}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''X-2'', Yuna journeys to Spira in search of the truth behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison.&lt;ref name="X-2"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2 |developer=Square|publisher=[[Square Enix]] |date=March 13, 2003|platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |quote='''Yuna [voiceover]''': It all began when I saw this sphere of you. At least, it looked like you. I couldn't say for sure. I thought I might find more spheres like it if I joined the Gullwings. So I did. Oh, in case you're wondering, the Gullwings are sphere hunters, and sphere hunters are, well...this! We fly all over Spira. I'm really enjoying myself.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her journey, Yuna discovers the man from the sphere was actually [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Shuyin|Shuyin]], a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover, [[Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2#Lenne|Lenne]].&lt;ref name="shuyin"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2 |developer=Square |publisher=Square Enix |date=2003-11-18 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Shuyin:''' Lenne.

This world continues to fail us, and what's worse, I failed to protect you. Vegnagun will make that all go away. And we'll fade together again, together. Help me do it, Lenne.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne's spirit.&lt;ref name="shuyinlennereunion"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2|developer=Square |level=|quote='''Shuyin''': A thousand years, and this moment is all we get? / '''Lenne''': This moment's enough.

We've come too far to look back now. Rest, Shuyin. Rest with me. Let's go.

In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling him she loves somebody else before declaring she will fight Sin once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X - X-2 HD Remaster |developer=Square |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 18, 2014 |platform=PlayStation 3|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also appears in ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'', an action game that features several ''Final Fantasy'' characters, as one of the characters to be summoned by the goddess Cosmos to participate in a war against her rival Chaos. For this game, Yuna appears in her ''Final Fantasy X'' form but sightly arranged to fit with the game's cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|url=http://andriasang.com/comtqv/nomura_other_games/|title=Hey Mr. Tetsuya Nomura, Whatchu Up To?|date=February 1, 2011|publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she has an alternative design based on [[Yoshitaka Amano]]'s illustration, and a wedding dress from ''Final Fantasy X''.&lt;ref name=as&gt;{{cite web|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|url=http://andriasang.com/comtid/yuna_and_third_forms_dissidia_site/|title=Yuna and Many Third Forms at the Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy Official Site|date=January 21, 2011|publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|url=http://andriasang.com/comu4v/dissidia_gilgamesh_update/|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy: Gilgamesh and More Another Forms|date=February 25, 2011|publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''Final Fantasy X-2'' regular form was made available as [[downloadable content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comuzm/dissidia_vaan_yuna/|title=Pirate Vaan and Gunner Yuna Hit Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy Next Week|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|date=April 14, 2011|publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the ''Final Fantasy'' series, Yuna appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' as a pixie along with Paine and [[Rikku]]. Bribed by [[Maleficent]] into spying on [[Squall Leonhart|Leon]]'s group, the pixies eventually switch sides after being abandoned by the witch and told of [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]'s cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=Square Enix|level=|quote='''Yuna''': Where's Maleficent? / '''Sora''': Looks like she ran away. / ... / '''Sora''': Umm, hey...if you're looking to pick sides, why don't you pick Leon's?

==Creation and development==
According to [[Tetsuya Nomura]], he based Yuna's overall design on [[hakama]], a type of traditional Japanese clothing. Nomura said that when he learned the character was to perform a dance called the "[[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Death and afterlife|sending]]," he wanted to give her outfit something that would flow. For this reason, the specific type of [[kimono]] he chose for her was a [[furisode]], a long-sleeved kimono.&lt;ref name="yunanameandclothing"&gt;{{cite web | author=Knight, Sheila | date=December 13, 2003| title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&amp;more=1 | publisher=FLAREgamer | accessdate=April 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura also said that he adorned Yuna's dress and necklace with images of the [[hibiscus]] flower also called "yuna," and that her name carries the meaning of "night" (夕な) in [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]], establishing a contrast between her and the lead male protagonist of ''Final Fantasy X'', Tidus, whose Japanese name (ティーダ) translates to "sun" (太陽) in Okinawan. This contrast is also represented in-game by items named for the sun and moon that empower Tidus' and Yuna's most powerful weapons. Nomura explains that while all these subtle details may be unneeded, he wanted his designs to have meaning behind them.&lt;ref name="yunanameandclothing"/&gt;

[[File:Yuna FFX-2.png|thumb|left|upright|Yuna's re-design for ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'']]

The positive fan reaction to ''Final Fantasy X'' convinced the developers to continue the story of Yuna and other characters with ''Final Fantasy X-2''. Costume designer Tetsu Tsukamoto said that the radical design changes for Yuna from one game to the other reflected a huge cultural change. Producer Yoshinori Kitase added that they did not want to make ''Final Fantasy X-2'' feel like an extension of its predecessor, so they changed the clothing of Yuna, Rikku and others' to make them seem more active. This was accomplished before the story and setting were created. Because Yuna, Rikku and Paine live in a more care-free world, the designers wanted them to be able to dress up, a feature which became key to the gameplay. Scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] described her new outfit as a "natural reaction to the heavy stuff she wore in ''FFX''." Yuna's singing performance was used to demonstrate the pop feel that the game incorporates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy X-2 Developer Interview |url=http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html |work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation |accessdate=August 2, 2012|date=November 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More Final Fantasy X-2 Details |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/26766/more-final-fantasy-x-2-details/ |publisher=GamePro |accessdate=December 24, 2009 |date=October 23, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607145223/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/26766/more-final-fantasy-x-2-details/|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Final Fantasy X'' director [[Motomu Toriyama]] said her personality was the result of not having her bear the responsibility of being a summoner anymore. He added that while "she could be seen as a completely different person, ... deep in her heart, she is the same old Yuna."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Jeremy |title=Exclusive interview: Final Fantasy X-2 |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/exclusive-interview-final-fantasy-x-2/ |publisher=GamesRadar |date=March 9, 2004 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114122727/http://www.gamesradar.com/exclusive-interview-final-fantasy-x-2/ |archivedate=November 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Japanese versions of the games Yuna has been voiced by [[Mayuko Aoki]].&lt;ref name="Feel/Go dream"/&gt; [[Hedy Burress]] provides the character's voice in the English adaptations of the game. In voicing Yuna, Burress remembers trying to translate Yuna's duty, respect and honor, but also wanting to retain the gentleness and femininity of her character. When commenting on how the audiences would react to ''Final Fantasy X'', Burress said that she wanted them to participate in the game itself and to "transport them into a completely different world" through the voices.&lt;ref name="interviews"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X International |developer=Square |publisher=Square EA |date=January 31, 2002|platform=PlayStation 2|level=Beyond Final Fantasy: Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;
