'''absentee funeral prayer in [[Islam]]''', known as '''صلاة الغائب Salat al-Gha'ib''', is a kind of [[funeral]] [[prayer]] performed upon a [[dead]] [[Muslim]] if they die in a place where there are no [[Muslims]] to pray for the dead. By contrast, if someone dies and a funeral prayer is said on his or her behalf, no other [[prayer]] is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/funeral.htm|title=Funeral Rites and Regulations in Islam|work=missionislam.com|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saaid.net/Warathah/hmood/h13.htm |title=فتوى الشيخ حمود بن عقلاء الشعيبي في الصلاة على الميت الغائب |publisher=Saaid.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hadith]], or traditions of [[Muhammad]], approve of offering funeral prayers for an absent [[person]]. [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayrah]] reports: "The Prophet informed his companions about the death of Negus (Najashi), the [[king]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], the day that he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/35853|title=Ruling on offering the funeral prayer in absentia - islamqa.info|work=islamqa.info|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; And then the Prophet led them to the [[prayer]] ground where he lined them up and offered funeral prayer for him with four Takbirs".&lt;ref&gt;[Reported by Imams Bukhari and Muslim]&lt;/ref&gt;

The time for offering a funeral prayer for an absent person should be within one month after his death. This rule is deduced from the [[Hadith terminology#mursal|Mursal Hadith]] stating that Muhammad performed a funeral prayer on the grave of a woman one month after her death, as Sayeed Ibn al-Musayyab reports: "Saad Bin Ubadh's mother died while the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was absent. When he came to [[Medina|Madinah]] one month later, he offered the funeral prayer on her grave."[Tirmizi]

== Funeral prayer for the absentee ==
[[Muslim]] [[scholar]]s have different [[opinions]] regarding the funeral prayer on the absentee.

This is the [[opinion]] of a great [[number]] of eminent [[Muslim]] scholars, including '''Al Khattaby''' and '''Al Rawiyani'''. Abu Dawud in his Sunan entitled a chapter: “Chapter of performing funeral prayer on a dead Muslim who died in a land of disbelief.”

This opinion is also the belief of [[Ibn Taymiyyah|Ibn Taymiyah]] and his disciple Ibn AlQayyim. The latter said in Zad Al Mi’aad: "Sheikh Al Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: ‘The right opinion is that the Muslim who died in a land where no funeral prayer was performed on him has the right to have absentee funeral prayer performed on him". This is similar to what Muhammad did when he heard about the death of Negus of Abyssinia, a Muslim who died in a land of Kufr where there were no Muslims to perform a funeral for him. The absentee prayer fulfills the prayer obligation so that there is no need for other prayers.

=== The Shaafa’is and Hanbalis ===
The Shaafa’is and Hanbalis believe that the funeral prayer in absentia should be held for everyone who dies away from his hometown, even if the funeral prayer is offered for him in the place where he dies.

'''The second view''' is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia if the deceased had benefited the Muslims in some way, such as a scholar, a mujahid or a rich man from whose wealth the people benefited, and so on.

'''The third view''' is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia so long as the funeral prayer has not been offered for the deceased in the place where he died. If the funeral prayer has been offered for him, then it is not prescribed to offer the funeral prayer for him in absentia.

=== Al-Khurshi (Maaliki) ===
Al-Khurshi (Maaliki) said (2/142): The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer for the Negus (in absentia) is one of the things that applied only to him.

Something similar was stated in Badaa’i al-Sanaa’i by al-Kasaani (Hanafi) (1/312).

[[Al-Nawawi]] said in al-Majmoo’ (5/211): "Our view is that it is permissible to offer the funeral prayer for one died away from his home town, but Abu Haneefah disallowed it. Our evidence is the hadeeth about the Negus, which is saheeh and has no faults, and they do not have any valid answer to that."

Al-Shaafa’i imposed a valid restriction on offering the funeral prayer in absentia, which is that the one who offers the funeral prayer for the deceased should be one of those who would have offered the prayer for him the day he died.

'''[[Fishing vessel|F/V]]''' '''''Andrea Gail''''' was a private fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands during the [[1991 Perfect Storm|"Perfect Storm"]] of 1991. The vessel and her six-man crew had been fishing the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] out of [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]]. Her last reported position was {{convert|180|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Sable Island]] on October 28, 1991. The story of ''Andrea Gail'' and her crew was the basis of the 1997 book ''[[The Perfect Storm (book)|The Perfect Storm]]'' by [[Sebastian Junger]], and a 2000 [[The Perfect Storm (film)|film adaptation of the same name]].

==F/V ''Andrea Gail''==
''Andrea Gail'' was a {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=on}} commercial fishing vessel constructed in [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], [[Florida]] in 1978, and owned by Robert Brown.&lt;ref name="cg" /&gt; Her home port was [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]], [[Massachusetts]]. She also sailed from [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], where she would offload her catch and reload food and stores for her next run.

==Lost at sea==

===Final voyage===
''Andrea Gail'' began her final voyage departing from Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1991, bound for the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] off the coast of eastern Canada. After poor fishing, Captain Frank W. "Billy" Tyne Jr. headed east to the [[Flemish Cap]] where he believed they would have better luck. Despite weather reports warning of dangerous conditions, Tyne set course for home on October 26–27.&lt;ref name="cg" /&gt; The ship's ice machine was malfunctioning and would not have been able to maintain the catch for much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Gillian |title=The Wreck of the Andrea Gail: Three Days of a Perfect Storm |year=2002 |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV6sUFC9h9oC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;dq=andrea+gail+ice+machine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eH3bRIRTDZ&amp;sig=Ah5HV2ZQ0TyvY0FfEN6Zftli7oo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7tyCT9OlDoXQsgbVgqykBA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=andrea%20gail%20ice%20machine&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
The last reported transmission from ''Andrea Gail'' was at about 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 28, 1991. Captain Tyne radioed Linda Greenlaw, Captain of the ''Hannah Boden'', owned by the same company, and gave his coordinates as {{Coord|44|00|N|56|40|W}},&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; or about {{convert|162|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Sable Island]]. He also gave a weather report indicating {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} seas and wind gusts up to 80&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]] ({{convert|150|km/h|abbr=on}}). Tyne's final recorded words were "She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong." Junger reported that the storm created waves in excess of {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, but ocean buoy monitors recorded a peak wave height of {{convert|39|ft|m}}, and so waves of {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} were deemed "unlikely" by ''[[Science Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meteorologists Say 'Perfect Storm' Not So Perfect|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/06/000628101549.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from a series of weather buoys in the general vicinity of the vessel's last known location recorded peak wave action exceeding {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height from October 28 through 30, 1991.&lt;ref name="cg" /&gt;

===Search===
On October 30, 1991, the vessel was reported overdue. An extensive air and land search was launched by the 106th Rescue Wing from the [[New York Air National Guard]], [[United States Coast Guard]] and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] forces. The search would eventually cover over {{convert|186000|sqnmi|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gloucestertimes.com/andreagail/local_story_155120146.html |title=The search for the Andrea Gail:  Gloucester Daily Times |accessdate=2009-04-07}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1991, ''Andrea Gail's'' [[EPIRB|emergency position-indicating radio beacon]] (EPIRB) was discovered washed up on the shore of [[Sable Island]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. The EPIRB was designed to automatically send out a distress signal upon contact with sea water, but the Canadian Coast Guard personnel who found the beacon "did not conclusively verify whether the control switch was in the on or off position".&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;[http://www.offsoundings.com/WEB%20PDF/ANDREA_GAIL.pdf U.S. Coast Guard investigation report]&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities called off the search for the missing vessel on November 9, 1991, due to the low probability of crew survival.&lt;ref name="cg" /&gt;

Fuel drums, a fuel tank, the [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|EPIRB]], an empty [[life raft]], and some other [[flotsam]] were the only wreckage ever found. The ship was presumed lost at sea somewhere along the [[continental shelf]] near Sable Island.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

All six of the crew were lost at sea.

The '''Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry''' (ABPI) is the [[trade association]] for over 120 companies in the UK producing prescription medicines for humans, founded in 1891. It is the British equivalent of America's [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America|PhRMA]], however the member companies research, develop, manufacture and supply 80% of the medicines [[Prescription Only Medicines|prescribed]] through the [[National Health Service]].

==History==
The organisation was founded in London in 1891 and originally known as the "Drug Club". A rival institution to represent wholesalers, the "Northern Wholesale Druggists' Association", was formed in 1902 and lasted until 1966.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Management and offices==
A board of management of members oversee the ABPI. The Board is made up of individuals who are elected by members to represent the industry and up to five people who are co-opted by the Board. Elections commence every January for elected seats to ensure that the Board is fully representative and has access to the broadest range of skills and expertise possible.

{{As of|2014}}, the Association's research director was Bina Rawal.&lt;ref name=piesing2014&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/23/tech-end-animals-drugs-testing | title=How tech could spell the end of animals in drugs testing | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=August 23, 2014 | author=Piesing, Mark | location=London | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABPI's head office is in London with three regional offices in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh.

==Membership==
ABPI membership is not open to individuals, only companies. Members fall into three categories:

* Full members who hold [[marketing authorization]] for, manufacture or supply [[prescription medicine]] for human use and undertake business in the UK
* Research affiliate members who carry out business in the UK and are involved in research and/or development of medicines for human use, but do not have a UK sales operation, for example [[Contract Research Organisation]]s (CROs) or [[Contract manufacturing organization]]s
* General affiliate members, who operate in the UK, have a business interest in the industry and will typically provide products or services to the industry, although not producing prescription medicines, for example law firms

==Functions==
The ABPI represents the views of the pharmaceutical industry to government and decision makers in the UK, i.e. is a [[lobbying organization]].

The organisation has six departments:
* Commercial
* Communications
* Legal
* Membership services
* [[NHS]] partnerships
* Research, medical and innovation

The medical and innovation department oversees complimentary resources for schools in UK to promote links between school science subjects and their applications in industrial research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpischools.org.uk/ ABPI resources for schools] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The department also runs a careers website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpicareers.org.uk ABPI Careers in the Pharmaceutical Industry] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The association sponsors booklets on a range of conditions, aimed at patients, carers and healthcare professionals.

The association has lobbied{{when|date=July 2017}} for the UK government to adopt the [[Directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions|European Union directive on biotechnology research]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Code of Practice==
The Code of Practice of the ABPI covers the promotion of medicines for prescribing to health professionals and administrative staff as well as the provision of information to the public about prescription only medicines in the UK. All ABPI member companies are obliged to comply with both the spirit and letter of the Code. The Code was first published in 1958 and undergoes revisions at least every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/thecode/InteractiveCode2016/Pages/default.aspx The Code of Practice of the ABPI] 2016 ABPI&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by the  Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority(PMCPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Criticism==
[[Ben Goldacre]] criticised the pharmaceutical industry in his 2012 book ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' as testing itself what it manufactures in "poorly designed trials, on hoplessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques that are flawed by design, in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments".&lt;ref name=statesman&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/sci-tech/2012/10/ben-goldacre-v-association-british-pharmaceutical-industry "Dr Ben Goldacre vs the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry"], The ABPI responds to Ben Goldacre's book Bad Pharma.''New Statesman'', 19 October 2012. accessed 4 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  
The ABPI responded that medicines were "tested against the most effective comparator where possible unless there is no current standard of care." 
Regarding "results that companies don’t like, [which] they are perfectly entitled to hide [..] from doctors and patients . . . academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure." the ABPI responded that it  did "... not seek to “hide” trial data" and was recognising there was "still work to be done in ensuring the publication of negative trial data within journals, and in ensuring greater transparency all round within the industry".&lt;ref name=statesman/&gt;

Born Liam Flannery at [[Rearcross]] in [[County Tipperary]] on 10 January 1925, he was the eldest of seven children produced by William K. Flannery and his wife Margaret (née Butler). He was educated at [[St. Flannan's College]] in [[Ennis]], completing his secondary education at [[Newbridge College|Dominican College, Newbridge]], [[County Kildare]].&lt;ref name="indoobit"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/obituaries/fr-austin-flannery-1517410.html Obiturary - Fr. Austin Flannery] Bernard Treacy, OP, editor Doctrine and Life, Irish Independent, Sunday November 02 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the [[Dominican Order]], in September 1944, led to studies in theology at [[The Priory Institute|St Mary's Priory]], Tallaght, and then at [[Blackfriars, Oxford]]. Joining the Dominicans he chose the name ''Austin'', he was ordained a priest in 1950. He continued his studies at the [[Angelicum University]] in [[Rome]]. After his studies he taught Latin in [[Newbridge College]] and then theology at [[Glenstal Abbey]], [[County Limerick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.eircom.net/~oflannery/bio/bioAF19252008.htm Hall of Fame Fr Austin Flannery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flannery edited the Dominican bi-monthly journal entitled ''Doctrine and Life'' from 1958 to 1988. He also edited the ''Religious Life Review''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishcatholic.ie/content/death-father-austin-flannery-op-rip Fr.

Tom Stack, ''[[The Irish Catholic]]'', 23 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He published many English language documents on the second vatican council.

Flannery's campaigning to end apartheid in South Africa, led to involvement with [[Kader Asmal]], and the founding the Irish [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], of which he served as chairman and president. In the late sixties his campaigning on behalf of the [[Dublin Housing Action Committee]], due to its association with republicans and left wing activists, led him to being accused of being a communist.&lt;ref name="indoobit" /&gt; He was dismissed in the Dail by the then Minister for Finance, a certain [[Charles J. Haughey]], as "a gullible cleric".

He died of a heart attack aged 83 on 21 October 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1021/flannerya.html Fr Austin Flannery dies aged 83] www.rte.ie, Wednesday, 22 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried in the Dominican plot at [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicans.ie/friars/42-fr-austin-flannery-op.html?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page=  Death Notice, Fr Austin Flannery OP]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Dominicans Website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clericalwhispers.blogspot.ie/2008/10/fr-austin-flannery-op-rip.html Fr Austin Flannery OP - RIP] Clerical Whispers, Wednesday, October 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior analytics ==
Behavior informatics covers ''behavior analytics'' which focuses on analysis and learning of behavioral data.

== Behavior ==
From an informa[[Informatics|t]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ics perspective, a [[behavior]] consists of four key elements: actors (behavioral subjects and objects), operations (actions, activities) and interactions (relationships), and their properties. A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector, all behaviors of an actor or an actor group can be represented as behavior sequences and multi-dimensional behavior matrix.

He re-entered the order after his [[ordination]] and went on to hold several positions of leadership within his own order; he was even likened to [[Saint Paul of the Cross]] while [[Pope Leo XIII]] and [[Pope Pius X]] held him in high esteem.&lt;ref name=PN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.passionistnuns.org/Saints/BlBernardCP/index.htm|title=Blessed Bernard Mary Silvestrelli, C.P.|date=|publisher=Passionist Nuns|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91506|title=Blessed Bernard of Jesus Silvestrelli|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His beatification was celebrated on 16 October 1988 in [[Saint Peter's Square]] and his liturgical feast is affixed to the date of his death as is the custom.

==Life==
===Education and priesthood===
Cesare Silvestrelli was born on 7 November 1831 in [[Rome]] as the third of seven children to the nobles Gian Tommaso Silvestrelli (d. 1853) and Teresa Gozzani (d. 1846) and were residents of the [[Piazza della Minerva]] since their residence was at no. 38; he was [[baptized]] just hours after his birth in the names '''Cesare Pietro''' at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; His brother was Luigi (d. 20 September 1867). His father's funeral saw the attendance of 120 [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]] and 40 [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] as well as 40 [[Order of Preachers|Dominicans]].&lt;ref name=PN/&gt;

He did his initial education first at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]-run [[Roman College]] (1840–47) and thereafter continued his studies at an institute at the [[Oratory of San Francesco Saverio del Caravita|Caravita Oratorio]] in addition to a series of private schools.&lt;ref name=PN/&gt; He was attracted to the [[Passionists|Passionist]] charism and entered their order on 21 February 1854 (at [[Saints John and Paul basilica al Celio, Rome|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]]) before being admitted into their [[novitiate]] at their San Giuseppe [[convent]] in [[Monte Argentario]] on 25 March 1854.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He received the [[religious habit]] and was given the name "Luigi del Sacro Cuore di Maria" on 7 April 1854. But he was forced to leave the novitiate on 3 May due to ill health though continued living with the Passionists in another house in the same town while he did theological studies.&lt;ref name=PN/&gt; He did those studies under Father Pacifico di San Giuseppe and from 31 June to 24 August 1855 lived at Santi Giovanni e Paolo.

Silvestrelli received his [[Holy Orders|ordination]] to the priesthood on 22 December 1855 (as a diocesan priest rather than one in the religious life) from Bishop Giuseppe-Maria Molajoni.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He then decided to re-enter the order and so sent another application before being accepted.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; On 1 April 1856 he entered the novitiate once again though this time at [[Morrovalle]] where he re-assumed the habit and the new religious name "Bernardo Maria di Gesù". It was here that he was the classmate of fellow novice [[Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows|Saint Francesco Possenti]]. He made his final profession on 28 April 1857. Thereafter he pursued studies for preaching and once that was finished he was assigned first as the director of students at Morrovalle (1860-1864) and then as the [[Novice master|Master of Novices]] at the Passionist convent of [[Scala Santa]] (adjacent to the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] in Rome) from January 1865 until 1869.&lt;ref name=PN/&gt;

===Leadership===
His brother Luigi died on September 20, 1867 and he was present at his brother's bedside as he died; he attended the funeral on 23 September at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He was then appointed as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the Scala Santa convent and held that position from 27 May 1869 until 1875 after being confirmed on 14 April 1872. It was here that - on 19 September 1870 - [[Pope Pius IX]] visited the steps from which the convent assumed its name. The pope was making his last visit to the sacred sites of Rome before the dissolution of the [[Papal States]]. Silvestrilli supported the Pope through holding onto his arm as both men climbed the steps weeping together.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

On 7 June 1875 he was elected as the first Provincial Consulter of the Roman province (he moved to [[Vetralla]] around this stage for a brief period) and he later became the [[Provincial Superior|Vice-Provincial Superior]] in July 1876. In the [[General Chapter]] on 4 May 1878 he was elected as the [[Superior General]] of the order. and his first term ran until 1884. In this position he worked hard to reconcile rival factions in the order and also founded new houses abroad (more so in Latin America as well as advancing the [[Bulgaria]]n mission) and reformed the regulations of the order; he was firm in the conviction that a return to the original spirit and the Rule of the founder could be the singular formula for reviving the spirit of the charism. In 1887 he accepted a request from Cardinal [[Francis Patrick Moran]] to send Passionists to [[Australia]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=PN/&gt;

He was re-elected as Superior General in 1884 and resigned from the position on 2 January 1889 after making his decision in 1888. In 1893 a vision of his former classmate Possenti convinced him to attend the General Chapter and he was then once more elected as the Superior General (on 3 May) which was a post to which he was re-elected again in 1899 (in the first vote) and on 8 May 1905 (in the first vote).&lt;ref name=PN/&gt; He attended a retreat at Monte Argentario in August 1890 and dwelt in the smallest cell while spending long periods of time before the [[Eucharist]] in [[Eucharistic adoration|adoration]]. He established an international house of studies for Passionist students at Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Rome and visited all the Passionist provinces in the world including a visit to the [[United States of America]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; It was around this stage that he developed [[arthrosis]] of the spine that made leg and neck movement difficult for him. He resigned again on 7 July 1907 (for the final time) which [[Pope Pius X]] accepted but the pope named him as an "Onorario Generale" for life due to his great service while in office and also as a sign of the pope's esteem. He was often praised as a second [[Saint Paul of the Cross]] and even [[Pope Leo XIII]] and Pius X regarded him high enough to offer him the cardinalate several times despite his humble refusals.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

===Death===
On 16 June 1911 he retired to the Passionist convent in [[Moricone]] and died there on 9 December 1911 after he fell backwards down a set of stairs as he was ascending. His remains were later exhumed and moved to the Moricone convent on 17 April 1931.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened under [[Pope Pius XII]] on 13 February 1942 and he became titled as a [[Servant of God]] while the confirmation of his model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]] allowed for [[Pope Paul VI]] to name him as [[Venerable]] on 18 October 1973. [[Pope John Paul II]] later beatified Silvestrelli on 16 October 1998 in [[Saint Peter's Square]].

The current [[postulator]] for the cause is the Passionist priest Giovanni Zubiani.

'''Betty Compson''' (born '''Eleanor Luicime Compson''', March 19, 1897 &amp;ndash; April 18, 1974) was an American actress and film producer. Most famous in [[silent films]] and early [[sound film|talkies]], she is best known in her performances in ''[[The Docks of New York]]'' and ''[[The Barker]]'', the latter earning a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

==Early life==
Compson was the daughter of Virgil K. Compson and Mary Elizabeth Rauscher,&lt;ref name="oi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=William|title=Compson, Betty|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1802341?rskey=V6Huzo&amp;result=55|website=Oxford Index|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110025612/http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1802341?rskey=V6Huzo&amp;result=55|archivedate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; born on March 19, 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Scott|title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.|date=2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476625997|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOHgDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;q=%22Eleanor%20Luicime%20Compson%22|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Beaver, Utah]], a mining camp. At various times, her father was a mining engineer, a gold prospector, and a grocery store proprietor. Her mother was a maid in homes and in a hotel.&lt;ref name="oi" /&gt; Compson attended public schools in Utah and graduated from Salt Lake High School.&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katchmer|first1=George A.|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Silent Film Western Actors and Actresses|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476609058|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VnGeCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;q=%22Betty%20Compson%22%20actress|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father died when she was young and she had to obtain employment as a violinist when 16 years old at a theater in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/betty-compson/|title=Betty Compson|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Playing in vaudeville sketches with touring circuits, Compson got noticed by Hollywood producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/bettycompson.html|title=© Betty Compson, Silent and Sound Movie Star - goldensilents.com|website=www.goldensilents.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While touring, she was discovered by comedic producer [[Al Christie]] and signed a contract with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Kristen Anderson|title=Comic Venus: Women and Comedy in American Silent Film|date=2018|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=9780814341032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUo9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT312&amp;q=%22Eleanor%20Luicime%20Compson%22|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first silent film, ''Wanted, a Leading Lady'', was in November 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bits of News for Movie Fans|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16410566/betty_compson/|work=Star Tribune|date=November 7, 1915|location=Minnesota, Minneapolis|page=35|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = January 9, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made 25 films in 1916 alone, although all of them were shorts for Christie with the exception of one feature ''Almost a Widow''.&lt;ref name="silentfilm.org"&gt;Muller, Eddie. 2012. San Francisco Silent Film Festival: ''The Docks of New York'' Retrieved 28 April 2018. http://www.silentfilm.org/archive/the-docks-of-new-york&lt;/ref&gt; She continued this pace of making numerous short films well into the middle of 1918 when after a long apprenticeship with Christie she started making features exclusively. Compson's star began to rise with the release of the 1919 feature ''[[The Miracle Man (1919 film)|The Miracle Man]]'' (1919) for ''[[George Loane Tucker]].'' Paramount signed Compson to a five-year contract with help of director Tucker.
[[File:Betty Compson 1.JPG|left|left|thumb|Compson in ''Photoplay'' Magazine (July 1920)]]
Her popularity allowed her to establish her own production company that providing her creative control over screenplays and financing.&lt;ref name="silentfilm.org"/&gt; Her first movie as producer was ''[[Prisoners of Love (1921 film)|Prisoners of Love]]'' (1921). She played the role of ''Blanche Davis'', a girl born to wealth and cursed by her inheritance of physical beauty. Compson selected [[Arthur Rosson|Art Rosson]] to direct the feature. The story was chosen from a work by actress and writer Catherine Henry. After completing ''[[The Woman With Four Faces]]'' (1923), Paramount refused to offer her a raise (her salary was $2,500 a week) and she refused to sign without one. Instead, she signed with a motion picture company in [[London, England]]. There she starred in a series of four films directed by [[Graham Cutts]], a well-known English filmmaker. The first of these was a movie version of an English play called ''[[Woman to Woman (1923 film)|Woman to Woman]]'' (1923), the screenplay for which was co-written by Cutts and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Part of [[The White Shadow (film)|The White Shadow]] (in which played a dual role), another Cutts/Hitchcock collaboration has been found and preserved from a collection in New Zealand.

''Woman to Woman'' was released in the United States and proved to be popular enough for [[Jesse Lasky]] to offer top dollar to return to Paramount. Back in Hollywood, she starred in ''[[The Enemy Sex]]'', directed by [[James Cruze]]. The two were married on October 25, 1925; they divorced in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neste|first1=Dan Van|title=The Magnificent Heel: The Life and Films of Ricardo Cortez|date=2017|publisher=BearManor Media|page=229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nM5ADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA229&amp;q=%22Betty%20Compson%22%20actress|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her contract with Paramount was not renewed in 1925 and she decided to freelance, working with lower budget studios such as [[Columbia Pictures]] in ''[[The Belle of Broadway]]'' (1926) and Chadwick in ''[[The Ladybird (film)|The Ladybird]]'' (1926). During this time, she was suggested as a replacement for difficult Greta Garbo in the MGM feature ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' opposite John Gilbert. She was eventually able to work for the studio with former ''The Miracle Man'' co-star [[Lon Chaney]] in ''[[The Big City (1928 film)|The Big City]]''

In 1928, she appeared in a [[First National Pictures]] part-talkie, ''[[The Barker]]''. Her performance as manipulative carnival girl Carrie garnered her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=("Betty Compson" search results)|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/search/results|website=Academy Awards Database|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she lost to [[Mary Pickford]] in ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]''. In "Court-Martial", a 1928 silent film that apparently has not survived, she became the first actress to portray Old West outlaw Belle Starr on film. In the same year, she appeared in the highly acclaimed [[Josef von Sternberg]] film ''[[The Docks of New York]]'' in a sympathetic portrayal of a suicidal prostitute rescued by stoker [[George Bancroft]]. These films caused Compson's popularity to re-emerge and she became one of the busiest actresses in the new talking cinema. In fact, Chaney offered her the female lead in his first talkie ''[[The Unholy Three (1930 film)|The Unholy Three]]'', but she was too busy and instead suggested friend Lila Lee. Unlike a number of other female stars of silent film, it was felt that her voice recorded exceptionally well.  Although she was not a singer, she appeared in a number of early musicals, in which her singing voice was dubbed.

===Later career===
Now divorced from Cruze, Compson's career continued to flourish, starring in nine films in 1930 alone. However, her last hit proved to be in ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', alongside [[Gary Cooper]]. She was unable to score a success and was only able to secure roles in "poverty row" studios.

One major film in which she did not appear was ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''; although she shot a [[Technicolor]] screen test for the role of Belle Watling, she was not cast in the role.  In 1941, Compson appeared in a small role in an Alfred Hitchcock film ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]''. Most of her later films were low-budget, even exploitation, efforts. Compson's last film was ''[[Here Comes Trouble (1948 film)|Here Comes Trouble]]'' (1948).

==Personal life==
During the filming of ''Ladies Must Live'', Compson began a relationship with married director George Loane Tucker. However, he was dying and as a favor to her, negotiated a contract with Paramount for her.

In 1924, Compson married film director [[James Cruze]], who directed her in films such as ''[[The Enemy Sex]]'' and ''[[The Great Gabbo]]''. They divorced in 1930. The reason for the divorce was that Cruze had an addiction to alcohol and work, which put a strain on their marriage and his health. Soon after their divorce, Cruze filed for bankruptcy, and Compson was forced to sell her possessions to pay past years' income taxes.

Compson later married and divorced agent-producer Irving Weinberg and Silvius Jack Gall, who died in 1962. All unions were childless.

After retiring from the screen in 1948, she began a cosmetic line and helped her husband run a business called "Ashtrays Unlimited".

==Death==
Compson died April 18, 1974, of a heart attack, at her home in [[Glendale, California]], aged 77. She was interred in [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in [[San Fernando, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellenberger|first1=Allan R.|title=Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries: A Directory|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786450190|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZraJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;q=%22Eleanor%20Luicime%20Compson%22|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left no surviving relatives.

==Hollywood Walk of Fame==
For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Compson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1751 Vine Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkoffame.com/betty-compson Hollywood Walk of Fame]; Retrieved 2017-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brighton trunk murders''' were two murders linked to [[Brighton]], England, in 1934. In each, the body of a murdered woman was placed in a [[trunk (luggage)|trunk]].

The murders led to Brighton being dubbed "The Queen of Slaughtering Places" (a play on "The Queen of Watering Places")&lt;ref name = Carder&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/page_id__7860_path__0p1364p1445p.aspx |title=My Brighton and Hove – Brighton: The name |publisher=www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unsolved June murder ==
The first murder came to light on 17 June 1934, when an unclaimed plywood trunk was noticed by William Joseph Vinnicombe at the left luggage office of [[Brighton railway station]] as he investigated a smell. He alerted the police and Chief Inspector Ronald Donaldson opened the trunk to find the dismembered torso of a woman. When other stations were alerted a suitcase at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross railway station]] was found to contain the legs. The head and arms were never found. The press named the victim 'The Girl with the Pretty Feet' or simply 'Pretty Feet' because the corpse had 'Dancer's Feet', thought beautiful.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The post-mortem by [[Sir Bernard Spilsbury]] revealed that the woman was about 25 and five months pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rose, 'Lethal Witness' Sutton Publishing 2007, Kent State University Press 2009 pp233-234&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the victim nor the murderer was ever identified.

Chief Inspector Donaldson suspected a local abortionist named Massiah based on what was known about him and on Spilsbury's notes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Internal examination of the torso had not revealed the cause of death; the legs and feet found at King's Cross belonged to the torso; the victim had been well nourished; she had been not younger than twenty-one and not older than twenty-eight, had stood about five feet two inches, and had weighed roughly eight and a half stones; she was five months pregnant at the time of death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Donaldson asked officers to watch Massiah covertly. One, drafted from Hove, confronted Massiah, expecting him to come quietly. Instead the doctor wrote a list of names and "...it seemed to the policeman that the sun had gone in: all of a sudden the consulting room was a place of sombre shadows....".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Goodman) ''The Railway Murders'', Allison &amp; Busby 1984&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The policeman did not tell Donaldson, who heard only when he was warned by a senior officer to back off. Massiah moved to London where a woman died while he was performing an abortion, yet he evaded prosecution. He remained on the [[General Medical Register]] and was removed only after he failed to re-register in 1952, following his retirement to [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Spilsbury, always on the lookout for evidence of illegal abortions, described no evidence of interference with the pregnancy, and noted that the dismemberment showed no particular anatomical skill &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rose op cit p240&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violette Kaye and Toni Mancini ==
[[File:Violette Kaye.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Violette Kaye]]
Although the first murder was almost certainly unrelated to the second, it did lead to discovery of the second trunk murder.

The victim was Violette Kaye (née Watts, also known as Saunders), aged 42. She had been a dancer and prostitute in London, where she had met Toni Mancini, aged 26 who had a criminal record including theft and loitering but who also worked as a waiter and bouncer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowker|1961|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as Cecil Lois England (his real name), Jack Notyre, Tony English and Hyman Gold.&lt;ref name = Wilson&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to Brighton together in September 1933 and lived at various addresses.

Kaye and Mancini’s relationship was tempestuous. One argument occurred on 10 May 1934 at the Skylark café on the seafront, where Mancini worked, when an obviously drunk Kaye accused him of being familiar with a teenage waitress called Elizabeth Attrell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowker|1961|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaye was never seen again and the following day Mancini told friends she had gone to Paris, and gave some of her clothes and belongings to Attrell. Her sister-in-law also received a telegram which read "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. --Vi"; it was later established that this had been sent from Brighton that morning, by which time Kaye was already dead.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1961 148"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowker|1961|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mancini then took new lodgings in 52 Kemp Street, close to the station, and transported a trunk to his new flat by [[handcart]]. He put the trunk, with Kaye's non-dismembered body inside it, at the foot of his bed, covered it with a cloth and used it as a coffee table – in spite of the smell and leaking fluids, of which visitors complained.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1961 148"/&gt;

Kaye’s absence had been noted by police and Mancini was questioned. Apparently panicked, he went on the run. During investigation related to the unsolved trunk murder, police searched premises close to the station and stumbled upon Kaye’s remains in Mancini’s lodgings. Mancini was arrested in South East London. The post mortem was also carried out by [[Sir Bernard Spilsbury]].&lt;ref name = Wilson/&gt;

=== Trial ===
[[File:TonyMancini1934.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Mancini]]
Mancini's trial opened in December 1934 in [[Lewes Crown Court|Lewes Assizes]] and lasted five days. The prosecution was led by J C Cassells and on his team was [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]] (later Lord Hailsham). [[Norman Birkett]] was defence counsel.&lt;ref name = Wilson/&gt;

The prosecution focused on Kaye’s death by a blow to the head. A graphologist confirmed the handwriting on the form for the telegram sent to Kaye’s sister matched that on menus Mancini had written at the Skylark café. One witness, Doris Saville, said Mancini had asked her to provide a false alibi. Other witnesses, friends of Mancini, claimed he boasted in the days after the murder of giving his "missus" the biggest hiding of her life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Birkett’s defence focused on Kaye’s work as a prostitute and her character. Mancini claimed he had discovered Kaye’s body at the flat in [[Park Crescent, Brighton]]. Thinking the police would not believe his story because he had a criminal record he kept the matter a secret and put her body in a trunk. Birkett speculated she could have been murdered by a client or fallen down steps into the flat.&lt;ref name = Wilson/&gt;

The quality and nature of the [[forensic evidence]] was also drawn into doubt by the defence who queried the amount of morphine in Kaye’s blood and proved that items of clothing stained with blood had been purchased after Kaye’s death. The testimony of Sir Bernard Spilsbury, whose stellar career as principal Home Office pathologist was already in decline, was effectively demolished by the brilliant cross-examination and closing speech of Norman Birkett.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rose op cit Chapter Twenty 'Tony Mancini: The Brighton Trunk Murders'.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of witnesses also confirmed that Mancini and Kaye had seemed a contented couple.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

After two and a quarter hours the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.&lt;ref name = Wilson/&gt;

In 1976, just before his death, Mancini confessed to a ''[[News of the World]]'' journalist. He explained that during a blazing row with Kaye she had attacked him with the hammer he had used to break coal for their fire. He had wrested the hammer from her, but when she had demanded it back, he had thrown it at her, hitting her on the left temple. A prosecution of Mancini for [[perjury]] was considered but rejected due to lack of corroboration.&lt;ref name = natarch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=179-spa&amp;cid=-1#-1 |title=The National Archives – Sussex Police Authority|publisher=www.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=19 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was dramatised in a 1951 episode of [[Orson Welles]]' radio drama ''[[The Black Museum]]'' titled "The Hammerhead" (with the story being changed to reveal the victim's sister as the killer).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== 1831 murder==
The press attention to the 1934 trunk murders revived interest in a previous Brighton trunk murder. In the 19th century, John Holloway murdered his wife Celia Holloway, a painter on the [[The Royal Suspension Chain Pier|Chain Pier]], then transported her body in a trunk on a wheelbarrow to Lover’s Walk in Preston Park, Brighton, and buried the remains. Holloway was arrested, tried in Lewes and hanged at Horsham gaol on 16 December 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowland| first = David| title = The Brighton Trunk Murders| year = 2008 | publisher = Finsbury Publishing| isbn = 978-0-9539392-8-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Artemia''''' is a genus of aquatic [[crustacean]]s also known as '''brine shrimp'''. ''Artemia'', the only genus in the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Artemiidae''', has changed little externally since the [[Triassic]] period. The first historical record of the existence of ''Artemia'' dates back to the first half of the 10th century AD from [[Urmia Lake]], [[Iran]], with an example called by an Iranian geographer an "aquatic dog",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alireza Asem |author2=Amin Eimanifar |year=2016 |title=Updating historical record on brine shrimp Artemia (Crustacea: Anostraca) from Urmia Lake (Iran) in the first half of the 10th century AD |journal=International Journal of Aquatic Science |volume=7 |pages=1–5 |url=http://www.alireza-asem.ir/Asem%20and%20Eimaifar%20(2016)1.pdf |access-date=2016-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401073432/http://alireza-asem.ir/Asem%20and%20Eimaifar%20(2016)1.pdf# |archive-date=2016-04-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the first unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schlösser in 1757 of animals from [[Lymington]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=R2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alireza Asem |year=2008 |title=Historical record on brine shrimp ''Artemia'' more than one thousand years ago from Urmia Lake, Iran |journal=Journal of Biological Research-Thessaloniki |volume=9 |pages=113–114 |url=http://www.alireza-asem.ir/Asem4.pdf |access-date=2013-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201062316/http://www.alireza-asem.ir/Asem4.pdf# |archive-date=2016-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artemia'' populations are found worldwide in inland saltwater lakes, but not in oceans. ''Artemia'' are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators, such as fish, by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity (up to 25%).&lt;ref name=R3&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Daintith |year=1996 |title=Rotifers and ''Artemia'' for Marine Aquaculture: a Training Guide |oclc=222006176 |publisher=[[University of Tasmania]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of the ''Artemia'' to produce dormant eggs, known as [[Microbial cyst|cysts]], has led to extensive use of ''Artemia'' in [[aquaculture]]. The cysts may be stored for long periods and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref name=R3/&gt; [[Nauplius (larva)|Nauplii]] of the brine shrimp ''Artemia'' constitute the most widely used food item, and over 2000 tonnes of dry ''Artemia'' cysts are marketed worldwide annually. In addition, the resilience of ''Artemia'' makes them ideal animals for running biological toxicity assays and it has become a [[model organism]] used to test the [[Toxicology testing|toxicity]] of chemicals. Breeds of ''Artemia'' are sold as novelty gifts under the marketing name ''[[Sea-Monkeys]]'' or ''Aqua Dragons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aqua Dragons |url=http://aquadragons.net/ |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The brine shrimp ''Artemia'' comprises a group of seven to nine species very likely to have diverged from an ancestral form living in the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] area about {{Ma|5.5}}.&lt;ref name=R4&gt;{{cite book |author=F. A. Abreu-Grobois |year=1987|chapter=A review of the genetics of ''Artemia'' |editors=P. Sorgerloo, D.&amp;nbsp;A. Bengtson, W. Decleir &amp; E. Jasper |title=''Artemia'' Research and its Applications. Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on the Brine Shrimp ''Artemia'', organised under the patronage of His Majesty the King of Belgium |volume=1 |publisher=Universa Press |location=Wetteren, Belgium |pages=61–99 |oclc=17978639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laboratory of Aquaculture &amp; Artemia Reference Center ([http://www.aquaculture.ugent.be/index.htm ARC]) at Ghent University possesses the largest known ''Artemia'' cyst collection, a cyst bank containing over 1,700 ''Artemia'' population samples collected from different locations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genomic tools and sex determination in the extremophile brine shrimp Artemia franciscana|last=De Vos|first=Stephanie|publisher=UGent|year=2014|isbn=9789059897175|location=Ghent|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Artemia'' is a typical primitive [[arthropod]] with a segmented body to which is attached broad leaf-like [[appendage]]s. The body usually consists of 19 segments, the first 11 of which have pairs of appendages, the next two which are often fused together carry the reproductive organs, and the last segments lead to the tail.&lt;ref name=R5&gt;{{cite book |author=Cleveland P. Hickman |year=1967 |title=Biology of Invertebrates |publisher=C.&amp;nbsp;V. Mosby |location=St. Louis, Missouri |url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL19205202M/Biology_of_the_invertebrates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total length is usually about {{convert|8|-|10|mm}} for the adult male and {{convert|10|-|12|mm|abbr=on}} for the female, but the width of both sexes, including the legs, is about {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}}.

The body of ''Artemia'' is divided into head, [[thorax]], and abdomen. The entire body is covered with a thin, flexible [[exoskeleton]] of chitin to which muscles are attached internally and shed periodically.&lt;ref name=R6&gt;{{cite book |author1=R. J. Criel  |author2=H. T. Macrae  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |chapter=''Artemia'' morphology and structure |editors=T.&amp;nbsp;J. Abatzopoulos, J.&amp;nbsp;A. Breardmore, J.&amp;nbsp;S. Clegg &amp; P. Sorgerloos |title=''Artemia'': Basic and Applied Biology |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |pages=1–33 |isbn=978-1-4020-0746-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In female ''Artemia'' a [[ecdysis|moult]] precedes every [[ovulation]].

For brine shrimp, many functions, including swimming, digestion and reproduction are not controlled through the brain; instead, local nervous system [[Ganglion|ganglia]] may control some regulation or synchronisation of these functions.&lt;ref name=R6/&gt; Autotomy, the voluntary shedding or dropping of parts of the body for defence, is also controlled locally along the nervous system.&lt;ref name=R5/&gt; ''Artemia'' have two types of eyes. They have two widely separated [[compound eye]]s mounted on flexible stalks. These compound eyes are the main optical sense organ in adult brine shrimps. The median eye, or the [[naupliar eye]], is situated anteriorly in the centre of the head and is the only functional optical sense organ in the nauplii, which is functional until the adult stage.&lt;ref name=R6/&gt;

==Ecology and behavior==
Brine shrimp can tolerate any levels of [[salinity]] from 25[[‰]] to 250‰ (25–250&amp;nbsp;g/L),&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite book |author=John K. Warren |year=2006 |title=Evaporites: Sediments, Resources and Hydrocarbons |publisher=[[Birkhäuser Verlag|Birkhäuser]] |isbn=978-3-540-26011-0 |chapter=Halotolerant life in feast or famine (a source of hydrocarbons and a fixer of metals) |pages=617–704 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihny39BvVhIC&amp;pg=PA641}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an optimal range of 60‰–100‰,&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt; and occupy the [[ecological niche]] that can protect them from predators.&lt;ref name=R7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhitey.com/Ecology/Artemia/BrineShrimp.html |title=Brine shrimp |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |author=Whitey Hitchcock |publisher=Clinton High School Science |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903034459/http://www.drwhitey.com/Ecology/Artemia/BrineShrimp.html |archivedate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiologically, optimal levels of salinity are about 30–35‰, but due to predators at these salt levels, brine shrimp seldom occur in natural habitats at salinities of less than 60–80‰. Locomotion is achieved by the rhythmic beating of the appendages acting in pairs. Respiration occurs on the surface of the legs through fibrous, feather-like plates (lamellar epipodites)&lt;ref name=R5/&gt;

[[File:Brine shrimp cyst.jpg|frame|left|An ''Artemia'' cyst]]

===Reproduction===
Males differ from females by having the second [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] markedly enlarged, and modified into clasping organs used in mating.&lt;ref name="Tyson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greta E. Tyson  |author2=Michael L. Sullivan  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1980 |title=Scanning electron microscopy of the frontal knobs of the male brine shrimp |journal=Transactions of the American Microscopical Society |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=167–172 |jstor=3225702}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adult female brine shrimp ovulate approximately every 140 hours. In favourable conditions, the female brine shrimp can produce eggs that almost immediately hatch. While in extreme conditions, such as low oxygen level or salinity above 150‰, female brine shrimp produce eggs with a [[chorion|chorion coating]] which has a brown colour. These eggs, also known as cysts, are [[Metabolism|metabolically]] inactive and can remain in total stasis for two years while in dry oxygen-free conditions, even at temperatures below freezing. This characteristic is called [[cryptobiosis]], meaning "hidden life". While in cryptobiosis, brine shrimp eggs can survive temperatures of [[liquid air]] ({{convert|-190|C|F|0|disp=or}}) and a small percentage can survive above boiling temperature ({{convert|105|C|F|disp=or}}) for up to two hours.&lt;ref name=R7/&gt;
Once placed in briny (salt) water, the eggs hatch within a few hours. The [[Nauplius (larva)|nauplius]] larvae are less than 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm in length when they first hatch.

===Parthenogenesis===
[[File:Central fusion and terminal fusion automixis.svg|thumb|right|The effects of central fusion and terminal fusion on heterozygosity]]
[[Parthenogenesis]] is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of [[embryo]]s occur without [[fertilisation]]. [[Thelytoky]] is a particular form of parthenogenesis in which the development of a female individual occurs from an unfertilised egg. [[Automixis]] is a form of thelytoky, but there are different kinds of automixis. The kind of automixis relevant here is one in which two haploid products from the same meiosis combine to form a diploid [[zygote]].

Diploid ''[[Artemia parthenogenetica]]'' reproduce by automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion (see diagram) and low but nonzero recombination.&lt;ref name="pmid26356354"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=O. Nougué, N. O. Rode, R. Jabbour-Zahab, A. Ségard, L.-M. Chevin, C.&amp;nbsp;R. Haag &amp; T. Lenormand |title=Automixis in ''Artemia'': solving a century-old controversy |journal=[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=2337–48 |year=2015 |pmid=26356354 |doi=10.1111/jeb.12757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central fusion of two of the haploid products of meiosis (see diagram) tends to maintain [[Zygosity|heterozygosity]] in transmission of the genome from mother to offspring, and to minimise [[inbreeding depression]]. Low crossover recombination during meiosis likely restrains the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity over successive generations.

===Diet===
In their first stage of development, ''Artemia'' do not feed but consume their own energy reserves stored in the cyst.&lt;ref name=R8&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. Sorgeloos |author2= P. Dhert  |author3=P. Candreva  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Use of the brine shrimp, ''Artemia'' spp., in marine fish larviculture |journal=[[Aquaculture (journal)|Aquaculture]] |volume=200 |pages=147–159 |url=http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/54679.pdf |doi=10.1016/s0044-8486(01)00698-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild brine shrimp eat microscopic [[Phytoplankton|planktonic]] [[algae]]. Cultured brine shrimp can also be fed particulate foods including [[yeast]], [[wheat]] [[flour]], [[soybean]] [[powder (substance)|powder]] or [[egg yolk]].&lt;ref name=R9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~davidr/discus/articles/artemia.html |title=''Artemia'' (Brine Shrimp) FAQ 1.1 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |author=Kai Schumann |date=August 10, 1997 |publisher=[[Portland State University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814003850/http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~davidr/discus/articles/artemia.html |archivedate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
''Artemia'' comprises sexually reproducing, [[diploid]] species and several [[obligate]] [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] ''Artemia'' populations consisting of different clones and [[Ploidy|ploidies]] (2n-&gt;5n).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maniatsi|first=Stefania|last2=Baxevanis|first2=Athanasios D.|last3=Kappas|first3=Ilias|last4=Deligiannidis|first4=Panagiotis|last5=Triantafyllidis|first5=Alexander|last6=Papakostas|first6=Spiros|last7=Bougiouklis|first7=Dimitrios|last8=Abatzopoulos|first8=Theodore J.|date=2011-02-01|title=Is polyploidy a persevering accident or an adaptive evolutionary pattern?

==Aquaculture==
[[File:Artemia breeding ponds.jpg|thumb|Salt ponds, [[San Francisco Bay]]]]
{{main|Aquaculture of brine shrimp}}

Fish farm owners search for a cost-effective, easy to use, and available food that is preferred by the fish. From cysts, brine shrimp nauplii can readily be used to feed fish and crustacean larvae just after one-day [[Hatchery|incubation]]. [[Instar]] I (the nauplii that just hatched and with large yolk reserves in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, because they are easy for operation, rich in nutrients, and small, which makes them suitable for feeding fish and crustacean larvae live or after drying.

==Toxicity test==
''Artemia'' found favor as a [[model organism]] for use in toxicological assays, despite the recognition that it is too robust an organism to be a sensitive [[indicator species]].&lt;ref name=R12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/documents/education/brine_shrimp_ecology.pdf |title=Brine shrimp ecology |author1=Micharl Dockey |author2=Stephen Tonkins |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[British Ecological Society]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708032931/http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/documents/education/brine_shrimp_ecology.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pollution research ''Artemia'', the brine shrimp, has had extensive use as a test organism and in some circumstances is an acceptable alternative to the [[toxicity testing]] of mammals in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=R13&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L. Lewan |author2 = M. Anderrson  |author3=P. Morales-Gomez  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1992 |title=The use of ''Artemia salina'' in toxicity testing |journal=Alternatives to Laboratory Animals |volume=20 |pages=297–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that millions of brine shrimp are so easily reared has been an important help in assessing the effects of a large number of [[Pollution|environmental pollutants]] on the shrimps under well controlled experimental conditions.

==Conservation==
[[File:Artemia monica.jpg|thumb|left|''Artemia monica'' (male)]]

Overall brine shrimp are abundant, but some populations and localized species do face threats, especially from habitat loss to [[introduced species]]. For example, ''[[Artemia franciscana|A. franciscana]]'' of the Americas has been widely introduced to places outside its native range and is often able to outcompete local species, such as ''[[Artemia salina|A. salina]]'' in the Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Muñoz J |author2=Gómez A |author3=Green AJ |author4=Figuerola J|author5=Amat F|author6=Rico C|year=2008 |title=Phylogeography and local endemism of the native Mediterranean brine shrimp Artemia salina (Branchiopoda: Anostraca) |journal=Mol. Ecol. |volume=17 | issue=13 |pages=3160–3177 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03818.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Naceur2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hachem Ben Naceur |author2=Amel Ben Rejeb Jenhani |author3=Mohamed Salah Romdhane |year=2009 |title=New distribution record of the brine shrimp Artemia (Crustacea, Branchiopoda, Anostraca) in Tunisia |journal=Check List |volume=5 | issue=2 |pages=281–288 |issn=1809-127X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the highly localized species are ''[[Artemia urmiana|A. urmiana]]'' from [[Lake Urmia]] in Iran. Once abundant, the species has drastically declined due to drought, leading to fears that it was almost extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 December 2014 |title=Lake Urumia’s Artemia Face Extinction |url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/people/7606/lake-urumia-s-artemia-face-extinction |publisher=Financial Tribune | accessdate=29 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a second population of this species has recently been discovered in the [[Koyashskoye Salt Lake]] at the [[Crimean Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eimanifar A |author2=Asem A |author3=Djamali M |author4=Wink M|year=2016 |title=A note on the biogeographical origin of the brine shrimp Artemia urmiana Günther, 1899 from Urmia Lake, Iran |journal=Zootaxa |volume=4097 | issue=2 |pages=294–300 |doi=10.11646/zootaxa.4097.2.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Artemia monica|A. monica]]'', the species commonly known as Mono Lake brine shrimp, can be found in [[Mono Lake]], [[Mono County, California]]. In 1987, Dennis D. Murphy from [[Stanford University]] petitioned the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] to add ''A. monica'' to the endangered species list under the [[Endangered Species Act]] (1973). The diversion of water by the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] resulted in rising [[salinity]] and concentration of [[sodium hydroxide]] in Mono Lake. Despite the presence of trillions of brine shrimp in the lake, the petition contended that the increase in [[pH]] would endanger them. The threat to the lake's water levels was addressed by a revision to [[California State Water Resources Control Board]]'s policy, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service found on 7 September 1995 that the Mono Lake brine shrimp did not warrant listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://frwebgate3.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=9913285177+1+0+0iWAISaction=retrieve |title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 12-Month Finding for a Petition to List the Mono Lake Brine Shrimp as Endangered |publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service |journal=Federal Register |volume=60 |issue=173 |year=1995 |pages=46571–46572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space experiment==
Scientists have taken the eggs of brine shrimp to [[outer space]] to test the impact of [[Cosmic ray|radiation]] on life. Brine shrimp cysts were flown on the U.S. Biosatellite II, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17 missions, and on the Russian [[Bion-3]] ([[Cosmos 782]]), [[Bion-5]] ([[Cosmos 1129]]), Foton 10, and Foton 11 flights. Some of the Russian flights carried European Space Agency experiments.

On ''[[Apollo 16]]'' and ''[[Apollo 17]]'', the cysts traveled to the [[Moon]] and back. The [[cosmic ray]] passed through an egg would be detected on the [[photographic film]] in their container. Some eggs were kept on Earth as [[Scientific control|experimental controls]] to ensure a fair test. Also, as the take-off in a [[spacecraft]] involves a lot of shaking and [[acceleration]], one control group of egg cysts was accelerated to seven times the force of [[gravity]] and vibrated mechanically from side to side for several minutes so that they could experience the same violence of a rocket take-off.&lt;ref name=R14&gt;{{cite book |authors=H. Planel, Y. Gaubin, R. Kaiser &amp; B. Pianezzi |year=1980 |title=The effects of cosmic rays on ''Artemia'' egg cysts |series=Report for National Aeronautics and Space Administration |journal=''Laboratoire Medicale'' |publisher=Faculté de Médcine |location=Toulouse, France}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 400 eggs in each experimental group. All the egg cysts from the experiment were then placed in salt water to hatch under optimum conditions. As a result, a high sensitivity to cosmic radiation was observed on ''Artemia salina'' eggs; 90% of the [[embryo]]s, which were induced to develop from hit eggs, died at different developmental stages.&lt;ref name=R15&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H.

'''Luke Joseph Scarpa'''&lt;ref name="PWHF"/&gt; (October 4, 1928 – April 3, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who was best known by the [[ring name]] '''Chief Jay Strongbow'''. Scarpa portrayed a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] wrestler, who wore a [[war bonnet]] to the ring and would "go on the warpath" when the fans started cheering him against an opponent.&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/cheifjaystrongbow|title=Chief Jay Strongbow's WWE Hall of Fame Profile|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been acknowledged that he was in fact an [[Italian-American]].&lt;ref name=chiefbackground&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/sports/joe-scarpa-who-gained-wrestling-fame-as-chief-jay-strongbow-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===National Wrestling Alliance (1947–1970)===
Scarpa's wrestling career began in 1947, under his real name.&lt;ref name="OWOW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/j/jay-strongbow.html|title=Wrestler Profiles: Chief  --&gt;Jay Strongbow|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a standout in the Georgia and Florida territories of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] throughout the 1950s and 1960s, winning several championships and becoming a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1970–1977)===
In 1970, Scarpa began working for [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vincent J. McMahon]]'s [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation (1963-1979)|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] as Chief Jay Strongbow, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] complete with a traditional headdress and Native themed [[Professional wrestling holds|wrestling moves]].&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slotnik, Daniel E. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/sports/joe-scarpa-who-gained-wrestling-fame-as-chief-jay-strongbow-dies.html?_r=1&amp; Joe Scarpa, Who Gained Wrestling Fame as Chief Jay Strongbow, Dies] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (April 5, 2012). Retrieved on 7-07-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He feuded with the likes of [[Andres Labrakis|"The Golden Greek" Spiros Arion]], [[Jimmy Valiant|"Handsome Jimmy" Valiant]], and [[Superstar Billy Graham]], nearly winning the [[WWE Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]]. A memorable match against "Iron Mike" McCord featured Strongbow applying his sleeper hold. But [[Lou Albano]], McCord's manager, interfered by smashing a cast on the Chief's forehead. It was alleged that Strongbow had previously jumped Albano in the locker room, breaking his arm. McCord was disqualified, but Strongbow was cut wide open by Albano's blows. Strongbow settled the score in front of a sold out crowd at [[Madison Square Garden]], beating Captain Lou Albano convincingly.

Strongbow picked up a win at Madison Square Garden in the summer of 1970, shortly after he entered the WWWF, pinning top contender Crusher Verdue, who was managed by Lou Albano.

In 1975, he began feuding with Spiros Arion. Arion, a popular and seemingly unbeatable [[babyface (wrestling)|babyface]], returned to the WWWF after an absence and teamed with Strongbow. Arion turned on Strongbow, destroying his headdress on Philadelphia television after he had tied Strongbow in the ropes, and rubbed the feathers in his face. Arion was now a [[heel (wrestling)|heel]], and pinned Strongbow in eastern arenas as he went on to challenge champion [[Bruno Sammartino]].

Strongbow won his first [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]] on May 22, 1972 with partner [[Larry Johnson (wrestler)|Sonny King]].&lt;ref name="worldtagteam"/&gt; They defeated the team of [[Mikel Scicluna|Baron Mikel Scicluna]] and [[King Curtis Iaukea]].&lt;ref name="worldtagteam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam|title=World Tag Team Championship official title history|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strongbow and King held the title for a month before losing it to the team of [[Harry Fujiwara|Mr. Fuji]] and [[Charles Kalani, Jr.|Professor Toru Tanaka]] on June 27.&lt;ref name="worldtagteam"/&gt;

Four and a half years later, on December 7, 1976, Strongbow won his second WWWF World Tag Team Championship, this time with partner [[Adnan Al-Kaissie|Billy White Wolf]].&lt;ref name="worldtagteam"/&gt; The team won the title in a three-team tournament, defeating The Executioners and [[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[Tor Kamata]].&lt;ref name="worldtagteam"/&gt; Their reign was cut short in August 1977 when the belts were vacated due to White Wolf suffering a neck injury at the hands of [[Ken Patera]]'s Swinging [[Professional wrestling holds#Full Nelson|Full Nelson]].&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt;

===NWA Detroit / Big Time Wrestling (1977)===
Strongbow also competed for [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik's]] Big Time Wrestling promotion in Detroit. He had a memorable feud with [[Don Kent (wrestler)|"Bulldog" Don Kent]], which culminated in a "shark cage match"&lt;ref name="PWHF"/&gt; in 1977. Strongbow and Kent fought inside of a small shark cage, with the first man to escape being declared the winner. With an assist from fellow fan favorite [[Mark Lewin]], Strongbow was able to escape the shark cage victorious.

===Return to WWF (1979–1983)===
In 1979, he feuded with [[Greg Valentine|Greg "The Hammer" Valentine]], who broke Strongbow's leg. The two wrestled all over the WWF circuit, including an "Indian Strap match" at Madison Square Garden on July 30, 1979.&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt;

In 1982, Strongbow formed a tag team with his on-screen brother, [[Jules Strongbow]].&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt; On June 28, the Strongbows won the tag team championship from the team of Mr. Fuji and [[Masa Saito|Mr. Saito]] in [[New York City]]'s Madison Square Garden.&lt;ref name="worldtagteam"/&gt; During the match, special guest referee [[Ivan Putski]] counted the winning fall, but did not see Fuji's foot draped over the bottom rope. On the July 13 episode of ''[[WWWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'', the Strongbows lost the titles back to Fuji and Saito,&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt; but on the October 26 episode of ''Championship Wrestling'', the Strongbows defeated Fuji and Saito for their second WWF Tag Team Championship reign as a team.&lt;ref name="worldtagteam"/&gt; On the March 8, 1983 episode of ''Championship Wrestling'', the Strongbows lost the titles to [[The Wild Samoans]] ([[Afa Anoa'i|Afa]] and [[Sika Anoa'i|Sika]]).&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt; After failing in regaining the belts, the Strongbows disbanded.&lt;ref name=WWF6389Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963 - 1989  | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2013 | isbn=1492825972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement (1985–1994)===
Strongbow retired in 1985, but would still step back into the ring from time to time, most notably for a legends [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] in 1987. In retirement, Strongbow became a WWF [[road agent (professional wrestling)|road agent]] and worked in the company's front office.&lt;ref name="PWHF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt; He also participated in a 1994 storyline in which he mentored [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]] (an actual Native American of the [[Lumbee]] tribe).&lt;ref name="SlamDies"/&gt; Strongbow was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1994)|class of 1994]] by [[Gorilla Monsoon]].&lt;ref name="WWE Profile"/&gt; Strongbow's last appearance in WWE was a brief appearance on the November 17, 2008 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' when [[Stephanie McMahon]] introduced him to the audience in Atlanta.&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/11/18/7446076.html|title=Raw: Lumberjacks bring predictable chaos|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

The '''Congressional Cemetery''' or '''Washington Parish Burial Ground''' is a historic and active [[cemetery]] located at 1801 E Street, SE, in Washington, D.C., on the west bank of the [[Anacostia River]].  It is the only American "cemetery of [[national memory]]" founded before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name = "NHL nom p4"&gt;National Historic Landmark Nomination, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
Over 65,000 individuals are buried or memorialized at the cemetery, including many who helped form the nation and the city of Washington in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="congressional cemetery website"/&gt;

Though the cemetery is privately owned, the U.S. government owns 806 burial plots administered by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]. Congress, located about a mile and a half (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) to the northwest, has greatly influenced the history of the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cem.va.gov/cems/lots/congressional.asp Department of Veterans Affairs], Congressional Cemetery Government Lots, accessed April 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery still sells plots, and is an active burial ground.  From the [[Washington Metro]], the cemetery lies three blocks east of the [[Potomac Avenue (WMATA station)|Potomac Avenue]] station and two blocks south of the [[Stadium-Armory (WMATA station)|Stadium-Armory]] station.

Many members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] who died while Congress was in session are interred at Congressional Cemetery. Other burials include early landowners and speculators, the builders and architects of early Washington, Native American diplomats, Washington city mayors, and [[American Civil War]] veterans. Nineteenth-century Washington, D.C., families unaffiliated with the federal government also have graves and tombs at the cemetery.

In all, there are one [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], one [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justice]], six [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] members, 19 [[United States Senate|Senators]] and 71 [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] (including a former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) buried there, as well as veterans of every American war, and the first [[director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[J. Edgar Hoover]].&lt;ref name="congressional cemetery website"&gt;{{cite web |title=Congressional Cemetery Website |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 23, 1969, and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="NHL designation"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places listings for June 24, 2011|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20110624.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
The Congressional Cemetery was established by private citizens associated with Christ Church on a 4.5 acre plot in 1807 and was later given to [[Christ Church, Washington Parish|Christ Church]], which gave it its official name '''Washington Parish Burial Ground'''. By 1817 sites were set aside for government legislators and officials; this includes [[cenotaph]]s for many legislators buried elsewhere.  The cenotaphs, designed by [[Benjamin Latrobe]], each have a large square block with recessed panels set on a wider plinth and surmounted by a conical point.

[[File:Latrobe Clinton LOC cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Architectural drawing of Vice President [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]'s monument by [[Benjamin Latrobe]], 1812.  Clinton was later reinterred in New York.  The monuments to the right are in the form of the Latrobe cenotaphs.]]
From 1823 to 1876 the U.S. Congress funded the expansion, enhancement, and maintenance of the cemetery, but it never became a federal institution. Appropriations funded a gravel road from the Capitol to the cemetery, paving within the cemetery, the public vault, fencing, and the gatehouse, as well as funerals for congressmen and the cenotaphs.&lt;ref name = "NHL nom p4"/&gt;  During the early part of this period, graves were laid out in a grid pattern in an extension of the grid in the [[L'Enfant Plan]] for Washington, and little or no landscaping or plantings were made on the grounds.&lt;ref name = "NHL nom p8"&gt;National Historic Landmark Nomination, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The grid survives to this day and was extended as the cemetery expanded.

===Expansion===
Starting in the late 1840s, the cemetery was influenced by the [[rural cemetery]] movement in which the graves were placed in a park-like setting with extensive landscaping.  To implement this new vision, the cemetery needed to expand.&lt;ref name = "NHL nom p8"/&gt;

Between 1849 and 1869 the cemetery grew in area to 35.75 acres. The original cemetery was located on block 1115 on E Street between 18th and 19th Streets Southeast in 1808.  In 1849, it doubled in size by acquiring the block  to its south, 1116. In 1853, it expanded to the east on blocks 1130, 1148 and 1149 between F and G Streets Southeast. In 1853-53, the cemetery expanded to the west by acquiring block 1104, between 17th Street and 18th Streets Southeast.  In 1858, the cemetery acquired block 1105 and Reservation 13. In 1859, it added blocks 1105 and 1123. Finally, the cemetery reached its current extent of 35.75 acres by growing south to Water Street Southeast with blocks 1106 and 1117 in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/acquisitionofthesqauresindrawing.pdf|title=Acquisition of the Squares|publisher=Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery|date=2011-01-14|access-date=2011-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211234959/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/acquisitionofthesqauresindrawing.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sousa Grave and Bench DC.JPG|thumb|left|Grave of John Philip Sousa]]
Eventually the land to the south of the cemetery was transferred to the [[National Park Service]] although the access road to the RFK Stadium parking lot is administered by the DC Sports and Entertainment Commission.  In the 1950s, it appeared that the southeast corner of the cemetery would become a part of the right of way for the [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Southeast-Southwest Freeway]].  However, protracted environmental litigation halted construction at [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], with the dead end of the freeway being connected by a temporary road to the RFK parking lot and to 17th Street Southeast at the southwest corner of the cemetery.

After 1876 the cemetery was seldom used or supported by Congress.  Nevertheless, many wealthy Washingtonians continued to bury family members there, and figures associated with the government who were local residents, such as [[Marine Corps Band]] Director [[John Philip Sousa]] and [[J. Edgar Hoover]], were buried there.  By the 1970s urban decay, the declining membership of Christ Church, and the declining value of the endowment funded by Christ Church, left the cemetery in serious difficulties.  Monuments and burial vaults were in disrepair.  Maintenance on buildings had been long delayed.  There was no paid staff and minimal funding.  Drug dealers and prostitutes began to occupy the cemetery.&lt;ref name ="Preserve"&gt;Betsy Crosby, [http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2012/jan-feb/congressional-cemetery.html The Resurrection of Congressional Cemetery, Historic Capitol Cemetery Revived by Local Preservationists], [[Preservation (magazine)|Preservation]], January/February, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The cemetery is still owned by Christ Church but since 1976 it has been managed by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC).  Progress on the renovation was very slow until two volunteers became involved.  Jim Oliver, then assistant manager of the House Republican Cloakroom, became involved in the late 1980s and helped revive congressional interest in the cemetery. The K-9 Corps, a group of dog owners whose activities helped drive away the drug dealers, was organized in 1997.&lt;ref name ="Preserve"/&gt;

Renovation picked-up after [[C-SPAN]] broadcast a video on the cemetery on July 5, 1996.&lt;ref name="span A"/&gt; The following weekend 100 airmen from [[Joint Base Andrews|Andrews Air Force Base]] arrived unannounced to mow the 35-acre lawn, and a contingent from the Army post at [[Fort Belvoir]] followed the next month. A Joint Service Day involving all five branches of the U.S. military has since become an annual tradition. In 2013, a record 328 people participated.&lt;ref name ="Preserve"/&gt;

The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] included the cemetery on its 1997 list of  [[America's Most Endangered Places|America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places]] and many gifts and donations were soon received. Congress gave $1 million in matching funds in 1999 to create an endowment for basic maintenance, and a 2002 Congressional appropriation funds restoration.&lt;ref name ="Preserve"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/Research/Newsletters/2000_2009/Newsletter_2007_Fall.pdf |title=Fall 2007 Heritage Gazette Newsletter |access-date=2010-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725195452/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/Research/Newsletters/2000_2009/Newsletter_2007_Fall.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APHCC now hosts over 1,000 volunteers each year working on a wide variety of projects: from planting bulbs to resetting tombstones to pruning trees, adopting and landscaping individual plots, providing research, and writing a quarterly newsletter. Events hosted by the APHCC have included free guided tours on Saturdays, Christmas caroling, Christ Church's Easter services, book signings, Pride 5k race and Dead Man's Run 5k race, Day of the Dog Festival, Ghosts &amp; Goblets Gala, and much more.&lt;ref name="congressional cemetery website"/&gt;

In August 2013 the cemetery began using [[goat]]s to eat and clear the surrounding wooded area of [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]], [[Hedera helix|English ivy]], grass, and other plants. The 58 "eco-goats", which cost $4,000, are considered more ecologically friendly than mowers and pesticides and provide fertilizer as well. It was the first use of goats inside the beltway.  The use of the goats drew widespread international attention and televised reports on BBC World News, Nat Geo, News Hour, NBC Nightly News, Tokyo TV, China CCTV, and Al-Jazeera.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/at-congressional-cemetery-goats-eating-their-way-through-an-acre-of-poison-ivy/2013/08/07/a098cc44-ff81-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html Shapira, Ian.

In the May 2013, Congressional Cemetery hired Topographix, a firm which surveys cemeteries using [[ground-penetrating radar]], to document burials in the cemetery. Although the cemetery had excellent records going back to its founding, many burial sites lacked a marker or had the marker removed or stolen. Additionally, subsidence of some areas and buckling in others changed the location of graves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalcommunitynews.com/content/congressional-cemetery-revealed Bosworth, Sharon. "Congressional Cemetery Revealed."] ''Capital Community News.'' June 1, 2013. Accessed 2013-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The last time Congressional Cemetery was accurately and completely mapped was 1935. By the end of 2013, about half the cemetery had been mapped, revealing a potential 2,750 unmarked burial sites. Cemetery staff said many of these burials are probably recorded, but some may be new discoveries. Congressional Cemetery officials said they were one of only 12 cemeteries in the city still accepting burials, and the mapping project would allow it to identify unused space. The mapping project will be completed in the spring of 2014, and the cemetery said it would use the results to release a [[Mobile app|mobile phone app]] which will allow users to search for and locate graves on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bone-finder-uses-ground-penetrating-radar-to-find-lost-graves-at-congressional/2013/12/13/9518d3e4-6441-11e3-91b3-f2bb96304e34_story.html Binkovitz, Leah.

==Monuments and structures==
[[File:ClayCalhoun QRc CC.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Cenotaphs of Senators [[John C. Calhoun]] (left) and [[Henry Clay]]]]
The Congressional Cemetery is a National Historic Landmark [[Historic District]] with 9 [[contributing structure]]s and 186 contributing objects built from 1817 to 1876.  Later structures and objects are considered to be "non-contributing" even if they are significant in the cemetery's current appearance.&lt;ref name="NHL p9"&gt;NHL Nomination, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cenotaphs===
Of the 186 contributing objects, 168 are the nearly identical Congressional cenotaphs, believed to have been designed by the [[Architect of the Capitol]] [[Benjamin Latrobe]].&lt;ref name="NHL p9"/&gt;  As used at the Congressional Cemetery, the term "cenotaph" includes not only monuments to those buried elsewhere, but also to the Latrobe monuments that mark the actual graves of representatives and senators.  Some congressmen are buried under a cenotaph, some are buried without one in a different area of the cemetery, and for some the marker is a true cenotaph. [[James Gillespie (politician)|James Gillespie]] (1747–1805) who was reinterred in 1892, has a separate grave and cenotaph.

A cenotaph was erected for each congressman who died in office from 1833 to 1876.  The first was for Rep. [[James Lent]]. After Congress appropriated funds and his monument was ordered, his family reinterred the body in New York.  Congress erected the monument in 1839 anyway, establishing the tradition of erecting cenotaphs.&lt;ref name=ceno/&gt;

[[File:QR CC cenotaphs Tip and Hale.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Cenotaphs of Tip O'Neill (front, with flag) and Hale Boggs (rear, with flag). Note [[QRpedia]] QR codes displayed on metal spikes.]]
The cenotaphs are constructed of [[Aquia Creek sandstone|Aquia sandstone]], as are the [[White House]] and the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], and were likewise painted white, forming a visual connections with these nearby symbols of Federal government, and a contrast to the surrounding gravestones.  They are grouped in rows in the older part of the cemetery where they dominate the landscape.&lt;ref name = "NHL nom p8"/&gt;

After the Civil War very few congressmen were buried in the cemetery, as their bodies were commonly shipped to their home states or buried in the new [[National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]] such as [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Cenotaphs were discontinued in 1876 after Massachusetts Senator [[George Frisbie Hoar]] stated that "the thought of being buried beneath one of those atrocities brought new terror to death."&lt;ref name=ceno&gt;[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/WT2%20Cenotaphs.pdf Congressional Cemetery]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2007, Cenotaph Walking Tour, accessed April 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Thornton]], who served as Architect of the Capitol before Latrobe, is the only person honored with a cenotaph who did not serve as a congressman.  Former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] was honored with a cenotaph in 1994, though it is not in the style of a Latrobe cenotaph.  After a [[Nicholas Begich#Disappearance|1972 plane crash]] in which their bodies were lost, [[Hale Boggs]] and [[Nick Begich|Nicholas Begich]] share a cenotaph.  These are the only cenotaphs erected since 1876.&lt;ref name=ceno/&gt;

===Public Vault===
{{Main article|Public Vault at the Congressional Cemetery}}
[[File:DC arsenal cenotaph.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Arsenal Disaster Monument]]
The [[Public Vault at the Congressional Cemetery|Public Vault]] is an early classical revival structure built 1832-34 with Federal funds to store the bodies of government officials before burial.
A classical marble facade with baroque scrolls decorate the partially subterranean vault. Double wrought iron doors have the words "PUBLIC VAULT" displayed by means of vent holes.&lt;ref name="NHL p9"/&gt;  Temporary residents of this vault have included three [[list of Presidents of the United States|U.S. president]]s: [[John Quincy Adams]] (1848), [[William Henry Harrison]] (1841), and  [[Zachary Taylor]] (1850).  President Harrison stayed in the vault for three months, three times longer than the time he spent as president.&lt;ref name="Washian"&gt;Josh Swiller, [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/a-walk-through-congressional-cemetery/ A Walk Through Congressional Cemetery], Washingtonian, May 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Dolley Madison]] was interred in the Public Vault for two years, the longest known interment in the vault, while funds were being raised for her re-interment at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]]. Her body was transferred to Causten family vault, located directly across the path from the Public Vault, for another six years before the funds were raised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdMtziloE7k American Artifacts: Congressional Cemetery], American History TV, CSPAN3, on YouTube, accessed April 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  First Lady [[Louisa Catherine Adams]] has been reported as having been interred in the Public Vault, but other sources report that she was interred in the Causten family vault.&lt;ref name="PV Post"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Public Vault|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/panorama/2006/12/13/PA2006121300640.html|work=The [[Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 17, 2013|date=December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cong Cem L Adams"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Lady Louisa C.

===Arsenal Disaster Monument===
In 1864 an explosion at the nearby [[Washington Arsenal]] killed a woman supervisor and 20 teenage girls, most of them Irish, who worked packing explosives and cartridges. President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] led the funeral procession to the cemetery and attended the graveside ceremonies.  Later a monument was erected over the graves of 16 of the victims.  A sculpture of a grieving young woman stands atop a marble column on the monument.&lt;ref&gt;NHL Nomination, pp. 11 and 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Local artist, [[Lot Flannery]] of the Flannery Brothers Marble Manufacturers, sculpted the monument.&lt;ref name=flannery&gt;{{cite web | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=G1I98048Q3397.39158&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=&amp;term=&amp;index=.GW&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;term=&amp;index=.AW&amp;term=&amp;index=.TW&amp;term=&amp;index=.SW&amp;term=&amp;index=.FW&amp;term=&amp;index=.OW&amp;term=76005972&amp;index=.NW&amp;x=9&amp;y=10#focus | title=Arsenal Monument, (sculpture). | publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum | accessdate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lot&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cem.va.gov/cems/lots/congressional.asp | title=Congressional Cemetery Government Lots | publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs | accessdate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand funerals==
Several nationally important or otherwise remarkable funerals have taken place at the Congressional Cemetery.  These funerals featured long formal processions starting at the White House or the Capitol, moving down Pennsylvania Avenue to E Street SE, and thence to the cemetery. Parts of this road were specially funded by Congress to facilitate these processions.  The form and protocol of these funerals formed the basis for later U.S. [[State funerals in the United States|state funerals]], including those of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Johnson, Chapter 2, "The Grand Procession to the National Burial Ground."&lt;/ref&gt;

These funerals include those held to honor:

In 2009, the association retained the  Oehme, van Sweden &amp; Associates to develop a new landscape plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/2009annualreport.pdf|title=2009 Annual Report|publisher=Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery|date=2011-01-14|page=10}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery has approximately 2,000 plots available for sale.  On March 20, 2014, the cemetery received its green burial certification from the [http://www.greenburialcouncil.org/ Green Burial Council].  Green burials are allowed in any plot in the cemetery.

===K-9 Corps===
Congressional Cemetery is also known for allowing members of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC) to walk dogs off-leash on the cemetery grounds. In addition to their membership dues, '''K-9 Corps''' members pay a fee for the privilege of walking their dogs. K-9 Corps members provide about 20% of Congressional Cemetery's operating income. Dog walkers follow a set of rules and regulations and provide valuable volunteer time to restore the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cemeterydogs.org |title=Cemetery Dogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The K-9 Corps program is recognized as providing the impetus for the revitalization of Congressional Cemetery, which had fallen into neglect prior to the program's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/21/AR2006122101127.html |title=Congressional Cemetery's Slow Resurrection | work=The Washington Post | first=Ryan | last=Holeywell | date=December 22, 2006 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the association restricted K-9 membership, placing restrictions on dogwalkers as the program became more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/ |title=Dogwalking Program Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The K-9 Corps program has been nationally recognized for creative use of urban green space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cemeterydogs.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45148">'''Criticism of the War on Terror''' addresses the morals, [[ethics]], efficiency, economics, as well as other issues surrounding the [[War on Terror]]. It also touches upon criticism against the phrase itself, which was branded as a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that participating [[government]]s exploited it to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003"&gt;[[George Monbiot]], [http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2003/03/11/a-wilful-blindness "A Wilful Blindness"] ("Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination"), ''monbiot.com'' (author's website archives), reposted from ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 11, 2003, accessed May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/fbi-tried-to-co/|title=FBI Tried to Cover Patriot Act Abuses With Flawed, Retroactive Subpoenas, Audit Finds|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=March 13, 2008|work=Wired.com|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and infringe upon [[human rights]]. It is argued that the term [[war]] is not appropriate in this context (as in [[War on Drugs]]), since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |title="War on terror" difficult to define |last=Richissin |first=Todd |date=2004-09-02 |publisher=''The Baltimore Sun'' |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114085106/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that "[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]" is not an enemy, but a tactic: calling it a "war on terror" obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s and international [[mujahideen]]. With a military presence in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and its associated collateral damage [[Shirley Williams]] maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley."&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1072390,00.html The seeds of Iraq's future terror]&lt;/cite&gt;".

==Terminology==
Various critics dubbed the term "War on Terror" as nonsensical.
For example, billionaire activist investor [[George Soros]] criticized the term "War on Terror" as a "false metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0815-35.htm A Self-Defeating War]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Wall Street Journal]], August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Linguist [[George Lakoff]] of the [[Rockridge Institute]] argued that there cannot literally be a [[Wiktionary:war|war]] on terror, since [[Wiktionary:terror|terror]] is an [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract noun]]. "Terror cannot be destroyed by weapons or signing a peace treaty. A war on terror has no end."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/lakoff/gwot_rip 'War on Terror,' Rest In Peace]&lt;/cite&gt;".[[Rockridge Institute]], February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jason Burke]], a journalist who writes about radical Islamic activity, describes the terms "[[definitions of terrorism|terrorism]]" and "[[War on Terror|war against terrorism]]" in this manner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are multiple ways of defining [[terrorism]] and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'. Some state clearly the kinds of group ('sub-national', 'non-state') or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with an act that involves innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory and grave problems with the use of the term persist.

Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term '[[militant (word)|militancy]]'. This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Jason|title=Al-Qaeda|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2003|pages=22|chapter=2|isbn=978-1-85043-396-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Perpetual war===
Former [[United States|U.S.]] President [[George W. Bush]] articulated the goals of the War on Terror in a September 20, 2001 speech, in which he said that it "will not end until every [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press release
|publisher=The White House
|date=September 20, 2001
|title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People
|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010920-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same speech, he called the war "a task that does not end", an argument he reiterated in 2006 State of The Union address.

===Preventive war===
One [[Rationale for the Iraq War|justification given for the invasion of Iraq]] was to prevent terroristic, or other attacks, by Iraq on the United States or other [[nation]]s. This can be viewed as a [[conventional warfare]] realization of the War on Terror.

A major criticism leveled at this justification is that it does not fulfill one of the requirements of a [[just war]] and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined [[international law]] and the authority of the [[United Nations]], particularly the [[United Nations Security Council]]. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the [[UN Charter]] and the [[Nuremberg Principles|Nuremberg principle]]s, therefore committing a [[war of aggression]], which is considered a [[war crime]]. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a [[precedent]], under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.

[[Richard N. Haass]], president of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], argues that on the eve of U.S. intervention in 2003, [[Iraq]] represented, at best, a gathering threat and not an imminent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Richard N.|title=The Irony of American Strategy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May–June 2013|volume= 92|issue= 3|page=57|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139106/richard-n-haass/the-irony-of-american-strategy|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hindsight he notes that Iraq did not even represent a gathering threat. "The decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 was discretionary: it was a war of choice. There was no vital American interests in imminent danger and there were alternatives to using military force, such as strengthening existing sanctions."&lt;ref name="FA Haas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Richard N.|title=The Irony of American Strategy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May–June 2013|volume= 92|issue= 3|page=58|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139106/richard-n-haass/the-irony-of-american-strategy|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Haass argues that U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 began as a war of necessity—vital interests were at stake—but morphed "into something else and it crossed a line in March 2009, when President [[Barack Obama]]` decided to sharply increase American troop levels and declared that it was U.S. policy to 'take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east' of the country."&lt;ref name="FA Haas" /&gt; Afghanistan, according to Haass, eventually became a war of choice.

==War on Terror seen as pretext==
Excerpts from an April 2006 report compiled from sixteen U.S. government intelligence agencies has strengthened the claim that engaging in Iraq has increased terrorism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Glaister, Dan. "&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1880275,00.html Campaign in Iraq has increased threat, says American intelligence report]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[Guardian Unlimited]], September 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic civil liberties===

Abar was in Abu Ghraib for [[carjacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=War in Iraq |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5412316/site/newsweek/ |title=Beneath the Hoods |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2007-02-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126023954/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5412316/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=2007-01-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the [[United Kingdom]], critics have claimed that the [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government used the War on Terror as a pretext to radically curtail civil liberties, some enshrined in law since [[Magna Carta]]. For example, the detention-without-trial in [[Belmarsh]] prison:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3714864.stm|title= Belmarsh - Britain's Guantanamo Bay? |last=Winterman|first=Denise|date=2004-10-06|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; controls on free speech through laws against protests near Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4523838.stm|title= Falconer defends new protest law|date=2005-12-13|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and laws banning the "glorification" of terrorism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4834738.stm|title= Lords back down on glorification|date=2006-03-22|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reductions in checks on police power, as in the case of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5173032.stm|title= Profile: Jean Charles de Menezes|date=2006-07-13|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mohammed Abdul Kahar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5075952.stm|title= Brothers looking for 'justice'|last=Summers|first=Chris|date=2006-06-13|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Leader [[Sir Menzies Campbell]] has also condemned Blair's inaction over the controversial U.S. practice of [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]], arguing that the human rights conventions to which the UK is a signatory (e.g. [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) impose on the government a "legal obligation" to investigate and prevent potential torture and human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4863776.stm|title= UK airspace 'used for rendition' |date=2006-03-31|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unilateralism===
U.S. President George W. Bush's remark of November 2001 claiming that "You're either with us or you are with the terrorists,"&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/11/06/ret.bush.coalition/index.html Bush says it is time for action]&lt;/cite&gt;" has been heavily criticized. [[Cable News Network]], 6 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; has been a source of criticism.  Thomas A. Keaney of Johns Hopkins University's Foreign Policy Institute said "it made diplomacy with a number of different countries far more difficult because obviously there are different problems throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Susan Martin. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/05/09/Columns/With_us_or_against_us.shtml With us or against us? Mideast is not that simple]&lt;/cite&gt;". ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', 9 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a war against Islam===
{{See also|War against Islam}}

Since the War on Terror revolved primarily around the United States and other NATO states intervening in the internal affairs of Muslim countries (i.e. in [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], etc.) and [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|organisations]], it has been labelled a war against Islam by ex-[[United States Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/17/stories/2007121754781100.htm|title=Ramsey Clark Interview|last=Dam|first=Marcus|date=2007-12-17|publisher=''The Hindu''|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. 
After his release from Guantanamo in 2005, ex-detainee [[Moazzam Begg]] appeared in the Islamist propaganda video ''21st Century CrUSAders'' and claimed the U.S. was engaging in a new [[Crusades|crusade]]:&lt;ref name="CrusadersVideo"&gt;"21st Century CrUSAders: A War on Muslims in Iraq and Palestine" [[DVD]]/[[VHS]], ''Green 72 Media'', 2005.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that history is definitely repeating itself and for the Muslim world and I think even a great part of the non-Muslim world now, are beginning to recognize that there are ambitions that the United States has on the lands and wealth of nations of Islam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Aiding terrorism===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Each month, there are more suicide terrorists trying to kill Americans and their allies in Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as other Muslim countries than in all the years before 2001 ''combined''. From 1980 to 2003, there were 343 suicide attacks around the world and at most 10 percent were anti-American inspired. Since 2004, there have been more than 2,000, over 91 percent against U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as other countries.|source=[[Robert Pape]]&lt;ref name="PapeOccupation"&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/18/it_s_the_occupation_stupid It's the Occupation, Stupid]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[University of Chicago]] professor and political scientist, [[Robert Pape]] has written extensive work on [[suicide terrorism]] and states that it is triggered by [[military occupations]], not extremist ideologies. In works such as ''[[Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]]'' and ''Cutting the Fuse'', he uses data from an extensive terrorism database and argues that by increasing military occupations, the US government is increasing terrorism. Pape is also the director and founder of the [[Robert Pape#CPOST|Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST)]], a database of every known suicide terrorist attack from 1980 to 2008.

In 2006, a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] stated that the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism. The estimate was compiled by 16 intelligence agencies and was the first assessment of global terrorism since the start of the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spy Agencies Say Iraq War Worsens Terrorism Threat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/world/middleeast/24terror.html|first=Mark|last=Mazzetti|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2006|name-list-format=vanc|postscript=|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelia Beyer explains how terrorism increased as a response to past and present military intervention and occupation, as well as to 'structural violence'. Structural violence, in this instance, refers to economic conditions of backwardness which are attributed to the economic policies of the Western nations, the United States in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Cornelia (2008), "Violent Globalisms", Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] politician [[Shirley Williams]] wrote that the United States and United Kingdom governments "must stop to think whether it is sowing the kind of resentment which is the seedbed of future terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley. "&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1072390,00.html The seeds of Iraq's future terror]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Guardian]], 28 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom [[ambassador]] to [[Italy]], [[Ivor Roberts (ambassador)|Ivor Roberts]], echoed this criticism when he stated that President Bush was "the best recruiting sergeant ever for al Qaeda."&lt;ref&gt;Richburg, Keith B. "&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58041-2004Sep28?language=printer Kerry Is Widely Favored Abroad]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Washington Post]], p. A14, 29 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The United States also granted "protected persons" status under the Geneva Convention to the [[Mojahedin-e-Khalq]], an Iranian group classified by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] as a terrorist organization, sparking criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Scott. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0729/p07s01-wome.html Why the U.S. granted 'protected' status to Iranian terrorists]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Christian Science Monitor]], 29 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics further noted that the American government granted political asylum to several alleged terrorists and terrorist organizations that seek to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime, while the American government claims to be anti-terrorism.

===Hypocrisy of the Bush Administration===
The alleged mastermind behind the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] was part of the mujahideen who were sponsored, armed, trained and aided by the CIA to fight the [[Soviet Union]] after it [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|intervened in Afghanistan in 1979]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,174608,00.html|title=Bin Laden Profiled|last=Karon|first=Tony|date=2001-09-12|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html|title=The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means|last=Cook|first=Robin|date=2005-07-08|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=2009-01-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/28/world.terrorism|title=The making of the world's most wanted man: Part 1|last=Burke|first=Jason|date=2001-10-28|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=2009-01-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/osamabinladen/|title=Who is Osama bin Laden?|date=2006-01-19|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela accused the U.S. government of having a double standard towards terrorism for giving safe haven to [[Luis Posada Carriles]].&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Science Monitor. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0929/dailyUpdate.html "Venezuela accuses U.S. of 'double standard' on terrorism".] Retrieved August 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Americans also commented on the selective use of the term War on Terrorism, including 3 star general [[William Odom]], formerly President Reagan's [[National Security Agency|NSA]] Director, who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As many critics have pointed, out, terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. Because the United States itself has a long record of supporting terrorists and  [[United States and state-sponsored terrorism|using terrorist tactics]], the slogans of today's war on terrorism merely makes the United States look hypocritical to the rest of the world. A prudent American president would end the present policy of "sustained hysteria" over potential terrorist attacks..treat terrorism as a serious but not a strategic problem, encourage Americans to regain their confidence and refuse to let al Qaeda keep us in a state of fright.&lt;ref name="odom_terrorismtactic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/32938989/American-Hegemony-How-to-Use-It-How-to-Lose American Hegemony How to Use It, How to Lose at Docstoc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misleading information===
In the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated they possessed information which demonstrated a link between [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]]. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, ''Newsweek'' magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaresearch.org/rm/cyber/2004/binladen061704/segment1.ram Link between Saddam and al-Qaeda] - ABC News video report&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush Administration believed there was a possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath regime]] following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan. [[Amnesty International]] Secretary General [[Irene Khan]] criticized the use of pro-humanitarian arguments by [[Coalition of the willing|Coalition]] countries prior to its [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], writing in an open letter: "This selective attention to human rights is nothing but a cold and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists. Let us not forget that these same governments turned a blind eye to Amnesty International's reports of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before the [[Gulf War]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Irene Khan|Khan, Irene]].

===Torture by proxy===
{{main|Extraordinary Rendition|Torture and the United States#Torture and Extraordinary Rendition}}
{{See also|Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture}}

The term "torture by proxy" is used by some critics to describe situations in which the CIA&lt;ref name="NYT-17-Feb-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA-Background-Memo"&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc97.pdf Background Paper on CIA's Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques]". 30 December 2004.

Retrieved 29 March 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other US agencies transferred supposed terrorists, whom they captured during their efforts in the 'War on terrorism', to countries known to employ [[torture]] as an interrogation technique. Some also claimed that US agencies knew torture was employed, even though the transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law.  Nonetheless, [[Condoleezza Rice]] (then the [[United States Secretary of State]]) stated that:&lt;ref name=rice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Upon Her Departure for Europe, 5 Dec 2005|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/57602.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;the United States has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This US programme also prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving [[Council of Europe]] member states, including those related with the so-called War on Terrorism. A [[#27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution|June 2006 report]] from the Council of Europe estimated that 100 people were kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory with the cooperation of Council of Europe members and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres ("[[black site]]s"), some located in Europe, utilised by the CIA. According to the separate [[#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|European Parliament report of February 2007]], the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where these alleged 'terrorists' could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Religionism and Islamophobia==
One aspect of the criticism regarding the rhetoric justifying the War on Terror was religionism, or more specifically [[Islamophobia]]. Theologian Amir Hussain, who studies contemporary Muslims societies in North America, defines this concept as a stereotyping of all followers of Islam as real or potential terrorists due to alleged hateful and violent teaching of their religion. He goes on to argue that "Islam is reduced to the concept of jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Lawrence. "Islamophobia, the Israel Lobby and American Paranoia: Letter From America." Holy Land Studies, 10.1 (2011): 90. DOI: 10.3366/hls.2011.0005.&lt;/ref&gt; This line of argument echoes [[Edward Said]]’s famous piece [[Orientalism (book)|''Orientalism'']] in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in an essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward W. "Islam Through Western Eyes." The Nation 26 April 1980. Posted on-line 1 January 1998. Accessed 13 December 2010 http://www.thenation.com/article/islam-through-western-eyes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decreasing international support==
In 2002, strong majorities supported the U.S.-led War on Terror in [[UK|Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[India]] and [[Russia]], according to a sample survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]]. By 2006, supporters of the effort were in the minority in Britain (49%), Germany (47%), France (43%) and Japan (26%). Although a majority of Russians still supported the War on Terror, that majority had decreased by 21%. Whereas 63% of Spaniards supported the War on Terror in 2003, only 19% of the population indicated support in 2006. 19% of the Chinese population still supports the War on Terror and less than a fifth of the populations of [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], as well as [[Jordan]] support the efforts. The report also indicated that Indian public support for the War on Terror has been stable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/commentary/display.php?AnalysisID=1019 Pew Global Attitudes Project: America's Image in the World: Findings from the Pew Global Attitudes Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228000000/http://pewglobal.org/commentary/display.php?AnalysisID=1019 |date=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew Kohut, while speaking to the [[U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], noted that and according to the [[Pew Research Center]] polls conducted in 2004, "the ongoing conflict in Iraq continues to fuel anti-American sentiments. America’s global popularity plummeted at the start of military action in Iraq and the U.S. presence there remains widely unpopular."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/congress/koh111005.pdf|format=PDF|title=Testimony of Andrew Kohut United States House of Representatives International Relations Committee Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|date=2005-11-10|publisher=Air War College - [[Maxwell Air Force Base]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of U.S. media==
Researchers in communication studies and political science found that American understanding of the "War on Terror" is directly shaped by how mainstream news media reports events associated with the conflict.   In ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuypers|first=Jim A.|title =Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age|date =2006-10-28|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-3653-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] illustrated "how the press failed America in its coverage on the War on Terror." In each comparison, Kuypers "detected massive bias on the part of the press." This researcher called the mainstream news media an "anti-democratic institution" in his conclusion. "What has essentially happened since 9/11 has been that Bush has repeated the same themes and framed those themes the same whenever discussing the War on Terror," said Kuypers. "Immediately following 9/11, the mainstream news media (represented by CBS, ABC, NBC, ''USA Today'', ''The New York Times'', as well as ''The Washington Post'') did echo Bush, but within eight weeks it began to intentionally ignore certain information the president was sharing and instead reframed the president's themes or intentionally introduced new material to shift the focus."

This goes beyond reporting alternate points of view, which is an important function of the press. "In short," Kuypers explained, "if someone were relying only on the mainstream media for information, they would have no idea what the president actually said. It was as if the press were reporting on a different speech." The study is essentially a "comparative framing analysis." Overall, Kuypers examined themes about 9-11 and the War on Terror that President Bush used and compared them to themes that the press used when reporting on what he said.

"Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner," wrote Kuypers. These findings suggest that the public is misinformed about government justification and plans concerning the War on Terror.

Others have also suggested that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of the threat to the U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, ''Trapped in the War on Terror''&lt;ref name="Lustick 2006"/&gt; political scientist Ian S. Lustick, claimed, "The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response." Lustick alleged that the War on Terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took on a life of its own, fueled by media coverage. [[Scott Atran]] writes that  "publicity is the oxygen of terrorism"  and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that "perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atran|first=Scott |title= Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists|date=2010-10-19|publisher=Ecco Press/ HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-134490-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media researcher Stephen D. Cooper's analysis of media criticism ''Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers As the Fifth Estate''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Stephen D.|title=Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers As the Fifth Estate|date=2006-06-12|publisher=Marquette Books|isbn=0-922993-47-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains several examples of controversies concerning mainstream reporting of the War on Terror.  Cooper found that bloggers' criticisms of factual inaccuracies in news stories or bloggers' discovery of the mainstream press' failure to adequately verify facts before publication caused many news organizations to retract or change news stories.

Cooper found that bloggers specializing in criticism of media coverage advanced four key points:
*Mainstream reporting of the War on Terror has frequently contained factual inaccuracies.  In some cases, the errors go uncorrected: moreover, when corrections are issued they usually are given far less prominence than the initial coverage containing the errors.
*The mainstream press has sometimes failed to check the provenance of information or visual images supplied by Iraqi "stringers" (local Iraqis hired to relay local news).
*Story framing is often problematic: in particular, "man-in-the-street" interviews have often been used as a representation of public sentiment in Iraq, in place of methodologically sound survey data.
*Mainstream reporting has tended to concentrate on the more violent areas of Iraq, with little or no reporting of the calm areas.

[[David Barstow]]  won the 2009 [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]]  by connecting the Department of Defense to over 75 retired generals supporting the Iraq War on television and radio networks. The Department of  Defense recruited retired generals to promote the war to the American public. Barstow also discovered undisclosed links between some retired  generals and defense contractors. He reported that "the Bush administration used its control over access of information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse".

==British objections==
The [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and head of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Ken Macdonald|Ken McDonald]], Britain's most senior criminal prosecutor, stated that those responsible for acts of terrorism such as the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] are not "soldiers" in a war, but "inadequates" who should be dealt with by the [[criminal justice system]]. He added that a "culture of legislative restraint" was needed in passing anti-terrorism laws and that a "primary purpose" of the violent attacks was to tempt countries such as Britain to "abandon our values." He stated that in the eyes of the UK criminal justice system, the response to terrorism had to be "[[Proportionality (law)|proportionate]] and grounded in due process and the rule of law":
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[London]] is not a battlefield. Those innocents who were murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, [[narcissistic]] inadequates. They were criminals. They were [[fantasy|fantasists]]. We need to be very clear about this. On the streets of London there is no such thing as a war on terror. The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2563401,00.html There is no war on terror in the UK, says DPP]'', [[The Times]], January 24, 2007, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Stella Rimington]], former head of the British intelligence service [[MI5]] criticised the War on Terror as a "huge overreaction" and had decried the militarization and politicization of U.S. efforts to be the wrong approach to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |title=Response to 9/11 was "hugh overreaction" |journal=[[The Guardian]] |issue=October 18 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/18/stella-rimington-9-11-mi5 |accessdate=2008-10-22 | location=London | date=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Miliband]], former UK foreign secretary, has similarly called the strategy a "mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Berger |title='War on Terror' was a mistake, says Miliband  |work=[[The Guardian]]  |page= |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=15 January 2009|quote=democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating it |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/15/war-on-terror-miliband | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Miliband |title='War on Terror' was wrong |work=[[The Guardian]]  |page= |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=15 January 2009|quote= The call for a "war on terror" was a call to arms, an attempt to build solidarity for a fight against a single shared enemy. But the foundation for solidarity between peoples and nations should be based not on who we are against, but on the idea of who we are and the values we share. Terrorists succeed when they render countries fearful and vindictive, when they sow division and animosity, when they force countries to respond with violence and repression. The best response is to refuse to be cowed.

'''Dalton Prejean''' (December 10, 1959 – May 18, 1990) was an [[Americans|American]] [[murderer]]. He was tried, convicted, and executed by the [[electric chair]] in [[Louisiana]] for the murder of [[Louisiana State Police]] Trooper Donald Cleveland.

The case received international attention because the defendant was a black man convicted by an [[all-white jury]]; had brain damage and tested just above mental retardation; and was age 17 at the time of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Background==
Prejean was the second of four children. When he was two weeks old his parents sent him from their home in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] to live with his aunt and uncle in [[Houston, Texas]]. Dalton was unaware of his true parentage until the age of eleven. When Dalton's father left his mother and moved to Houston, the aunt decided that Dalton had to be told that he was not her child. Around this time, he began creating problems of an unknown nature, and was sent to live with his mother in Lafayette.

Dalton began skipping his school classes following his return to Lafayette. In March 1972, he was committed to the [[Louisiana Training Institute]] for truancy at the insistence of his mother. Released only seven months later, he soon came into conflict with the authorities on charges of burglary, theft, and "false firearms". In March 1974, he was committed to the Lafayette Juvenile Youth Authority, a residential program for delinquents. He ran away from that facility after a month; upon his return his commitment was terminated and he was released on probation to his mother.

In June 1974, Dalton was arrested for the killing of John Doucet, a taxi driver. Dalton admitted the killing and was committed once again to the Louisiana Training Institute. In a later statement about the incident Dalton stated that he and two friends called a cab with the intention of robbing the driver. One of his companions was carrying a gun. The three directed the driver to a quiet part of town and persuaded him to stop while they searched for an address. Dalton insisted on taking the gun from his companion because the other youth appeared to be nervous. Dalton approached the driver, and believing that the driver was reaching for a gun of his own, fired twice and began running. While fleeing he told a passerby to call an ambulance because someone had been shot. Dalton later turned himself in to the police and admitted that he had killed the driver.

A psychiatric evaluation of Dalton was performed in 1974. He was found to be intellectually limited and to have very poor judgment. Dalton was diagnosed as having borderline mental retardation, and it was questionable if he knew the difference between right and wrong. The psychiatrist considered the boy to be "a definite danger to himself and others, and his dream content suggests that it is a matter of accident that the cab driver was killed rather than the boy being killed. He is equally likely to get himself killed in the near future." The psychiatrist  therefore recommended a lengthy confinement, followed by transfer to permanent facilities. The juvenile courts had jurisdiction over the defendant until he was twenty-one. The doctor's recommendation would have served to keep the defendant confined until December 1980.

In 1976, however, another doctor conducted a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant and recommended that he be discharged. He concluded that the defendant's values had changed, but cautioned that "suitable conditions (should be) imposed to be sure he had adequate supervision and is going to live in a fairly stable environment". That doctor also suggested that fairly rigid probation requirements be imposed. On December 10, 1976, Prejean was released to the custody of his aunt in Houston, apparently without any probation requirements. Within seven months, Dalton was once more under arrest for murder.

== Crime ==

At about five o'clock in the morning of July 2, 1977, Prejean, his brother Joseph, Michael George, and Michael Broussard left Roger's Nite Club in [[Lafayette Parish]]. The four had spent the night drinking in various lounges in the vicinity. They left Roger's Nite Club in a 1966 Chevrolet driven by Dalton, with his brother in the front seat and the other two in the back. The car's taillights were not working, and within a few hundred feet of the lounge, Trooper Cleveland, who was on his way to work driving his police vehicle, signaled the Chevrolet to stop. Prejean and his brother attempted to switch places in the front seat because the defendant had been driving without a license. The trooper noticed the switch and ordered the occupants out of the car. He told Michael George and Michael Broussard to get back in and began to search Joseph Prejean. Dalton Prejean, back in the car, stated in reaction to the trooper's pushing Joseph against the car, over Joseph's protest, "I don't like the way he's doing my brother." Dalton then took a .38 caliber revolver from under the car seat, got out of the car and approached the officer with the gun hidden against his leg. As he neared the trooper he fired without warning. Trooper Cleveland was struck by two bullets and was killed. Dalton and his companions fled the scene but were apprehended several hours later.

Dalton was once again given psychological tests during pretrial confinement. On the basis of the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler]] Intelligence Scale, the [[Stanford Binet]] Vocabulary Subtest and the [[Bender-Gestalt]] Test, Dr. William Hawkins determined that he functioned at the dull normal level in the verbal area but in the borderline mental retardation area in the performance area. He had a verbal IQ of 82 and a performance IQ of 72. His full scale IQ is 76, with a full scale mental age of thirteen years and six months.

== Trial and appeals==

Dalton Prejean was charged by grand jury indictment with first degree murder in violation of Louisiana Revised Statute 14:30. The trial was transferred from Lafayette Parish to [[Ouachita Parish]] because of pretrial publicity. After a three-day bifurcated trial beginning on May 1, 1978, a jury of twelve persons found the defendant guilty as charged and unanimously recommended that the death penalty be imposed.

Prejean's defense lawyers appealed citing mitigating factors of an IQ around 71, schizophrenia with two institutionalizations, and his abandonment as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Robert Anthony |date=2000-01-12 |title=Those Who Died for Juvenile Crimes |work=[[APBnews.com]] |url= http://www.apbnews.com/cjsystem/justicenews/2000/01/12/executions0112_01.html  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20020209215953/http://www.apbnews.com/cjsystem/justicenews/2000/01/12/executions0112_01.html |archivedate=2002-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty appeal reached the [[US Supreme Court]] in 1990; in November 1989 it had granted a stay on the eve of his scheduled execution. On April 17, 1990, the Court lifted the stay without comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| last=Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Parliament]] called for commutation of the sentence and a review of the evidence. A representative for [[Amnesty International]] said, "I doubt that in documented recent world history there is an execution [with] such a pile of reasons not to do it.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=1990-05-19
|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Governors of Louisiana|Louisiana Governor]] [[Buddy Roemer]] declined to commute the death sentence to life in prison, rejecting the recommendation of the parole board. "On behalf of 780 state troopers, and thousands of police officers who put their lives on the line every day, the execution will proceed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Execution ==

[[File:AngolaLAPrison.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]], where Prejean died]]

On May 18, 1990, Prejean was executed in the [[electric chair]] at [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] at [[Angola, Louisiana|Angola]].

His final statement was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing is going to be accomplished. I have peace with myself. I'd like to thank all of those who supported me all these years. I'd also like to thank my loved ones for being strong. . . . My son will be a better person for not letting something like this bring down his life. . . . Keep strong, keep pushing, keep praying. They said it wasn't for the revenge, but it's hard for me to see, to understand. I hope they're happy. So I forfeit my life. I give my love to all. God bless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Lane |last2=Foster |first2=Burk |year=2001 |title=Death Watch |chapter=Any Last Words? |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120415072641/http://www.burkfoster.com/AnyLastWords.htm &lt;!-- accessdate=2017-01-14 not relevant for archive --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2409">The '''Edinburgh Handedness Inventory''' is a measurement scale used to assess the dominance of a person's right or [[Left-handedness|left hand]] in everyday activities, sometimes referred to as [[laterality]]. The inventory can be used by an observer assessing the person, or by a person self-reporting hand use. The latter method tends to be less reliable due to a person over-attributing tasks to the dominant hand.

The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was published in 1971 by R.C. Oldfield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldfield |first1=RC |date=March 1971 |title=The assessment and analysis of handedness: The Edinburgh inventory |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=97–113 |pmid=5146491 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used in various scientific studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verdino |first1=M |last2=Dingman |first2=S |title=Two measures of laterality in handedness: the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory and the Purdue Pegboard test of manual dexterity |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=86 |issue=2 |date=April 1998 |pages=476–8 |pmid=9638746 |doi=10.2466/pms.1998.86.2.476}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=S |last1=Knecht |first2=B |last2=Dräger |first3=M |last3=Deppe |first4=L |last4=Bobe |first5=H |last5=Lohmann |first6=A |last6=Flöel |first7=E-B |last7=Ringelstein |first8=H |last8=Henningsen |date=December 2000 |title=Handedness and hemispheric language dominance in healthy humans |journal=Brain |volume=123 |pages=2512–8 |doi=10.1093/brain/123.12.2512 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/123/12/2512 |accessdate=2009-04-08 |pmid=11099452 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as popular literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A left-handed Turn Around the World |last1=Wolman |first1=David |author1-link=David Wolman |isbn=978-0-306-81498-3 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nihon Eisai Co. Ltd. was established in 1941. In 1944, merger with Sakuragaoka Research Laboratory resulted in creation of Eisai Co. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

In 1996, Eisai received [[Approved drug|approval]] from the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (USFDA) for Aricept ([[donepezil]]), a drug discovered in the company's labs and co-marketed with [[Pfizer]]. Three years later in 1999, the company received USFDA approval for Aciphex ([[rabeprazole]]), a drug co-marketed with [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].

In September 2006, the company acquired four oncology products from [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]].

In April 2007, Eisai acquired [[Exton, Pennsylvania]]-based [[Morphotek]], a company developing [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|therapeutic monoclonal antibodies]] for the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and infectious diseases.

In December 2007, Eisai acquired [[MGI Pharma]], a company specializing in oncology, for $3.9 billion USD. This event brought Dacogen ([[decitabine]]), Aloxi ([[palonosetron]]), Hexalen ([[altretamine]]) for ovarian cancer, and the Gliadel Wafer ([[carmustine]]) for brain tumors into the Eisai product portfolio.

In 2009, Eisai received the Corporate Award from the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] (NORD) for the development of [[Banzel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nord-to-honor-rare-disease-pioneers-61818702.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209123421/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nord-to-honor-rare-disease-pioneers-61818702.html |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |title=NORD to Honor Rare Disease Pioneers |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''General Sherman'' incident}}
The '''''General Sherman'' incident''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 제너럴셔먼호 사건) was the destruction of an American armed [[merchant marine]] [[side-wheel steamer]] that visited [[Korea]] in 1866. It was an important catalyst to the end of Korean isolationism in the 19th century. After passing the [[Keupsa Gate]] without permission from the Koreans, the [[United States Merchant Marine|United States merchant ship]] was attacked and fought over for several days before finally being destroyed in [[Pyongyang]].

==Background==
In the mid-19th century, the Great Powers were eager to open up new trade in Asia and began consolidating trade in China and southeast Asia. Japan was also opened up to trade after [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]] sailed into [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga Harbor]] near [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo) on 8 July 1853, and under the threat of force Japan signed the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854. As early as 1832, discussions of opening up Korea to trade were made by the captain of {{USS|Peacock|1813|6}}, [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]], yet in 1844 a draft by the [[United States Congress]] was shelved due to lack of interest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The first contact between the US and Korea was not hostile. Several Americans who were shipwrecked in Korea in 1855&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=413928|title=America's First Encounter With Korea: Shipwrecked Whalers - OhmyNews International|website=english.ohmynews.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1866&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paullin|first=Charles Oscar|date=1910|title=The Opening of Korea by Commodore Shufeldt|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2141171|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=25|issue=3|pages=470–499|doi=10.2307/2141171}}&lt;/ref&gt; were treated well and sent to China for [[repatriation]]. However, the [[Joseon]] dynasty court which ruled Korea was well aware of the displacement of the traditional ruling classes of China as a result of the [[First Opium War|First]] and the [[Second Opium War]]s and maintained a strict policy of [[isolationism]], forbidding any of those they ruled to trade with the outside world to avoid a similar fate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Approach==
Determined to open Korea for trade, ''General Sherman'' (named for [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]) came into Korean waters with goods purchased from the British trading firm Meadows and Co., based in [[Tientsin]] (present day Tianjin), China. Upon arriving, the crew of ''General Sherman'' attempted to meet with Korean officials to begin negotiations for a trade treaty. The steamer reportedly carried a cargo of cotton, tin, and glass, and was heavily armed. Only five of the crew and passengers were non-Asians:the ship's owner, W. B. Preston, an American trader; [[Robert Jermain Thomas]], a [[Protestant]] [[missionary]] acting as a navigator and [[Interpreting|interpreter]]; an Englishman named Hogarth&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Wu8BQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=General+Sherman+lost+off+korea+1866&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN_PeIrIbdAhXJ5YMKHTo5AFs4ChDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=General%20Sherman&amp;f=false "Corea the Hermit Kingdom" p.391. accessed August 24,2018]&lt;/ref&gt;; Captain Page; Chief Mate Wilson. The rest of the crew were 13 Chinese and three Malay sailors;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Wu8BQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=General+Sherman+lost+off+korea+1866&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN_PeIrIbdAhXJ5YMKHTo5AFs4ChDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=General%20Sherman&amp;f=false "Corea the Hermit Kingdom" p.391. reports the Asian crew numbered 19 Chinese and Malayians. accessed August 24,2018]&lt;/ref&gt;; a Chinese [[shroff]] is also listed on board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Wu8BQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=General+Sherman+lost+off+korea+1866&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN_PeIrIbdAhXJ5YMKHTo5AFs4ChDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=General%20Sherman&amp;f=false "Corea the Hermit Kingdom" p.391. accessed August 24,2018]&lt;/ref&gt;. They departed [[Chefoo]] (present day Yantai), China on 9 August and arrived on the coast of Korea on 16 August.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"&gt;"Gojong-sillok" (Vol.3)&lt;/ref&gt; ''General Sherman'', assisted by Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]], entered the [[Taedong River]] on Korea's west coast, sailing towards [[Pyongyang]], and stopped at the Keupsa Gate on the border between [[Pyongan]] and [[Hwanghae]] provinces. Yu Wautai, captain of one of the Chinese junks, had accompanied Rev. Thomas on his previous trip to Korea's Hwanghae province. According to Thomas, Yu had 20 years experience trading with Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Thomas's letter dated 12 January 1866 published in Missionary Magazine July 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

Local officials met Captain Page and communicated well enough to learn the ship was interested in trade. The Koreans refused all trade offers but agreed to provide the crew with food and provisions. Page was told to wait while higher level government officials were consulted. However, ''General Sherman'' went further upriver and anchored west of [[Pyongyang]]. Due to the previous month's rains and the tides, the depth of the Taedong River was unusually high and this allowed the steamer into Pyongyang.

[[Park Gyu-su]] (the governor of Pyongyang) sent his Adjutant-General, Yi Hyon-Ik, to provide the crew with food, but told the captain he should have stayed at the Keupsa Gate. He was again ordered to wait while the Korean ruler was consulted. At the time Korea was ruled by a regent, the [[Heungseon Daewongun]], in the name of his minor son [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. Father Ridel, a French priest who guided [[French campaign against Korea#Preliminaries (10 September – 3 October 1866)|the French invasion party into Korea on 10 September 1866]] after the ''General Sherman'' incident, reported to the Westerners in China that Daewongun, the regent himself, had sent orders that the ship must leave immediately or all aboard would be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=North-China Herald &amp; Supreme Court &amp; Consular Gazette|date=20 March 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
There is dispute over what happened next. Apparently, the ship's crew seized Adjutant-General Yi and his two deputies, who were attempting to pursue a small boat launched from ''General Sherman'' with six men attempting to reach shore.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}} According to Governor Park's report, another government official, Shin Tae-jung, tried to persuade the crew to release Yi Hyon-ik and his men but failed. Instead, ''General Sherman'' moved upstream, firing cannons and eventually anchored at Hwang-gang-jung (House of Yellow River). Governor Park later reported that the ship had fired her guns into the crowd, killing seven and wounding five.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}} Then, five men launched a boat and navigated north of Pyongyang to determine the river's depth. The citizens of Pyongyang gathered on the riverbank, shouting for the release of Yi Hyon-ik. A man in the boat (probably Robert J. Thomas, the only one who spoke Korean) replied they would give the answer if they were allowed inside Pyongyang city.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}} The crowd started throwing stones at the small boat.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}} Korean soldiers shot arrows and guns at the launch, which retreated back to the ship. The Koreans sent a rescue party and managed to free Yi, but his deputies (Yoo Soon-won and Park Chi-young) were killed.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}} The ship eventually turned back and sailed down until she ran aground into [[Yanggakdo|Yang-Gak island]], an island across from Pyongyang.

Fighting continued for four days, after which the Koreans resorted to [[fire ship|fire boats]], filled with wood, [[sulphur]] and [[saltpeter]]. The first two failed to inflict any damage, but the third set ''General Sherman'' afire. Unable to stem the flames, the crew jumped into the water.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}}

According to the Korean Official historical record, ''[[Gojong sillok]]''{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}}, there were two survivors from the initial attack, Robert Thomas and Cho Neung-bong, however, they were beaten to death.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}}

In January 1867 {{USS|Wachusett|1861|6}} (under Captain [[Robert W. Schufeldt]]) attempted to investigate the demise of ''General Sherman,'' but bad weather turned her back. In the spring of 1868 {{USS|Shenandoah|1862|6}} (under Captain [[John C. Febiger]]) reached the Taedong River's mouth and received an official letter acknowledging the death of all crewmen of ''General Sherman''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/sherman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern over this incident is often erroneously cited as a reason why the U.S. Navy conducted the [[United States expedition to Korea|1871 Korea Campaign]], which resulted in the death of about 300 Korean soldiers and three Americans, but official records at the time do not support that.&lt;ref&gt;Empirical Research on the 1871 U.S. Military Action in Korea by Thomas Duvernay 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later Korea was forced to sign a trade treaty with Japan in a separate incident, and in 1882 finally signed a treaty with the United States promising to abide by international norms regarding the treatment of prisoners. These treaties ended several centuries of isolationism.

==Disputed account==
[[File:Plaque Marking the Sinking of the General Sherman (4613639457).jpg|thumb|A plaque marking the sinking of ''General Sherman'' in Pyongyang]]
Some Koreans have claimed that the real purpose of ''General Sherman'' was to seek treasures buried in the royal tombs near [[Pyongyang]]. Onboard the ship was a Chinese inspector of gold and silver, whose presence can only be explained by the fact that ''General Sherman'' was planning for burglary of precious metals from a king's tomb near Pyongyang.&lt;ref&gt;Yonggu Kim, Diplomatic History&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2018}} The ship did not even possess proper records of the items listed for trade, pointing to an ulterior motive. Another supporting factor of this claim is that Robert Jermain Thomas, the ship's interpreter, asked a Korean undercover officer the whereabouts of a white pagoda, which is usually associated with worship.&lt;ref&gt;the Memoir of Park Gyu-Su.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2018}} However, in China, it was believed that the royal coffins in the tombs of Pyongyang, where more than one dynasty of Korea lay buried, were of solid gold, and after the departure of ''General Sherman'' to Korea, it was rumored among Westerners in China that ''General Sherman'''s expedition had something to do with these treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Corea, the Hermit Nation by William Elliot Griffis&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Koreans believed the use of an armed metal-hull gunboat was suspicious in a mission simply for trade. Even among Westerners residing in China, there were concerns regarding ''General Sherman'' being heavily armed. It was well known that two months prior to the ''General Sherman'' incident, an armed vessel captained by [[Ernst Oppert]], a German, had visited Korea and made the same demand for trade. Trade had been refused, but Oppert and his crewmen had been well treated and returned to China safely.&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Ein verschlossenes Land. – Brockhaus, Leipzig 1880&lt;/ref&gt; Oppert returned to Korea in ''Emperor'', which steamed up the Han River near Seoul on the same day that ''General Sherman'' left Chefoo.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;U.S. Diplomatic Correspondence, 1870&lt;/ref&gt; Oppert's request for trade was denied and he returned to China without incident. ''Surprise'', an American ship, had been shipwrecked in Chulsan, in Pyong-an Province, on 24 June 1866. The crew was not harmed and was sent to China by Governor Park Gyu-su, the same official in charge during the ''General Sherman'' incident.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gojong-sillok"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|reason=200 year old, biased source with obsolete information|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;the Study of Park Gyu-su by Kim Myong-ho 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1960s, [[North Korea]]'s government historians began to claim the attack on ''General Sherman'' was planned and led by [[Kim Hyong-jik]],{{citation needed|reason=Kim Hyong-jik was Kim Il-sung's father. Given the fact that he was born in 1894, 28 years after the incident, it's to be expected that there are no historical records confirming his involvement. According to Martin (2006), 'Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader', Kim Il-sung writes in his memoirs that his great-grandfather was involved, and that he's been told he played a major role.|date=June 2018}} a direct ancestor of North Korean president [[Kim Il-sung]]. The claim has no confirmation in historical records but is still being repeated in North Korean publications, including textbooks. In 2006, North Korea issued a postage stamp commemorating the sinking of the merchant vessel.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2006/200609/news09/02.htm#11 New Stamps Issued] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012092409/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2006/200609/news09/02.htm |date=12 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}}, a U.S. Navy intelligence ship captured by North Korea in 1968 (and the only U.S. warship still being held in captivity), was formerly moored at what is believed to be the spot where the incident took place. In late 2012, however, the ship was relocated to the [[Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/sherman.htm USS General Sherman Incident]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2322">[[File:George W. Lindsay.jpg|thumb|George W. Lindsay, New York Congressman]]

'''George Washington Lindsay''' (March 28, 1865 – March 15, 1938) was a [[United States Representative]] from [[NYCongDel|New York]] and son of [[George Henry Lindsay]], who was also a U.S. Representative.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Brooklyn]] on March 28, 1865 to [[George Henry Lindsay]]. He attended the public schools, was deputy [[Coroner of Kings County, New York]] from 1886 to 1892 (during which time his father was coroner) and engaged in the real estate business. He was a member of the [[USDemocrat|Democratic]] State committee and served as leader of the assembly district from 1919 to 1934. He was appointed as a confidential investigator in the State insurance department in 1914 and served until 1919. He was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (Kings Co., 13th D.) in [[143rd New York State Legislature|1920]]. He was deputy [[tenement]]-house commissioner for Brooklyn and [[Queens]] from 1921 to 1923.

Lindsay was elected as a Democrat to the Sixty-eighth and to the five succeeding Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1923 to January 3, 1935. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1934 and resumed the real estate business.

In 1938 he died in Brooklyn; interment was in [[Cemetery of the Evergreens]].

The '''Godolphin Arabian''' ({{circa|1724|lk=yes}}–1753), also known as the '''Godolphin Barb''', was an [[Arabian horse]] or [[Barb horse]] who was one of three [[stallion (horse)|stallion]]s that founded the modern [[Thoroughbred]] (the others were the [[Darley Arabian]] and the [[Byerley Turk]]). He was named after his best-known owner, [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin]].

==Origins==
The Godolphin Arabian was foaled about 1724 in [[Yemen]] and moved several times before reaching England. At some early age he was exported, probably via [[Syria]], to the stud of the [[Bey of Tunis]]. From there he was given to [[Louis XV]] of France in 1730.&lt;ref name="BHA"/&gt; It is believed he was a present from monarch to monarch. Even so, he was not valued by his new French owner, and it is believed he was used as a carthorse.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=84}}

The horse was then imported from [[France]] by Edward Coke and sent to his [[Stud farm|stud]] at [[Longford Hall, Derbyshire]] where he remained until the death of his owner in 1733.&lt;ref name=Milner3&gt;{{Citation|author=Milner, Mordaunt|title=The Godolphin Arabian: The Story of the Matchem Line |publisher=J. A. Allen |location=London |isbn=0-85131-476-7|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1793.htm#i17921 |title=p. 1793 §  17921 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He was bequeathed to Roger Williams, "proprietor of the [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|St. James's Coffee House]]",{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=84}} who inherited Coke's stallions. He was bought by the 2nd Earl of Godolphin,&lt;ref name=Milner3/&gt; and placed at his stud at [[Babraham, Cambridgeshire]], until his death on Christmas Day 1753.

==Appearance==

The Godolphin Arabian was a [[bay (horse)|bay]] colour with some white on the off heel behind. He stood at {{hands|15}} and was distinguished by an unnaturally high crest which is noticeable from portraits of the horse.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}} Most of his immediate offspring were also bay.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=88}}

The veterinary surgeon Osmer described the Godolphin Arabian in the following manner:

{{quotation|There never was a horse… so well entitled to get racers as the Godolphin Arabian…his shoulders were deeper, and lay farther into his back, than those of any horse yet seen. Behind the shoulders, there was but a very small space where the muscles of his loins rose exceedingly high, broad, and expanded, which were inserted into his quarters with greater strength and power than in any horse . . . yet seen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.godolphin.com/about-us/our-heritage/the-godolphin-arabian/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Breed controversy==
[[Image:Godolphin Arabian grave.jpg|right|thumb|The Godolphin Arabian was buried within the stable block at [[Wandlebury]] in 1753 at the age of 29.]]
Controversy exists over the ancestry of this horse; some writers referred to him as a [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], but [[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth]] of the [[Crabbet Arabian Stud]] concludes that it is most widely believed that he was [[Arabian horse|an Arabian]] or had primarily Arabian lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton. ''The Authentic Arabian Horse,'' 3rd ed. George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Barb" is a reference to his believed country of origin, [[Tunisia]], on the [[Barbary Coast]].  Whyte in the 1840 ''History of the British Turf'', refers to the horse as "The Godolphin Barb, or ''as he has been improperly called'', the Godolphin Arabian" (emphasis added){{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=64}} before further clarifying, "he was long considered an Arabian, although his points resembled more those of the highest breed of Barbs."{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=84}} However, portraits showing a horse with a high-carried tail and dished profile, features that differentiate the two types, lead modern experts to believe he was more likely an Arabian.&lt;ref name="TBH1"/&gt; The confusion is understandable, but while the breeds have some characteristics in common and are distantly related, their [[phenotype]]s are quite distinct. There was also an argument raised that he was actually a [[Turkoman horse|Turkomen]], merely called an Arabian in order to raise the [[stud fee]].

The Earl of Godolphin referred to the horse as an Arabian, and he was described as such by the painter [[George Stubbs]]. Lord Godolphin later bought a second stallion in 1750. This one he clearly called a "barb". Both were of a similar bay colour but the Barb had a star. Godolphin later bought a grey Barb, which has also caused some confusion over the years.

Recent DNA studies disprove the theory that he was a Barb, as his descendants' [[Y-DNA]] traces to the same general [[haplotype]] as the [[Darley Arabian]], though to different sub-groups and there are relatively few male-line descendants of the Goldophin Arabian today.&lt;ref name="Wallner 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallner|first1=Barbara|last2=Palmieri|first2=Nicola|last3=Vogl|first3=Claus|last4=Rigler|first4=Doris|last5=Bozlak|first5=Elif|last6=Druml|first6=Thomas|last7=Jagannathan|first7=Vidhya|last8=Leeb|first8=Tosso|last9=Fries|first9=Ruedi|last10=Tetens|first10=Jens|last11=Thaller|first11=Georg|last12=Metzger|first12=Julia|last13=Distl|first13=Ottmar|last14=Lindgren|first14=Gabriella|last15=Rubin|first15=Carl-Johan|last16=Andersson|first16=Leif|last17=Schaefer|first17=Robert|last18=McCue|first18=Molly|last19=Neuditschko|first19=Markus|last20=Rieder|first20=Stefan|last21=Schlötterer|first21=Christian|last22=Brem|first22=Gottfried|title=Y Chromosome Uncovers the Recent Oriental Origin of Modern Stallions|journal=Current Biology|date=July 2017|volume=27|issue=13|pages=2029–2035.e5|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.086}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This group may have been of [[Turkoman horse]] or Arabian origins, as modern horses of both breeds have been linked to this haplotype.&lt;ref name="Wallner 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallner|first1=Barbara|last2=Vogl|first2=Claus|last3=Shukla|first3=Priyank|last4=Burgstaller|first4=Joerg P.|last5=Druml|first5=Thomas|last6=Brem|first6=Gottfried|last7=Ellegren|first7=Hans|title=Identification of Genetic Variation on the Horse Y Chromosome and the Tracing of Male Founder Lineages in Modern Breeds|journal=PLoS ONE|date=3 April 2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e60015|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeding career==
[[File:Lord Godolphin's Lath by James Seymour.jpg|thumb|Lord Godolphin's Lath ([[James Seymour]])]]
The Godolphin Arabian was the [[leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1738, 1745 and 1747.

Originally, this small stallion was considered inferior to the larger European horses of the time and was not meant to be put to stud. Instead he was used as 'teaser', a stallion used to gauge the mare's receptiveness. This changed when Lady Roxana, a [[mare]] brought to the stud specifically to be bred to a stallion called [[Hobgoblin (horse)|Hobgoblin]], rejected her intended mate, and so the Godolphin Arabian was allowed to [[Mating|cover]] her instead.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}}

The result of this mating was [[Lath (horse)|Lath]], the first of his offspring, who went on to win the Queen's Plate nine times out of nine at the [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket races]]. The second colt from this pair was [[Cade (horse)|Cade]], and the third was [[Regulus (horse)|Regulus]].&lt;ref name="SireLine"/&gt; All three were the same gold-touched bay as their sire, with the same small build and high crested [[horse conformation|conformation]]. All were exceptionally fast on the track, and went on to sire many foals themselves. This was the start of the Godolphin Arabian's prowess as a racing stud, and he spent the rest of his days as the Earl of Godolphin's prize stallion, bred to England's finest mares.

The American connection began with the filly [[Selima (horse)|Selima]] (born in 1745 out of Shireborn). She was purchased by [[Benjamin Tasker Jr.]] of the [[Province of Maryland]] in [[Colonial America]], carried to the [[new world]], and raced between 1750 and 1753. She won the biggest prize of the era, 2,500 [[pistole]]s at [[Gloucester, Virginia]] which marked "the beginning of the remarkable racing contests between the rival colonies of Maryland and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]." After this, she became a successful broodmare at the [[Belair Stud]] in [[Collington, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=Deubler&gt;{{Citation | last = Deubler | first = Cindy | author-link =  | title = Belair Museums stand in path of "Progress" | journal = Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred | pages =  22–27 | date = May 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=remly&gt;{{Citation | last = Remly | first = Lynn L. | title = Art Among the Oats: Belair Stable Museum| journal = Equine Images | volume = 2000 | issue = 81 | pages = 5–56 | date = Fall 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major Thoroughbred sire [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]] traces in his sire line to the Darley Arabian, but his dam was a daughter of Regulus and thus also traces to the Godolphin Arabian.&lt;ref name="Pedigree"/&gt;  This pattern continues to be seen today, with the Godolphin Arabian more heavily represented in dam lines and in the "middle" of pedigrees as opposed to direct sire lines.

The Godolphin Arabian died on the Gog Magog hills [[Cambridgeshire]] in 1753, aged around 29.  The horse's grave in the stable block of [[Wandlebury Hill|Wandlebury House]] can be visited.  When he was interred, the occasion was marked with ale and cake.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}}

==Legacy==
Although today the majority of Thoroughbred horses’ sire lines trace to the [[Darley Arabian]], many famous North American horses of the past trace their sire line back to the Godolphin Arabian. These include [[Seabiscuit]], [[Man o' War (horse)|Man o' War]], [[War Admiral]], and [[Silky Sullivan]]. Today, the sire line is primarily supported by descendants of [[Relaunch (horse)|Relaunch]] and his son Cee's Tizzy through dual [[Breeders' Cup Classic]] winner [[Tiznow]].

In Europe, his influence survives mainly through the [[2,000 Guineas]] winner [[Known Fact]], and his son, the champion miler [[Warning (horse)|Warning]]. This line has produced outstanding sprinters such as [[Diktat (horse)|Diktat]] ([[Haydock Sprint Cup]]), [[Avonbridge (horse)|Avonbridge]] and [[Dream Ahead]].  The [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] has not been won by a sire line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian since [[Santa Claus (horse)|Santa Claus]] in 1964 and is nowadays dominated by descendants of the Darley Arabian.&lt;ref name="BHA"/&gt;

==In fiction==
''[[King of the Wind]]'' (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1948) is a fictional biography of the Godolphin Arabian by American author [[Marguerite Henry]]. She wrote many [[Pony book|books about horses for children]], and perhaps is best known for ''[[Misty of Chincoteague]]'' and its sequels. She won the [[Newbery Medal]]&lt;!--only; Misty was a runner-up in 1946--&gt; for ''King of the Wind'', recognizing it as the year's "most distinguished contribution to American literature for children".&lt;ref name=newbery&gt;

Retrieved 23 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel, the Godolphin Arabian was foaled in [[Morocco]] and was called Sham. He came to Europe as a diplomatic gift to King [[Louis XV of France]] but, due to his poor condition on arrival and relatively small size, was given to the cook as a cart horse. He was soon sold to a woodcarter in Paris, where he was treated poorly and then purchased by the Quaker Edward Coke of [[Holkham Hall]], older brother of the 1st [[Earl of Leicester]] 5th Creation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1771.htm#i17703 |title=p. 1771 §  17703 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; then sold to [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|Francis, Earl of Godolphin]], who maintained a stud in [[Suffolk]], near the racing town of [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]].

[[File:Herod Agrippa II.jpg|200px|thumb|Agrippa II from [[Guillaume Rouillé]]'s ''Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum'']]
'''Herod Agrippa II''' ({{Lang-he-n|אגריפס}}) (AD 27/28&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|92}} or 100&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Agrippa, Herod, II.|volume=1|page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;) officially named '''Marcus Julius Agrippa''' and sometimes shortened to '''Agrippa''', was the eighth and last ruler of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] from the [[Herodian dynasty]]. He was the fifth to bear the title of King of the Jews, but in practice he ruled as a Roman [[Client state|client]]. Agrippa was overthrown by his Jewish subjects in 66 and supported the Roman side in the [[First Jewish–Roman War]].

==Early life==
Herod Agrippa II was the son of the first and better-known [[Herod Agrippa]], the brother of [[Berenice (daughter of Herod Agrippa)|Berenice]], [[Mariamne (daughter of Herod Agrippa)|Mariamne]], and [[Drusilla (daughter of Herod Agrippa)|Drusilla]] (second wife of the Roman procurator [[Antonius Felix]]).&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite DGRBM | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | title = Agrippa, Herodes II | volume = 1 | page = 78 | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D11%3Aentry%3Dagrippa-herodes-ii-bio-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was educated at the court of the emperor [[Claudius]], and at the time of his father's death he was only seventeen years old. Claudius therefore kept him at Rome, and sent [[Cuspius Fadus]] as [[Judea (Roman province)|procurator]] of the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judaea]]. While at Rome, he voiced his support for the Jews to Claudius, and against the [[Samaritan]]s and the procurator of [[Iudaea Province]], [[Ventidius Cumanus]], who was lately thought to have been the cause of some disturbances there.&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rajak | first = Tessa | author-link = | contribution = Iulius Agrippa (2) II, Marcus | editor-last = Hornblower | editor-first = Simon | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]] | volume = | pages = | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | place = Oxford | year = 1996 | contribution-url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise in power==
On the death of king [[Herod of Chalcis]] in 48, his small Syrian kingdom of [[Kingdom of Chalcis|Chalcis]] was given to Agrippa, with the right of superintending the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and appointing its high priest, but only as a tetrarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite JE1906| url= http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=913&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Agrippa%20II |title= Agrippa II}}: "In the year 50, without regard to the rights of the heir to the throne, he had himself appointed ... to the kingdom of Chalcis by the emperor, and also to the supervisorship of the Temple at Jerusalem, which carried with it the right of nominating the high priest."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livius.org: Herod Agrippa II http://www.livius.org/articles/person/herod-agrippa-ii/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 53, Agrippa was forced to give up the tetrarchy of Chalcis but in exchange Claudius made him ruler with the title of king over the territories previously governed by [[Philip the Tetrarch|Philip]], namely, [[Batanea]], [[Trachonitis]] and [[Gaulonitis]], and the kingdom of [[Lysanias]] in [[Abila Lysaniou|Abila]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (book 20, chapter 7, verse 1); Josephus, ''[[Wars of the Jews]]'' (book 2, chapter 12, verse 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=Aw00tXpMSpIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Herod+Agrippa+II++title++king++or+Tetrarch&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHufzIgIXPAhWJtRQKHaL3BKYQ6AEINjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Herod%20Agrippa%20II%20%20title%20%20king%20%20or%20Tetrarch&amp;f=false|title=Herod Antipas– Google Knihy |publisher=Books.google.cz |date= January 1, 1980|accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=zSDsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6669&amp;lpg=PT6669&amp;dq=In+the+New+Testament+Paul+calls+him+%22king%22+and+appeals+++Agrippa+II&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YOjNmfb7zK&amp;sig=uQJsK_kmx9kSX35iYH25ALpEplg&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr29iFvJTPAhUhb5oKHVI1D6AQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20New%20Testament%20Paul%20calls%20him%20%22king%22%20and%20appeals%20%20%20Agrippa%20II&amp;f=false|title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia– Google Knihy |publisher=Books.google.cz |date= August 25, 2015|accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrarchy of Chalcis was subsequently in 57 given to his cousin, [[Aristobulus of Chalcis|Aristobulus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Acts|25:13}}; {{bibleverse-nb|Acts|26:2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herod Agrippa celebrated by marrying off his two sisters [[Mariamne (daughter of Herod Agrippa)|Mariamne]] and [[Drusilla (daughter of Herod Agrippa)|Drusilla]]. [[Flavius Josephus]], the Jewish historian, repeats the gossip that Agrippa lived in an incestuous relationship with his sister, [[Berenice (daughter of Herod Agrippa)|Berenice]].

In 55, the Emperor [[Nero]] added to Agrippa's realm the cities of [[Tiberias]] and [[Taricheae]] in [[Galilee]], and [[Livias]] (Iulias), with fourteen villages near it, in [[Perea (region)|Peraea]].

[[File:Nikolai Bodarevsky 001.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''Apostle Paul On Trial'' by [[Nikolai Bodarevsky]], 1875. Agrippa and [[Berenice (daughter of Herod Agrippa I)|Berenice]] are both seated on thrones.]]
It was before Agrippa and his sister Berenice that, according to the [[New Testament]], [[Paul the Apostle]] pleaded his case at [[Caesarea Maritima]], possibly in 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Acts|26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrippa expended large sums in beautifying [[Jerusalem]] and other cities, especially [[Berytus]] (ancient Beirut), a Hellenised city in Phoenicia. His partiality for the latter rendered him unpopular amongst his own subjects, and the capricious manner in which he appointed and deposed the high priests made him disliked by his coreligionists.

==War with Rome==
In the seventeenth year of Agrippa's reign (corresponding with the 12th year of [[Nero]]'s reign), Agrippa tried desperately to avert a war with Rome,&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''De Bello Judaico'' (''Wars of the Jews'') ii.xiv.§ 4&lt;/ref&gt; when he saw his countrymen generally disposed to fight against Rome, because of certain insults and abuses they had had under the Roman procurator, [[Gessius Florus]]. At this time, they had broken-off the cloisters leading from [[Antonia Fortress]] to the [[Temple Mount]] where Roman soldiers were wont to keep guard during the Jewish holidays, and they refused to pay the tribute which was due to Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''De Bello Judaico'' (''Wars of the Jews'') ii.xv.§ 6; ii.xvi.§ 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippa convened the people and urged instead that they tolerate the temporary injustices done to them and submit themselves to Roman [[hegemony]]. At length, Agrippa failed to prevent his subjects from rebelling, whereas, during a certain holiday when the Roman governor of Syria, [[Cestius Gallus]], had passed through Judea to quell the rebellion, he was routed by Jewish forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''De Bello Judaico'' (''Wars of the Jews'') ii.xix.§ 2&lt;/ref&gt; By 66 the citizenry of Jerusalem expelled their king, Agrippa, and his sister, Berenice, from Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt; During the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] of 66–73, he sent 2,000 men, archers and cavalry, to support [[Vespasian]], showing that, although a Jew in religion, he was entirely devoted to the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He accompanied [[Titus]] on some campaigns,&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt; and was wounded at the [[siege of Gamla]]. After the capture of Jerusalem, he went with his sister Berenice to Rome, where he was invested with the dignity of [[praetor]] and rewarded with additional territory.

===Relation with Josephus=== 
Agrippa had a great intimacy with the historian [[Josephus]], having supplied him with information for his history, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Josephus preserved two of the letters he received from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=17 |chap=5 |sec=4 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}}; {{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=19 |chap=9 |sec=2 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} and endnote 1 ; {{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=20 |chap=1 |sec=3 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=20 |chap=5 |sec=2 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=20 |chap=7 |sec=1 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=20 |chap=7 |sec=8 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=20 |chap=8 |sec=4|pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=anti |bookno=11 |chap=9|sec=4|pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Josephus |text=wars |bookno=2 |chap=11 |sec=6 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=wars |bookno=2|NorW=W |chap=12 |sec= |nn=1,16 |pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=wars |bookno=2 |chap=17|sec=1|pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}} ; {{Cite Josephus |text=wars |bookno=4 |chap=1|sec=3|pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Josephus |text=life |bookno=1 |chap=1|sec=54|pace=1 |show-translator=no |show-source=no |abbr=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
According to [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], Agrippa died, childless, at the age of seventy, in the third year of the reign of [[Trajan]], that is, 100,&lt;ref&gt;[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] cod. 33&lt;/ref&gt; but statements of historian Josephus, in addition to the contemporary [[epigraphy]] from his kingdom, cast this date into serious doubt.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The modern scholarly consensus holds that he died before 93/94.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt; He was the last prince from the [[Herodian dynasty|House of Herod]].

'''Horace Holley''' (February 13, 1781 – July 31, 1827) was an [[Americans|American]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister and president of [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

==Early life==
Horace Holley was born February 13, 1781 in [[Salisbury, Connecticut]], the fourth son of Luther and Sarah (Dakin) Holley.&lt;ref name=trask&gt;Trask, "Horace and Mary Austin Holley"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orville L. Holley]] and [[Myron Holley]] were his brothers. Their father was the founder of a successful iron business, and was also a farmer and merchant.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt;

Holley began his early studies before the age of four, and finished them by age ten.&lt;ref name=pmvhs123&gt;''Proceedings'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; For the next few years, he studied at home under the tutelage of his father.&lt;ref name=pmvhs123 /&gt; In 1797, at the age of sixteen, he began preparatory studies at [[Williams College]].&lt;ref name=pmvhs123 /&gt;  He matriculated to [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1799.&lt;ref name=um&gt;Holley, Horace, 1781&amp;ndash;1827&lt;/ref&gt; The son of a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] father and a [[Baptist]] mother, Holley had not been brought up to follow either denomination.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt;&lt;ref name=um /&gt; While attending Yale, he became excited by the religious doctrines of Yale president [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], a staunch opponent of [[deism]].&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; In 1803, earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree and delivered a graduation address entitled "The Slavery of Free Thinking."&lt;ref name=um /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmvhs124&gt;''Proceedings'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry==
Holley determined to pursue the profession of law, studying in the office of Riggs &amp; Radcliffe of [[New York City|New York]], but abandoned this ambition after only a few short months.&lt;ref name=um /&gt; He returned to Yale to study divinity under President Dwight.&lt;ref name=um /&gt; He earned his degree in December 1804, and was licensed to preach by the North Haven Association.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt;&lt;ref name=um /&gt; On January 1, 1805, he married [[Mary Holley|Mary Austin]], a fellow student at Yale who would later publish ''History of Texas''.&lt;ref name=pmvhs124 /&gt; The couple moved to Fairfield, Connecticut where Holley was ordained by the Western Consociation of Fairfield County, Connecticut on September 13, 1805.&lt;ref name=pmvhs124 /&gt; That same year, he began to pastor Greenfield Hill [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] church in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=as&gt;Holley, Mary Phelps Austin, 1784&amp;ndash;1846&lt;/ref&gt;

During his short tenure at Greenfield Hill, Holley's religious views became more liberal, in part due to the influence of his wife, Mary.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; This shift in his religious views, as well as a desire for a more favorable financial situation, led him to resign his post at Greenfield Hill.&lt;ref name=um /&gt; He considered posts in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]]; [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; and [[Albany, New York]], but ultimately declined them all and moved to [[Boston]] in 1808.&lt;ref name=pmvhs125&gt;''Proceedings'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the move, Holley's first child, Harriette Williman Holley, was born.&lt;ref name=as /&gt; Holley preached several trial sermons to large crowds in the [[Old South Church]].&lt;ref name=pmvhs125 /&gt; Previously a [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]], by the time Holley accepted the call to become pastor of [[Hollis Street Church]] in Boston, he had already become a Unitarian.&lt;ref name=loring370&gt;Loring, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; Holley was installed as pastor on March 8, 1809.&lt;ref name=um /&gt;

While in Boston, Holley developed a reputation as a great orator. He became a member of several benevolent societies, including the [[Harvard Board of Overseers]], the Boston School Committee, and the [[Washington Benevolent Societies|Washington Benevolent Society]].&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; The Washington Benevolent Society was affiliated with the [[Federalist Party]], which Holley supported despite his respect for [[Democratic-Republican]] [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name=um /&gt; Holley served as a [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives|chaplain of the House of Representatives]] during the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=loring370 /&gt; When Hollis Street Church was constructing a larger building, the congregation met with the congregation from Boston's First Church, and Holley shared the pulpit with [[William Emerson (minister)|William Emerson]], father of philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1812.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisth American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency of Transylvania University==
Transylvania University had a long-standing affiliation with the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church, but due to low enrollment and graduation numbers, the Kentucky General Assembly reorganized its Board of Trustees, temporarily diminishing the church's influence.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, "Horace Holley"&lt;/ref&gt; The new board members, mostly men of political influence, believed Horace Holley's liberal religious views would foster academic progress and help realize their dreams of making Lexington the "[[Athens]] of the West."&lt;ref name=um /&gt;&lt;ref name=as /&gt;

Holley was first invited to become president of Transylvania University in 1815.&lt;ref name=pmvhs126&gt;''Proceedings'', p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He at first refused, but the Board of Trustees persisted, and again unanimously extended their invitation to Holley in 1817.&lt;ref name=pmvhs126 /&gt; Holley was intrigued by the second offer, and on an 1818 visit to Lexington, was given a tour of the city by native son [[Henry Clay]].&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; Impressed by what he saw, Holley accepted the offer to become president in April.&lt;ref name=pmvhs126 /&gt; He returned to Boston for his wife, daughter, and newborn son, Horace Austin Holley, and in September 1818, the family relocated to Lexington.&lt;ref name=pmvhs126 /&gt; Holley was inaugurated as president on December 19, 1818.&lt;ref name=pmvhs126 /&gt;

Holley's tenure at Transylvania was of immense benefit to the university. A new [[gym]]nasium and [[art gallery]] were opened.&lt;ref name=um /&gt; The library was substantially expanded.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; The school was reorganized as a four-year institution, and a [[medical school]] and [[law school]] were both founded.&lt;ref name=um /&gt; Holley attracted eminently qualified faculty to the university, including [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]].&lt;ref name=pmvhs130&gt;''Proceedings'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; By 1825, the medical school was ranked second in the country, enrollment had quadrupled, and the school had produced 650 graduates.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; (By comparison, in the period from the university's founding in 1799 to the beginning of Holley's tenure in 1818, it had produced only 60 graduates.)&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

In 1825 Holley welcomed [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], who was doing a [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|triumphal tour]] of the United States and to whom he dedicated one of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Horace Holley, ''The order of exercises in the chapel of Transylvania University : […] in honour of the arrival of General Lafayette, the hero, patriot and philanthropist, a defender of American independence, a companion of Washington, and a devoted friend of liberty and equal laws in Europe and America'', Lexington (Ky.), 1825, 16 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions between Holley and the school's conservative [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] leadership did not subside, however.&lt;ref name=um /&gt; His support of the Federalist Party also cost him a great deal of support in the state.&lt;ref name=um /&gt; Allegations surfaced regarding everything from fiscal mismanagement to the Holleys' extravagant social life.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; Public funding for the university dwindled, and in 1826, Holley's salary was cut.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt;&lt;ref name=um /&gt; He further lost the support of Governor [[Joseph Desha]], who disliked the university for what he perceived as its elitist character and for its association with Henry Clay.&lt;ref name=wright436&gt;Wright, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; Overwhelmed by the opposition, Holley offered his resignation in January 1826, but the Board of Trustees refused to accept it.&lt;ref name=pmvhs132&gt;''Proceedings'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned again in 1827; this time it was accepted.&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

==Later life and death==
Following his resignation, Holley moved to [[New Orleans]], where he hoped to take a group of young men on a tour of [[Europe]] as part of a "traveling academy."&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; When the parents of the young men refused, Holley was invited to establish a new educational institution in New Orleans.&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; Supporters promised Holley full fiscal and administrative control over the college.&lt;ref name=um /&gt;

Holley agreed to open the college, but first took leave to Boston to escape the hot climate and build up his health.&lt;ref name=um /&gt;&lt;ref name=smith /&gt; While on this excursion, Holley and his wife both contracted [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref name=trask /&gt; Ms. Holley was so delirious with fever, she was not aware of her husband's death on July 31, 1827.&lt;ref name=as /&gt; Holley was [[burial at sea|buried at sea]] near the [[Dry Tortugas]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=wright437&gt;Wright, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vitruvian man.jpg|thumbnail|Logo of the HGP – the [[Vitruvian Man]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]

The ''' Human Genome Project''' ('''HGP''') was an international [[scientific research]] project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide [[base pairs]] that make up human [[DNA]], and of identifying and mapping all of the [[gene]]s of the [[human genome]] from both a physical and  a functional standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Robert Krulwich]] |date=2003 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/genome/ |title=Cracking the Code of Life |medium=Television Show |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://battelle.org/docs/default-document-library/economic_impact_of_the_human_genome_project.pdf|title= Economic Impact of the Human Genome Project – Battelle| accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete on April 14, 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/11006943/human-genome-project-completion-frequently-asked-questions/|title=Human Genome Project Completion: Frequently Asked Questions|author=|date=|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Funding came from the US government through the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside government by the [[Celera Corporation]], or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Spain and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/11006943| title=Human Genome Project Completion: Frequently Asked Questions|work=genome.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Genome Project originally aimed to map the [[nucleotides]] contained in a human [[haploid]] [[reference genome]] (more than three billion).  The "genome" of any given individual is unique; mapping the "human genome" involved sequencing a small number of individuals and then assembling these together to get a complete sequence for each chromosome. Therefore, the finished human genome is a mosaic, not representing any one individual.

== Human Genome Project ==

=== History ===
[[File:Dna-split.png|right]]
The Human Genome Project was a 15-year-long, publicly funded project initiated in 1990 with the objective of determining the DNA sequence of the entire euchromatic human genome within 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Genome Project: Sequencing the Human Genome {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-sequencing-technologies-key-to-the-human-828|website = www.nature.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1985, Robert Sinsheimer organized a workshop to discuss sequencing the human genome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinsheimer|first1=Robert|title=The Santa Cruz Workshop, May 1985|journal=Genomics|date=1989|volume=5|issue=4|pages=954–956|doi=10.1016/0888-7543(89)90142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for a number of reasons the NIH was uninterested in pursuing the proposal. The following March, the Santa Fe Workshop was organized by [[Charles DeLisi]] and David Smith of the Department of Energy's Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeLisi|first1=Charles|title=Conferences That Changed the World|journal=Nature|date=October 2008|pages=876–877|doi=10.1038/455876a|bibcode=2008Natur.455..876D|volume=455|issue=7215|pmid=18923499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time [[Renato Dulbecco]] proposed whole genome sequencing in an essay in Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dulbecco|first1=Renato|title=Turning Point in Cancer Research, Sequencing the Human Genome|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=231|pages=1055–1056|doi=10.1126/science.3945817|pmid=3945817|issue=4742|bibcode=1986Sci...231.1055D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Watson followed two months later with a workshop held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The fact that the Santa Fe workshop was motivated and supported by a Federal Agency opened a path, albeit a difficult and tortuous one,&lt;ref name="Cook-Deegan"&gt;Gene Wars, Op.Cit. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; for converting the idea into a public policy in the [[United States]].  In a memo to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Research (Alvin Trivelpiece), Charles DeLisi, who was then Director of the OHER, outlined a broad plan for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/556935/discover?filtertype=author&amp;filter_relational_operator=equals&amp;filter=DeLisi%2C+Charles|title=Search|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This started a long and complex chain of events which led to approved reprogramming of funds that enabled the OHER to launch the Project in 1986, and to recommend the first line item for the HGP, which was in President Reagan's 1988 budget submission,&lt;ref name="Cook-Deegan" /&gt; and ultimately approved by the Congress.  Of particular importance in Congressional approval was the advocacy of Senator [[Peter Domenici]], whom DeLisi had befriended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/new/html/Mon_Jan_8_141714_2001.html|title=President Clinton Awards the Presidential Citizens Medals|work=nara.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenici chaired the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as the Budget Committee, both of which were key in the DOE budget process.  Congress added a comparable amount to the NIH budget, thereby beginning official funding by both agencies.

[[Alvin Trivelpiece]] sought and obtained the approval of DeLisi's proposal by  Deputy Secretary [[William Flynn Martin]]. This chart&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Trivelpiece/HGP%20Presenation.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; was used in the spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of [[John S. Herrington|Secretary Herrington]]. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million in the [[Reagan Administration]]’s 1987 budget submission to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi|first=Charles|title=Meetings that changed the world: Santa Fe 1986: Human genome baby-steps|journal=Nature|date=2008|volume=455|issue=7215|pages=876–877|bibcode = 2008Natur.455..876D |doi = 10.1038/455876a|pmid=18923499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It subsequently passed both Houses. The Project was planned for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi|first=Charles|title=The Human Genome Project|journal=American Scientist|date=1988|volume=76|issue=5|page=488|bibcode = 1988AmSci..76..488D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate technologies were already being considered for the proposed undertaking at least as early as 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi |first=Charles |date=2001 |url=http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v11n3/05delisi.html |title=Genomes: 15 Years Later A Perspective by Charles Deli, HEP Pioneer |journal=Human Genome News |volume=11 |pages=3–4 |accessdate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904183906/http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v11n3/05delisi.html |archivedate=September 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the two major funding agencies, DOE and [[NIH]], developed a memorandum of understanding in order to coordinate plans and set the clock for the initiation of the Project to 1990.&lt;ref name=hgmis&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml |title=About the Human Genome Project: What is the Human Genome Project |publisher=The Human Genome Management Information System (HGMIS) |date= 2011-07-18 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, David Galas was Director of the renamed “Office of Biological and Environmental Research” in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and [[James Watson]] headed the NIH Genome Program. In 1993, Aristides Patrinos succeeded Galas and [[Francis Collins]] succeeded [[James Watson]], assuming the role of overall Project Head as Director of the [[United States National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) National Center for Human Genome Research (which would later become the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]]). A working draft of the genome was announced in 2000 and the papers describing it were published in February 2001. A more complete draft was published in 2003, and genome "finishing" work continued for more than a decade.

The $3-billion project was formally founded in 1990 by the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, and was expected to take 15 years.&lt;ref name=human&gt;{{cite web|author = Human Genome Information Archive|url= http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml|title= About the Human Genome Project| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy &amp; Human Genome Project program | accessdate=1  August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the United States, the international [[consortium]] comprised [[geneticist]]s in the United Kingdom, France, Australia, China and myriad other spontaneous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Collins F|author2= Galas D |url=http://www.genome.gov/10001476 |title=A New Five-Year Plan for the United States: Human Genome Program|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute |date=1993-10-01 | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the inflation, the project roughly costed $5 billion.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07323-y|title=Life on Earth to have its DNA analysed in the name of conservation|date=6 November 2018|publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=3 December 2018|volume=563|pages=155–156|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-07323-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewin|first1=Harris A.|last2=et al.|title=Earth BioGenome Project: Sequencing life for the future of life|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4325|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|date=2018|volume=115|pages=4325–4333|doi=10.1073/pnas.1720115115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to widespread international cooperation and advances in the field of [[genomics]] (especially in [[sequence analysis]]), as well as major advances in computing technology, a 'rough draft' of the genome was finished in 2000 (announced jointly by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] on June 26, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/clinton1.shtml |title=White House Press Release |accessdate=2006-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first available rough draft [[Genome Project|assembly]] of the genome was completed by the Genome Bioinformatics Group at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], primarily led by then graduate student [[Jim Kent]]. Ongoing [[sequencing]] led to the announcement of the essentially complete [[genome]] on April 14, 2003, two years earlier than planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2940601.stm |title=Human genome finally complete |accessdate=2006-07-22 |date=2003-04-14 |work=BBC News |first=Ivan |last=Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/science/the-human-genome-project-then-and-now.html|title=Human Genome, Then and Now|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=15 April 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, another milestone was passed on the way to completion of the project, when the sequence of the [[Chromosome 1 (human)|last chromosome]] was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uklatest/story/0,,-5829253,00.html |title=Guardian Unlimited &amp;#124;UK Latest &amp;#124; Human Genome Project finalised |accessdate=2006-07-22 |work=The Guardian |location=London }} {{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State of completion ===
The project was not able to sequence all the DNA found in [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|human cells]].  It sequenced only ''[[Euchromatin|euchromatic]]'' regions of the genome, which make up 92% of the human genome.  The other regions, called ''[[heterochromatin|heterochromatic]]'', are found in [[centromeres]] and [[telomeres]], and were not sequenced under the project.&lt;ref name=Genoscope&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Genome Project FAQ|url=http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/The-Human-Genome-Project.html?artsuite=1#FAQ2|website=Genoscope|publisher=Centre National de Séquençage|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Genome Project was declared complete in April 2003. An initial rough draft of the human genome was available in June 2000 and by February 2001 a working draft had been completed and published followed by the final sequencing mapping of the human genome on April 14, 2003. Although this was reported to cover 99% of the euchromatic human genome with 99.99% accuracy, a major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published on May 27, 2004 indicating over 92% of sampling exceeded 99.99% accuracy which was within the intended goal.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2009, the [[Genome Reference Consortium]] (GRC) released a more accurate version of the human genome, but that still left more than 300 gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolgin|first=Elie|date=2009-12-17|title=Human genomics: The genome finishers|journal=Nature|volume=462|issue=7275|pages=843–845|doi=10.1038/462843a|issn=1476-4687|pmid=20016572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the GRC still indicated 514 gaps, most of which are annotated as "stalled" or "under investigation/review", so it seems they will not be resolved any time soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/human/issues?filters=type:gap&amp;asm=GRCh37.p13|title=Human Genome Issues|last=|first=|date=|website=Genome Reference Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and proposed benefits ==
The sequencing of the human genome holds benefits for many fields, from [[molecular medicine]] to [[human evolution]]. The Human Genome Project, through its sequencing of the DNA, can help us understand diseases including: [[genotype|genotyping]] of specific [[virus]]es to direct appropriate treatment; identification of [[mutation]]s linked to different forms of [[cancer]]; the design of medication and more accurate prediction of their effects; advancement in [[forensics|forensic]] applied sciences;  [[biofuel]]s and other energy applications; [[agriculture]], [[animal husbandry]], [[bioprocessing]]; [[risk assessment]];  [[bioarcheology]], [[anthropology]] and [[evolution]]. Another proposed benefit is the commercial development of [[genomics]] research related to DNA based products, a multibillion-dollar industry.

The sequence of the DNA is stored in [[database]]s available to anyone on the [[Internet]]. The U.S. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (and sister organizations in Europe and Japan) house the gene sequence in a database known as [[GenBank]], along with sequences of known and hypothetical genes and proteins. Other organizations, such as the [[UCSC Genome Browser]] at the University of California, Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://genome.ucsc.edu|title= An Overview of the Human Genome Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ensembl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensembl.org|title=Ensembl Genome Browser|work=ensembl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; present additional data and annotation and powerful tools for visualizing and searching it. [[Computer program]]s have been developed to analyze the data, because the data itself is difficult to interpret without such programs.  Generally speaking, advances in genome sequencing technology have followed Moore’s Law, a concept from computer science which states that integrated circuits can increase in complexity at an exponential rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mardis|first1=E.|title=The impact of next-generation sequencing technology on genetics|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=133–41|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2007.12.007|pmid=18262675  |pmc=2680276}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the speeds at which whole genomes can be sequenced can increase at a similar rate, as was seen during the development of the above-mentioned Human Genome Project.

== Techniques and analysis ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The process of identifying the boundaries between genes and other features in a raw DNA sequence is called [[genome annotation]] and is in the domain of [[bioinformatics]]. While expert biologists make the best annotators, their work proceeds slowly, and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the high-throughput demands of genome sequencing projects. Beginning in 2008, a new technology known as [[RNA-seq]] was introduced that allowed scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells. This replaced previous methods of annotation, which relied on inherent properties of the DNA sequence, with direct measurement, which was much more accurate. Today, annotation of the human genome and other genomes relies primarily on deep sequencing of the transcripts in every human tissue using RNA-seq. These experiments have revealed that over 90% of genes contain at least one and usually several alternative splice variants, in which the [[exons]] are combined in different ways to produce 2 or more gene products from the same locus.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The genome published by the HGP does not represent the sequence of every individual's genome. It is the combined mosaic of a small number of anonymous donors, all of European origin. The HGP genome is a scaffold for future work in identifying differences among individuals. Subsequent projects sequenced the genomes of multiple distinct ethnic groups, though as of today there is still only one "reference genome."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Findings ===
Key findings of the draft (2001) and complete (2004) genome sequences include:

=== Accomplishment ===

[[Image:Wellcome genome bookcase.png|thumb|The first printout of the human genome to be presented as a series of books, displayed at the [[Wellcome Collection]], London]]

The Human Genome Project was started in 1990 with the goal of sequencing and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a [[megaproject]] because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion [[base pair]]s. With the sequence in hand, the next step was to identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.&lt;ref name=hgmis/&gt;&lt;ref name=wellcome&gt;{{cite web|author= Wellcome Sanger Institute|url= http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/history/hgp/|title= The Human Genome Project: a new reality|publisher= Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Genome Research Limited|accessdate= 1  August 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801231124/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/history/hgp/|archivedate= 2013-08-01|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was far too expensive at that time to think of sequencing patients’ whole genomes. So the National Institutes of Health embraced the idea for a "shortcut", which was to look just at sites on the genome where many people have a variant DNA unit. The theory behind the shortcut was that, since the major diseases are common, so too would be the genetic variants that caused them. [[Natural selection]] keeps the human genome free of variants that damage health before children are grown, the theory held, but fails against variants that strike later in life, allowing them to become quite common (In 2002 the National Institutes of Health started a $138 million project called the [[HapMap]] to catalog the common variants in European, East Asian and African genomes).&lt;ref name=naid&gt;{{cite journal|author =Naidoo N|author2 =Pawitan Y|author3 =Soong R|author4 =Cooper DN|author5 = Ku CS |title=Human genetics and genomics a decade after the release of the draft sequence of the human genome | journal=Hum Genomics |volume= 5|issue=6 |pages= 577–622| date=2011 |pmid=22155605 |pmc=3525251 |doi=10.1186/1479-7364-5-6-577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genome was broken into smaller pieces; approximately 150,000 [[base pair]]s in length.&lt;ref name=wellcome/&gt; These pieces were then ligated into a type of vector known as "[[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s", or BACs, which are derived from bacterial chromosomes which have been genetically engineered. The vectors containing the genes can be inserted into bacteria where they are copied by the bacterial [[DNA replication]] machinery. Each of these pieces was then sequenced separately as a small [[Shotgun sequencing|"shotgun"]] project and then assembled. The larger, 150,000 base pairs go together to create chromosomes. This is known as the [[Shotgun sequencing#Hierarchical Shotgun sequencing|"hierarchical shotgun"]] approach, because the genome is first broken into relatively large chunks, which are then mapped to chromosomes before being selected for sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~edy/genome/celera.html|title=Celera: A Unique Approach to Genome Sequencing | work= ocf.berkeley.edu|date=2006|publisher=Biocomputing | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Davidson College |url= http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/shotgun.html|title=

Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and a UK charity organization, the [[Wellcome Trust]], as well as numerous other groups from around the world. The funding supported a number of large sequencing centers including those at [[Whitehead Institute]], the [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/who-we-are/sanger-institute Wellcome Sanger Institute] (then called The Sanger Centre) based at the [[Wellcome Genome Campus]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and [[Baylor College of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=human/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Human Genome Project Information Archive|url=http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/research/centers.shtml |title= U.S. &amp; International HGP Research Sites| date=2013|publisher= U.S. Department of Energy &amp; Human Genome Project | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) served as an important channel for the involvement of developing countries in the Human Genome Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vizzini|first1=Casimiro|title=The Human Variome Project: Global Coordination in Data Sharing|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=March 19, 2015|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2015/human-variome-project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public versus private approaches ==
In 1998, a similar, privately funded quest was launched by the American researcher [[Craig Venter]], and his firm Celera Genomics. Venter was a scientist at the NIH during the early 1990s when the project was initiated. The $300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the roughly $3 billion [[research funding|publicly funded project]]. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The sequence of the human genome|journal = Science|date = 2001-02-16|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 11181995|pages = 1304–1351|volume = 291|issue = 5507|doi = 10.1126/science.1058040|first = J.

O.|last7 = Smith|first8 = M.|last8 = Yandell|first9 = C. A.|last9 = Evans|bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celera used a technique called [[whole genome shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|whole genome shotgun sequencing]], employing [[Shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|pairwise end sequencing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1995 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/088875439580219C |title=Pairwise end sequencing: a unified approach to genomic mapping and sequencing |journal=Genomics |volume=26 |pages=345–353 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(95)80219-C |pmid=7601461 |author=Roach JC |author2=Boysen C |author3=Wang K|author4=Hood L |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been used to sequence bacterial genomes of up to six million base pairs in length, but not for anything nearly as large as the three billion base pair human genome.

Celera initially announced that it would seek patent protection on "only 200–300" genes, but later amended this to seeking "intellectual property protection" on "fully-characterized important structures" amounting to 100–300 targets. The firm eventually filed preliminary ("place-holder") patent applications on 6,500 whole or partial genes.
Celera also promised to publish their findings in accordance with the terms of the 1996 "[[Bermuda Principles|Bermuda Statement]]", by releasing new data annually (the HGP released its new data daily), although, unlike the publicly funded project, they would not permit free redistribution or scientific use of the data. The publicly funded competitors were compelled to release the first draft of the human genome before Celera for this reason. On July 7, 2000, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group released a first working draft on the web. The scientific community downloaded about 500 GB of information from the UCSC genome server in the first 24 hours of free and unrestricted access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering|url=http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/research/hgp_race |title=The Human Genome Project Race |publisher=Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] announced that the [[Genome|genome sequence]] could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The statement sent Celera's stock plummeting and dragged down the [[biotechnology]]-heavy [[Nasdaq]]. The biotechnology sector lost about $50 billion in [[market capitalization]] in two days.

Although the working draft was announced in June 2000, it was not until February 2001 that Celera and the HGP scientists published details of their drafts. Special issues of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (which published the publicly funded project's [[Academic publishing|scientific paper]])&lt;ref name="IHGSC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium |title=Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome |journal=Nature |volume=409 |pages=860–921 |date=2001 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/pdf/409860a0.pdf |doi=10.1038/35057062 |format=PDF |pmid=11237011 |issue=6822|bibcode=2001Natur.409..860L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (which published Celera's paper&lt;ref name="Venter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venter, JC |title=The sequence of the human genome |journal=Science |volume=291 |pages=1304–1351 |date=2001 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/291/5507/1304.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1058040 |pmid=11181995 |format=PDF |issue=5507 |display-authors=1 |last2=Adams |first2=MD |last3=Myers |first3=EW |last4=Li |first4=PW |last5=Mural |first5=RJ |last6=Sutton |first6=GG |last7=Smith |first7=HO |last8=Yandell |first8=M |last9=Evans |first9=CA|last10=Holt |first10=Robert A. |last11=Gocayne |first11=Jeannine D. |last12=Amanatides |first12=Peter |last13=Ballew |first13=Richard M. |last14=Huson |first14=Daniel H. |last15=Wortman |first15=Jennifer Russo |last16=Zhang |first16=Qing |last17=Kodira |first17=Chinnappa D. |last18=Zheng |first18=Xiangqun H. |last19=Chen |first19=Lin |last20=Skupski |first20=Marian |last21=Subramanian |first21=Gangadharan |last22=Thomas |first22=Paul D. |last23=Zhang |first23=Jinghui |last24=Gabor Miklos |first24=George L. |last25=Nelson |first25=Catherine |last26=Broder |first26=Samuel |last27=Clark |first27=Andrew G. |last28=Nadeau |first28=Joe |last29=McKusick |first29=Victor A. |last30=Zinder |first30=Norton |bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V }}&lt;/ref&gt;) described the methods used to produce the draft sequence and offered analysis of the sequence.  These drafts covered about 83% of the genome (90% of the euchromatic regions with 150,000 gaps and the order and orientation of many segments not yet established).  In February 2001, at the time of the joint publications, [[News release|press releases]] announced that the project had been completed by both groups.  Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to approximately 92% of the sequence currently.

== Genome donors ==
In the IHGSC international [[Public sector|public-sector]] HGP, researchers collected blood (female) or sperm (male) samples from a large number of donors. Only a few of many collected samples were processed as DNA resources.  Thus the donor identities were protected so neither donors nor scientists could know whose DNA was sequenced. DNA clones from many different [[DNA library|libraries]] were used in the overall project, with most of those libraries being created by [[Pieter J. de Jong's]].  Much of the sequence (&gt;70%) of the [[reference genome]] produced by the public HGP came from a single anonymous male donor from [[Buffalo, New York]] ([[code name]] RP11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Osoegawa | first = Kazutoyo | date = 2001 | url = http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/483 | title =  A Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Library for Sequencing the Complete Human Genome  | journal=Genome Research | volume = 11 | pages = 483–96 | doi =  10.1101/gr.169601 | pmid =  11230172 | last2 = Mammoser | first2 = AG | last3 = Wu | first3 = C | last4 = Frengen | first4 = E | last5 = Zeng | first5 = C | last6 = Catanese | first6 = JJ | last7 = De Jong | first7 = PJ | issue = 3 | pmc = 311044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tuzun | first = E | date = 2005 | url = http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v37/n7/full/ng1562.html | title =  Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome  | journal=Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | pages = 727–737 | doi =  10.1038/ng1562 | pmid =  15895083 | issue=7 | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Sharp | first2 = Andrew J | last3 = Bailey | first3 = Jeffrey A | last4 = Kaul | first4 = Rajinder | last5 = Morrison | first5 = V Anne | last6 = Pertz | first6 = Lisa M | last7 = Haugen | first7 = Eric | last8 = Hayden | first8 = Hillary | last9 = Albertson | first9 = Donna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HGP scientists used [[white blood cell]]s from the blood of two male and two female donors (randomly selected from 20 of each) – each donor yielding a separate DNA library.  One of these libraries (RP11) was used considerably more than others, due to quality considerations.  One minor technical issue is that male samples contain just over half as much DNA from the sex chromosomes (one [[X chromosome]] and one [[Y chromosome]]) compared to female samples (which contain two [[X chromosome]]s). The other 22 chromosomes (the autosomes) are the same for both sexes.

Although the main sequencing phase of the HGP has been completed, studies of DNA variation continued in the [[International HapMap Project]], whose goal was to identify patterns of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) groups (called [[haplotype]]s, or “haps”). The DNA samples for the HapMap came from a total of 270 individuals: [[Yoruba people]] in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]]; [[Japanese people]] in [[Tokyo]]; [[Han Chinese]] in [[Beijing]]; and the French [[Center for the Study of Human Polymorphisms|Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain]] (CEPH) resource, which consisted of residents of the United States having ancestry from Western and [[Northern Europe]].

In the Celera Genomics [[Private sector|private-sector]] project, DNA from five different individuals were used for sequencing.  The lead scientist of Celera Genomics at that time, Craig Venter, later acknowledged (in a public letter to the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') that his DNA was one of 21 samples in the pool, five of which were selected for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=297|page=1237|title=Not wicked, perhaps, but tacky|author=Kennedy D|pmid=12193755|doi=10.1126/science.297.5585.1237|issue=5585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2003|volume=299|pages=1183–4|title=A Part of the Human Genome Sequence|author=Venter D|pmid=12595674|doi=10.1126/science.299.5610.1183|issue=5610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a team led by [[Jonathan Rothberg]] published [[James Watson]]'s entire genome, unveiling the six-billion-nucleotide genome of a single individual for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = James Watson's genome sequenced at high speed|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080416/full/452788b.html|journal = Nature News|date = 2008-04-16|pages = 788|volume = 452|issue = 7189|doi = 10.1038/452788b|pmid = 18431822|first = Meredith|last = Wadman|bibcode = 2008Natur.452R....W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The work on interpretation and analysis of genome data is still in its initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]]. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as [[Myriad Genetics]], started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including [[breast cancer]], [[blood clotting|hemostasis disorders]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[liver]] diseases and many others. Also, the [[etiology (medicine)|etiologies]] for [[cancer]]s, [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.&lt;ref name=naid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Gonzaga-Jauregui C|author2 = Lupski JR|author3 = Gibbs RA|title=Human genome sequencing in health and disease | journal= Annu Rev Med|volume= 63|issue=1 |pages=35–61 | date=2012 |pmid= 22248320|doi=10.1146/annurev-med-051010-162644 |pmc=3656720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many tangible benefits for biologists. For example, a researcher investigating a certain form of [[cancer]] may have narrowed down their search to a particular gene. By visiting the human genome database on the [[World Wide Web]], this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene, including (potentially) the three-dimensional structure of its product, its function(s), its evolutionary relationships to other human genes, or to genes in mice or yeast or fruit flies, possible detrimental mutations, interactions with other genes, body tissues in which this gene is activated, and diseases associated with this gene or other datatypes. Further, deeper understanding of the disease processes at the level of molecular biology may determine new therapeutic procedures. Given the established importance of DNA in molecular biology and its central role in determining the fundamental operation of [[Biological process|cellular processes]], it is likely that expanded knowledge in this area will facilitate medical advances in numerous areas of clinical interest that may not have been possible without them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Snyder M, Du J|author2 =Gerstein M |title=Personal genome sequencing: current approaches and challenges | journal=Genes Dev |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=423–431 | date=2012 |pmid=20194435 |doi=10.1101/gad.1864110 |pmc=2827837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues in the study of [[evolution]]. In many cases, evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of [[molecular biology]]; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the [[ribosome]] and [[organelle]]s, the development of [[embryo]]s with body plans, the [[vertebrate]] [[immune system]]) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives (the [[primate]]s, and indeed the other [[mammal]]s) are expected to be illuminated by the data in this project.&lt;ref name=naid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Lander ES |title= Initial impact of the sequencing of the human genome| journal=Nature |volume= 470|issue= 7333|pages=187–197 | date=2011 |pmid=21307931 |doi=10.1038/nature09792|bibcode = 2011Natur.470..187L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project inspired and paved the way for genomic work in other fields, such as agriculture. For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the world’s most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=J|last2=Sun|first2=E|last3=Nevo|first3=D|title=Domestication Evolution, Genetics And Genomics In Wheat|journal=Molecular Breeding|date=2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=281–301|doi=10.1007/s11032-011-9608-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, and how does this play out in evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.

== Ethical, legal and social issues ==
At the onset of the Human Genome Project several ethical, legal, and social concerns were raised in regards to how increased knowledge of the human genome could be used to discriminate against people.  One of the main concerns of most individuals was the fear that both employers and health insurance companies would refuse to hire individuals or refuse to provide insurance to people because of a health concern indicated by someone's genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greely|first=Henry|title=The Code of Codes: Scientific and Social Issues in the Human Genome Project|date=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-13646-5|pages=264–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996 the United States passed the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) which protects against the unauthorized and non-consensual release of individually identifiable health information to any entity not actively engaged in the provision of healthcare services to a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = US Department of Health and Human Services|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/index.html|title=Understanding Health Information Privacy|date=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with identifying all of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes in the human genome, the Human Genome Project also sought to address the ethical, legal, and social issues that were created by the onset of the project. For that the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) program was founded in 1990. Five percent of the annual budget was allocated to address the ELSI arising from the project.&lt;ref name=human/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Genetics Home Reference|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/hgp/elsi |title= What were some of the ethical, legal, and social implications addressed by the Human Genome Project?| work=ghr.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013|accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This budget started at approximately $1.57 million in the year 1990, but increased to approximately $18 million in the year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10002329/elsi-research-program-fact-sheet/|title=ELSI Research Program Fact Sheet - National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the project may offer significant benefits to medicine and scientific research, some authors have emphasized the need to address the potential social consequences of mapping the human genome. "Molecularising disease and their possible cure will have a profound impact on what patients expect from medical help and the new generation of doctors' perception of illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinberger|first=H.J.|title=Living and Working with the New Medical Technologies|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4946">The '''"Lady with the Ring"''' is a story about [[premature burial]] from [[European folklore]]. Versions of the story were popular throughout Europe in the 14th through the 19th centuries.

== Story ==

=== Central features ===
The central feature of the story is that a woman is buried or entombed while wearing a valuable ring. Shortly after the burial, a [[grave robber]] (often a corrupt [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]) disinters the body with the intent of stealing the ring. The robber is unable to slide the ring off the woman's finger, so he prepares to cut off the finger with a knife. However, upon making the initial incision, the woman awakes, surprising the grave robber. The woman had not been dead at all, but had been the victim of [[premature burial]].

=== Variations ===
The following details are included in some versions of the story:
* the grave robber instantly dies of fright after the woman awakes;
* the woman walks a considerable distance from her burial spot to her home;
* the woman's husband or other people at her house think that she is a ghost and refuse her entry into the house;
* the person refusing entry to the woman tells the woman that it would be as impossible for her to return from the dead as it would be for horses to leave their stable and run up the stairs in the house; immediately after making this comparison, horses are heard and seen with their heads emerging from a high window of the house; when this occurs, the person refusing entry realises that the woman is not a ghost;
* the woman lives for many more years and gives birth to numerous children.

== Popularity ==
Versions of the story have been found to exist in almost every European country, including [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Italy]], [[England]], [[Scotland]], and [[Ireland]]. The story is also told about a former resident of [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].

== Specific examples ==
[[File:Köln richmodisturm.jpg|thumb|Richmodis tower, Cologne]]

=== Germany ===
The most famous version of the story is from [[Cologne]], where the woman has been popularly identified as Richmodis von Aducht, the wife of Menginus von Aducht. The incident was said to have occurred during [[Black Death]] year of 1357, though other versions claimed that it occurred in the 16th century. In Richmodstraße in Cologne one can find "Richmodis House", birthplace of the composer [[Max Bruch]], where—according to legend—the Aduchts had lived. From a tower two sculpted horseheads look out of a window. These heads by sculptor Wilhelm Müller-Maus were installed in 1958 as a replacement for the wooden ones by Christoph Stephan (1797–1864) that had not survived the [[bombing of Cologne in World War II]].

In 1920, an ethnologist determined that there were nineteen cities in Germany that claimed that a version of the Lady of the Ring had occurred there, including [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], [[Dresden]], and [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]]. In eleven of the cases, there were horse sculptures that commemorated the strange ending to the story.

=== British Isles ===
In 18th-century England, the woman in the story was identified as [[Emma Edgcumbe]], Countess Mount Edgcumbe, wife of [[George Edgcumbe, 1st Earl of Mount Edgcumbe]]. However, the century before, Emma's ancestor Lady [[Anne Edgcumbe]] was commonly identified as the woman. In England, numerous other ladies with the ring have been identified, including [[Annot of Benallay]], Lady [[Katherine Wyndham]] (wife of [[Sir Edward Wyndham, 2nd Baronet]]), Hannah Goodman, and Constance Whitney. In Scotland, the woman was identified as [[Marjorie Elphinstone]] (second wife of [[Robert Drummond of Carnock]]), or sometimes Margaret Halcro Erskine.

==== Ireland ====

A version of the story has become part of [[Lurgan]] folklore, with the woman identified as Marjorie (or Margorie) McCall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A '''lek''' is an aggregation of male animals gathered to engage in competitive displays, '''lekking''', to entice visiting females which are surveying prospective partners for copulation.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fiske | first1=P. | last2=Rintamaki | first2=P.

A lekking species is characterised by male displays, strong female [[mate choice]], and the conferring of indirect benefits to males. Although most prevalent among [[birds]] such as [[black grouse]], lekking is also found in insects including [[paper wasp]]s, crustaceans, fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.

A classical lek consists of male territories in visual and auditory range of each other. An exploded lek, as seen in the [[kakapo]] (the owl parrot), has more widely separated territories, but still in auditory range.

Lekking is associated with an apparent [[lek paradox|paradox]]: strong [[sexual selection]] by females for specific male traits ought to erode [[genetic diversity]] by [[Fisherian runaway]], but diversity is maintained and runaway does not occur. Many attempts have been made to explain it away,&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thery/&gt;&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Durães/&gt; but the paradox remains.

The term derives from the [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] ''[[-lock|lek]]'', a noun which typically denotes pleasurable and less rule-bound games and activities ("play", as by children). English use of ''lek'' dates to the 1860s. Llewelyn Lloyd's ''The Game birds and wild fowl of Sweden and Norway'' (1867) introduces it (capitalised and in single quotes, as 'Lek') explicitly as a Swedish term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Llewelyn |title=The Game Birds and Wild Fowl of Sweden and Norway |date=1867 |publisher=[[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] |location=London |pages=219ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEd-EgZE2AgC}}. Lloyd also loans 'Lek-ställe' (Swedish  ''lekställe'') for "pairing ground".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lekking species==
The term was originally used most commonly for [[black grouse]] (Swedish: "orrlek") and for [[capercaillie]] (Swedish: "tjäderlek"), and lekking behavior is quite common in [[Grouse#Sexual Size Dimorphism|birds]] of this type, such as [[sage grouse]], [[prairie chicken]], [[great bustard]] and [[sharp-tailed grouse]]. However, lekking is also found in birds of other families, such as the [[Ruff (bird)|ruff]], [[great snipe]], [[Guianan cock-of-the-rock]], [[musk duck]]s, [[Green hermit|hermit hummingbird]]s, [[manakin]]s, [[birds-of-paradise]], [[screaming piha]]s and the [[kakapo]].

==Lekking behaviour==
[[File:Capercaillie Lomvi 2004.jpg|thumb|left|A posing [[capercaillie]]]]

There are two types of lekking arrangements: classical and exploded. In the classic lekking system, male territories are in visual and auditory range of their neighbours. In an exploded lek, males are further away from one another than they would be in a classic lek. Males in an exploded lek are outside of visual range of one another, but they stay within earshot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Trail | first1=P.

Females do not return to a mating site if their male partner is not present.&lt;ref name=Duval /&gt; Another possible explanation for lek stability is from male hierarchies within a lek. In some species of manakins, subordinate betas may inherit an alpha's display site, increasing the chances of female visitation.&lt;ref name=Duval /&gt; Rank may also contribute to the stability of lek size, as lower ranking males may congregate to achieve a perceived optimal size as a way to attract females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hernandez | first1=M.

Some species of ants, such as [[red harvester ants]], as well as certain bee species, like ''[[Tetragonisca angustula]]''  and ''[[Trigona spinipes]]'' exhibit lek-like mating patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Velthuis | first1=Hayo H.W. | last2=Koedam | first2=Dirk | last3=Imperatriz-Fonseca | first3=Vera L | year=2005 | title=The males of Melipona and other stingless bees, and their mothers | journal=Apidologie | volume=36 | issue=2| pages=169–185 | doi=10.1051/apido:2005014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prato-Mating&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prato |first1=M |last2=Soares |first2=A E E|title=Production of Sexuals and Mating Frequency in the Stingless Bee Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille) (Hymenoptera, Apidae) |journal=Neotropical Entomology |date=July 2013 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=474–482 |doi=10.1007/s13744-013-0154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males form reproductive aggregations, congregating and collectively give off a [[pheromone]] that attracts reproductive females. The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females.

Lek mating is relatively common among [[paper wasp]] species. For example, ''[[Polistes dominula]]'' males often fight with other males in mid-air to demonstrate their superiority and attractiveness. Males that lose fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe males before making choices on mates and they use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on males, which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. Males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other males and preferred by females compared to males who have larger, more irregularly shaped spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Izzo |first1=Amanda |last2=Elizabeth |first2=A. |last3=Tibbetts |first3=E. |title=Spotting the Top Male: Sexually Selected Signals in Male ''Polistes dominulus'' Wasps |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2012 |volume=83 |pages=839–845 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''[[Mischocyttarus flavitarsis]]'' males choose a perch site near female hibernation areas, rub their abdomens to mark their territory and wait 6–7 weeks for a female to approach. If an intruder approaches, the owner of the site lunges and grapples the other wasp. Typically, they fall off the perch site and finish the fight on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Mischocyttarus flavitarsis in Arizona: Social and Nesting Biology of a Polistine Wasp |last=Litte |first=Marcia |date=1979 |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs and benefits==
[[File:Paraclusia tigrina - lekking behaviour.ogv|thumb|Lekking behavior in the [[Clusiidae|Clusiid]] fly ''Paraclusia tigrina'']]

The main benefit for both sexes is mating success. For males, the costs stem from females’ preferences. The traits that are selected for may be energetically costly to maintain and may cause increased predation. For example, increased vocalization rate caused a decrease in the mass of male great snipe.&lt;ref name="Costs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hoglund | first1=J. | last2=Kalais | first2=J. A. | last3=Fiske | first3=P. | year=1992 | title=The costs of secondary sexual characters in the lekking great snipe (Gallinago media) | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=30 | pages=309–315 | doi=10.1007/bf00170596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cost would be male competition, as females prefer victorious males. [[Great snipe]]s, ''[[Gallinago media]]'', regularly fight to display dominance or defend their territory.&lt;ref name=Costs /&gt; Aggressive male black grouse are preferred over non-aggressive males and when the males fight they tear feathers from each other's tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alatalo | first1=R. V | last2=Höglund | first2=J. | last3=Lundberg | first3=A | year=1991 | title=Lekking in the black grouse: a test of male viability | journal=Nature | volume=352 | pages=155–156 | doi=10.1038/352155a0| bibcode=1991Natur.352..155A }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first glance, it would seem that females receive no direct benefits because these males are only contributing genes to the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, J. D. &amp; Gross, M. R. "Costs and Benefits of Female Mate Choice : Is There a Lek Paradox ?" 136, 230–243 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; However, lekking actually reduces the cost of female searching because the congregating of males makes mate selection easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wickman | first1=P. | last2=Jansson | first2=P. | year=1997 | title=An estimate of female mate searching costs in the lekking butterfly ''Coenonympha pamphilus'' | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=40 | pages=321–328 | doi=10.1007/s002650050348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females do not have to travel as far, since they are able to evaluate and compare multiple males within the same vicinity. This may also help reduce the amount of time a female may be vulnerable to predators. Female marbled reed frogs, ''[[Hyperolius marmoratus]]'', under predatory pressure consistently chose leks near their release sites, and high male calling rates reduced female search time.&lt;ref name=Grafe1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grafe|first=T.

==Female mating preferences==
A meta analysis of 27 species found that qualities such as lekking size, male display rate, and the rate of male aggression exhibit positive correlation with male success rates.&lt;ref name=Fiske /&gt; A positive correlation was also found between attendance, magnitude of exaggerated traits, age, frequency of fights, and mating success.&lt;ref name=Fiske /&gt; This female preference leads to mating skew, with some males being more successful at copulating with females. The variation in mating success is quite large in lek mating systems with 70-80 percent of matings being attributed to only 10%-20% of the males present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mackenzie | first1=A. | last2=Reynolds | first2=J.

==The lek paradox==

{{main article|Lek paradox}}

Since sexual selection by females for specific male [[trait (biology)|trait]] values should erode [[genetic diversity]], the maintenance of genetic variation [[Lek paradox|in lekking species constitutes a paradox]] in evolutionary biology. Many attempts have been made to explain it away, but the paradox remains.&lt;ref name="indirect genetic effects"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Miller | first1=Christine | last2=Moore | first2=Allen | year=2007 | title=A potential resolution to the lek paradox through indirect genetic effects | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2176171/pdf/rspb20060413.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=274 | pages=1279–1286 | pmc=2176171 | pmid=17341455 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0054}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two conditions in which the lek paradox arises.

[[File:Tetrax tetrax, Castuera, Estremadura, Spain 1.jpg|thumb|In the [[little bustard]], the presence of a hotshot male seems to attract males and females to the lek.]]

==Evolution==
{{primary|date=November 2018}}

===Hotshot hypothesis===
There have been several hypotheses proposed as to why males cluster into leks. The hotshot hypothesis is the only model that attributes males as the driving force behind aggregation. The hotshot model hypothesizes that attractive males, known as hotshots, garner both female and male attention.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=M. S. | last2=Beehler | first2=B. M. | year=1998 | title=Hotshots, Hotspots, and Female Preferences in the Organization of Lek Mating Systems |journal=The American Naturalist | volume=131 | pages=203–219 | doi=10.1086/284786| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235682/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females go to the hotshots because they are attracted to these males. Other males form leks around these hotshots as a way to lure females away from the hotshot. A manipulative experiment using the little bustard, ''[[Tetrax tetrax]]'', was done to test the various lek evolution models.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt; The experiment involved varying the size and sex ratio of leks using decoys. To test whether or not the presence of a hotshot determined lek formation, a hotshot little bustard decoy was placed within a lek. After the fake hotshot was added to the lek, both male and female visitation to the lek increased.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jiguet | first1=F. | last2=Bretagnolle | first2=V. | year=2006 | title=Manipulating lek size and composition using decoys: An experimental investigation of lek evolution models | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=168 | pages=758–768 | doi=10.1086/508808 | pmid=17109318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hotspot model===
[[File:Manacus manacus.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[manakin]]s, males aggregate near hotspots with plentiful fruit, where females tend to go.]]

The hotspot model considers the female density to be the catalyst for the clustering of males. This model predicts that leks will form where females tend to reside as a way to increase female interaction.&lt;ref name=Thery&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Théry | first1=M | year=1992 | title=The evolution of leks through female choice: Differential clustering and space utilization in six sympatric manakins | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=30 | pages=227–237 | doi=10.1007/bf00166707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female [[manakin]] traffic has been observed to be concentrated around leks, bathing sites, and fruiting areas, with males aggregated near the most visited fruiting resources.&lt;ref name=Thery/&gt; The hotspot model also predicts that lek size is dependent upon the number of females inhabiting a patch of land.&lt;ref name=Foster/&gt; To test if the number of females affects lek formation, a group of female little bustard decoys were added to a lek. The presence of these female decoys did not have an effect on lek size.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt;

===Blackhole model===
The blackhole model proposes that females have a preference for neither size nor type of male, but rather that females tend to be mobile and mate wherever leks may be located.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt; This model predicts that female mobility is a response to male harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Clutton-Brock | first1=T. H. | author1link=Tim Clutton-Brock | last2=Price | first2=O. F. | last3=Maccou | first3=A. D. C. | year=1991 | title=Mate retention, harassment, and the evolution of ungulate leks |  journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=3 | pages=234–242 | doi=10.1093/beheco/3.3.234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction is difficult to test, but there was a negative correlation found between male aggressiveness and female visitation in the little bustard population.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size" /&gt; Evidence supporting the black hole model is mainly found in [[ungulates]].&lt;ref name=Isvaran /&gt;

===Kin selection===
[[File:Lekadvert.JPG|thumb|In [[black grouse]], leks are composed of brothers and half-brothers, suggesting a [[kin selection]] mechanism.]]
An alternative hypothesis for lekking is [[kin selection]], which assumes that males within a lek are related to one another. As females rarely mate outside of leks, it is advantageous for males to form leks.&lt;ref name=Durães&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Durães | first1=R. | last2=Loiselle | first2=B. A. | last3=Blake | first3=J. G. | year=2008 | title=Spatial and temporal dynamics at manakin leks: Reconciling lek traditionality with male turnover | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=62 | pages=1947–1957 | doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0626-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all males within a lek mate with a female, the unmated males still receive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] benefits. Kin selection explains that related males congregate to form leks, as a way to attract females and increase [[inclusive fitness]].&lt;ref name=Duval /&gt; In some species, the males at the leks show a high degree of relatedness, but this does not apply as a rule to lek-forming species in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Loiselle, B. A. |author2=Thomas B. Ryder |author3=Renata Durães |author4=Wendy Tori |author5=John G. Blake |author6=Patricia G. Parker |year=2007| title= Kin Selection Does Not Explain Male Aggregation at Leks of 4 Manakin Species| doi=10.1093/beheco/arl081 | journal= Behavioral Ecology | volume=18| pages= 287–291|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cooperative display and relatedness among males in a lek-mating bird |author1=McDonald, D. B. |author2=Potts, W. K. |year=1994| journal=Science |volume=266 |doi=10.1126/science.7973654 |pmid=7973654 |issue=5187 |pages=1030–1032 |bibcode=1994Sci...266.1030M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hoglund, J. | year=2003| title= Lek-kin in birds – Provoking theory and surprising new results|journal= Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=40| pages=249–253|url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf40/anzf40-249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few species such as peacocks and [[black grouse]], leks are composed of brothers and half-brothers. The lower-ranking males gain some fitness benefit by passing their genes on through attracting mates for their brothers (larger leks attract more females). [[Peacock]]s recognize and will lek with their brothers, even if they have never met before.&lt;ref name="Petrie et al 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petrie |first=Marion |author2=Krupa, Andrew |author3=Burke, Terry |title=Peacocks lek with relatives even in the absence of social and environmental cues |journal=Nature |year=1999 |volume=401 |issue=6749 |pages=155–157 |doi=10.1038/43651 |bibcode=1999Natur.401..155P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predation protection ===
Another hypothesis is predator protection, or the idea that there is a reduction in individual predation risk in a larger group.&lt;ref name="manipulating lek size"/&gt; This could work both for the males in within the group as well as any female who visits the lek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kin selection may contribute to lek evolution and trait introgression across an avian hybrid zone|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05474.x/abstract |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2012 |issn=1365-294X |pages=1477–1486 |volume=21 |issue=6 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05474.x |first=Moira R. |last=Concannon |first2=Adam C. |last2=Stein |first3=J. Albert C. |last3=Uy |pmid=22320709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protection also explains the presence of mixed leks, when a male of one species joins a lek of another species for protection from a common set of predators. This occurs with manakins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comparison of Species Tree Methods for Reconstructing the Phylogeny of Bearded Manakins (Aves: Pipridae, Manacus) from Multilocus Sequence Data |url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/5/719 |journal=Systematic Biology |date=2008-10-01|issn=1063-5157 |pmid=18853359 |pages=719–731 |volume=57 |issue=5 |doi=10.1080/10635150802422290 |first=Robb T. |last=Brumfield |first2=Liang |last2=Liu |first3=David E. |last3=Lum |first4=Scott V. |last4=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other birds such as [[grouse]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Active formation of mixed–species grouse leks: a role for predation in lek evolution? |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/269/1509/2503|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=2002 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=1691199 |pmid=12573063 |pages=2503–2507 |volume=269 |issue=1509 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2187 |first=Robert M. |last=Gibson |first2=Andrea S.|last2=Aspbury |first3=Leonard L. |last3=McDaniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Coin of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.]]
'''Lucius Appuleius Saturninus''' (died late 100 BC) was a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[populares|populist]] and [[tribune]]. He is most notable for introducing a series of legislative reforms, alongside his associate [[Gaius Servilius Glaucia]] and with the consent of the famous [[Gaius Marius]], during the last years of the second century BC. Senatorial opposition to these laws eventually led to an internal crisis, the declaration of the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'', and the deaths of Saturninus, Glaucia, and their followers in 100 BC.

==Biography==
===Quaestor===
As ''[[quaestor]]'' (104 BC) he superintended the imports of grain at [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]], but was removed by the [[Roman Senate]] (an unusual proceeding), and replaced by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]], one of the chief members of the ''[[Optimates]]''. He does not appear to have been charged with incapacity or mismanagement, and the standard view is that the injustice of his dismissal drove him into the arms of the ''[[Populares]]''.

===First Tribuneship===
In 103 BC he was elected [[tribune]]. He entered into an agreement with [[Gaius Marius]], and in order to gain the favour of his soldiers proposed that each of his veterans should receive an allotment of 100 [[Jugerum|iugera]] of land in the Roman province of [[Africa]]. He was also chiefly instrumental in securing the election of Marius to his fourth consulship (102 BC).

An opportunity to retaliate against the ''[[Nobiles]]'' was afforded him by the arrival (101 BC) of ambassadors from [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], with large sums of money for bribing the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]; compromising revelations were made by Saturninus, who insulted the ambassadors. He was brought to trial for violating the law of nations, and only escaped conviction by an ''[[Appeal to pity|ad misericordiam]]'' appeal to the people. To the first tribunate of Saturninus is probably to be assigned his [[Lex_Appuleia_de_maiestate|law on ''majestas'']], the exact provisions of which are unknown, but its object was probably to strengthen the power of the [[tribune]]s and the ''Populares''; it dealt with the ''minuta majestas'' (diminished authority) of the Roman people, that is, with all acts tending to impair the integrity of the Commonwealth, being thus more comprehensive than the modern word "[[treason]]".

One of the chief objects of Saturninus's hatred was [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus]], who, when censor, endeavoured to remove Saturninus from the Senate on the ground of immorality, but his colleague refused to assent. In order to ingratiate himself with the people, who still cherished the memory of the [[Gracchi]], Saturninus took about with him Lucius Equitius, a paid freedman, who [[Pretender|made himself out to be the son of]] [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus]]. Sempronia, sister of the dead Gracchi, refused to acknowledge her alleged nephew.

===Second Tribuneship===
Marius, on his return to Rome after his victory over the [[Cimbri]], finding himself isolated in the senate, entered into a compact with Saturninus and his ally [[Gaius Servilius Glaucia]], and the three formed a kind of [[triumvirate]], supported by the veterans of Marius and many of the common people. By the aid of bribery and assassination Marius was elected (100 BC) consul for the sixth time, Glaucia ''[[praetor]]'', and Saturninus tribune for the second time. Saturninus now brought forward an [[agrarian law]], the [[lex Appuleia agraria]], an extension of the African law already alluded to{{ref?|date=September 2017}}. It was proposed that all the land north of the Padus ([[Po River|Po]]) lately in possession of the Cimbri, including that of the independent [[Celt]]ic tribes which had been temporarily occupied by them, should be held available for distribution among the veterans of Marius. This was problematic, since the land was already the property of the provincials who had been dispossessed by the Cimbri.

Colonies were to be founded in [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], [[Transalpine Gaul]],  and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], which were to be purchased with the [[Gold of Tolosa]], the temple treasures embezzled by [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] (consul in 106).&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Beesely, ''The Gracchi, Marius, and Sulla Epochs of Ancient History'', (Kindle edition), ch. VII., p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Further, though they were classed as [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman]], Italians were to be admitted to these colonies, and as they were to be burgess colonies, the right of the Italians to equality with the Romans was thereby partially recognized. The city mob therefore strongly opposed the bill, resenting sharing their citizen rights with the Italian allies, and Saturninus was obliged to call up rural voters from outside the city to pass the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Beesely, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

A clause provided that, within 5 days after the passing of the law, every senator should take an oath to observe it, under penalty of being expelled from the senate and heavily fined. All the senators subsequently took the oath except Metellus Numidicus, who went into exile. Saturninus also brought in a bill, the object of which was to gain the support of the people by supplying grain at a nominal price. The bill either reduced the already cheap price fixed by the corn-law of [[Caius Gracchus]], or was a repeal of a former Senatorial repeal of Gracchus' law, though the former is more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Beesely, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The quaestor [[Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger]] declared that the treasury could not stand the strain, and Saturninus' own colleagues interposed their [[veto]]. Saturninus ordered the voting to continue, and Caepio dispersed the meeting by violence. The Senate declared the proceedings null and void, because [[thunder]] had been heard; Saturninus replied that the Senate had better remain quiet; otherwise the thunder might be followed by [[hail]]. The bills (''leges Appuleiae'') were finally passed by the aid of the Marian veterans.

===Downfall and death===
Marius, finding himself overshadowed by his colleagues and compromised by their excesses, thought seriously of breaking with them, and Saturninus and Glaucia saw that their only hope of safety lay in their retention of office. At the elections for 99, held probably in late summer–autumn 100, Saturninus was elected tribune for the third time for the year beginning December 10 100, and Glaucia, although at the time praetor and therefore not eligible until after the lapse of 2 years, was a candidate for the consulship. [[Marcus Antonius Orator]] was elected without opposition; the other ''Optimate'' candidate, [[Gaius Memmius (Tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], who seemed to have the better chance of success, was beaten to death by the hired agents of Saturninus and Glaucia, while the voting was actually going on.

This produced a complete revulsion of public feeling. The Senate met on the following day, declared Saturninus and Glaucia public enemies, and issued the so-called 'final decree' (''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'') calling upon Marius to defend the State. Marius had no alternative but to obey. Saturninus, defeated in a pitched battle in the [[Roman Forum]], took refuge with his followers in the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]], where, the water supply having been cut off, they were forced to capitulate. Marius, having assured them that their lives would be spared, removed them to the [[Curia Hostilia]], intending to proceed against them according to law. But the more impetuous members of the aristocratic party climbed onto the roof, stripped off the tiles, and stoned Saturninus and many others to death. Glaucia, who had escaped into a house, was dragged out and killed.

==Descendants==
His daughter Appuleia married well despite the family disgrace, and was mother of two consuls, including the triumvir [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. Another descendant, [[Sextus Appuleius (consul 29 BC)|Sextus Appuleius]], was consul in 29 BC. His son [[Sextus Appuleius (consul AD 14)|Sextus Appuleius]], consul in AD 14, had a son by [[Fabia Numantina]], who died young; Fabia had inscribed on his gravestone that the boy was "the last of his family".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Marcus Appuleius]] who was consul in 20 BC may have been another descendant.

'''Mike the Headless Chicken''' (April 20, 1945 – March 17, 1947), also known as '''Miracle Mike''',&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Mike's Story| url=http://www.miketheheadlesschicken.org| publisher=Mike the Headless Chicken | year=2007 | accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Wyandotte chicken]] that lived for 18 months after his head had been cut off. Although the story was thought by many to be a [[hoax]], the bird's owner took him to the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]] to establish the facts.&lt;ref name=story/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Online 10 September 2015"/&gt;

==Beheading==
On September 10, 1945, farmer Lloyd Olsen of [[Fruita, Colorado]], was planning to eat supper with his mother-in-law and was sent out to the yard by his wife to bring back a chicken. Olsen chose a five-and-a-half-month-old [[Wyandotte chicken]] named Mike. The axe removed the bulk of the head, but missed the [[jugular vein]], leaving one ear and most of the [[brain stem]] intact.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lloyd | first=John | authorlink=John Lloyd (writer) |author2=Mitchinson, John |authorlink2=John Mitchinson (researcher)  | title=[[The Book of General Ignorance]] | publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] | year=2006 | isbn=0-571-23368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The Rooster | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776319,00.html | publisher=Time Inc. | date=October 29, 1945 | accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Olsen's failed attempt to behead Mike, the chicken was still able to balance on a perch and walk clumsily. He attempted to preen, peck for food, and crow, though with limited success; his "crowing" consisted of a gurgling sound made in his throat.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; When Mike did not die, Olsen instead decided to care for the bird. He fed it a mixture of milk and water via an eyedropper, and gave it small grains of corn and worms.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 19, 1945 |title=Beheaded Chicken Calmly Lives On |page=17 |work=[[Salt Lake Tribune]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23633791/beheaded_chicken_calmly_lives_on/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=September 10, 2018}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fame==
Once his fame had been established, Mike began a career of touring [[sideshow]]s in the company of such other creatures as a two-headed baby. He was also photographed for dozens of magazines and papers, and was featured in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; Mike was put on display to the public for an admission cost of 25 cents. At the height of his popularity, the chicken's owner earned [[US$]]4,500 per month (${{Inflation|US|4500|1947|r=-2|fmt=c}} today){{Inflation-fn|US}}; Mike was valued at $10,000.{{Citation needed|date = September 2018}}

==Death==
In March 1947, at a [[motel]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] on a stopover while traveling back from tour, Mike started choking in the middle of the night. He had managed to get a kernel of corn in his throat. The Olsens had inadvertently left their feeding and cleaning syringes at the sideshow the day before, and so were unable to save Mike. Olsen claimed that he had sold the bird off, resulting in stories of Mike still touring the country as late as 1949. Other sources say that the chicken's severed trachea could not properly take in enough air to be able to breathe, and it therefore choked to death in the motel.&lt;ref name="BBC Online 10 September 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title= The chicken that lived for 18 months without a head| url= https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34198390| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| date= September 10, 2015 | website= [[BBC News Online]]| accessdate =September 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation of the case==
It was determined  that the axe had missed the [[jugular vein]]&lt;ref name="Lambert"/&gt; and a [[clot]] had prevented Mike from bleeding to death. Although most of his head was severed, most of his [[brain stem]] and one ear were left on his body. Since basic functions (breathing, heart rate, etc.) as well as most of a chicken's reflex actions are controlled by the brain stem, Mike was able to remain quite healthy. This is a good example of central motor generators enabling basic [[homeostatic]] functions to be carried out in the absence of higher brain centres.&lt;ref name="Lambert"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6OgdMLO0CdMC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Mike+the+Headless+Chicken&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M_DDT4TsA-OG2gX7woxd&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mike%20the%20Headless%20Chicken&amp;f=false  Kelly Lambert and  Craig Kinsley. 2004. Clinical Neuroscience. Worth Publishers, Incorporated]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Mike the Headless Chicken is now an institution in [[Fruita, Colorado]], with an annual "Mike the Headless Chicken Day", the third weekend of May, starting in 1999. Events held include the "5K Run Like a Headless Chicken Race", [[egg toss]], "Pin the Head on the Chicken", the "Chicken Cluck-Off", and "Chicken Bingo", in which chicken droppings on a numbered grid choose the numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/travel/planet/2000/01/06/chicken/ | title=Mike the Headless Chicken Day | publisher=[[salon.com]] | accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike the Headless Chicken was an inspiration for the poultry-themed comedy punk band [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]], serving as the subject of their 2008 song "Headless Mike", for which a music video was filmed. The band also features a Headless Mike puppet which is frequently used in their live shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/a73abcde00/radioactive-chicken-heads-headless-mike-music-video?_cc=__d___&amp;_ccid=false |publisher=[[Funny or Die]] |title=The Radioactive Chicken Heads - "Headless Mike"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yvonne Gilford''' was an [[Australia]]n nurse who was murdered in the King Fahd Military Medical Complex, in [[Dhahran]], [[Saudi Arabia]] on 12 December 1996. Two [[United Kingdom|British]] nurses, Deborah Parry and Lucille "Lucy" McLauchlan, were arrested for the crime. Parry [[confession|confessed]] the murder and McLauchlan to being an accessory, though both subsequently claimed to have been coerced into signing the confession. Parry was sentenced to death by [[Decapitation|beheading]], and McLauchlan to eight years' imprisonment and 500 [[Flagellation|lashes]]. Parry's sentence was reduced to [[life imprisonment]] after Gilford's elder brother Frank accepted a "[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]" payment of approximately [[Pound sterling|£]]750,000, and both sentences were eventually commuted to [[time served]] after personal intervention from [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]].

== Yvonne Gilford ==
Yvonne Gilford was born in 1941 and grew up on a farm in [[Jamestown, South Australia|Jamestown]], [[South Australia]], along with her parents and brother Frank. She became a nurse at the age of 28 and initially worked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], before moving to [[London]] in 1973 and then [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] in 1976. After working in various hospitals in the city for the next twenty years, she accepted a new job in [[Dhahran]] in April 1996, and moved to [[Saudi Arabia]] with her ultimate aim being to earn enough money to retire from nursing and return to [[Australia]]. She initially found herself with few colleagues who spoke [[English language|English]], and quickly befriended Parry and McLauchlan after they arrived in Dhahran in August of that year.&lt;ref name="People"&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123505,00.html People Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; For Parry it was her second time working in the country, having previously worked there between 1993 and 1994, while it was McLauchlan's first time working abroad, having been dismissed from her previous job for [[credit card fraud]]. It subsequently emerged she had used fraudulent references to obtain the job in Dhahran.&lt;ref name="Courier"&gt;[http://www.thecourier.co.uk/News/article/22639c2/i-did-nothing-wrong-deborah-parry-explains-fight-to-reopen-yvonne-gilford-investigation.html The Courier]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder ==
Gilford was last seen alive on the evening of 11 December, when she, Parry and McLauchlan held an "early [[Christmas]] party" in her bedroom. She failed to report for work the following morning, and when guards were sent to her bedroom to investigate, they found her dead. There were signs of a struggle in which Gilford had been stabbed thirteen times, though the ultimate cause of her death was ascertained to have been [[asphyxiation]] by her own bed pillow. Within the next week, Parry and McLauchlan were arrested on suspicion of murder after allegedly using Gilford's [[bank card]] to make a series of withdrawals totalling approximately $1,000.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt;

== Trial and sentencing ==
Several days after their arrest, Parry eventually [[confession|confessed]] to having been in a relationship with Gilford, and that she had attacked her (albeit without intent to kill) following an argument. McLauchlan agreed that her account of events was true, though by the time of the trial both had unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw the confession, claiming that they had been intimidated, deprived of sleep and subjected to threats of [[sexual violence]] in order to coerce them into signing it.&lt;ref name="BBCMay1998Two"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/97826.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the trial, the lawyers for the two nurses discovered similarities between Gilford's death and the 1994 murder of Liberty de Guzman, another nurse at the same complex, but that case was judged to not be relevant to the trial.&lt;ref name="Indep1997"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/new-doubt-raised-as-nurse-tells-of-second-murder-at-saudi-hospital-1233560.html The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual trial was relatively swift, in large part due to the confession that the two nurses had signed. There was no [[cross-examination]] of the two witnesses, nor any witnesses or [[forensic evidence]].&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; McLauchlan was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment and 500 [[Flagellation|lashes]]. Parry's sentencing was more complicated, as she was found guilty of murder and sentenced to [[death penalty|death]], but could be commuted to a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] if the closest surviving relative of the victim were to accept a "[[blood money (restitution)|blood money]]" payment as allowed under the [[Islamic law]] of ''[[Diyya]]''. Gilford's closest surviving relative was her brother Frank, who initially refused the notion of accepting any such payment, though eventually accepted a payment worth around [[Pound sterling|£750,000]], which was funded primarily by [[British Aerospace]] and philanthropist/publisher [[Felix Dennis]]. Frank subsequently donated the entire payment to a children's charity.&lt;ref name="Indep1998"/&gt;

While Parry had been saved from the death penalty, there were still many questions about the overall fairness of the trial, and in March 1998, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] personally appealed to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] during a [[state visit]] to resolve the situation. Finally, on 20 May 1998, Fahd [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] the sentences of both women to 17 months in prison - the time that they had already served - with the only conditions being that both were to write him a letter personally thanking him for his [[clemency]], and then accept deportation back to the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="BBCMay98"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/97195.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following her return to the UK, McLauchlan married her fiancé Grant Ferrie. She subsequently asked to meet Frank to personally apologise for calling him a "greedy, selfish bastard" for accepting the blood money, but Frank refused the offer and said that he did not ever want to meet either of the two nurses.&lt;ref name="BBCOct98"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/202366.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; She was subsequently struck off the nursing register for her actions in using false references to obtain her job in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt; In 2011 she was convicted of credit card fraud for a second time,&lt;ref name="DailyRecord"&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/saudi-murder-trial-nurse-lucy-1094999 Daily Record]&lt;/ref&gt; before being convicted of [[theft]] in May 2012. On both occasions, her [[solicitor]] said she had been "mentally scarred" by her experience in the Saudi prison.&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt; McLauchlan died on 7 January 2014, aged 48, at [[Ninewells Hospital]], [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] after suffering a [[brain haemorrhage]] at her house two days previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/saudi-murder-case-nurse-lucille-2996110 Daily Record: Saudi murder case nurse Lucille McLauchlan dies after suffering brain haemorrhage at her home]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parry resumed her nursing career upon her return to the UK, being re-employed at one of her former jobs at Holy Cross Hospital in [[Haslemere]], despite an attempt by [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[George Galloway]] to have her struck off.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1428464/What-goes-around-comes-around-George.html The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to maintain that she was not a [[Lesbian|lesbian]] and had not been in a relationship with Yvonne Gilford and had no involvement whatsoever with the murder, and in 2012 called for Gilford's body to be exhumed and subjected to forensic techniques that were not available at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt;

The case attracted much attention in the UK and Australia owing to the fact it would have been the first execution of a western woman by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; Other factors were the British media's reporting over the case and the political pressures that prompted Fahd to release the nurses.&lt;ref name="Indep1998"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/who-killed-yvonne-gilford-who-cares--certainly-not-the-tabloids-1158020.html The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was mentioned in ''Desert Royal,'' a memoir of a Saudi princess written by Jean Sasson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sasson|first1=Jean|title=Desert Royal|date=1999|publisher=Bantam|location=London|pages=183-186|edition=2000 printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Mount Everest - Leszek Cichy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leszek Cichy]], who completed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest in February 1980, found a note there urging the passers-by to call a certain prostitute in Anchorage for "a good time". Apparently Genet left it there as a prank after reaching the summit.{{sfn|Nawrot|2015|p=1}}]]--&gt;
'''Ray Genet''' (July 27, 1931 – October 2, 1979), often referred to by the nickname '''Pirate''', was a Swiss-born American [[mountaineer]].  He was the first guide on [[North America]]'s highest mountain, [[Alaska]]'s [[Denali]] (Mount McKinley).
Genet is the grandfather of actress [[Q'Orianka Kilcher]].
==Career==
Genet's association with Denali began in 1967, when, although he had no previous mountaineering experience, he participated in the first successful winter expedition to Denali's summit, led by Gregg Blomberg. The expedition is described in ''Minus 148 Degrees: The First Winter Ascent of Mount McKinley'' (1970) by Art Davidson.{{sfn|Davidson|1999}}
==Death==
Genet died on October 2, 1979 while descending Mount Everest, succumbing to hypothermia in the night along with his fellow climber [[Hannelore Schmatz]].  Two Sherpa guides, [[Sungdare Sherpa]] and Ang Jangbo, had stayed with them in a [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]] at 28,000 feet, but Genet did not survive until morning.&lt;ref name=bpm/&gt; The group was running low on [[bottled oxygen]], and Schmatz died trying to get down to South Col with Sungdare later that day.&lt;ref name=bpm&gt;{{cite news|work=Backpacker|date=May 1986|author=Marshall, Roger|title=  The King of Everest|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_N8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=sungdare+sherpa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwA2oVChMIyam37trqxgIVCpceCh0B2w0h#v=onepage&amp;q=sungdare%20sherpa&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger East''' (7 February 1922{{spaced ndash}}8 December 1975) was an [[Australian]] journalist who was murdered by the [[Indonesian military]] during its [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion of East Timor]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;&lt;ref name=justice/&gt;  

East was a [[Freelancer|freelance journalist]] who worked for the [[Australian Associated Press]] (AAP). He travelled to [[Portuguese Timor]] (now known as [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]]) in October 1975, following the story of the [[Balibo Five]], who had been killed by Indonesian soldiers just weeks before. East was captured by the Indonesian security forces and was brought, along with many other prisoners, to the [[Dili]] waterfront where he and scores of others were then executed by firing squad.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;&lt;ref name=justice/&gt;

Previously, he had worked as a publicity officer for the [[National Party of Australia|Australian Country Party]] in [[Queensland]] and had been working in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] as a press officer for the [[Darwin Reconstruction Commission]] (which was created after the devastation of Darwin by [[Cyclone Tracy]] in December 1974).

== Early life ==
Born in {{NSWcity|Girraween}}, in [[Western Sydney|western Sydney]] in 1922, East was raised  near [[Dubbo]] in country [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=memorial&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/corp/memorial/rogereast.htm |title=Roger East (1922-1975), journalist |work=In memorium |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= |author=Cronau, Peter |access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two brothers, Bill and Alan, and a younger sister, Glenise. East was a child of [[Great Depression in Australia|the Depression]] and his teenage years in the 1930s were difficult ones. During [[World War II]], East served in the [[Royal Australian Navy]].&lt;ref name=hindsight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/hindsight/roger-east---australias-forgotten-journalist/3169848#transcript |title=Roger East - Australia's Forgotten Journalist |author=Rayner, Michelle |format=transcript |date=14 December 2008 |work=Hindsight |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Radio National]] |access-date=18 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After the war, East entered journalism. Working at first in regional New South Wales newspapers, in the 1950s he left Australia to cover foreign events in places as varied as [[Cyprus]], Africa, China and the [[Suez Crisis]]. In the 1960s, he went to work for [[Visnews]] (today [[Reuters Television]]). In the early 1970s he worked as a press officer for different organisations including both the Australian Country Party and the Australian Labor Party.&lt;ref name=hindsight/&gt;

=== Investigating the Balibo Five ===
At the time of East's arrival, East Timor was under the ''[[de facto]]'' government of [[Fretilin]], a left-wing political party. The Portuguese governor had fled to the island of [[Atauro]] and was refusing to return to the capital, Dili. Fretilin issued a [[Unilateral declaration of independence]] from [[Portugal]] on 28 November 1975.

East was one of only three journalists in Timor — the other two were Michael Richardson, the South-East Asia correspondent for ''[[The Age]]'' and [[Jill Jolliffe]], a freelancer who was then working for [[Reuters]]. When it became obvious that a full-scale invasion by Indonesia was imminent, Richardson and Jolliffe left with the [[Red Cross]] and went to Darwin. East, however, decided to remain in East Timor. He planned to retreat with the Fretilin forces to the mountains in the interior and report from there to the outside world. He was captured by the Indonesians before he could get away.  Eyewitnesses later reported that East was brought, along with many other prisoners, to the Dili waterfront, where he and scores of others were then executed by firing squad.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;&lt;ref name=justice/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nfsa.gov.au/latest/timor-first-decade |title=Democratic Republic of Timor Leste 10th anniversary |work=Timor: The first decade |publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]] |location=Australia |date=May 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2018 |author=Plush, Vincent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an inquest into the murder of the Balibo Five, there were calls for a similar inquest into the murder of East.&lt;ref name=justice&gt;{{cite news |author=Barker, Anne |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-06-11/justice-demanded-for-sixth-balibo-journalist/64952 |title=Justice demanded for 'sixth Balibo journalist' |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=11 June 2007 |access-date=18 March 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029005043/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-06-11/justice-demanded-for-sixth-balibo-journalist/64952 |archive-date=29 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
In [[Timothy Mo]]'s novel ''[[The Redundancy of Courage]]'', the character Bill Mabbely is based upon Roger East.

[[Anthony LaPaglia]] starred as East in the 2009 Australian film ''[[Balibo (film)|Balibo]]''; which tells the story of the Balibo Five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2009/08/04/2645921.htm |title=Balibo: Anthony LaPaglia talks to Lindy Burns |subject=[[Anthony LaPaglia]] |interviewer=Lindy Burns |work=[[ABC Radio Melbourne]] |date=4 August 2009 |access-date=18 March 2018 |format=streaming audio }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/28/2045993.htm?section=entertainment |title=LaPaglia leads Balibo five thriller cast' |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=28 September 2007 |access-date=18 March 2018 |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was co-written by [[David Williamson]] and [[Robert Connolly]] and was based upon ''Cover-Up'', a book by Jolliffe, as well as the work of Professor Clinton Fernandes, who served as the film's historical consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fernandes, Clinton (Prof) |url=https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/timor-balibo-five |title=Timor - The Balibo Five |work=[[Australian Defence Force Academy]] |publisher=[[UNSW Australia]] |date= |access-date=18 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SS''' '''''City of Boston''''' was a British iron-hulled single-screw passenger [[steamship]] of the [[Inman Line]] which disappeared in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] en route from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], to [[Liverpool]] in January 1870.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibbs | first = C. R. Vernon | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Passenger Liners of the Western Ocean: A Record of Atlantic Steam and Motor Passenger Vessels from 1838 to the Present Day | publisher = John De Graff | date = 1957 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Description ==
The ''City of Boston'' was built by shipbuilders [[John Macgregor#Tod and Macgregor|Tod &amp; Macgregor]] of [[Partick]], [[Glasgow]] and launched on 15 November 1864. Her maiden voyage, on 8 February 1865, was from Liverpool to New York via [[Cobh|Queenstown]].

==Disappearance==
The ''City of Boston'' sailed from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] for Liverpool on 28 January 1870 commanded by Captain Halcrow. She had 191 people on board: 55 cabin passengers, 52 steerage passengers and a crew of 84. A number of the passengers were prominent businessmen and military officers from Halifax. She never reached her destination and no trace of her was ever found.

A violent gale and snowstorm took place two days after her departure which may have contributed to her loss. Collision with an iceberg was another explanation suggested at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/wrecks/wrecks/shipwrecks.asp?ID=925 "City of Boston-1870", ''On the Rocks Shipwreck Database'' Nova Scotia Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

''City of Boston'' had been fitted with a two-blade propeller to replace her original three-blade propeller which had been broken during her previous voyage, and Captain Brooks of the [[SS City of Brooklyn|SS ''City of Brooklyn'']] expressed the opinion that the new propeller would not be strong enough to let her make headway against the adverse weather.

==Rumors of the "Dynamite Fiend"==

On 11 December 1875 the mystery of the ''City of Boston'' took a brief turn, that looked like it might give a solution, albeit a melodramatic one. On that day the German seaport of Bremerhaven was the scene of a dynamite explosion that killed eighty people.  It turned out that a barrel being stored on board a ship had been a specially made dynamite bomb with a remarkable timer.  It was to explode and sink the ship and kill most (if not all the passengers) out at sea (where no trace of the vessel would be likely to be found). The purpose was to collect insurance on the cargo. The premature explosion of the barrel caused the man responsible (one "William Thompson") to shoot himself. He became known in the period as the "Dynamite Fiend".  In time Thompson was revealed to be one ''[[Alexander Keith, Jr.]]'' a Canadian from Halifax, Nova Scotia.  In the wake of the discovery of his scheme and crime, police departments around the world were wondering if Thompson/Keith had been involved in the disappearance of other ships.  

Thompson had been in New York City in the winter of 1870, and it was wondered if he had any hand in the disappearance of the ''City of Boston''. At the time he had sent two large money transfers to his wife from New York, and that looked like a possible pay-off by some partners in the scheme. As he came from Halifax, and the ''City of Boston'' was headed for Halifax, it looked like there could be a connection, especially as part of the cargo included a shipment of furs by one "James Thompson" of Halifax.  However, further investigation found that Mr. James Thompson was a real merchant, who lost a valuable shipment of furs on the ''City of Boston'', and (ironically) was unable to get the shipment insured.  After that the possibility of a link between Thompson/Keith and the disappearance of the ''City of Boston'' diminished.

'''Beatrice''' "'''Sathima Bea'''" '''Benjamin''' (17 October 1936 – 20 August 2013) was a South African vocalist and composer, based for nearly 45 years in New York City.

==Early life==
She was born Beatrice Bertha Benjamin&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Nate Chinen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/arts/music/sathima-bea-benjamin-jazz-singer-and-activist-dies-at-76.html?_r=0 "Sathima Bea Benjamin, Jazz Singer and Activist, Dies at 76"], ''The New York Times'', 29 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Claremont, Cape Town]], South Africa;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/sathima-bea-benjamin "Sathima Bea Benjamin", South African History Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; her father, Edward Benjamin, was from the island of St. Helena off the coast of West Africa, and her mother, Evelyn Henry, had roots in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Kelley /&gt; As an adolescent, she first performed popular music in talent contests at the local cinema (bioscope) during the intermission. By the 1950s she was singing at various nightclubs, community dances and social events, performing with notable Cape Town pianists Tony Schilder and Henry February, among others. She built her repertoire watching British and American movies and transcribing lyrics from songs heard on the radio, where she discovered [[Nat King Cole]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Doris Day]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. These musicians would come to influence her singing style, notably in terms of light phrasing and clear diction.

At the age of 21, she joined [[Arthur Klugman]]'s travelling show, "Coloured Jazz and Variety", on a tour of South Africa. When the production failed, she found herself stranded in [[Mozambique]], where she met South African saxophonist [[Kippie Moeketsi]]. In 1959, she returned to Cape Town's now thriving jazz scene, where she met pianist Dollar Brand (later known as [[Abdullah Ibrahim]]), whom she would marry in 1965. In that same year she recorded what would have been the first jazz LP in South Africa's history. Entitled ''My Songs for You'', with accompaniment by Ibrahim's trio, the recording of mostly standards was never released.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

==Sharpeville Massacre and Europe==
In the aftermath of South Africa's [[Sharpeville Massacre]] of 1960, Benjamin and Ibrahim left South Africa for Europe. The couple, along with Ibrahim's trio of bassist [[Johnny Gertze]] and drummer [[Makhaya Ntshoko]], settled in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, and worked throughout Germany and Scandinavia, meeting and occasional working with American jazz players, including [[Don Byas]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Kenny Drew]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Bud Powell]], [[John Coltrane]], and [[Thelonious Monk]]. The artist who would have the greatest impact on Benjamin's life, however, was [[Duke Ellington]].

==Duke Ellington==
Benjamin met Ellington while he was in Zurich in 1963. Standing in the wings during most of his band’s performance, once the concert ended she insisted that Duke hear her husband’s trio at the [[Club Africana]], where Ibrahim's band had a standing engagement. Duke obliged, but insisted that Benjamin sing for him. Following this encounter, Ellington arranged for the couple to fly to Paris and record separate albums for [[Frank Sinatra]]’s [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] label, for whom Ellington functioned as Artists and Repertoire representative. Ibrahim’s record, ''[[Duke Ellington Presents The Dollar Brand Trio]]'', was released the following year and subsequently helped him build a following in Europe and the United States. Benjamin’s recording, however, remained unreleased was presumed to be lost until its release in 1996 by [[Enja Records]], under the title ''A Morning in Paris''. The session's engineer, [[Gerhard Lerner]], had surreptitiously made a second copy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twohundredandten.wordpress.com/tag/sathima-bea-benjamin/ "Sathima Bea Benjamin"], Two Hundred and Ten, 1 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

She maintained her musical relationship with Ellington. In 1965, he arranged to have her perform with his band in the U.S. at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] (when she sang the Ellington ballad "[[(In My) Solitude|Solitude]]"),&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; and at one point asked her to join his band permanently. Due to her recent marriage to Ibrahim that same year, Benjamin declined the offer.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==South Africa, America, and ekapa records==
Throughout the 1960s, Benjamin and Ibrahim moved back and forth between Europe and New York City, as Ibrahim worked to establish his career. Benjamin spent much of the period as a manager and agent for her husband while raising their son, Tsakwe. The year 1976 marked a turning point for Benjamin. She and Ibrahim returned to South Africa to live; she gave birth to her daughter, Tsidi (now the underground hip-hop artist [[Jean Grae]]); and recorded ''African Songbird'', an album of original compositions, for South Africa's [[Gallo Record Company|Gallo Records]]. Shortly after Tsidi's birth, the family relocated to New York city in 1977, to the famed [[Hotel Chelsea]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

In 1979, Benjamin launched her own record label, ekapa rpm, to produce, publish and distribute her and Ibrahim's music. Between 1979 and 2002, she released eight of her own albums on ekapa: ''Sathima Sings Ellington'', ''Dedications'', ''Memories and Dreams'', ''Windsong'', ''Lovelight'', ''Southern Touch'', ''Cape Town Love'', and ''Musical Echoes''.

Each of these recordings received critical acclaim for Benjamin. ''Dedications'' was nominated for a [[Grammy]] in 1982. Benjamin's collaborators on these albums have included saxophonist [[Carlos Ward]], pianists [[Stephen Scott (jazz pianist)|Stephen Scott]], [[Kenny Barron]], [[Larry Willis]] and [[Onaje Allan Gumbs]], bassist [[Buster Williams]] and drummers [[Billy Higgins]] and [[Ben Riley]]. For the most part, Benjamin has used American musicians for her U.S. recordings and South African musicians when in Cape Town. Her 2002 recording, ''Musical Echoes'', featured American pianist [[Stephen Scott (jazz pianist)|Stephen Scott]] with two South Africans, bassist [[Basil Moses]] and drummer [[Lulu Gontsana]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Later career==
In 2000, Danish second-hand bookdealer and fan of South African jazz Lars Rasmussen published a collection of essays and a discography of Benjamin's music in ''Sathima Bea Benjamin: Embracing Jazz'' (Copenhagen, 2000). It contains two compact discs of Sathima's music: ''Cape Town Love'' and an ''Embracing Jazz'' compilation with photographs.

In October 2004, South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] gave her the [[Order of Ikhamanga]] Silver Award for "excellent contribution as a jazz artist" and for her contribution "to the struggle against apartheid."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=507 "Presentation of National Honours"], 29 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the art group Pen and Brush, Inc. presented her with a Certificate of Achievement for her work as a performer, musician, composer, and "activist in the struggle for human rights in South Africa". Benjamin was profiled in the March 2006 issue of ''[[JazzTimes]]''.&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;Robin D. G. Kelley, [http://jazztimes.com/articles/16570-sathima-bea-benjamin-the-echo-returns "Sathima Bea Benjamin: The Echo Returns"], ''JazzTimes'', March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her album ''SongSpirit'', was released on 17 October 2006 in celebration of her 70th birthday. A compilation record, it includes tracks from her earlier albums, plus a previously unreleased duet with Abdullah Ibrahim from 1973.

In 2007, Benjamin began reissuing her back catalogue for download. ''Cape Town Love'', released 19 June, began the process, while ''A Morning in Paris'' was reissued in October 2007 to mark her 71st birthday. It was released for download on 16 October, and reissued on CD on 22 January 2008.

In December 2008 she performed at the Apollo Theater at the closing of the concert Bricktop at the Apollo, hosted by film director [[Jordan Walker-Pearlman]].&lt;ref name=AllAfrica /&gt; She sang "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (song)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]".

In 2010, she was the subject of the documentary ''Sathima's Windsong'', directed by author and professor Daniel Yon.

In 2011 [[Duke University Press]] published ''Musical Echoes: South African Women Thinking in Jazz'', which was written by Benjamin and Carol Muller, a South African ethnomusicologist, over the course of twenty years.

She returned to Cape Town in 2011, where she continued to work as a vocalist. She died on 20 August 2013 at the age of 76.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2013/08/20/rip-sathima-bea-benjamin/ "RIP, Sathima Bea Benjamin"], ''Ottawa Citizen'', 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/9aee8b0040ccfd47bf70ffa58719f994/Jazz-songstress-Sathima-Bea-Benjamin-dies-20132108 "Jazz songstress Sathima Bea Benjamin dies"], SABC, 21 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllAfrica&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201308210658.html "South Africa: Jazz Singer, Composer Sathima Bea Benjamin Dies"], AllAfrica, 21 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Theodosius Edward Allesley Boughton''' (1760 – 30 August 1780) was the [[Rouse-Boughton baronets|7th Boughton baronet of Lawford]] who was poisoned by his brother-in-law in circumstances which made the case famous in its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bevan|first1=G. Phillips|title=Tourist's Guide to Warwickshire|date=1882|publisher=Edward Standford|location=London|isbn=0554808021}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 21, Boughton stood to inherit a fortune, which in the event of his death before that age would pass to his sister.

Boughton was confined to his bed by severe illness at Lawford Hall, [[Little Lawford]], near [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] where his mother and sister, Mrs Donellan wife of Captain John Donellan, were living. He died shortly after taking a draught from the hands of Lady Boughton complaining of the unpleasant taste.&lt;ref&gt;The Murder of Sir Theodosius Boughton; http://yearofdeaths.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/murder-of-sir-theodosius-boughton-1780.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After his body was exhumed on a suspicion of poisoning, a Coroner's inquest returned a verdict of murder against Captain Donellan. Captain Donellan, who was known as Diamond Donellan, because of a large diamond he had brought back from India, was tried, condemned and executed on 2 April 1781 &lt;ref&gt;John Donellan, Esq; http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng359.htm&lt;/ref&gt; for the crime although the evidence against him was solely circumstantial and he died solemnly protesting his innocence.&lt;ref name=Cooke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=Elizabeth|title=The damnation of John Donellan :a mysterious case of death and scandal in Georgian England|date=2011|publisher=Profile|isbn=9781846684821}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His widow subsequently married [[Leigh baronets|Sir Egerton Leigh Bt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Burke's Peerage''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Burke (barrister)|Peter Burke]] (1849), ''Celebrated Trials Connected with the Aristocracy in the Relations of Private Life''. William Benning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (2011) pp.227-229&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was inherited by a half cousin, (grandson of the 4th Baronet by his second wife Catherine&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (2011) p.87&lt;/ref&gt;), Sir Edward Boughton, 8th Baronet, who sold Lawford Hall (later demolished) and the Warwickshire estate in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (2011) pp.224-225&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6860">'''Therese Schroeder-Sheker''' is a musician, educator, clinician, and academic dean of the School of Music-Thanatology, which was housed at St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Montana from 1992 to 2002.

Schroeder-Sheker, using voice and harp, works as a music-thanatologist, a relatively new discipline, where the practitioner works with those who are actively dying (24&amp;ndash;48 hours) or have received a terminal diagnosis with a life expectancy of less than six months. The goals of music-thanatology include reduction of physical as well as emotional pain, creation of a supportive environment while dying, helping the patient become more conscious of their own death process, and changing the approach to death within established structures (hospices, hospitals, etc.). Schroeder-Sheker was honored by the '''New York Open Center''' [http://www.opencenter.org/] in 1997 for her "Music Thanatology". Her music has been used in documentaries and released commercially.

==CD and Video==

Schroeder-Sheker has produced numerous recorded works. Among those works are:

*''Celebrant: The Historical Harp'', (cassette tape),  Lady Reason Records. (1984)
*''The Queen's Minstrel'', (CD) [[Windham Hill Records]]. (1988), [[Valley Entertainment]]. (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valley-entertainment.com/the-queen-s-minstrel-2.html |title=The Queen's Minstrel |work=Valley Entertainment-Windham Hill Records |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Rosa Mystica'', Celestial Harmonies (1989)
*''In Dulci Jubilo (Sweet Joy)'' Celestial Harmonies (1991)
*''Inside the Miracle:  Enduring Illness, Approaching Wholeness'', spoken words by Mark Nepo. [[Parabola (magazine)|Parabola AudioTapes]] (1996)

'''Trance''' is an abnormal state of wakefulness in which a person is not self-aware and is either altogether unresponsive to external stimuli but is nevertheless capable of pursuing and realizing an aim, or is selectively responsive in following the directions of the person who has induced the trance. Trance states may occur involuntarily and unbidden.

The term ''trance'' may be associated with [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[flow (psychology)|flow]], and [[prayer]]. It may also be related to the earlier generic term, [[altered states of consciousness]], which is no longer used in "[[transpersonal psychology|consciousness studies]]" discourse.

==Etymology==

Trance in its modern meaning comes from an earlier meaning of "a dazed, half-conscious or insensible condition or state of fear", via the Old French ''transe'' "fear of evil", from the [[Latin]] ''transīre'' "to cross", "pass over". This definition is now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trance |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working models==

Wier, in his 1995 book, ''Trance: from magic to technology'', defines a simple trance (p.&amp;nbsp;58) as a state of mind being caused by cognitive loops where a cognitive object (thoughts, images, sounds, intentional actions) repeats long enough to result in various sets of disabled cognitive functions. Wier represents all trances (which include sleep and watching television) as taking place on a dissociated trance plane where at least some cognitive functions such as volition are disabled; as is seen in what is typically termed a 'hypnotic trance'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trance.edu/drupal/node/26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208040631/http://www.trance.edu/drupal/node/26 |archivedate=8 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this definition, meditation, hypnosis, addictions and charisma are seen as being trance states. In Wier's 2007 book, ''The Way of Trance'', he elaborates on these forms, adds ecstasy as an additional form and discusses the ethical implications of his model, including magic and government use which he terms "trance abuse".

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] in ''Rational Mysticism'' (2003) explores the neurological mechanisms and psychological implications of trances and other [[mystical]] manifestations. Horgan incorporates literature and case-studies from a number of disciplines in this work: [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[radiology]] and [[theology]].

==Working definitions==
The following are some examples of trance states:
* [[Incantation|Enchantment]]: a [[psychological]] state induced by (or as if induced by) a magical [[incantation]]
* A state of mind in which consciousness is fragile and voluntary action is poor or missing
* A state resembling deep [[sleep]]
* Capture: attract; cause to be enamored; "She/he captured all the men's hearts"; in the sense of entranced
* A condition of apparent sleep or unconsciousness, with marked physiological characteristics, in which the body of the subject is thought by certain people to be liable to [[spirit possession|possession]]
* An [[out-of-body experience]] in which one feels they have passed out of the body into another state of [[being]], a [[rapture]], an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]. In a general way, the entranced conditions thus defined are divided into varying degrees of a negative, [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] state, and into progressive gradations of a positive, conscious, illumining condition.
* A state of hyper or enhanced [[suggestibility]].
* An induced or [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]] sleep-like condition of an [[altered state of consciousness]], which is thought by certain people to permit the subject's physical body to be utilized by disembodied spirits or entities as a means of [[Symbolic expression|expression]]
* An altered state of awareness induced via [[hypnosis]] in which unconscious or dissociated responses to suggestion are enhanced in quality and increased in degree
* A state induced by the use of [[hypnosis]]; the person accepts the suggestions of the hypnotist
* A state of consciousness characterized by extreme [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] often to the point of appearing [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].

Trance conditions include all the different states of [[mind]], [[emotion]]s, [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and [[daydream]]s that human beings experience. All activities which engage a human involve the filtering of information coming into sense modalities, and this influences brain functioning and consciousness. Therefore, trance may be understood as a way for the mind to change the way it filters information in order to provide more efficient use of the mind's resources.

Trance states may also be accessed or induced by various [[wikt:modality|modalities]] and is a way of accessing the [[unconscious mind]] for the purposes of [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[healing]], [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]. There is an extensive documented history of trance as evidenced by the case-studies of anthropologists and ethnologists and associated and derivative disciplines. Hence trance may be perceived as endemic to the [[human condition]] and a [[cultural universal|Human Universal]]. Principles of trance are being explored and documented as are methods of trance induction. Benefits of trance states are being explored by medical and scientific inquiry. Many traditions and rituals employ trance. Trance also has a function in religion and mystical experience.

Castillo (1995) states that: "Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction. Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain and depend to a large extent on the characteristics of culture. Culture-specific organizations exist in the structure of individual neurons and in the organizational formation of neural networks."

Hoffman (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;9) states that: "Trance is still conventionally defined as a state of reduced [[consciousness]], or a somnolent state. However, the more recent [[anthropological]] definition, linking it to '[[altered states of consciousness]]' ([[Charles Tart]]), is becoming increasingly accepted."

Hoffman (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;9) asserts that: "...the trance state should be discussed in the plural, because there is more than one altered state of consciousness significantly different from everyday consciousness."

==Origins and history==

===Temple of Epidaurus: healing sleep===
According to Hoffman (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;10), [[pilgrims]] visited the [[Temple]] of [[Epidaurus]], an [[asclepeion]], in [[Greece]] for healing sleep. Seekers of healing would make [[pilgrimage]] and be received by a [[priest]] who would welcome and [[blessing|bless]] them. This temple housed an ancient [[religious]] [[ritual]] promoting [[dreams]] in the seeker that endeavored to promote healing and the solutions to problems, as did the [[oracles]]. This temple was built in honor of [[Asclepios]], the Greek god of medicine. The Greek treatment was referred to as [[incubation (ritual)|incubation]], and focused on [[prayers]] to Asclepios for healing. The [[asclepion]] at [[Epidaurus]] is both extensive and well-preserved, and is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of [[Asclepius]]. (For a comparable modern tool see [[Dreamwork]].)

The [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] was also famous for trances in the ancient Greek world;  priestesses there would make [[divination|predictions about the future]] in exchange for [[gold]].

===Oral lore and storytelling===
Stories of the [[saints]] in the [[Middle Ages]], [[mythology|myths]], [[parables]], [[fairy tales]], [[oral lore]] and [[storytelling]] from different cultures are themselves potentially inducers of trance. Often [[rhetorical device|literary devices]] such as [[repetition (rhetorical)|repetition]] are employed which is evident in many forms of trance induction. [[Milton Erickson]] used stories to induce trance as do many [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]] practitioners.

===Military===
From at least the 16th century it was held that [[march music]] may induce soldiers marching in unison into trance states where according to apologists, they bond together as a unit engendered by the rigors of training, the ties of comradeship and the chain of command. This had the effect of making the soldiers become automated, an effect which was widely evident in the 16th, 17th and 18th century due to the increasing prevalence of firearms employed in warcraft. Military instruments, especially the [[snare drum]] and other drums were used to entone a monotonous [[ostinato]] at the pace of march and heartbeat. High-pitched [[fife (musical instrument)|fifes]], [[flute]]s and [[bagpipe]]s were used for their "piercing" effect to play the melody. This would assist the morale and solidarity of soldiers as they marched to battle.

[[Joseph Jordania]] recently proposed a term battle trance for this mental state, when [[combatant]]s do not feel [[fear]] and [[pain]], and when they lose their [[Personal identity|individual identity]] and acquire a [[collective identity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jordania]], [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berserker|Norse Berserkers]] induced a trance-like state before battle, called ''Berserkergang''. It is said to have given the warriors superhuman strength and made them impervious to pain during battle. This form of trance could have been induced partly due to ingestion of [[Amanita muscaria|hallucinogenic mushrooms]].

===Mystics===
As the mystical experience of [[mysticism|mystics]] generally entails direct connection, communication and communion with [[Deity]], Godhead and/or [[god]]; trance and cognate experience are endemic. (see [[Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Shaman]], [[Umbanda]], [[Crazy Horse]], etc.)

As shown by [[Jonathan Garb]],&lt;ref&gt;(Shamanic Trance in Modern Kabbalah, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; trance techniques also played a role in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the mystical life of the circle of [[Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto]] and [[Hasidism]].

===Christian mystics===
Many [[Christian mystics]] are documented as having experiences that may be considered as cognate with trance, such as: [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[John of the Cross]], [[Meister Eckhart]], Saint Theresa (as seen in the Bernini sculpture) and [[Francis of Assisi]].

===Mesmer and the origin of hypnotherapy===
* [[Mesmer]], an influential but discredited promoter of trance states and their curative powers.
* [[Milton Erickson]], the founder of [[hypnotherapy]] who died in 1980, introduced trance and hypnosis to orthodox medicine and psychotherapy—hypnosis here is something different from traditional [[clinical hypnosis]].

===Trance in American Christianity===
[[Ann Taves|Taves]] (1999) charts the synonymic language of trance in the American Christian traditions: ''power'' or ''presence'' or ''indwelling'' of God, or Christ, or the Spirit, or spirits. Typical expressions include "the indwelling of the Spirit" ([[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]), "the witness of the Spirit" ([[John Wesley]]), "the power of God" (early American [[Methodists]]), being "filled with the Spirit of the Lord" (early [[Adventists]]; see [[charismatic Adventism]]), "communing with spirits" ([[Spiritualists]]), "the Christ within" ([[New Thought]]), "streams of holy fire and power" (Methodist [[Holiness movement|holiness]]), "a religion of the Spirit and Power" (the [[Emmanuel Movement]]), and "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" (early [[Pentecostal]]s). (Taves, 1999: 3)

===Trance and Anglo-American Protestants===
Taves (1999) well-referenced book on trance charts the experience of Anglo-American Protestants and those who left the Protestant movement beginning with the transatlantic awakening in the early 18th century and ending with the rise of the [[psychology of religion]] and the birth of [[Pentecostalism]] in the early 20th century. This book focuses on a class of seemingly involuntary acts alternately explained in [[religious]] and [[secular]] terminology. These involuntary experiences include uncontrolled bodily movements ([[Seizure|fits]], bodily exercises, falling as dead, [[catalepsy]], [[convulsions]]); spontaneous vocalizations (crying out, shouting, [[speaking in tongues]]); unusual sensory experiences (trances, [[hallucination|visions]], voices, [[clairvoyance]], [[out-of-body experiences]]); and alterations of [[consciousness]] and/or [[memory]] ([[dream]]s, [[wikt:somnium|somnium]], [[somnambulism]], mesmeric trance, mediumistic trance, [[hypnosis]], [[spirit possession|possession]], alternating personality) (Taves, 1999: 3).

==Trance induction and sensory modality==
Trance-like states are often interpreted as [[religious ecstasy]] or [[vision (religion)|visions]] and can be deliberately induced using a variety of techniques, including [[prayer]], [[religious ritual]]s, [[meditation]], [[pranayama]] ([[breathwork]] or breathing exercises), [[physical exercise]], [[coitus]] (and/or [[sex]]), [[music]], [[dancing]], [[sweating]] (e.g. [[sweat lodge]]), [[fasting]], [[thirst]]ing, and the consumption of [[psychotropic]] drugs such as [[spiritual use of cannabis|cannabis]]. [[Sensory modality]] is the [[Mediumship|channel]] or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for the induction of the trance. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place in occasion of contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely [[beauty|beautiful]] or [[holy]]. It may also happen without any known reason. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually one that is associated with that individual's particular [[religious]] and [[cultural]] [[traditions]]. As a result, an ecstatic experience is usually interpreted within the context of a particular individual's religious and cultural traditions. These interpretations often include statements about contact with [[supernatural]] or [[spiritual beings]], about receiving new information as a [[revelation]], also religion-related explanations of subsequent change of [[values]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behavior]] (e.g. in case of [[religious conversion]]).

Benevolent, neutral and malevolent trances may be induced (intentionally, spontaneously and/or accidentally) by different methods:
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] by [[chanting]], auditory [[story telling]], [[mantra]], [[overtone singing]], [[drum]]ming, [[music]], etc.;,
* [[Kinesthetic]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[feeling]] and movement through the [[Laban Movement Analysis|kinesphere]] by [[ecstatic dance]], [[story telling]] by movement, [[mudra]], embodying [[ritual]]s, [[yoga]], [[breathwork]], [[oxygen]] deprivation, sexual stimulation etc.;
* Visual: driving through the [[sense]] of [[Visual perception|sight]] by [[yantra]], visual [[story telling]], [[mandala]], [[film|cinema]], [[theater]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[beauty]], [[strobe lights]], [[form constants]], [[symmetry]];
* [[Olfactory]]: driving via [[scent]] through the [[sense]] of [[olfaction|smell]] by [[perfume]], [[pheromones]], [[incense]], [[flowers]], [[pollen]], indeed any scent for which we have an association or memory, etc.;
* [[Gustatory]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[taste]] and [[indigestion]]; including: [[starvation]], [[herbs]], [[hallucinogens]] and [[drugs]]. As the intake of food and beverage entails intra-bodily chemical reactions through [[digestion]], some infer that all food may be considered medicine or drugs and therefore contribute to the induction of discernible psycho-physical states (see [[Ancient Medicine]]). Trance states can be attained through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drugs]], particularly [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], such as [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[Peyote]], [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[MDMA]].
* Disciplines: [[Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]]; [[meditation]];
* Miscellaneously: [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] accident, [[sleep deprivation]], [[nitrogen narcosis]] (deep diving), [[fever]], by the use of a [[sensory deprivation]] tank or mind-control techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]];
* Naturally occurring: [[dreams]], [[lucid dreaming|lucid dreams]], [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], [[ecstasy (state)|ecstasy]], [[psychosis]] as well as purported [[premonitions]], [[out-of-body experience]]s, and [[Mediumship|channeling]].

===Auditory driving and auditory art===
[[Charles Tart]] provides a useful working definition of auditory driving. It is the induction of trance through the sense of hearing. Auditory driving works through a process known as [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The usage of repetitive [[rhythms]] to induce trance states is an ancient phenomenon. Throughout the [[world]], shamanistic practitioners have been employing this method for [[millennia]]. [[Anthropologists]] and other researchers have documented the similarity of shamanistic auditory driving [[rituals]] among different cultures.

Said simply, entrainment is the synchronization of different rhythmic cycles. Breathing and heart rate have been shown to be affected by auditory stimulus, along with brainwave activity. The ability of rhythmic sound to affect human brainwave activity, especially [[theta rhythm|theta brainwaves]], is the essence of auditory driving, and is the cause of the altered states of consciousness that it can induce.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Visual driving and visual art===

Nowack and Feltman have recently published an article entitled "Eliciting the Photic Driving Response" which states that the EEG photic driving response is a sensitive neurophysiological measure which has been employed to assess chemical and drug effects, forms of epilepsy, neurological status of Alzheimer's patients, and physiological arousal. Photic driving also impacts upon the psychological climate of a person by producing increased visual imagery and decreased physiological and subjective arousal. In this research by Nowack and Feltman, all participants reported increased visual imagery during photic driving, as measured by their responses to an imagery questionnaire.

Dennis Wier (https://web.archive.org/web/20060915232957/http://www.trance.edu/papers/theory.htm Accessed: 6 December 2006) states that over two millennia ago [[Ptolemy]] and [[Apuleius]] found that differing rates of flickering lights affected states of awareness and sometimes induced epilepsy. Wier also asserts that it was discovered in the late 1920s that when light was shined on closed eyelids it resulted in an echoing production of brainwave frequencies. Wier also opined that in 1965 Grey employed a [[stroboscope]] to project rhythmic light flashes into the eyes at a rate of 10–25&amp;nbsp;Hz (cycles per second). Grey discovered that this stimulated similar brainwave activity.

Research by [[Thomas Budzynski]], [[Oestrander]] et al., in the use of brain machines suggest that [[photic]] driving via the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] and direct electrical stimulation and driving via other mechanisms and modalities, may [[entrainment (physics)|entrain]] processes of the brain facilitating [[learning theory (education)|rapid and enhanced learning]], produce deep [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], an increase in [[creativity]], [[problem solving]] propensity and may be associated with enhanced concentration and accelerated learning. The [[theta rhythm|theta]] range and the border area between [[alpha wave|alpha]] and [[theta rhythm|theta]] has generated considerable research interest.

===Kinesthetic driving and somatic art===
[[Charles Tart]] provides a useful working definition of [[kinesthetic]] driving. It is the induction of trance through the [[sense]] of [[touch]], [[feeling]] or [[emotions]]. Kinesthetic driving works through a process known as [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]].

The [[rituals]] practiced by some [[sportsperson|athletes]] in preparing for contests are dismissed as [[superstition]], but this is a [[tool|device]] of [[sport psychologist]]s to help them to attain an ecstasy-like state. [[Joseph Campbell]] had a peak experience whilst [[running]]. [[Roger Bannister]] on breaking the four-minute mile (Cameron, 1993: 185): "No longer conscious of my movement, I discovered a new unity with nature. I had found a new source of power and beauty, a source I never dreamt existed." Roger Bannister later became a distinguished [[neurologist]].

Mechanisms and [[discipline]]s that include kinesthetic driving may include: [[dancing]], [[walking meditation]], [[yoga]] and [[asana]], [[mudra]], [[juggling]], [[poi (juggling)]], etc.

[[Sufism]] (the [[mystical]] branch of [[Islam]]) has [[theoretical]] and [[metaphoric]] [[writing|texts]] regarding [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] as a state of connection with [[Allah]]. [[Sufi]] practice [[rituals]] (''[[dhikr]]'', ''[[sema]]'') use body movement and music to achieve the state.

==Types and varieties==
* ''[[Maenads]]'' and ''[[Bacchae]]'': in [[Greek mythology]], ''Maenads'' were female [[worshipper]]s of [[Dionysus]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god of [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery]], [[wine]] and [[substance intoxication|intoxication]], and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. The word literally translates as "raving ones". They were known as wild, insane women who could not be reasoned with. The mysteries of Dionysus inspired the women to [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] frenzy; they indulged in copious amounts of violence, bloodletting, sexual activity, self-intoxication, and mutilation. They were usually pictured as crowned with [[vine]] leaves, clothed in [[deer|fawnskins]] and carrying the [[thyrsus]], and dancing with wild abandon. They were also characterized as entranced women, wandering through the forests and hills.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles, David (2000). ''Greek Theatre Performance: An Introduction''. Cambridge University Press. Source: [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052164027X]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Maenads'' were also known as ''Bassarids'' (or ''Bacchae'' or ''Bacchantes'') in [[Roman mythology]], after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to wear a [[fox]]-skin, a ''bassaris''.
* [[berserker|Norse berserkers]] were said to have often entered battle entrenched in a state of primal rage, biting their shields and howling like wolves. This fanaticism was so powerful that they were known to continue fighting even after having lost limbs or being otherwise deeply wounded.
* ''[[Samādhi]]'': [[yoga]] provides techniques to attain a state of [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] called ''samādhi''. According to practitioners, there are various stages of ecstasy, the highest of which is called ''[[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa samādhi]]''. Different traditions have different understanding of ''Samādhi''.
* ''[[Bhakti]]'': ([[Devanāgarī]]: भक्ति) is a word of Sanskrit origin meaning "devotion" and also "the path of devotion" itself, as in ''[[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti-yoga]]''. Within [[Hinduism]] the word is used exclusively to denote devotion to a particular [[deity]] or form of [[God]]. Within [[Vaishnavism]] ''bhakti'' is only used in conjunction with [[Vishnu]] or one of his associated [[incarnation]]s, it is likewise used towards [[Shiva]] by followers of [[Shaivism]]. Saints in these traditions exhibit different trance states or ecstasy.
* ''[[Agape]]'' or "Divine Love": the term ''agape'' appears in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' twice, where the word describes something that creates contentedness within the speaker.
* Communion: In the [[monotheistic]] [[tradition]], [[religious ecstasy]] is usually associated with communion and [[henosis|oneness]] with [[God]]. Indeed, ecstasy is the primary vehicle for the type of [[prophetic]] [[hallucination|visions]] and [[revelation]]s found in the [[Bible]]. However, such experiences can also be personal [[mystical]] experiences with no significance to anyone but the person experiencing them.
* [[Rapture]] or [[religious ecstasy]]: is an [[altered state of consciousness]] characterized by greatly reduced external [[awareness]] and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness which is frequently accompanied by [[hallucination|visions]] and emotional/intuitive (and sometimes physical) [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]. Although the experience is usually brief in physical time, there are records of such experiences lasting several days or even more, and of recurring experiences of ecstasy during one's lifetime. [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] [[perception]] of [[time]], [[space]] and/or [[self (philosophy)|self]] may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy.
* [[Peak experiences]]: is a term developed by [[Abraham Maslow]] and used to describe certain extra-personal and [[ecstatic states]], particularly ones tinged with themes of unification, [[harmonization]] and [[Oneness (metaphysics)|interconnectedness]]. Participants characterize these experiences, and the revelations imparted therein, as possessing an ineffably [[mystical]] (or overtly [[religious]]) quality or essence.
* In [[Christianity]], the ecstatic experiences of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 10:10, 11:5 and 22:17.
* Some [[Charismatic movement|charismatic Christians]] practice ecstatic states (called, e.g., "being [[slain in the Spirit]]") and interpret these as given by the [[Holy Spirit]].
* In [[hagiography]] (writings on the subject of Christian [[saint]]s) many instances are recorded in which saints are granted ecstasies. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05277a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ecstasy|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; religious ecstasy (called ''supernatural ecstasy'') includes two elements: one, interior and invisible, in which the mind rivets its attention on a religious subject, and another, corporeal and visible, in which the activity of the senses is suspended, reducing the effect of external sensations upon the subject and rendering him or her resistant to awakening.
* Trance states have also long been used by [[shamans]], [[mysticism|mystics]], and [[fakirs]] in [[healing]] [[rituals]], being particularly cultivated in some [[religions]], such as [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Australian shamanism has been observed&lt;ref&gt;Lawlor (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;374) states that:
"The supernormal, super sensory powers of Aboriginal wise woman and men of high degree, by their own accounts, comes directly from initiations administered by the ancestral sky heroes themselves and by the totemic spirits. Those who have gone through these initiations alone, in a deep trance that makes them lose their personal identities and confront manifestations of the ancestral powers, are held in the highest regard."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawlor (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;303) states that: "One such animal dance ceremony was observed and photographed by Gillen and Spencer. More than 30 naked men gathered in a large circle. One by one, each man performed the dance of the animal to be hunted while the others sang and slapped their buttocks to create a percussive beat for the dancer. The slapping sound was so loud that it could be heard for miles across the surrounding desert. The dance continued for hours, with each man dancing frenetically until he dropped from exhaustion. The eyes of the onlookers soon became glazed with entrancement; their penises were erect in a state of ecstatic arousal. Finally, after the last man had performed the animal dance and collapsed in exhaustion, the entire group leaped on him, emitting a loud abandoned cry. The next day the hunt began."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination==
[[Divination]] is a cultural universal which [[anthropologists]] have observed as being present in many [[religions]] and [[cultures]] in all ages up to the present day (see [[sibyl]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Divination may be defined as a mechanism for [[fortune-telling]] by ascertaining information by interpretation of [[omens]] or an alleged supernatural agency. Divination often entails [[ritual]], and is often facilitated by trance.

In [[Tibet]], [[oracle]]s have played, and continue to play, an important part in [[religion]] and [[government]]. The word ''oracle'' is used by Tibetans to refer to the [[spirit]], [[deity]] or [[entity]] that enters those men and women who act as [[mediumship|media]] between the natural and the spiritual realms. The media are, therefore, known as ''kuten'', which literally means, "the physical basis".

The [[Dalai Lama]], who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the ''[[Nechung Oracle]]'', which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. He gives a complete description of the process of trance and possession in his book ''Freedom in Exile''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205234136/http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |archivedate=5 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific disciplines==
Convergent disciplines of [[neuroanthropology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[neurotheology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], amongst others, are conducting research into the trance induction of [[altered states of consciousness]] resulting from [[brainwave entrainment|neuron entrainment]] with the driving of sensory modalities, for example [[polyharmonics]], [[multiphonics]], and [[percussive]] [[polyrhythms]] through the channel of the auditory and [[kinesthetic]] [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]].

[[Neuroanthropology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] are conducting research into the trance induction of [[altered states of consciousness]] (possibly engendering [[higher consciousness]]) resulting from [[neuron]] firing [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]] with these [[polyharmonics]] and [[multiphonics]]. Related research has been conducted into neural entraining with [[percussive]] [[polyrhythms]]. The [[timbre]] of traditional singing bowls and their [[polyrhythms]] and [[multiphonics]] are considered meditative and calming, and the harmony inducing effects of this [[tool]] to potentially alter consciousness are being explored by scientists, medical professionals and therapists.

==Brainwaves and brain rhythms==

{{see also|Neural oscillation}}

Scientific advancement and new technologies such as computerized [[EEG]], [[positron emission tomography]], regional cerebral blood flow, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, are providing measurable tools to assist in understanding trance phenomena.

Though a source of contention, there appear to be three current streams of inquiry: [[neurophysiology]], [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive behaviorism]]. The [[neurophysiological]] approach is awaiting the development of a mechanism to map physiological measurements to human thought. The social-psychological approach currently measures gross subjective and social effects of thoughts and some critique it for lack of precision. Cognitive behaviorialists employ [[systems theory]] concepts and analytical techniques.

There are four principal brainwave states that range from high-amplitude, low-frequency delta to low-amplitude, high-frequency beta. These states range from deep dreamless sleep to a state of high arousal. These four brainwave states are common throughout humans. All levels of brainwaves exist in everyone at all times, even though one is foregrounded depending on the activity level. When a person is in an aroused state and exhibiting a beta brainwave pattern, their brain also exhibits a component of alpha, theta and delta, even though only a trace may be present.

The University of Philadelphia study on some Christians at the Freedom Valley Worship Center in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], revealed that [[glossolalia]]-speaking (vocalizing or praying in unrecognizable form of language which is seen in members of certain Christian sects) activates areas of the brain out of voluntary control. In addition, the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain, which monitors speech, significantly diminished in activity as the study participants spoke glossolalia. Dr. [[Andrew B. Newberg]], in analysis of his earlier studies as opposed to the [[MRI scans]] of the test subjects, stated that Buddhist monks in meditation and Franciscan nuns in prayer exhibited increased activity in the frontal lobe, and subsequently their behaviors, very much under voluntary control. The investigation found this particular beyond-body-control characteristic only in tongue-speakers (also see [[xenoglossia]]).

A '''trophic function''' was first introduced in the differential equations of the [[Kolmogorov]] predator–prey model. It generalizes the linear case of predator–prey interaction firstly described by Volterra and Lotka in the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]]. A trophic function represents the consumption of prey assuming a given number of predators. The trophic function (also referred to as the [[functional response]]) was widely applied in chemical kinetics, biophysics, mathematical physics and economics. In economics, "predator" and "prey" become various economic parameters such as prices and outputs of goods in various linked sectors such as processing and supply. These relationships, in turn, were found to behave similarly to the magnitudes in chemical kinetics, where the molecular analogues of predators and prey react chemically with each other.

These inter-disciplinary findings suggest the universal character of trophic functions and the predator–prey models in which they appear. They give general principles for the dynamic interactions of objects of different natures, so that the mathematical models worked out in one science may be applied to another. Trophic functions have proven useful in forecasting temporarily{{clarify|reason=Do you mean temporarily, temporally, or something else?|date=April 2015}} stable conditions ([[limit cycle]]s and/or [[attractor]]s) of the coupled dynamics of [[predator]] and [[prey]]. The [[Pontryagin]] L.S. theorem{{clarify|reason=This theorem is not findable by google. Is LS the name of the theorem?|date=April 2015}} on the inflection points of trophic functions guarantees the existence of a limit cycle in these systems.

Trophic functions are especially important in situations of chaos, when one has numerous interacting magnitudes and objects, as is particularly true in global economics. To define and forecast the dynamics in this case is scarcely possible with linear methods, but non-linear dynamic analysis involving trophic functions leads to the discovery of limit cycles or attractors. Since in nature there exist only temporarily stable objects, such limit cycles and attractors must exist in the dynamics of observed natural objects (chemistry, flora and fauna, economics, cosmology). The general theory suggests as-yet-unknown regularities in the dynamics of the various systems surrounding us.

Despite the success already achieved in research on trophic functions, the field still has great further theoretical potential and practical importance. Global economics, for instance, needs tools to forecast the dynamics of outputs and prices over a scale of at least 3–5 years so as to maintain stable demand and not over-produce, and to prevent crises such as that of 2008.

'''Zond 5''', a member of the Soviet [[Zond program]], was an unmanned spacecraft that in September 1968 became the second ship to travel to and circle the [[Moon]], and the first to return safely to Earth. Although unmanned, Zond 5 carried the first [[Earthling]]s to reach the Moon, including two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, plants, and other lifeforms, and was also the first to return Moon travelers safely to Earth.

Zond 5, a version of the [[Soyuz 7K-L1]] manned Moon-flyby spacecraft, was launched by a [[Proton-K]] carrier rocket with a [[Blok D]] upper stage to conduct scientific studies during its lunar [[Planetary flyby|flyby]].

==The moon flight==
After [[Zond 4]]'s partial success in March 1968, a follow-up was launched on April 22. The launch failed however when the LES sent an erroneous abort command at T+260 seconds and shut down the Proton booster's second stage. The escape rocket fired and pulled the descent module to safety. In July, another 7K-L1 was being prepared for launch when the Block D stage exploded on the pad, killing three people, but leaving the Proton booster and spacecraft with only minor damage.

Zond 5 launched on September 14 and became the first spacecraft to circle the Moon and return to land on Earth. On September 18, the spacecraft flew around the Moon. The closest distance was 1,950&amp;nbsp;km. High-quality photographs of the Earth were taken at a distance of 90,000&amp;nbsp;km. A biological payload of two [[Russian tortoise]]s, [[wine fly|wine flies]], [[mealworm]]s, [[plant]]s, [[seed]]s, [[bacteria]], and other living matter was included in the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1968-076A|title=Zond 5 Spacecraft Details|publisher=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, the reentry capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere but could not perform a [[skip reentry]] due to a failure of the guidance system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/lunarl1.htm |title=Lunar L1 |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705074647/http://www.astronautix.com/project/lunarl1.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Soviet Space Race with Apollo, Asif Siddiqi, pp 655-656&lt;/ref&gt; Landing was supposed to occur in Kazakhstan, but instead Zond 5 [[splashdown|splashed down]] in the Indian Ocean and was successfully recovered by the USSR recovery vessels ''Borovichy'' and ''Vasiliy Golovin''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QdBP8E4di0sC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=zond+5+Borovichy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kgIETdSo70&amp;sig=BefzLjM5VnjTGUalEG9yToip_RQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UEn_TO2qK5TksQPVqIWwCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=zond%205%20Borovichy&amp;f=false "Zond 5, Recovery Ship, Miss Distance"], ''Red Moon By Michael Cassutt - page 320, Recovery Ship and Miss Distance.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Alias=Zond%2005&amp;Letter=Z&amp;Display=ReadMore "Zond 5, Landing Point, Miss Distance"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021949/https://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Alias=Zond%2005&amp;Letter=Z&amp;Display=ReadMore |date=September 27, 2011 }}, ''NASA Solar System Exploration - Zond 5, Landing Point, Miss Distance.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Pavlenko (Олег Павленко), [http://niskgd.ru/mix/p9/zond.htm Из истории Морского космического флота.

Although the ballistic reentry would have been bad for human occupants, it did not appear to affect the biological specimens, all of which were alive and well when the descent module was finally opened four days after landing. It was announced that the tortoises had lost about 10 percent of their body weight but remained active and showed no loss of appetite. This spacecraft was planned as a precursor to a manned lunar spacecraft. 

The [[USS McMorris (DE-1036)|USS ''McMorris'']] was shadowing the Soviet recovery ships, collecting intelligence information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1302/1 "Chasing the Zond"], by Dwayne A. Day. ''The Space Review'', February 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs taken by the ''McMorris'' of the descent module bobbing in the ocean aroused concern at [[NASA]] that the Soviets were planning a manned circumlunar flight soon, especially since the [[United States]] had been tracking Zond 5 for its entire flight, and was a catalyst for the decision to launch [[Apollo 8]] to the Moon in December instead of its originally planned mission of testing the [[lunar module]] in high Earth orbit.

The Zond 5 return capsule is on display at the [[RKK Energiya museum]], in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/r/russialocatnedspacecraft.html|title=Russia: Location of Russian Manned Spacecraft|publisher=Astronautix|access-date=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
