'''Abortion in Panama''' is illegal except in instances that the pregnancy is life-threatening or the health of the woman is at risk, or if the pregnancy is the result of [[rape]] or [[incest]].

== History ==
A penal code was set in place on September 22, 1982, which penalized illegal abortions. This code is still active today.

In 2005, a poll was conducted with a simple questionnaire. One of the questions asked, "Do you agree or disagree with abortion?" 89.4% of those that answered were against abortions.&lt;ref name="pop.org"&gt;http://www.pop.org/00000000147/the-epidemiology-of-abortion-in-pro-life-panama{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CIA, based upon the population as a whole, 85% of  Panamanians are against abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pm.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately four-fifths of Panama's population practices [[Roman Catholicism]], which has as its official stance that abortion is murder.

== Legality ==
In Panama, abortion is illegal with the exception of two circumstances: if the mother's life is endangered by the pregnancy, or if she is the victim of rape or incest.

==Penalties for abortion==
The punishment for a woman who has an illegal abortion is one to three years in prison. The punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure with the woman's consent is 3 to 6 years in prison. If the procedure is done without the woman's consent, the punishment is 5 to 10 years in prison. If the woman dies as a result of the abortion, the punishment for the abortionist is 5–10 years in prison. If the woman's husband is found guilty of performing the abortion, the penalties are increased by one sixth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/panama.doc |title=Abortion Policy |publisher=[[United Nations Population Division]] |accessdate=2010-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220044912/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/panama.doc |archivedate=2006-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to abortion facilities==
The only abortions allowed to be performed are done by doctors in government-run hospitals.&lt;ref name="pop.org"/&gt;

==Alternatives to abortion==

===Contraceptives===
Condoms, [[tubal ligation]], and some [[intrauterine devices]] (IUDs) are available at no cost to a woman. Other forms of contraception that require a fee, such as other IUDs and chemical drugs (like the Depo shot), are available, but the woman does not need to get a prescription to obtain them.&lt;ref name="pop.org"/&gt;

===Family planning===
In 1965, the Asociación Panameña para el Planeamiento de la Familia, or (APLAFA), was founded to help women control the size of their families. A private family planning group, APLAFA has gone to great lengths not just to reduce the rate of teen pregnancy, but also to aid pregnant women with pre- and post-natal care for their unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/panama.doc {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401064655/https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/panama.doc |date=April 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panamanian government has also played a constructive role in the family planning movement. It offers services which teach couples about natural birth control methods (such as the ovulation method, the symptothermal method, and the rhythm method),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/women/contraceptive/126.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615041506/http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/women/contraceptive/126.html |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as modern methods, which many know as "the pill", shots, patches, sterilization, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2004/pr0414tx.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115224040/http://www.census.gov.ph//data/pressrelease/2004/pr0414tx.html |archivedate=2009-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6165">'''Aidchild''', a [[not-for-profit]] organization incorporated in both [[Uganda]] and the [[United States]], was established in 2000 as a [[hospice]] center for [[orphan]]s living with [[AIDS]] who did not have the care of extended family members.  In 2002, it became the first [[pediatric]] facility in Uganda to provide free [[anti-retroviral]] drugs to children. Today,{{When|date=May 2012}}  more than 3,000 children have received care and treatment through Aidchild's inpatient and outpatient services, including a laboratory, two clinics, homes and academies in [[Masaka]] and [[Mpigi]], Uganda.

Aidchild is supported by a mix of government and private donors and income-generating activities.

==History==
Aidchild was founded by Nathaniel Dunigan.  
Dunigan first visited Uganda when he was Deputy Director of the Office of the Governor in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;ref name=tucsoncitizen&gt;{{cite news|last=Vanderson|first=Jessie|title=Out of Africa|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2001/03/22/166614-out-of-africa/ |accessdate=25 April 2012|newspaper=Tucson Citizen|date=22 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A one-month assignment as a volunteer HIV-prevention educator had taken him to Africa where he met many children who were suffering and dying.  On his return to the US, he resolved to make a difference, and completed a feasibility study for his Aidchild concept. At the age of 26, he resigned from his job, sold his car and belongings, and moved to Uganda.&lt;ref name=profiles/&gt; He had an initial budget of just $3,500.  Two years later, Aidchild was chosen by the Ugandan and American governments as a model of pediatric HIV/AIDS care for the entire continent of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aim.jsi.com/Docs/annual_report_2003.pdf|publisher=The AIDS/HIV Integrated Model District Programme|title= Annual Report 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A second center was created just after that, as was a treatment laboratory that has served the needs of more than 3,000 children and adults living with AIDS.

==Social entrepreneurship==
Aidchild operates the Equation Gallery, an art gallery and café on the [[Equator]] line in Uganda; Ten Tables, a restaurant and screening room in [[Masaka]], and Aidchild's Terrace Club, a rooftop barbecue venue and boutique hostel.&lt;ref name=profiles/&gt;  International travel guides have called the businesses the very best in the whole of Eastern and Central Africa.  Clients include international celebrities, Ambassadors, and UN personnel.  [[Lonely Planet]] calls Aidchild's Equation Café “first class,” and Oscar winner [[Emma Thompson]] says it is “possibly the best shop on the planet”.  The [[Eye (magazine)|''Eye'' magazine]] named Aidchild’s restaurant the best in the nation in 2008.

The organization earns 70% of its own budget from these businesses, and is 100% administratively self-sustained thanks to a Ugandan management team.&lt;ref name=profiles/&gt;

==Nathaniel Dunigan==
Dr. Nathaniel Dunigan was raised on the [[Navajo reservation]] in the [[southwestern United States]].&lt;ref name=tucsoncitizen/&gt;

;Work in the United States
Dunigan has testified before the United States Congress in Washington, DC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Africa|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/intlrel/hfa78801.000/hfa78801_0f.htm|publisher=United States Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an expert witness in the identification of best practices of care for orphans living with AIDS, and other vulnerable children in Africa.  In 2004, Dunigan was nominated for the World of Children Award. He is the author of "We Are Not Mahogany: Three stories about the male African life." &lt;ref&gt;''We Are Not Mahogany: Three stories about the male African life''. {{ISBN|978-1-4993-3765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After living in rural Uganda for nine years, Dunigan completed a master's degree in education at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], specializing in Human Development and Psychology,&lt;ref name=profiles&gt;{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Jill|title=From One to Many: Master’s Student Nathaniel Dunigan|url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news-impact/2009/12/from-one-to-many-masters-student-nathaniel-dunigan/|accessdate=21 April 2012|newspaper=Harvard Graduate School of Education|date=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a PhD in Leadership and Education at the [[University of San Diego]]’s [[School of Leadership and Education Sciences]] (SOLES) where he was the Dammeyer Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Profile|url=http://www.sandiego.edu/soles/programs/leadership_studies/current_student_profiles/doc_student_profiles.php#dunigan|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a Reynolds Fellow in Social Entrepreneurship at the [[Harvard Kennedy School]]'s [[Center for Public Leadership]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunigan |first=Nathaniel |title=My Path to the Reynolds Fellowship |url=http://64.151.79.128/?p=134 |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School |accessdate=21 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208135132/http://64.151.79.128/?p=134 |archivedate=8 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and winner of the 2010 Harvard HDP Marshal Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honors Awarded at 2010 Convocation Ceremony|url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news-impact/2010/05/honors-awarded-at-2010-convocation-ceremony/|accessdate=21 April 2012|newspaper=Harvard Graduate School of Education|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Current work
Dunigan now divides his time between Uganda and Florida in his role as Chief Executive Officer of Aidchild.

Dunigan has personally adopted more than 100 children in Uganda. He and the Ugandan staff continue to receive new children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''''Angelica sinensis''''', commonly known as '''''dong quai''''' or "'''female [[ginseng]]'''" is a herb from the family [[Apiaceae]], indigenous to [[China]]. ''Angelica sinensis'' grows in cool high altitude mountains in China, Japan, and Korea. The yellowish brown root of the plant is harvested in fall and is a well-known Chinese medicine used over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dong quai|url=http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/dong-quai|website=University of Maryland Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
{{medical citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}

===Use in traditional Chinese medicine===

The dried root of ''A. sinensis'' is commonly known as Chinese angelica ({{zh|t={{linktext|當歸}}|p=dāngguī|poj=tong-kui}})  and is widely used in [[Chinese traditional medicine]] for women's health, cardiovascular conditions, [[osteoarthrosis]], [[inflammation]], [[headache]], [[infections]], mild [[anemia]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[high blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelica sinensis / Dong Quai|url=https://www.goldenlotusherbs.com/index.php?pageid=2&amp;itemid=113|website=Golden Lotus Botanicals}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref name=Medline /&gt; The dong quai (當歸) means that a husband shall return to his wife, which is implicitly said to help women's sexual health.

''Dong quai'' is used for menopause vasomotor symptoms such as [[hot flashes]]. However, a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial showed that ''dong quai'' was no more effective than placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirata|first1=Janie D|title=Does dong quai have estrogenic effects in postmenopausal women? A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.|pmid=9418683|volume=68|issue=6|date=Dec 1997|journal=Fertil Steril|pages=981–6|doi=10.1016/s0015-0282(97)00397-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential anti-osteoporotic effects of ''dong quai'' independent of any estrogen mechanism were evaluated in [[rat model]]s which showed that the extract of ''A. sinensis'' may prevent bone loss. However, more high quality human evidence is needed to confirm same anti-osteoporotic effects of ''dong quai'' in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=Dong Wook|title=Anti-Osteoporotic Effects of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels Extract on Ovariectomized Rats and Its Oral Toxicity in Rats.|pmid=25325255|doi=10.3390/nu6104362|volume=6|issue=10|date=Oct 2014|journal=Nutrients|pages=4362–72|pmc=4210922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dong quai'' contains a chemical compound called [[butylidenephthalide]] which has [[antispasmodic]] activity ''[[in vitro]]'' and might relieve [[dysmenorrhoea]] muscle cramps by relaxing the uterus muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WC|first1=Ko|title=A newly isolated antispasmodic--butylidenephthalide|pmid=7401411|volume=30|issue=1|date=Feb 1980|journal=Jpn J Pharmacol|pages=85–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim lacks evidence of effectiveness in human clinical trials.

In an animal study, ''Dong quai'' also induced hair growth via the inhibition of [[apoptosis]] signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Mi Hye|last2=Choi|first2=You Yeon|last3=Cho|first3=Ik-Hyun|last4=Hong|first4=Jongki|last5=Kim|first5=Sung-Hoon|last6=Yang|first6=Woong Mo|title=Angelica sinensis Induces Hair Regrowth via the Inhibition of Apoptosis Signaling|journal=The American Journal of Chinese Medicine|date=January 2014|volume=42|issue=04|pages=1021–1034|doi=10.1142/S0192415X14500645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the [[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] states that more evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of ''dong quai'' for most uses.&lt;ref name=Medline /&gt;

===Adverse effects===
There is evidence that ''A. sinensis'' may affect the muscles of the uterus. Women who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant should not use ''A. sinensis'',  because it may induce a miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Medline /&gt; Taking ''A. sinensis'' can cause skin to become extra sensitive to the sun, leading to a greater risk for skin cancer.&lt;ref name=Medline/&gt; One case of [[gynaecomastia]] has been reported following consumption of ''dong quai'' root powder pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goh, S. Y. |author2=Loh, K. C. | title = Gynaecomastia and the Herbal Tonic ''Dong Quai''  | journal = Singapore Medical Journal | year = 2001 | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 115–116 | pmid = 11405562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large and prolonged doses of the plant is not advised as it contains compounds that are considered carcinogenic.&lt;ref name=Medline&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-dongquai.html | work = Medline Plus | publisher = NIH | title = Dong Quai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug interactions===
''A. sinensis'' may increase the anticoagulant effects of the drug [[warfarin]] (as it contains coumarins&lt;ref&gt;Simultaneous quantification of six main active constituents in Chinese Angelica by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680850/&lt;/ref&gt;) and consequently increase the risk of bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Page, R. L. |author2=Lawrence, J. D. | title = Potentiation of Warfarin by ''Dong Quai'' | journal = Pharmacotherapy | year = 1999 | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–876 | pmid = 10417036 | doi=10.1592/phco.19.10.870.31558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the antiplatelet and [[anticoagulant]] effects of ''A. sinensis'', it should be taken with caution with herbs or supplements (such as [[ginkgo]], [[garlic]], and [[ginger]]) that may slow blood clotting to reduce the possible risk of bleeding and bruising.&lt;ref name=Medline /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HH|first1=Tsai|title=A review of potential harmful interactions between anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents and Chinese herbal medicines |pmid=23671711 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064255 |volume=8 |issue=5 |year=2013 |journal=PLOS ONE|pages=e64255 |pmc=3650066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
The plant's chemical constituents include [[phytosterol]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, ligustilit, b-butyl phtalit, cnidilit, isoenidilit, p-cymen, [[sodium ferulate|ferulate]], and [[flavonoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Zhao, K.

The '''Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children''' ('''ALSPAC'''), also known as '''Children of the 90s''' and formerly the '''Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood''', is a [[cohort study]] of children born in the former county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]], [[England]] during 1991 and 1992.&lt;ref name= "alspac website"&gt;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/ ALSPAC website, accessed 15 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by researchers in health, education and other social science disciplines.

The study is hosted at the [[University of Bristol]] and was initially led by [[Jean Golding]] and is now directed by [[George Davey Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Achievements-and-Impact/Initiatives/UK-biomedical-science/ALSPAC/index.htm [[Wellcome Trust]] page on ALSPAC, accessed 24 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The initial recruits were 15,247 pregnant women with estimated dates of delivery between April 1991 and December 1992. Since then the fathers, siblings and children of the participants have also begun to be studied.&lt;ref name= "alspac website" /&gt;

It is one of a family of similar studies that were set up at around the same time in six countries across Europe, known as the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC). ELSPAC included studies in [[Czechoslovakia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elspac.cz/index-en.php?pg=about |title=About the ELSPAC study |publisher=ELSPAC |accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Isle of Man]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/social-community-medicine/projects/isleofmanstudy/ |title=ELSPAC in the Isle of Man |publisher=University of Bristol |accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to ALSPAC.

A [[mental disorder]] is "''a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or psychological pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering, death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |publisher= American Psychiatric Association (APA) |date= 2000 |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) |edition= 4th, Text Revision |location= Washington, DC |chapter= |last1= |first1= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The '''causes of mental disorders''' are regarded as complex and varying depending on the particular disorder and the individual. Although the causes of most mental disorders are not fully understood, researchers have identified a variety of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that can contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30057-9 |pmid=29773478 |title=Preventive strategies for mental health |journal=The Lancet Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=591 |year=2018 |last1=Arango |first1=Celso |last2=Díaz-Caneja |first2=Covadonga M |last3=McGorry |first3=Patrick D |last4=Rapoport |first4=Judith |last5=Sommer |first5=Iris E |last6=Vorstman |first6=Jacob A |last7=McDaid |first7=David |last8=Marín |first8=Oscar |last9=Serrano-Drozdowskyj |first9=Elena |last10=Freedman |first10=Robert |last11=Carpenter |first11=William }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mental disorders are a result of a combination of several different factors rather than just a single factor.

Differences have also been found in the size or activity of certain brain regions in some cases. Psychological mechanisms have also been implicated, such as [[cognitive]] (e.g. [[reasoning]]) biases, [[emotional]] influences, [[Personality psychology|personality]] dynamics, [[temperament]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] style. Studies have indicated{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} that variation in [[genes]] can play an important role in the development of mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific categories of disorder has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding [[pregnancy]] and [[birth]] have also been implicated{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. [[Traumatic brain injury]] may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. There have been some tentative inconsistent links found to certain viral infections, to substance misuse, and to general physical health.

Social influences have been found to be important{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, including [[abuse]], [[neglect]], [[bullying]], [[social stress]], [[Traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic events]] and other negative or overwhelming life experiences. The specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear, however. Aspects of the wider community have also been implicated,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} including [[employment]] problems, [[socioeconomic]] [[Economic inequality|inequality]], lack of social cohesion, problems linked to [[Human migration|migration]], and features of particular [[societies]] and [[cultures]].

==Theories==

===General theories===
There are a number of [[theories]] or [[scientific modelling|models]] seeking to explain the causes ([[etiology]]) of [[mental disorder]]s. These theories may differ in regards to how they explain the cause of the disorder, how they treat the disorder, and their basic [[classification of mental disorders]]. There may also be differences in [[philosophy of mind]] regarding whether, or how, the [[mind]] is considered separately from the [[brain]].

During most of the 20th century, mental illness was believed to be caused by problematic relationships between children and their parents. This view was held well into the late 1990s, in which people still believed this child-parent relationship was a large determinant of severe mental illness, such as depression and schizophrenia. Today,{{When|date=June 2014}} the belief is held that the child-parent relationship is of small importance in terms of causing mental illness compared to biological and genetic factors{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. So, the perceived causes of mental illness have changed over time and will most likely continue to alter while more research is done in this area.&lt;ref name="Link Phelan 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Link |first1=BG |last2=Phelan |first2=JC |last3=Bresnahan |first3=M |last4=Stueve |first4=A |last5=Pescosolido |first5=BA |display-authors= 2 |title=Public conceptions of mental illness: Labels, causes, dangerousness, and social distance |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=89 |issue=9 |pages=1328–33 |year=1999 |pmid=10474548 |pmc=1508784 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the West, community approaches remain a focus.&lt;ref name="mentalhealth.freeuk.com"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.mentalhealth.freeuk.com/pjns.pdf |title= Explanatory models for mental illness: Limitations and dangers in a global context |last1= Thomas |first1= P |last2= Bracken |first2= P |last3= Yasmeen |first3= S |journal= Pak J Neurol Sci |date= 2007 |volume= 2 |issue= 3 |pages= 176–81 |via= www.mentalhealth.freeuk.com |pmid= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical or biomedical model===
An overall distinction is also commonly made between a "medical model" (also known as a biomedical or disease model) and a "social model" (also known as an empowerment or recovery model) of mental disorder and [[disability]], with the former focusing on hypothesized disease processes and symptoms, and the latter focusing on hypothesized [[social constructionism]] and social contexts.&lt;ref name="Rogers&amp;Pilgram05"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pilgrim, David |author2=Rogers, Anne |title=A sociology of mental health and illness |publisher=Open University Press |location=[[Milton Keynes]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-335-21583-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biological psychiatry]] has tended to follow a [[biomedical]] model focused on organic or "hardware" pathology of the brain,&lt;ref name="Ghaemi 2006"/&gt; where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience.&lt;ref name=Insel&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.555 | last1 = Insel | first1 = T.R. | last2 = Wang | first2 = P.S. | year = 2010 | title = Rethinking mental illness | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 19| pages = 1970–1971 | pmid = 20483974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopsychosocial model===
The primary model of contemporary mainstream Western psychiatry is the [[biopsychosocial model]] (BPS), which merges biological, psychological and social factors.&lt;ref name= "Ghaemi 2006"/&gt; For instance one view is that genetics accounts for 40% of a person's susceptibility to mental disorders while psychological and environmental factors account for the other 60%.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com"&gt;{{cite web |last= Frey |first= Rebecca J. |url= http://www.minddisorders.com/Flu-Inv/Genetic-factors-and-mental-disorders.html#b |title= Genetic factors and mental disorders |website= www.minddisorders.com |date= |access-date= |publisher= Advameg}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}} It may be commonly neglected or misapplied in practice due to being too broad or relativistic, however.

The most common view &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Rangaswamy Srinivasa |last1= Murthy  |display-authors= etal |title=The World Health Report 2001: Mental Health, New Understanding, New Hope|orig-year=2001 |date= 2002 |publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|edition= Reprint|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GQEdA-VFSIgC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=mental+health+comes+from+genetics#v=onepage&amp;q=genetics&amp;f=false |isbn= 9789241562010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2017}} is that disorders tend to result from genetic dispositions and environmental stressors, combining to cause patterns of distress or dysfunction or, more sharply, trigger disorders ([[Diathesis-stress model]]). A practical mixture of models may often be used to explain particular issues and disorders,&lt;ref name="Ghaemi 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghaemi |first= SN |title= Paradigms of psychiatry: Eclecticism and its discontents |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=619–24 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17012942 |doi= 10.1097/01.yco.0000245751.98749.52 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/547497_print}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there may be difficulty defining boundaries for indistinct psychiatric [[syndromes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10588394 |year=1999 |author1=Kendler |first1=K. S |title=Setting boundaries for psychiatric disorders |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=156 |issue=12 |pages=1845–8 |doi=10.1176/ajp.156.12.1845 |doi-broken-date=2018-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalytic theories===
[[Psychoanalytic]] theories focus on unresolved internal and relational conflicts. These theories have been posited as overall explanations of mental disorder, although today most psychoanalytic groups are said to adhere to the biopsychosocial model and to accept an eclectic mix of subtypes of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name="Ghaemi 2006"/&gt; The psychoanalytic theory was originated by [[Sigmund Freud]]. This theory focuses on the impact of unconscious forces on human behavior. According to Freud, the personality is made up of three parts: the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]], [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]], and [[superego]]. The id operates under the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], the ego operates under the [[reality principle]], and the superego is the "conscience" and incorporates what is and is not socially acceptable into a person's value system.  Also, according to the psychoanalytic theory, there are five stages of psycho-sexual development that everyone goes through: the [[oral stage]], [[anal stage]], [[phallic stage]], [[latency stage]], and [[genital stage]]. Mental disorders can be caused by an individual receiving too little or too much gratification in one of the psycho-sexual developmental stages. When this happens, the individual is said to be [[Fixation (psychology)|fixated]] in that developmental stage.&lt;ref name="Segrist 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segrist|first1=Dan J.|title=What's Going on in Your Professor's Head? Demonstrating the Id, Ego, and Superego|journal=Teaching of Psychology|volume=36| issue=1|year=2009|pages=51–54| doi=10.1080/00986280802529285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Westen D | year = 1998 | title = The scientific legacy of Sigmund Freud: Toward a psychodynamically informed psychological science | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 124 | issue = 3| pages = 333–371 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.3.333| citeseerx = 10.1.1.590.4857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
[[Attachment theory]] is a kind of evolutionary-psychological approach sometimes applied in the context for mental disorders, which focuses on the role of early caregiver-child relationships, responses to danger, and the search for a satisfying reproductive relationship in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crittenden PM |title=Attachment, information processing, and psychiatric disorder |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=72–75 | date=June 2002 | pmid=16946856 |pmc=1525137}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the more secure a child's attachment is to a nurturing adult, the more likely that child will maintain healthy relationships with others in their life. As found by the [[Strange Experiment|Strange Situation experiment]] run by [[Mary Ainsworth]] based on the formulations of [[John Bowlby]], there are four main patterns of attachment: [[secure attachment]], [[Attachment styles|avoidant attachment]], [[disorganized attachment]] and [[ambivalent attachment]].  These attachment patterns are found cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Vondra, J. I., &amp; Barnett, D. (1999). A typical attachment in infancy and early childhood among children at developmental risk. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 64 (3, Serial No. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; Later research found a fourth pattern of attachment known as [[Disorganized attachment|disorganized disoriented attachment]]. Secure attachments reflect trust in the child-caretaker relationship while insecure attachment reflects mistrust. The security of attachment in a child affects the child's emotional, cognitive, and social competence later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gregory |last1=Lowder |first2=James |last2=Hansell |first3=Nancy |last3=McWilliams |year= |title=The Enduring Significance of Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice |url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-39/leadership/apsaa/significance.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary psychology===
[[Evolutionary psychology]] (or more specifically evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) has also been proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of [[mental module]]s adapted to [[ancestral]] physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first= Simon |title=The Maladapted Mind: Classic Readings in Evolutionary Psychopathology |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-86377-460-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brüne |first= M |title=Toward an integration of interpersonal and biological processes: Evolutionary psychiatry as an empirically testable framework for psychiatric research |journal=Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=48–57 |year=2002 |pmid=11980046 |doi=10.1521/psyc.65.1.48.19759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nesse |first= RM |title=Evolutionary biology: A basic science for psychiatry |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=7–9 |date=February 2002 |pmid=16946805 |pmc=1489830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including in enhancing creativity.&lt;ref name="Andreasen 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/ajp.144.10.1288 |pmid=3499088 |title=Creativity and mental illness: Prevalence rates in writers and their first-degree relatives |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=144 |issue=10 |pages=1288–92 |year=1987 |author1=Andreasen |first1=N. C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some related behavioral abnormalities have been found in non-human [[great apes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.002 |pmid=17141312 |title=Psychopathology in great apes: Concepts, treatment options and possible homologies to human psychiatric disorders |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1246–59 |year=2006 |last1=Brune |first1=M |last2=Brunecohrs |first2=U |last3=McGrew |first3=W |last4=Preuschoft |first4=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that human minds are products of natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry on their genetic legacy through their offspring. This theory identifies the environment as having a great effect on a person's mental development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Downes |first= S. |chapter= Evolutionary Psychology |date= 21 May 2014 |title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolutionary-psychology/ |editor-last= Aalta |editor-first= Edward N. |archive-url= https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/evolutionary-psychology/ |archive-date= 21 December 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors affecting choice of models and theories===
Psychiatrists may favour biomedical models because they believe such models make their discipline seem more esteemed.&lt;ref name="Angermeyer 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085563 |pmid=22045945 |title=Biogenetic explanations and public acceptance of mental illness: Systematic review of population studies |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=199 |issue=5 |pages=367–72 |year=2018 |last1=Angermeyer |first1=Matthias C |last2=Holzinger |first2=Anita |last3=Carta |first3=Mauro G |last4=Schomerus |first4=Georg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, families of mentally ill people tend to favour biomedical models because to do so gives less self-blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |last= Martinez |first= Margaret A. |url= http://www.yale.edu/psychdus/Senior_Essays_files/f.pdf |title= The Blame Game: Lay casual theories and familiarity with mental illness |date= 19 April 2010 |archive-date= 22 February 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222191356/http://www.yale.edu/psychdus/Senior_Essays_files/f.pdf |deadurl= yes |page=  |type= Senior Thesis in Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}} If patients are seen by a more ethnically similar doctor, they are more likely to adopt a non-biomedical model.&lt;ref name="Ghane 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0053-1 |pmid=19381425 |pmc=2820666 |title=Assessment of explanatory models of mental illness: Effects of patient and interviewer characteristics |journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=175–82 |year=2009 |last1=Ghane |first1=Samrad |last2=Kolk |first2=Annemarie M |last3=Emmelkamp |first3=Paul M. G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological factors==
Biological factors consist of anything physical that can cause adverse effects on a person's mental health. This includes genetics, prenatal damage, infections, exposure to toxins, brain defects or injuries, and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/mental-health-causes-mental-illness |title= Causes of Mental Illness |date=  |access-date= |work= WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}} Many professionals believe that the sole cause of mental disorders is based upon the biology of the brain and the nervous system.&lt;ref name="netplaces.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netplaces.com/psychology/disorders-when-thinking-and-emotionality-go-awry/causes-of-mental-disorders.htm |title= Causes of Mental Disorders |last= Cherry |first= Kendra |archive-date= 12 May 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150512134316/http://www.netplaces.com/psychology/disorders-when-thinking-and-emotionality-go-awry/causes-of-mental-disorders.htm |deadurl= yes |website= www.netplaces.com |publisher= About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=November 2017}}

[[Mind (charity)|''Mind'']] mentions genetic factors, long-term physical health conditions, and head injuries or epilepsy (affecting behaviour and mood) as factors that may possibly trigger an episode of mental illness.&lt;ref name="mind.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/mental-health-problems-(general)/what-causes-mental-health-problems/#.U1ItYeZdUz4 |title= What causes mental health problems? |deadurl= yes |archive-date= 30 May 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140330190323/http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/mental-health-problems-(general)/what-causes-mental-health-problems/#.WgsHinZryM8 |website= www.mind.org.uk |publisher= [[Mind (charity)|Mind]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===

Family-linkage and [[twin studies]] have indicated that genetic factors often play an important role in the development of mental disorders. The reliable identification of specific genetic susceptibility to particular disorders, through [[genetic linkage|linkage]] or [[genetic association|association studies]], has proven difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Insel |first1= TR |last2= Collins |first2= FS |title=Psychiatry in the genomics era |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=616–20 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668345 |url= http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/4/616 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.4.616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bearden |first1=CE |last2= Reus |first2= VI |last3= Freimer |first3=NB |title=Why genetic investigation of psychiatric disorders is so difficult |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=280–6 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15172671 |doi= 10.1016/j.gde.2004.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been reported to be likely due to the complexity of interactions between genes, environmental events, and early development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kas |first1= MJ |last2= Fernandes |first2= C |last3= Schalkwyk |first3= LC |last4= Collier |first4= DA |display-authors= 2 |title=Genetics of behavioural domains across the neuropsychiatric spectrum: Of mice and men |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=324–30 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17389901 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001979}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the need for new research strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Burmeister |first= M | year = 2006 | title = Genetics of psychiatric disorders: A primer | doi = 10.1176/foc.4.3.317 | journal = Focus | volume = 4 | issue = 3| page = 317 |doi-broken-date= 2018-08-15 |url=https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/foc.4.3.317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[heritability]] of behavioral traits associated with mental disorder may be greater in permissive than in restrictive environments, and susceptibility genes probably work through both "within-the-skin" (physiological) pathways and "outside-the-skin" (behavioral and social) pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kendler |first1=KS |title=Twin studies of psychiatric illness |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=58 |issue=11 |pages=1005–14 |year=2001 |pmid=11695946 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.11.1005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations increasingly focus on links between genes and endophenotypes—more specific traits (including neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological)—rather than disease categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bearden |first1= CE |last2= Freimer |first2= NB |title=Endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders: Ready for primetime? |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=306–13 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16697071 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.04.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Glahn |first1= DC |last2= Thompson |first2= PM |last3= Blangero |first3= J |date=June 2007 |journal=[[Hum Brain Mapp]]  |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=488–501 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20401 |pmid= 17440953 |title=Neuroimaging endophenotypes: Strategies for finding genes influencing brain structure and function|url=http://www.soph.uab.edu/Statgenetics/Club_ssg/WPrucka_07_2.pdf |citeseerx= 10.1.1.582.7919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to a prominent mental disorder, [[schizophrenia]], for a long time consensus among scientists was that certain [[alleles]] (forms of genes) were responsible for schizophrenia, but some research has indicated only multiple, rare mutations thought to alter neurodevelopmental pathways that can ultimately contribute to schizophrenia; virtually every rare structural mutation was different in each individual.&lt;ref name=Genetics&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Tom|title=Rare Structural Variants Disrupt Multiple Genes in Neurodevelopmental Pathways in Schizophrenia|url=http://www.uwpsychiatry.org/Docs/News/McClellan_Science_Paper.pdf|publisher=Science|accessdate=11 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722054257/http://www.uwpsychiatry.org/Docs/News/McClellan_Science_Paper.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that many conditions are polygenic meaning there are multiple defective genes rather than only one that are responsible for a disorder.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}} [[Schizophrenia]] and [[Alzheimer's]] are both examples of hereditary mental disorders.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com"/&gt;

The increasing understanding of [[neuroplasticity|brain plasticity (neuroplasticity)]] raises questions of whether some brain differences may be caused by mental illnesses, rather than pre-existing and causing them.

===Prenatal damage===
Any damage that occurs to a fetus while still in its mother's womb is considered prenatal damage. If the pregnant mother uses drugs or alcohol or is exposed to illnesses or infections then mental disorders can develop in the fetus. According to research, certain conditions, such as [[autism]] result from a disruption of early fetal brain progression.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}}

Environmental events surrounding [[pregnancy]] and [[birth]] have been linked to an increased development of mental illness in the [[offspring]]. This includes maternal exposure to serious psychological [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[psychological trauma|trauma]], conditions of famine, [[obstetric]] birth complications, infections, and [[gestational]] exposure to [[alcohol]] or [[cocaine]]. Such factors have been hypothesized to affect specific areas of neurodevelopment within the general developmental context and to restrict [[neuroplasticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fumagalli |first1= F |last2= Molteni |first2= R |last3= Racagni |first3= G |last4= Riva |first4= MA |display-authors= 2 |title=Stress during development: Impact on neuroplasticity and relevance to psychopathology |journal=Prog.

===Infection, disease and toxins===
A number of psychiatric disorders have often been tentatively linked with microbial pathogens, particularly viruses; however while there have been some suggestions of links from animal studies, and some inconsistent evidence for infectious and immune mechanisms (including prenatally) in some human disorders, infectious disease models in psychiatry are reported to have not yet shown significant promise except in isolated cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pearce |first1=BD |title=Modeling the role of infections in the etiology of mental illness |journal=Clinical Neuroscience Research |volume=3 |issue=4–5 |year=2003 |pages=271–82 |doi=10.1016/S1566-2772(03)00098-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some inconsistent findings of links between infection by the parasite [[Toxoplasma gondii]] and human mental disorders such as schizophrenia, with the direction of causality unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-4-32 |pmid=15491496 |pmc=526777 |title=Toxoplasma and coxiella infection and psychiatric morbidity: A retrospective cohort analysis |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=4 |pages=32 |year=2004 |last1=Thomas |first1=Hollie V |last2=Thomas |first2=Daniel Rh |last3=Salmon |first3=Roland L |last4=Lewis |first4=Glyn |last5=Smith |first5=Andy P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-178 |pmid=17178002 |pmc=1764421 |title=Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondiiinfection in psychiatric inpatients in a northern Mexican city |journal=BMC Infectious Diseases |volume=6 |pages=178 |year=2006 |last1=Alvarado-Esquivel |first1=Cosme |last2=Alanis-Quiñones |first2=Olga-Patricia |last3=Arreola-Valenzuela |first3=Miguel-Ángel |last4=Rodríguez-Briones |first4=Alfredo |last5=Piedra-Nevarez |first5=Luis-Jorge |last6=Duran-Morales |first6=Ehecatl |last7=Estrada-Martínez |first7=Sergio |last8=Martínez-García |first8=Sergio-Arturo |last9=Liesenfeld |first9=Oliver }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Yolken |first1= RH |last2= Torrey |first2= EF |title=Viruses, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=131–45 |date=1 January 1995|pmid=7704891 |pmc=172852 |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7704891 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of diseases of the white matter can cause symptoms of mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Walterfang |first1= M |last2=Wood |first2= SJ |last3=Velakoulis |first3= D |last4=Copolov |first4= D |last5= Pantelis |first5= C |display-authors= 2 |title=Diseases of white matter and schizophrenia-like psychosis |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry. |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=746–56 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16168032 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2005.01678.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poorer general health has been found among individuals with severe mental illnesses, thought to be due to direct and indirect factors including diet, bacterial infections, substance use, exercise levels, effects of medications, socioeconomic disadvantages, lowered help-seeking or treatment adherence, or poorer healthcare provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Phelan |first1= M |last2= Stradins |first2= L |last3= Morrison |first3= S |title=Physical health of people with severe mental illness: Can be improved if primary care and mental health professionals pay attention to it |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7284 |pages=443–4 |date=February 2001 |pmid= 11222406 |pmc=1119672 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/322/7284/443#B8 |doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7284.443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chronic general medical conditions have been linked to some aspects of mental disorder, such as [[AIDS]]-related psychosis.

The current research on Lyme's disease caused by a deer tick, and related toxins, is expanding the link between bacterial infections and mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mentaldisorders.html Mental Disorders: MedlinePlus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that infections and exposure to toxins such as [[HIV]] and [[streptococcus]] cause dementia and OCD respectively.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perry |first1=SW |title=Organic mental disorders caused by HIV: Update on early diagnosis and treatment |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=147 |issue=6 |pages=696–710 |year=1990 |pmid=2188514 |doi=10.1176/ajp.147.6.696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The infections or toxins trigger a change in the brain chemistry, which can develop into a mental disorder.

===Injury and brain defects===
Any damage to the brain can cause a mental disorder. The brain is the control system for the nervous system and the rest of the body. Without it the body cannot function properly.&lt;ref name="netplaces.com"/&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}}

Higher rates of mood, psychotic, and substance abuse disorders have been found following [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI). Findings on the relationship between TBI severity and prevalence of subsequent psychiatric disorders have been inconsistent, and occurrence has been linked to prior mental health problems as well as direct neurophysiological effects, in a complex interaction with personality and attitude and [[social influences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fann |first1= JR |last2= Burington |first2= B |last3= Leonetti |first3= A |last4= Jaffe |first4= K |last5= Katon |first5= WJ |last6= Thompson |first6= RS |display-authors= 2 |title= Psychiatric illness following traumatic brain injury in an adult health maintenance organization population |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=53–61 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14706944 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.61.1.53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head trauma is classified as either open or closed head injury. In [[open head injury]]  the skull is penetrated and brain tissue is destroy in a localized area. [[Closed head injury]] is more common, the skull is not penetrated but there is an impact of the brain against the skull which can create permanent structural damage (e.g. [[subdural hematoma]]). With both types, symptoms may disappear or persist over time.  It has been found that typically the longer the length of time spent unconscious and the length of [[post-traumatic amnesia]] the worse the prognosis for the individual.  The cognitive residual symptoms of head trauma are associated with the type of injury (either open head injury or closed head injury)and the amount of tissue destroyed. Symptoms of closed injury head trauma tend to be the experience of intellectual deficits in [[Abstract reasoning|abstract reasoning ability]], judgement, and memory, and also marked personality changes. Symptoms of open injury head trauma tend to be the experience of classic neuropsychological syndromes like [[aphasia]], visual-spatial disorders, and types of memory or [[Sensory processing disorder|perceptual disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Turner |editor1-first= Samuel M. |editor2-last= Hersen |editor2-first= Michel |date= 1984 |series= Wiley Series on Personality Processes |pages= 44–5 |location= Canada |publisher= John Wiley |title= Adult Psychopathology and Diagnosis |edition= 2nd |isbn= 978-0471089698 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain tumors are classified as either [[malignant]] and [[benign]], and as [[intrinsic]] (directly infiltrate the [[parenchyma]] of the brain) or [[extrinsic]] (grows on the external surface of the brain and produces symptoms as a result of pressure on the brain tissue). Progressive cognitive changes associated with brain tumors may include confusion, poor comprehension, and even [[dementia]].  Symptoms tend to depend on the location of the tumor on the brain. For example, tumors on the [[frontal lobe]] tend to be associated with the symptoms of impairment of judgment, apathy, and loss of the ability to regulate/modulate behavior.&lt;ref name= TH45-6&gt;{{harvp|Turner|Hersen|1984|pp=45-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings have indicated abnormal functioning of [[brainstem]] structures in individuals with mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], and other disorders that have to do with impairments in maintaining sustained attention.&lt;ref name= 2005MirskyDuncan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mirsky |first1= AF |last2= Duncan |first2= CC |title=Pathophysiology of mental illness: A view from the fourth ventricle |journal=Int J Psychophysiol. |volume=58 |issue=2–3 |pages=162–78 |year=2005 |pmid=16213042 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2005.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some abnormalities in the average size or shape of some regions of the brain have been found in some disorders, reflecting genes and/or experience. Studies of schizophrenia have tended to find enlarged [[ventricular system|ventricles]] and sometimes reduced volume of the [[cerebrum]] and [[hippocampus]], while studies of (psychotic) [[bipolar disorder]] have sometimes found increased [[amygdala]] volume. Findings differ over whether volumetric abnormalities are risk factors or are only found alongside the course of mental health problems, possibly reflecting neurocognitive or emotional stress processes and/or medication use or substance use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=C|last2=Marshall |first2=N |last3=Sham |first3=PC |last4=Bullmore |first4=ET |last5=Schulze |first5=K |last6=Chapple |first6=B |last7=Bramon |first7=E |last8=Filbey |first8=F |last9=Quraishi |first9=S |last10=Walshe |first10=M |last11=Murray |first11=RM |display-authors= 2 |title=Regional brain morphometry in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and their unaffected relatives |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=478–87 |year=2006 |pmid=16513870 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.3.478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velakoulis |first1=D |last2=Wood |first2=SJ |last3=Wong |first3=MTH |last4=McGorry |first4=PD |last5=Yung |first5=A |last6=Phillips |first6=L |last7=Smith |first7=D |last8=Brewer |first8=W |last9=Proffitt |first9=T |last10=Desmond |first10=P |last11=Pantelis |first11=C |display-authors= 2 |title=Hippocampal and Amygdala Volumes According to Psychosis Stage and Diagnosis |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=139–49 |year=2006 |pmid=16461856 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.2.139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have also found reduced hippocampal volumes in [[major depression]], possibly worsening with time depressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Colla |first1=M |last2=Kronenberg |first2=G |last3=Deuschle |first3=M |last4=Meichel |first4=K |last5=Hagen |first5=T |last6=Bohrer |first6=M |last7=Heuser |first7=I |display-authors= 2 |title=Hippocampal volume reduction and HPA-system activity in major depression |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=553–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17023001 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.06.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurotransmitter systems===
Abnormal levels of [[dopamine]] activity have been ''correlated'' with a number of disorders (e.g., reduced in [[ADHD]] and [[OCD]], and increased in schizophrenia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iversen |first1=SD |last2= Iversen |first2= LL |title=Dopamine: 50 years in perspective |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=188–93 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17368565 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunction in [[serotonin]] and other [[monoamine]] neurotransmitters (e.g., [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]), and their associated neural networks, are also moderately correlated with certain mental disorders, including [[major depressive disorder|major depression]], [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[phobias]], [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], and [[generalized anxiety disorder]]. Studies of depleted levels of [[monoamine]] neurotransmitters show an association with depression and other psychiatric disorders, but "... it should be questioned whether 5-HT [serotonin] represents just one of the final, and not the main, factors in the neurological chain of events underlying psychopathological symptoms...." &lt;ref&gt;Marazziti, D.

Simplistic "chemical imbalance" explanations for mental disorders have never received empirical support; and most prominent psychiatrists, neuroscientists, and psychologists have not espoused such ill-defined, facile etiological theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/couch-crisis/psychiatrys-new-brain-mind-and-legend-chemical-imbalance|title=Psychiatry’s New Brain-Mind and the Legend of the "Chemical Imbalance" {{!}} Psychiatric Times|website=www.psychiatrictimes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hindmarch |first1=I |title=Beyond the monoamine hypothesis: Mechanisms, molecules and methods |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=17 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=294–9 |year=2002 |pmid=15177084 |doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(02)00653-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, neurotransmitter systems have been understood in the context of the [[Diathesis–stress model|diathesis-stress]] or [[biopsychosocial]] models. The following 1967 quote from renowned psychiatric and neuroscience researchers exemplifies this more sophisticated understanding (in contrast to the woolly "chemical imbalance" notion).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas specific genetic factors may be of importance in the etiology of some, and possibly all, depressions, it is equally conceivable that early experiences of the infant or child may cause enduring biochemical changes, and that these may predispose some individuals to depressions in adulthood. It is not likely that changes in the metabolism of the biogenic amines alone will account for the complex phenomena of normal or pathological affect.&lt;ref&gt;Schildkraut, J. J., &amp; Kety, S. S. (1967). Biogenic amines and emotion. ''Science'', 156(3771), 21-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Substance abuse===
Substance abuse, especially long-term abuse, can cause or exacerbate many mental disorders. [[Alcoholism]] is linked to [[depression (mood)|depression]] while abuse of [[amphetamines]] and [[LSD]] can leave a person feeling [[paranoid]] and [[anxious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.unc.edu/alcohol/prevention/health.html |title= Effects of Alcohol and Drug Abuse; ...On your Health |accessdate= 8 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522233612/http://www.med.unc.edu/alcohol/prevention/health.html |archivedate=22 May 2013 |publisher= Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies: University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Correlations of mental disorders with drug use include [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]],&lt;ref name="rcpsych.ac.uk"/&gt; alcohol and [[caffeine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winston |first1=AP |title=Neuropsychiatric effects of caffeine |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=11 |issue=6 |year=2005 |pages=432–9 |doi=10.1192/apt.11.6.432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caffeine]] use is correlated with [[anxiety]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vilarim |first1=MM |last2=Rocha Araujo |first2=DM |last3=Nardi |first3=AE |title=Caffeine challenge test and panic disorder: a systematic literature review |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=1185–95 |year=2011 |pmid=21797659 |doi=10.1586/ern.11.83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and suicide. Illicit drugs have the ability to stimulate particular parts of the brain which can affect development in adolescence. Cannabis has been found to worsen depression and lessen an individual's [[motivation]].&lt;ref name="rcpsych.ac.uk"/&gt; Alcohol has the potential to damage "[[white matter]]" in the brain which affects [[thinking]] and [[memory]]. Alcohol has been found to be a serious problem in many countries due to many people participating in excessive drinking or [[binge drinking]].

==Life experience and environmental factors==

The term "environment" is very loosely defined when it comes to mental illness.  Unlike biological and psychological causes, environmental causes are stressors that individuals deal with in everyday life. These stressors range from financial issues to having low self-esteem. Environmental causes are more psychologically based thus making them more closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mentalhealth-jami.org.uk/causes-of-mental-illness |title= Causes of Mental Illness |website= www.mentalhealth.jami.org.uk |date= |accessdate= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=November 2017}} Events that evoke feelings of loss or damage are most likely to cause a mental disorder to develop in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=CW |title=Environmental connections: A deeper look into mental illness |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=115 |issue=8 |pages=A404, A406–10 |year=2007 |pmid=17687431 |pmc=1940091 |doi=10.1289/ehp.115-a404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental factors include but are not limited a dysfunctional home life, poor relationships with others, substance abuse, not meeting social expectations, low self-esteem and poverty.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}}

[[Mind (charity)|Mind]] mentions childhood abuse, trauma, violence or neglect, social isolation, loneliness or discrimination, the death of someone close, stress, homelessness or poor housing, social disadvantage, poverty or debt, unemployment, caring for a family member or friend, significant trauma as an adult, such as military combat, and being involved in a serious accident or being the victim of a violent crime as possibly triggering an episode of mental illness.&lt;ref name="mind.org.uk"/&gt;

Repeating generational patterns have been found to be a risk factor for mental illness.&lt;ref name=pmid24206921/&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

===Life events and emotional stress===
It is reported that treatment in childhood and in adulthood, including [[sexual abuse]], [[physical abuse]], [[emotional abuse]], [[domestic violence]] and [[bullying]], has been linked to the development of mental disorders, through a complex interaction of societal, family, psychological and biological factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spataro |first1=J |last2=Mullen |first2=PE |last3=Burgess |first3=PM |last4=Wells |first4=DL |last5=Moss |first5=SA |display-authors= 2 |title=Impact of child sexual abuse on mental health: Prospective study in males and females |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=184 |issue= 5|pages=416–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15123505 |doi=10.1192/bjp.184.5.416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maughan |first1=B |last2=McCarthy |first2=G |title=Childhood adversities and psychosocial disorders |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=156–69 |year=1997 |pmid=9158291 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teicher |first1= MH |last2= Samson |first2= JA |last3= Polcari |first3= A |last4= McGreenery |first4= CE |display-authors= 2 |title=Sticks, stones, and hurtful words: Relative effects of various forms of childhood maltreatment |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=6 |pages= 993–1000 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16741199 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.6.993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kessler |first1= RC |last2= Davis |first2= CG |last3= Kendler |first3= KS |title=Childhood adversity and adult psychiatric disorder in the US National Comorbidity Survey |journal=Psychol.

[[Psychological resilience|Resilience]] to such experiences varies, and a person may be resistant to some forms of experience but susceptible to others. Features associated with variations in resilience include genetic vulnerability, temperamental characteristics, cognitive set, coping patterns, and other experiences.&lt;ref name=Rutter2000&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rutter |first= M |title=Psychosocial influences: Critiques, findings, and research needs |journal=Dev Psychopathol. |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=375–405 |year=2000 |pmid=11014744 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400003072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[bipolar disorder]], stress (such as childhood adversity) is not a specific cause, but does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000424 |title=Prevention of bipolar disorder in at-risk children: Theoretical assumptions and empirical foundations |year=2008 |last1=Miklowitz |first1=DJ |last2=Chang |first2=KD |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pmid=18606036 |pages=881–97 |pmc=2504732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor parenting, abuse and neglect===

Poor parenting has been found to be a risk factor for depression&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  and anxiety.&lt;ref name="National Academies Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bienvenu Ginsburg 2007"/&gt; Separation or bereavement in families, and childhood trauma, have been found to be risk factors for psychosis and schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="schizophreniacommission.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varese |first1=F |last2=Smeets |first2=F |last3=Drukker |first3=M |last4=Lieverse |first4=R |last5=Lataster |first5=T |last6=Viechtbauer |first6=W |last7=Read |first7=J |last8=van Os |first8=J |last9=Bentall |first9=RP |display-authors= 2 |title=Childhood adversities increase the risk of psychosis: A meta-analysis of patient-control, prospective- and cross-sectional cohort Studies |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=661–71 |year=2012 |pmid=22461484 |pmc=3406538 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbs050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe psychological trauma such as abuse can wreak havoc on a person's life. Children are much more susceptible to psychological harm from traumatic events than adults. Once again, the reaction to the trauma will vary based on the person as well as the individual's age. The impact of these events is influenced by several factors: the type of event, the length of exposure the individual had to the event, and the extent to which the individual and their family/friends were personally affected by the event. Human-caused disasters, such as a tumultuous childhood affect children more than natural disasters&lt;ref name="Feldman, P. 2012 p. 347"&gt;{{harvp|Feldman|Papalia|2012|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neglect]] is a type of maltreatment related to the failure to provide needed, age-appropriate care, supervision and protection. It is not to be confused with [[abuse]], which, in this context, is defined as any action that intentionally harms or injures another person.&lt;ref&gt;medical-dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2017}} Neglect most often happens during childhood by the parents or caretakers. Oftentimes, parents who are guilty of neglect were also neglected as children. The long-term effects of neglect are reduced physical, emotional, and mental health in a child and throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name="Feldman, P. 2012 p. 347"/&gt;

===The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study===

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are various forms of [[child maltreatment|maltreatment]] and household dysfunction experienced in childhood. The [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study]] has shown a strong [[dose–response relationship]] between ACEs and numerous health, social, and behavioral problems throughout a person's lifespan, including suicide attempts and frequency of depressive episodes.&lt;ref name=SAMHSA_ACE/&gt; Children's neurological development can be disrupted when they are chronically exposed to stressful events such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect, witnessing violence in the household, or  a parent being incarcerated or suffering from a mental illness. As a result, the child's cognitive functioning or ability to cope with negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired. Over time, the child may adopt various harmful coping strategies that can contribute to later disease and disability.&lt;ref name=SAMHSA_ACE&gt;{{cite web |title=Adverse Childhood Experiences |publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |location=Rockville, Maryland, United States |website=samhsa.gov |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/capt/practicing-effective-prevention/prevention-behavioral-health/adverse-childhood-experiences |access-date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Relationship issues have been consistently linked to the development of mental disorders, with continuing debate on the relative impact of the home environment or work/school and peer groups. Issues with parenting skills or parental depression or other problems may be a risk factor. Parental divorce appears to increase risk, perhaps only if there is family discord or disorganization, although a warm supportive relationship with one parent may compensate. Details of infant feeding, weaning, toilet training etc. do not appear to be importantly linked to psychopathology. Early social privation, or lack of ongoing, harmonious, secure, committed relationships, have been implicated in the development of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1= LM |last2= Gullone |first2= E |title=The clinical significance of loneliness: A literature review |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=695–718 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16952717 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some approaches, such as certain theories of [[co-counseling]], may see all non-neurological mental disorders as the result of the self-regulating mechanisms of the mind (which accompany the physical expression of emotions) not being allowed to operate.

How an individual interacts with others as well as the quality of relationships can greatly increase or decrease a person's quality of living. Continuous fighting with friends and family can all lead to an increased risk of developing a mental illness. A [[dysfunctional family]] may include disobedience, child neglect and/or abuse which occurs regularly. These types of families are often a product of an unhealthy co-dependent relationship on the part of the head of the household (usually to drugs).

Losing a loved one, especially at an early age can have lasting effects on an individual. The individual may feel fear, guilt, anger or loneliness. This can drive a person into solitude and depression. They may turn to alcohol and drugs to cope with their feelings.

[[Divorce]] is also another factor that can take a toll on both children and adults alike. Divorcees may suffer from emotional adjustment problems due to a loss of intimacy and social connections. Newer statistics show that the negative effects of divorce have been greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mediate.com/articles/psych.cfm |title= Psychological and Emotional Aspects of Divorce&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |website= www.meditate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=November 2017}}
The effects of divorce in children are based on three main factors: the quality of their relationship with each of their parents before the separation, the intensity and duration of the parental conflict, and the parents' ability to focus on the needs of children in their divorce.

===Social expectations and esteem===
How individuals view themselves ultimately determines who they are, their abilities and what they can be. Having both too low of [[self-esteem]] as well as too high of one can be detrimental to an individual's mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=M |last2=Hosman |first2=CM |last3=Schaalma |first3=HP |last4=de Vries |first4=NK |display-authors= 2 |title=Self-esteem in a broad-spectrum approach for mental health promotion |journal=Health Education Research |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=357–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15199011 |doi=10.1093/her/cyg041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person's self-esteem plays a much larger role in their overall happiness and quality of life. Poor self-esteem whether it be too high or too low can result in aggression, violence, self-deprecating behavior, anxiety, and other mental disorders.

Not fitting in with the masses can result in bullying and other types of emotional abuse. Bullying can result in depression, feelings of anger, loneliness.

===Poverty===
{{See|Socioeconomic status and mental health}}

Studies show that there is a direct correlation between [[poverty]] and mental illness. The lower the socioeconomic status of an individual the higher the risk of mental illness. Impoverished people are actually two to three times more likely to develop mental illness than those of a higher economic class.

Low levels of self-efficiency and self-worth are commonly experienced by children of disadvantaged families or those from the economic underclass. Theorists of child development have argued that persistent poverty leads to high levels of psychopathology and poor self-concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2095905 |jstor=2095905 |title=Poverty, Parenting, and Children's Mental Health |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=351–66 |year=1993 |last1=McLeod |first1=Jane D |last2=Shanahan |first2=Michael J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This increased risk for psychiatric complications remains consistent for all individuals among the impoverished population, regardless of any in-group demographic differences that they may possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poverty and psychiatric status: Longitudinal evidence from the New Haven Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=48|issue=5|pages=470–474|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1991.01810290082015|year=1991|author=Livingston Bruce Martha}}&lt;/ref&gt; These families must deal with economic stressors like unemployment and lack of affordable housing, which can lead to mental health disorders. A person's socioeconomic class outlines the [[psychosocial]], environmental, behavioral, and [[biomedical]] risk factors that are associated with mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Mental Illness and Poverty: A Fact Sheet |url= http://www.fccmh.org/resources/docs/MentalIllnessandPovery.pdf |date= January 2007 |accessdate=  |publisher= Florida Council for Community Mental Health |website= www.fccmh.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to findings there is a strong association between poverty and [[substance abuse]]. Substance abuse only perpetuates a continuous cycle. It can make it extremely difficult for individuals to find and keep jobs. As stated earlier, both financial problems and substance abuse can cause mental illnesses to develop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everythingaddiction.com/addiction-society/substance-abuse-and-poverty Substance Abuse and Poverty | Addiction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communities and cultures===

Problems in communities or cultures, including poverty, unemployment or [[underemployment]], lack of social cohesion, and migration, have been &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;associated with&lt;/span&gt; the development of mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Rogers&amp;Pilgram05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutter2000"/&gt; Stresses and strains related to socioeconomic position ([[socioeconomics|socioeconomic status]] (SES) or [[social class]]) have been linked to the occurrence of major mental disorders, with a lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic or social position generally linked to more mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muntaner |first1=C |last2=Eaton |first2=WW |last3=Miech |first3=R |last4=O'Campo |first4=P |display-authors= 2 |title=Socioeconomic position and major mental disorders |journal=Epidemiologic Reviews |volume=26 |issue= |pages=53–62 |year=2004 |pmid=15234947 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxh001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been mixed findings on the nature of the links and on the extent to which pre-existing personal characteristics influence the links.

==Psychological and individual factors, including resilience==
Some clinicians believe that psychological characteristics alone determine mental disorders. Others speculate that abnormal behavior can be explained by a mix of social and psychological factors. In many examples, environmental and psychological triggers complement one another resulting in emotional stress, which in turn activates a mental illness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahn |first1=W-k |last2=Proctor |first2=CC |last3=Flanagan |first3=EH |title=Mental health clinicians’ beliefs about the biological, psychological, and environmental bases of mental disorders |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=147–182 |year=2009 |pmid=20411158 |pmc=2857376 |doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each person is unique in how they will react to psychological stressors. What may break one person may have little to no effect on another. Psychological stressors, which can trigger mental illness, are as follows: emotional, physical or sexual abuse, loss of a significant loved one, neglect and being unable to relate to others.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}}

The inability to relate to others is also known as [[emotional detachment]]. Emotional detachment makes it difficult for an individual to empathize with others or to share their own feelings. An emotionally detached person may try to rationalize or apply logic to a situation to which there is no logical explanation. These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and may be a bit [[neuroticism|neurotic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Schreiner |first= Michael |url= http://www.evolutioncounseling.com/detached-personality.html |title= Detached Personality |work= Evolution Counseling |publisher= Michael Schreiner |date= 8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2017}} Oftentimes, the inability to relate to others stems from a traumatic event.

Mental characteristics of individuals, as assessed by both neurological and psychological studies, have been linked to the development and maintenance of mental disorders. This includes cognitive or [[neurocognitive]] factors, such as the way a person perceives, thinks or feels about certain things;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iacoviello |first1= BM |last2=Alloy |first2=LB |last3=Abramson |first3=LY |last4=Whitehouse |first4=WG |last5=Hogan |first5= ME |display-authors= 2 |title=The course of depression in individuals at high and low cognitive risk for depression: A prospective study |journal=J.

'''Charles Handfield Jones''' (1819–1890) was an English physician. 
[[File:Charles Handfield Jones.jpg|thumb|Charles Handfield Jones]]

==Life==
The son of Captain Jones, R.N., he was born in [[Liverpool]], 1 October 1819. He was one of [[Thomas Arnold]]'s pupils at [[Rugby School]], went on to [[Catharine Hall, Cambridge]] in 1837, and graduated B.A. in 1840. After study at [[St. George's Hospital]], London, he took the degree of M.B. at Cambridge in 1843, but never proceeded to that of M.D.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Jones, Charles Handfield|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=JNS836CH|name=Jones, Charles Handfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones became a member of the [[College of Physicians of London]] in 1845, and was elected a fellow in 1849. He published a paper of observations on the minute structure of the [[liver]], which led to his election as fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1850. In 1851 he was elected physician to [[St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington]], and continued on the staff of there till his death.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Jones attained a reputation as a [[histologist]] and as a clinical observer. In the College of Physicians he was junior censor in 1863–4 and senior censor in 1886, and in 1888 a vice-president. In 1865 he delivered the [[Lumleian lectures]] on the pathology of the nervous system.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Resident in Green Street, [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]], Jones in later years, moved to [[Montagu Square]], London. He died there of cancer of the stomach, 30 September 1890.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Jones published with [[Edward Henry Sieveking]], in 1854, a ''Manual of Pathological Anatomy'', and in 1864 ''Clinical Observations on Functional Nervous Disorders''. He wrote also papers in medical journals, the ''Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London'', and the ''Transactions of the Pathological Society''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
Jones married in 1851 Louisa Holt, and had two sons, who both went into the medical profession.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Contraceptive security''' (CS) is a situation in which people are able to reliably choose, obtain, and use quality [[Birth Control|contraceptives]] for [[family planning]] and the prevention of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity|title=Commodity Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers primarily to efforts undertaken in [[Developing country|developing countries]] to ensure contraceptive availability as an integral part of family planning programs.

Organizations, usually government health agencies, work to ensure clients have long-term access to a range of high quality contraceptives and other essential health supplies. A framework and tool, the Strategic Pathway to Reproductive Health Commodity Security (SPARHCS), was developed in 2004 by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and partners to help countries identify and prioritize key commodity security issues; assess current capacity for commodity security among country or regional programs, systems and policies; and shape commodity security strategic plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/cssparhcs|title=SPARHCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures taken to provide contraceptive security may include strengthening contraceptive supply chains, forming CS committees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/cscommitteetoolkit|title=CS Committee Toolkit}}&lt;/ref&gt; product quality assurance, promoting supportive policy environments, and examining financing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/csfinancing|title=Financing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening commodity security requires routine monitoring of donor and government commitment, policies, stakeholder coordination, and supply chain information. Tools including the CS Indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/rdr?p_url=/dlvr_content/resources/allpubs/logisticsbriefs/CSIndiImprFPProg_1.pdf|title=How Contraceptive Security Indicators Can Be Used to Improve Family Planning Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CS Index offer ways of measuring contraceptive security, and allow comparisons over time and across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/csmeasuring|title=Measuring Commodity Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent analysis of 48 countries’ CS Index scores between 2003-2012 indicates that all regions improved on measures of supply chain, financing, health and social environment, access, and utilization, with the greatest progress made in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/rdr?p_url=/dlvr_content/resources/allpubs/factsheets/CSIndexbkltEng.pdf|title=Contraceptive Security Index 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsidized products, particularly [[condoms]] and [[oral contraceptives]], may be provided to increase accessibility for low-income people.

A '''direct acoustic cochlear implant''' - also '''DACI''' - is an [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[Cochlear implant|implant]] which converts [[sound]] in [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] vibrations that stimulate directly the [[perilymph]] inside the [[cochlea]]. The hearing function of the external and middle [[ear]] is being taken over by a little [[actuator|motor]] of a [[cochlear implant]], directly stimulating the cochlea. With a DACI, people with no or almost no residual hearing but with a still functioning inner ear, can again perceive speech, sounds and music.
DACI is an official product category, as indicated by the nomenclature of [[GMDN]].&lt;ref name="GMDN"&gt;http://www.gmdnagency.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A DACI tries to provide an answer for people with hearing problems for which no solution exists today. People with some problems at the level of the cochlea can be helped with a [[hearing aid]]. A hearing aid will absorb the incoming sound from a microphone, and offer enhanced through the natural way. For larger reinforcements, this may cause problems with [[feedback]] and [[distortion]]. A hearing aid also simply provides more loudness, no more resolution. Users will view this often as, "all sounds louder, but I understand nothing more than before."
Once a hearing aid offers no solution anymore, one can switch to a [[cochlear implant]]. A Cochlear implant captures the sound and sends it electrically, through the cochlea, to the auditory nerve. In this way, completely deaf patients can perceive sounds again.
However, As soon as there are problems not only at the level of the cochlea, but also in the middle ear (the so-called [[conductive]] losses), then there are more efficient ways to get sound to the partially functioning cochlea.
The most obvious solution is a [[bone anchored hearing aid|BAHA]], which brings the sound to the cochlea via bone conduction.
However, patients who have both problems with the cochlea, as with the middle ear (i.e. patients with mixed losses), none of the above solutions is ideal.
To this end, the direct acoustic cochlear implant was developed. A DACI brings the sound directly to the cochlea, and provides the most natural way of sound amplification.

== History ==
The first DACI was implanted in Hannover. In Belgium, the first DACI was implanted at the Catholic University Hospital of Leuven.&lt;ref name="Codacs in Leuven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nieuws.kuleuven.be/node/10986|title=Oorchirurgen UZ Leuven plaatsen nieuw type hoorimplantaat bij ernstig slechthorende patiënten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Netherlands, the Radboud clinic in Nijmegen was the first while in Poland it was first implanted at the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Codacs in Warsaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.ifps.org.pl/en/2012/06/a-new-chance-for-the-impaired-people/|title=First in Poland CODACS implantation surgery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|date=April 2010}}
[[Disease surveillance|Surveillance]] for [[communicable diseases]] is the main [[public health]] surveillance activity in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. Currently, the [[disease surveillance]] system in China has three major components:&lt;ref&gt;David Ho. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/full/435421a.html;jsessionid=3805314D3192FBAF970D76F37ED1FA77 Is China prepared for microbial threats?] Nature 435, 421-422 (26 May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''National Disease Reporting System''' (NDRS): The system covers the entire population (1.3 billion persons) living in all the provinces, prefectures, and counties that make up [[mainland China]]. Thirty-five communicable diseases are reportable under this system.
* '''Nationwide Disease Surveillance Points''' (DSPs): This surveillance system, comprising 145 reporting sites selected by [[stratified sampling|stratified]] [[cluster sampling|cluster]] [[random sampling]], covers a 1% representative sample of China's population.
*Surveillance system for specific [[infectious diseases]], [[occupational diseases]], [[food poisoning]], etc.

There are 35 notifiable infectious diseases, which are divided into Classes A, B, and C. The functions of the surveillance include explaining the natural history of infectious diseases, describing the distribution of case occurrence, triggering disease-control effort, monitoring epidemic of infectious diseases during [[Natural disasters in China|natural disasters]], predicting and controlling epidemics and providing the base of policy adjustment.

Data collected through the disease surveillance network serve as the basis for formulating health policies and devising strategies for preventing disease. A computerized reporting system for notifiable diseases has been established that links China's 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Mechanisms for providing timely feedback to units that report data and for systematically assessing the quality of those data are important attributes of this system.

==National Disease Reporting System (NDRS)==

In 1959, a system for reporting infectious diseases was established. Data collected at the village level are reported to prevention units in township hospitals. From the prevention units, data are transmitted through county health and epidemic-prevention stations to provincial centers and then on to the [[Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine]]. Since 1977, the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Health]] has convened annual meetings to analyze these data on the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.

In 1987, a [[Nationwide Antiepidemic Computer Telecommunication Network]] (NATCN) was established as an official information system for the National Disease Reporting System (NDRS). The Ministry of Public Health and the provincial centers of health and epidemic prevention support this network, which monitors disease [[epidemic]]s at various levels within the public health system. As technical facilities of the network improve, use of the NACTN will expand into all aspects of public health surveillance.

===Computer Network Development===

After receiving approval from the Ministry of Public Health in 1986, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) began to establish a nationwide [[microcomputer]] [[communication network]]. The purpose was to link all the country's provincial centers of health and epidemic prevention in an effort to improve the system for preventing epidemics. After a year was spent establishing and modifying the system, a network that connected the capitals of 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities began operating in 1987. The primary function of the network was to collect data on the morbidity and mortality associated with reportable communicable diseases, to obtain information on [[outbreak]]s of other types of disease, and to provide monthly and annual reports to local and national health authorities.

===Morbidity and Mortality Monthly Reports (MMMR)===

Each month, all provinces transmit [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]]-level summaries of the numbers of cases and deaths associated with 35 notifiable communicable diseases to the Academy of Preventive Medicine. Reports are sent on the 13th to 15th day of each month via the NACTN. At the central node of NACTN, the Academy's Center of [[Computer Science]] and [[Health Statistics]] compiles and analyzes the data, provides feedback to the provinces, and creates national summaries within one week. Copies of the MMMR are distributed regularly to health authorities at various levels.

===Morbidity and Mortality Annual Report (MMAR)===

Each January, all provinces provide [[wikt:supplementary|supplementary]] reports to revise and update the monthly reports submitted during the previous year. [[Ageing|Age]]- and [[Employment|occupation]]-specific reports of mortality and morbidity are also submitted at this time. In April, after the surveillance data have been reviewed at the national meeting on epidemic diseases, the MMAR and other analytical reports are distributed.

===Computer Telecommunication of Surveillance Data: Technical Issues===

Until the 1980s, no public [[digital communications]] system was available in China. In establishing the nationwide communication network, [[modem]]s with common [[Plain old telephone service|analog telephone]] lines had to be used. Making this large communication system run successfully posed major challenges. With some of the problems in mind, the system was designed to have strong fault-tolerant redundancy - with the capability for self-correction - to overcome the myriad of problems caused by poor-quality telephone lines and cumbersome [[telephone exchange]] systems.

The NACTN was enhanced by incorporating the following functions.

* [[Breakpoint]] recording with resumption of operations: When telephone lines break during data transmission, the system is designed to record the break-point status for every case. This allows data transmission to resume automatically when line connections are reestablished.
* Automatic node scanning and re-circling: This feature allows the system to scan the status of all network nodes to allocate telephone lines and thereby optimize the strategy for maintaining line connections. This important mechanism improves the efficiency of the system and makes data transmission more successful.
* Automatic sorting/batching, rescheduling, and executing of transmissions: The system can execute all necessary network commands to carry out the communication task arranged by command files of the MMMR/MMAR system. The system adjusts the path as needed in order to complete transmissions that have been delayed because of problems in the system.
* [[Data compression]] and [[data security|security]]: Before transmission, data are processed by a "two-phase compressing" procedure. Data file size can be compressed more than 90%, resulting in shorter [[online]] transmission times. Thus, receiving data from the 30 provincial reporting centers on the network requires only about an hour of online operation. Compression also makes data transmission more secure.

====System Support for NACTN====

* [[Personnel]]: In each province, the computer divisions have selected one or two persons who are dedicated to operating the province's nodes of the NACTN. In 1987, a working group convened to coordinate computer applications and activities. Several times each year, persons from provincial centers meet to discuss network problems and to devise solutions.
* Hardware and software: Special software has been developed: YQS for collecting and processing information and producing reports and TXS for managing network communications.

====Future Developments of the NACTN====

* Accumulating information
* Updating techniques
* Establishing subnetworks within provinces

In collaboration with the NACTN, a few provinces have established subnetworks to facilitate local communication.

====Existing Databases====

* National report on infectious disease
* National disease surveillance
* National report on occupational disease
* National report on outbreaks of food poisoning
* National survey data bases: Drinking water quality; Human-parasite infections; Nutritional surveys; Nutrition for the elderly; Child-nutrition surveillance; Diarrheal disease of children; Smoking and health.

==National Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs)==

In the period 1980-1989, the network of DSPs covered 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities that had a combined population of 10 million persons (&lt;1% of China's population). When the network was proposed in 1978, it was not possible to obtain a population-based [[random sample]]. Because participation in the network was voluntary, the data collected were biased, even after attempts were made to adjust the sample to improve national representativeness. Persons covered by the DSPs tended to be from the upper-middle socioeconomic stratum.

In 1989, efforts were begun to select a new sample of surveillance points. We used stratified cluster random sampling to select 145 DSPs in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, which have a combined population structure similar to that shown in the national census. Data on individual births and deaths, as well as on infectious diseases and certain types of behaviors (e.g., [[tobacco smoking]]), are recorded. At the household level, information on socioeconomic indicators, health-care conditions, and environmental factors is collected.

Information obtained from the DSPs is compared with data obtained from the National Disease Reporting System to enable [[health policy|policymakers]] to estimate more accurately the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with infectious disease. More importantly, policy makers can evaluate information from the DSPs in relation to the economic development, cultural background, and health-care-service use by the population covered by this surveillance system.

Data collected at DSPs:

* Household information: includes data on number of members, income, health-care situation, water supply, and toilet facilities.
* Individual information: includes data on occupation, education, births, deaths, episodes of infectious diseases, pregnancy, [[lactation]], feeding, and [[vaccination]] status.

Each month, data collected by the township hospitals and village prevention units are submitted to the country, which then conveys the information through the provincial centers to the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. The Academy distributes monthly reports to the Ministry of Public Health, to provincial health authorities, and to all DSPs. An annual report is also published and distributed.

===Surveys and Investigations===

Surveys and investigations are conducted by the DSPs to improve the quality and promote the use of data collected. These surveys and investigations are designed to generate information that can be used by policymakers. At present, the following activities are being undertaken:

* Characterizing risk factors and patterns of death among adults;
* Identifying factors that influence the quality of data collected by DSPs;
* Developing methods to monitor [[Chronic diseases in China]];
* Devising approaches to promote use of data from DSPs by policymakers.

===Development of the Network of Disease Surveillance Points===

Samples of persons already monitored under existing DSPs will be used for [[data collection]] to address important and emerging public health issues. Issues to be addressed include a prospective study of the health consequences of smoking, an assessment of drinking-water quality and disease occurrence, an evaluation of the national "Expanded Program on [[Immunization]]", and an epidemiologic study of [[hepatitis]]. By selecting samples in this fashion, investigators can correlate data from these special studies with data routinely collected under the system of DSPs.

==Surveillance of Specific Infectious diseases==

The following are examples of surveillance for specific [[infectious diseases]].

* For each 10-day period during the summer, cases of [[cholera]] - diagnosed by microbiologic or clinical criteria - from all the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities are reported to the national level; this information is compiled and conveyed back to the provincial reporting sources.
* In eight provinces, surveillance among subgroups of the population with elevated risk for infection with [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) is conducted at the national [[diagnostic]] laboratories by using immediate reports and confirmatory testing.
* A surveillance network for epidemic [[hemorrhagic fever]] has been established for immediate reporting of cases. During the peak season, surveillance for disease among [[rodent]]s is conducted to provide an early-warning system at the local level.

==Quality control of data collection==

[[Quality control]] (QC) in association with [[data collection]] (DC) has been an important component of disease-surveillance activities in China.

* In November of each year, the NDRS actively surveys hospitals and households to identify the proportion of notifiable diseases that went unreported. During a recent year, for example, the proportion of class A and B infectious diseases that was unreported was 27%; this proportion was used to correct the total annual estimate of morbidity attributable to infectious diseases.
* Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs) are surveyed annually to estimate underreporting of births, deaths, and morbidity due to infectious diseases. From 1990 to 1991, for example, reporting of morbidity from infectious diseases improved. The proportions of unreported births, age-specific deaths, and disease-specific deaths are also reported. In 1991, a team from the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine evaluated the quality of data reported from 18 DSPs located in nine provinces. In their study, the evaluation team identified factors that influenced data quality.

==Use of surveillance data for control of disease==

Surveillance data have been used to implement and evaluate public health programs.

;Monitoring morbidity from infectious disease during heavy flooding in 1991

When six provinces around the [[Yangtze River]] were heavily flooded in 1991, the central government expressed serious concern about disease-prevention activities in these provinces. In response, experts were dispatched to the flooded area, and prevention guidelines were developed and distributed to the affected provinces. Simultaneously, a system for collecting daily reports of disease activity was established. Every 3 days, DSP data on infectious disease morbidity were compared with data from previous years to identify potential outbreaks. For example, rates of hepatitis during the flood were compared with rates for the comparable time periods from the preceding 2 years. Data collected from June to October 1991 indicated that infectious diseases had been controlled effectively during the flood.

;Forecasting the epidemiologic transition in China

In a study sponsored by the [[World Bank]], data collected in DSPs in the period 1986-1989 have been used to study the epidemiologic transition in China. Mortality from leading causes of death was projected for 2010 and 2030. After risk factors were assessed and the impact of preventive programs on these [[chronic diseases in China|chronic diseases]] was estimated, mortality rates were recalculated. These analyses were used to develop recommendations for program planning to the Ministry of Health.

;Prediction and control of meningitis

After surveillance data on morbidity from [[meningitis]] in China were reviewed by [[empirical analysis]] and [[Boyer's Theorem]], it was predicted that morbidity from this disease would peak in 1984 or 1985. Additional analyses suggested that the vaccination program that had been conducted for several years, which provided vaccination only for children &lt;12 months of age, would not be adequate to control the predicted upsurge in disease. Therefore, a new vaccination program was adopted that expanded coverage to all children &lt;5 years of age in areas in which surveillance data (including [[blood serum|serum]] epidemiologic data) identified a high risk of meningitis outbreaks. The results in [[Henan Province]] suggested that the intensified vaccination coverage was successful in decreasing rates of meningitis.

;Strategy for vaccination for poliomyelitis

After data from 1988 to 1989 on rates of [[poliomyelitis]] and vaccination coverage were reviewed, high-risk areas were identified. In these areas, persons received supplementary vaccination in 1989-1990. By 1991, rates of poliomyelitis had begun to fall.

'''Electrodeionization''' is a [[water treatment]] technology that utilizes electricity, ion exchange membranes and resin to [[deionize]] water and separate dissolved [[ions]] (impurities) from water. It differs from other water purification technologies in that it is done without the use of chemical treatments and is usually a polishing treatment to [[reverse osmosis]] (RO). There are also EDI units that are often referred to as '''continuous electrodeionization''' ('''CEDI''')  since the electric current regenerates the resin mass continuously. CEDI technique can achieve very high purity, with conductivity below 0.1 µS/cm. Recently, Argonne National Laboratory developed a process called Resin-Wafer Electrodeionization 
(RW-EDI), which uses a unique porous resin wafer mold made from immobilized loose ion-exchange resin beads. The resin wafer material enhances mass transfer between solid (resin bead) and liquid (feed solution) phases to achieve a high purity, especially when treating impaired or&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b02455|title = Development of a Resin Wafer Electrodeionization Process for Impaired Water Desalination with High Energy Efficiency and Productivity|journal = ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering|volume = 5|issue = 4|pages = 2942–2948|year = 2017|last1 = Pan|first1 = Shu-Yuan|last2 = Snyder|first2 = Seth W|last3 = Ma|first3 = Hwong-Wen|last4 = Lin|first4 = Yupo J|last5 = Chiang|first5 = Pen-Chi}}&lt;/ref&gt; brackish water.

==Applications==
When fed with low [[Total dissolved solids|TDS]] feed (e.g., feed purified by RO), the product can reach very high purity levels (e.g., [[Purified water#Electrical Conductivity|18 Megohms/cm]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labmanager.com/?articles.view/articleNo/3673/], Resistivity / Conductivity Measurement of Purified Water, Lab Manager Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;). The ion exchange resins act to retain the ions, allowing these to be transported across the ion exchange membranes. The main applications of EDI technology, such as that supplied by Ionpure, E-cell and SnowPure, are in electronics, pharmaceuticals and power generation.

One important aspect in the water treatment application is that some types of EDI needs to have feed water that is free from CO2, as well as other dissolved gasses, since these put unnecessary strain on the EDI unit and will reduce performance.

==Theory==
An electrode in an [[electrochemical cell]] is referred to as either an [[anode]] or a [[cathode]], terms that were coined by [[Michael Faraday]]. The anode is defined as the electrode at which [[electrons]] leave the cell and [[oxidation]] occurs, and the cathode as the electrode at which electrons enter the cell and [[redox|reduction]] occurs. Each electrode may become either the anode or the cathode depending on the [[voltage]] applied to the cell. A bipolar electrode is an electrode that functions as the anode of one cell and the cathode of another cell.

Each cell consists of an electrode and an [[electrolyte]] with [[ions]] that undergo either oxidation or reduction. An electrolyte is a substance containing free ions that behaves as an electrically conductive medium. Because they generally consist of ions in solution, electrolytes are also known as ionic solutions, but molten electrolytes and solid electrolytes are also possible. They are sometimes referred to in abbreviated jargon as [[lytes]].

Water is passed between an anode (positive electrode) and a cathode (negative electrode). Ion-selective membranes allow the positive ions to separate from the water toward the negative electrode and the negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water results.

==Resin-Water Electrodeionization==
RW-EDI is a process that targets the desalination of impaired water or water with salt levels of 1,000 - 10,000 ppm. RW-EDI process uses a porous ion exchange resin wafer with 195 cm2 cross-section surface area. Water is fed through the wafer, while an electric current is applied to setup. In between resin wafer compartments, there are concentrate compartments, where brine flows out of the system. An anode is setup on the left side of the setup and a cathode is setup on the right side of the setup. The electric current (supplied from various energy sources) charges the ions that make up the contaminants. The positively charged ions flow toward the cathode and are rinsed out in the concentrate stream, and the negatively charged ions flow toward the anode and are rinsed out in another concentrate stream. Purified water flows out through the opposite side of the compartment. The resin-wafer technology increases the energy efficiency of the desalination process significantly, especially when testing impaired water. RO processes have an energy efficiency of 4%, whereas RW-EDI has an energy efficiency ranging from 35-65%. Argonne National Laboratory estimates that 402.83 GWh of energy can be saved a day, if this technology is implemented for the processing of wastewater from industrial plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b02455|title = Development of a Resin Wafer Electrodeionization Process for Impaired Water Desalination with High Energy Efficiency and Productivity|journal = ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering|volume = 5|issue = 4|pages = 2942–2948|year = 2017|last1 = Pan|first1 = Shu-Yuan|last2 = Snyder|first2 = Seth W|last3 = Ma|first3 = Hwong-Wen|last4 = Lin|first4 = Yupo J|last5 = Chiang|first5 = Pen-Chi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11596">'''E-referrals''' or '''electronic referrals''' or [[Electronic Consultation (E-Consult)|'''electronic consultation''']] is an electronic platform that enables the seamless transfer of patient information from a primary to a secondary treating practitioner's client management system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nehta.gov.au/component/docman/cat_view/161-business-packages/56-ecommunications-in-practice/60-ereferral eReferral], National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic referral (E-referral)|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/pcps/coordination/e_referral/|work=Victorian Government Health Information|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-referrals have fast become the best replacement of paper-based referrals, and hold great potential toward the ultimate goal of seamless communication and information sharing between practitioners.&lt;ref name="Health Informatics New Zealand"&gt;{{cite web |author=Li Tian, healthAlliance |url=http://www.hinz.org.nz/journal/2011/04/Improving-Knowledge-Management-between-Primary-and-Secondary-Healthcare--an-e-Referral-Project-/1041#T1 |title=Health Informatics New Zealand |publisher=Hinz.org.nz |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2013-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116190500/http://www.hinz.org.nz/journal/2011/04/Improving-Knowledge-Management-between-Primary-and-Secondary-Healthcare--an-e-Referral-Project-/1041#T1 |archivedate=2012-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Electronic referrals can result in considerable benefits for service providers. Firstly at the patient level, e-referrals ensure significant improvements to follow-up care coordination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hysong|first=Sylvia J.|author2=Adol Esquivel |author3=Dean F. Sittig |author4=Lindsey A. Paul |author5=Donna Espadas |author6=Simran Singh |author7=Hardeep Singh |title=Towards successful coordination of electronic health record based-referrals: a qualitative analysis|journal=Implementation Science|year=2011|volume=6|issue=84|url=http://www.implementationscience.com/content/pdf/1748-5908-6-84.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   by the creation of accurate and timely referrals. Medical decisions are enhanced as each provider involved has the full patient information available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim|first1=Y |last2=Chen|first2=AH |last3=Keith|first3=E |last4=Yee|first4=HF, Jr |last5=Kushel|first5=MB |title=Not perfect, but better: primary care providers’ experiences with electronic referrals in a safety net health system.|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|year=2009|volume=24|issue=5|pages=614–9|doi=10.1007/s11606-009-0955-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Duplicate tests are eliminated as patient information is being shared from one provider to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiciansmoneydigest.com/blogs/financial-health-check-up/03-2011/Reaping-the-Benefits-of-Electronic-Patient-Referral |title=Reaping the Benefits of Electronic Patient Referral |publisher=Physiciansmoneydigest.com |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of communication is improved by removing delays related to paper-based transmission, ensuring a faster response rate. Also transmission of referral information is secured, upholding [[Consumer privacy]].

Benefits can also be seen beyond the patient level, e-referrals can improve practice productivity. Documentation quality is improved by removing the use of illegible handwriting as well as poor quality faxed documentation. E-referrals create a logical and standardised referral template. Auto-population of clinical information ensures referrals are more clinically complete. There are also significant long term operational cost savings between electronic and paper based referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The cost benefit of electronic patient referrals in Denmark summary report |url=http://www2.accaglobal.com/pubs/members/publications/sector_booklets/healthcare_sector/benefit_denmark.pdf |publisher=ACCA and MedCom |accessdate=4 November 2013 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers==
A variety of barriers exist that inhibit the electronic [[General practitioner]] referral pathway to secondary care. These include the high start-up costs such as that of hardware, software and training needed to produce, process, send and receive each electronic referral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim-Hwang|first1=Judy E. |first2=Alice Hm |last2=Chen |first3=Douglas S. |last3=Bell |first4=David |last4=Guzman |first5=Hal F., Jr. |last5=Yee |first6=Margot B. |last6=Kushel |title = Evaluating Electronic Referrals for Specialty Care at a Public Hospital|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|year=2010|volume=25|issue=10|pages=1123–8|doi=10.1007/s11606-010-1402-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties faced when integrating different information systems to allow technology interface. As well as a slow response due to a deep rooted resistance to change and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian State-wide Forum on Electronic Referral|url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/pcps/downloads/publications/e-referral_forum_summary.pdf|publisher=Department of Human Services|accessdate=4 November 2013|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture Framework==
[[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) is an international standard developed by the organisation [[Health Level 7]] International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/Clinical-Document-Architecture-CDA |title=What is Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Searchhealthit.techtarget.com |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlining the unvarying structure and presentation for clinical documents like that of e-referrals. 
The CDA:
*Provides a consistent structure for e-referral clinical information
*Guarantees receiving systems can understand and interpret e-referral information 
*Allows the automation process of forwarding e-referrals to the correct department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iemml.org.au/ereferrals-and-discharges | title=eReferrals and discharges | work=Medicare Local: Inner East Melbourne | accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Review==
The e-referral initiative has been acknowledged globally, with many countries having successfully adopted the system. Including [[Finland]] who implemented the e-referral in 1990, [[Denmark]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannaby|first=S.|author2=Wanscher CE |author3=Pedersen CD |author4=Voss H. |title=The Cost Benefit of Electronic Patient Referrals in Denmark|publisher=MedCom / ACCA|location=London|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norway]] in 1996, [[Netherlands]] in 2001, [[New Zealand]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="e-referral guide"&gt;[http://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/in-print/2011/may-2011/18-may-2011/new-guidelines-to-test-e-referrals.aspx New guidelines to test e-referrals]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="Heimly"&gt;Heimly V.

===Finland===
[[Finland]] was the first country to implement an e-referral system, introduced in the capital city of [[Helsinki]] in 1990. The e-referral project was put in place to allow for a more cost-effective way of treating a bigger number of patients, increase productivity and to improve access to healthcare. There were two hundred general practitioner practices and one million residents originally involved in the project. It took twelve years but by 2002, a total of sixty-seven thousand e-referrals had been sent.&lt;ref name="Health Informatics New Zealand" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wootton R, Harno K and Reponen J. Organisational Aspects of e-Referrals. Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare  2003; 9 (Suppl 2): 76-79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
[[Denmark]] was the second country to introduce an electronic referral system. This was done so through a nationwide MedCom project implemented in 1995 entitled ''The Danish Health Care Data Network''. This TeleMed project aimed to expand the electronic communication between health service parties, and e-referrals were a part of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TeleMed |url=http://www.medcom.dk/dwn445.pdf |publisher=MedCom-the Danish  Health Care Data Network |accessdate=4 November 2013 |date=December 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305034940/http://www.medcom.dk/dwn445.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, forty-one percent of all referrals sent were electronic. Causing a “significant improvement in access to care, quality of care, efficiency and productivity of the health sector”.&lt;ref name="Health Informatics New Zealand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Norway===
The use of e-referrals began in [[Norway]] in 1996, and has been much slower than that of other countries. By January 2009, less than twenty-five percent of all referrals were sent electronically. Remarkably lower than that of [[Denmark]] or [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="Health Informatics New Zealand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heimly"/&gt;

===Netherlands===
The development of e-referrals in the [[Netherlands]] began in 2001. With one hundred GP’s initially involved, by December 2004 five thousand e-referrals had been sent.&lt;ref name="Health Informatics New Zealand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heimly"/&gt;

===New Zealand===
The e-referral project was launched within [[New Zealand]] Hutt District in 2007. The project aimed to “provide complete and relevant referral information electronically and make it available to practitioners involved in the patient’s care to allow prompt and appropriate clinical decision-making.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hisac.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexcm/hisac2-actionzone-ereferrals Health Information Strategy Action Committee, Action Zone 8 - eReferrals Preliminary Scope and Approach]; 2007 [cited 1 Nov 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601223209/http://www.hisac.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexcm/hisac2-actionzone-ereferrals |date=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, ninety percent of all referrals were electronic. The Hutt Valley District has been acknowledge as the leading district in electronic referrals in [[New Zealand]] by the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)]].&lt;ref name="Health Informatics New Zealand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="e-referral guide" /&gt;

===Australia===
Most recent to initiate an e-referral system was [[Australia]] in June 2009. Approximately thirty [[General practitioners]] from the [[Australian Capital Territory]] used the electronic system to refer to sixty outpatient service specialists. With many plans underway to increase and expand to other nearby areas of [[Australia]] &lt;ref name="Health Informatics New Zealand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heimly" /&gt;

The Noelle S2200 ("''Victoria''") is a full scale healthcare education simulator produced by '''Gaumard Scientific''' that simulates a mother in labor.
The Noelle line of simulators&lt;ref name="mlive_20141021"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minbcnews_20141001"/&gt; including the Victoria model can reproduce events seen during a full-term or premature delivery.  Delivery can be programmed to mimic many situations from a normal vaginal birth to a [[C-section]].&lt;ref name="bizjournals_20140915"/&gt;  Complications including breech presentation, [[shoulder dystocia]], maternal bleeding or umbilical cord prolapse can also be simulated.&lt;ref name="obgyn_20140925"/&gt; Healthcare personnel can thus hone their skills addressing serious situations that may not occur frequently before working with real patients.&lt;ref name="miamiherald_20140914"/&gt; 
Victoria is tetherless and contains a rechargeable battery that can operate Victoria for about 8 hours as she is moved through a continuum of care.  Additionally, actual medical equipment, such as a fetal monitor, a [[pulse oximeter]] and a [[blood pressure monitor]] can be used directly on Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaumard Victoria product page|url=http://www.gaumard.com/victoria/|website=Gaumard.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Munro of Auchinbowie,''' originally '''of Bearcrofts''' was a Scottish born military officer of the late 17th century. He was the first [[Munro of Auchinbowie]].&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie "&gt;[[John Alexander Inglis|Inglis, John Alexander]]. (1911). ''[https://archive.org/details/monrosofauchinbo00ingl The Monros of Auchinbowie and Cognate Families]''. Edinburgh, privately printed by T and A Constable, printers to His Majesty.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==

George Munro was the eldest son of [[Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts]] who himself was a descendant of the [[Munro of Milntown]] family.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;[[Alexander Mackenzie (historian)|Mackenzie, Alexander]]. (1898) ''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofmunroso00mack#page/304/mode/2up History of the Munros of Fowlis]''. pp. 265 - 277, 305 - 312 and 314 - 321.&lt;/ref&gt; The Munro of Milntown family descend from a younger son of [[Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis]] (d.1425).&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt; In the published genealogies of the family [[Alexander Mackenzie (historian)|Alexander Mackenzie]]'s designation of "of Bearcrofts" and "of Auchinbowie" is different to that given by [[John Alexander Inglis]].&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt; The line that Mackenzie designates of Auchinbowie did not come into possession of the Auchinbowie property until the second head of the family, [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]], who was the son of [[John Monro (surgeon)|John Monro]], who himself was a younger son of Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts, bought the property from the grandson of the George Munro who is the subject of this article.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt;

==Military career==

During the [[Jacobite rising of 1689]], George Munro fought for the Scottish [[Covenanter]]s as a Captain in the [[Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)|Cameronian Regiment]] at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] where the Jacobites were defeated.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; The Battle of Dunkeld is said to have lasted four to five hours and the Cameronian regiment of 1200 men was outnumbered by a force of 5000 Jacobites.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; In the first hour of the battle the Colonel of the Cameronian Regiment, [[William Cleland]], was killed and the Major was wounded so the command fell to Captain George Munro.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; It is said that they had to use lead stripped off the roofs of houses and melted in the ground for ammunition.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; The Jacobites were eventually defeated.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt;

After the Battle of Dunkeld, Captain George Munro was promoted to Major and was put in command of an independent company of foot in [[Perthshire]].&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; Later as a Major in Sir Charles Graham's Regiment of Foot he fought at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Siege of Namur in 1695]].&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt;

==Family==

George Munro married Margaret Bruce of Auchinbowie in 1693.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt; Margarat was the second daughter of Robert Bruce of Auchinbowie.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; She had no brothers, and on her father's death the property fell to her elder sister Janet Bruce.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; However Janet's husband, Captain William Bruce, killed another gentleman in a drunken brawl and he fled from justice, leaving Janet to cope with the debts of the property, which proved too much for her.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; In 1702 Janet Bruce sold the property to her brother-in-law, Major George Munro, who thus became the [[Munro of Auchinbowie|Laird of Auchinbowie]].&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; They had the following children:

#Alexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie who according to Inglis married Anne, daughter of [[Stewart baronets|Sir Robert Stewart, Lord Tillicultry]],&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; but who according Mackenzie, designating this line as of Bearcrofts, died before his own father.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt; However, Mackenzie, page 311, does state ''We are not at all clear about these marriages, and think there must have been another head of the house which is here missed out.''&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt; According to Inglis, Alexander of Auchinbowie's son was George Munro (3rd) of Auchinbowie, who sold the property to his cousin Alexander Monro (primus), son of John Monro, son of Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts.&lt;ref name="MonroOfAuchinbowie"/&gt; It is Alexander Monro (primus) and his father John who Mackenzie designates as the second and first Monros of Auchinbowie.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;
#Margarat Munro, who was born in 1707. 
#[[George Monro (British officer)|George Monro]], who is believed to have been born in [[Ireland]] in about 1700 at Clonfin in county [[Longford]].&lt;ref name="Inglis2"&gt;Holden, James A. and Inglis, John Alexander.

'''Head pressing''' is a [[veterinary]] condition characterized by standing close to a wall or corner face-first without moving.{{clarification needed|date=September 2015}} This condition is seen in pets such as dogs and cats, and also other animals such as cows, horses, and goats. Head pressing is usually a sign of a neurological disorder, especially of the forebrain (e.g., [[prosencephalon]] disease),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/neurological/c_multi_headpressing&lt;/ref&gt; or of toxicity due to liver damage, such as [[portosystemic shunt]] and [[hepatic encephalopathy]].&lt;ref name="FaerberDVM1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cody W. Faerber|author2=Cody W. Faerber, DVM,S. Mario Durrant, DVM,Jane Fishman Leon, DVM|author3=S. Mario Durrant|title=Canine Medicine and Disease Prevention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-pU4pfEGqggC&amp;pg=RA1-PA67|date=1 June 1999|publisher=Animal Health Publications|isbn=978-0-9701159-1-1|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be distinguished from [[bunting (animal behavior)|bunting]], which is a normal behavior found in healthy animals.

==Possible causes==
* Prosencephalon disease
* Liver shunt
* [[Brain tumor]]
* Metabolic disorder (e.g., [[hyponatremia]] or hyperatremia)
* [[Stroke]]
* Infection of the nervous system ([[rabies]], parasites, bacterial, viral or fungal infection)
* Head trauma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dogs Who Head Press Should See A Vet ASAP.

===Liver neurotoxicity===
A [[liver shunt]] is a congenital or acquired condition that may lead to toxicity and head pressing. Additional symptoms include drooling and slow maturation early in development. Older animals may suffer from liver cirrhosis.{{citation required|date=February 2017}}

===Viral causes===
Several viruses that cause [[encephalitis]] or [[meningoencephalitis]] can lead to the neurological sign of head pressing, see for example [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] and [[Bovine herpesvirus 5]].&lt;ref name="McVeyKennedy2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

'''Hypochondroplasia''' ('''HCH''') is a developmental disorder caused by an [[autosomal dominant]] genetic defect in the [[fibroblast growth factor receptor]] 3 gene (''[[FGFR3]]'') that results in a disproportionately short stature, [[micromelia]]&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bober|first1=Michael B.|last2=Bellus|first2=Gary A.|last3=Nikkel|first3=Sarah M.|last4=Tiller|first4=George E.|title=Hypochondroplasia|journal=GeneReviews(®)|date=1 January 1993|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1477/|accessdate=18 December 2016|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle}}update 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and a head that appears large in comparison with the underdeveloped portions of the body. It is classified as short-limbed [[dwarfism]].&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=hypochondroplasia |title=Hypochondroplasia - Genetics Home Reference |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dwarfism: MedlinePlus|url=https://medlineplus.gov/dwarfism.html|website=NIH|publisher=NIH|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Individuals affected by this disorder appear normal at [[birth]]. As the infant grows, however, their arms and legs do not develop properly, and their body becomes thicker and shorter than normal.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt; The following are characteristics consistent with this condition:&lt;ref name="nih2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypochondroplasia             {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6724/hypochondroplasia|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brachydactyly]]
*Short stature
*[[Micromelia]]
*[[Skeletal dysplasia]]
*Abnormality of [[femur]]

==Cause==
Hypochondroplasia is transmitted as an [[autosomal dominant]] trait affecting the ''FGFR3'' gene on [[chromosome 4]]p16.3. There is currently no cure for this condition.&lt;ref name=Reference/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:PDB 1m61 EBI.jpg|thumb|100 px|TYK]]
This disorder results from mutations in the proximal [[tyrosine kinase]] domain of the [[FGFR3]] gene.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;This gene plays an important role in [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]], playing a part in regulating activities such as [[cell division]], [[Cell migration|migration]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]].{{medical citation needed|date=December 2016}} 

Hypochondroplasia can result from p.&amp;nbsp;Lys650Asn as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NM_000142.4(FGFR3):c.1950G&gt;C (p.Lys650Asn) AND Hypochondroplasia - ClinVar - NCBI|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000017756/|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nih/&gt; In FGFR3, some 20 different mutations have been associated to hypochondroplasia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reference|first1=Genetics Home|title=FGFR3 gene|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FGFR3#conditions|website=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it seems to have a role in skeletal dysplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foldynova-Trantirkova |first1=Silvie |last2=Wilcox |first2=William R. |last3=Krejci |first3=Pavel |title=Sixteen years and counting: the current understanding of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) signaling in skeletal dysplasias |journal=Human Mutation |date=21 December 2016 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=29–41 |doi=10.1002/humu.21636|pmc=3240715 |issn=1059-7794 |pmid=22045636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of this condition can be done via [[X-rays]] (with lack of normal distance [[Lumbar vertebrae|L1]] to [[Lumbar vertebrae|L5]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMIM Entry             - # 146000 - HYPOCHONDROPLASIA; HCH|url=https://omim.org/entry/146000|website=omim.org|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally genetic testing is available to ascertain hypochondroplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypochondroplasia - Conditions - GTR - NCBI|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/conditions/C0410529/|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the physical characteristics are one of the most important in determining the condition.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:Spinal Stenosis.png|thumb|110 px|[[Spinal stenosis]]]]
Treatment of hypochondroplasia usually takes the form of [[orthopedic surgery]] and [[physical therapy]]. [[Genetic counseling]] is advised for individuals and their families. Specifically in the case of [[spinal stenosis]], one option is [[laminectomy]].&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;&lt;ref name=nih2/&gt;

===Prognosis===
Life expectancy for individuals with hypochondroplasia is normal; the maximum height is about 147&amp;nbsp;cm, or 4.8&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=RESERVED|first1=INSERM US14 -- ALL RIGHTS|title=Orphanet: Hypochondroplasia|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=EN&amp;Expert=429|website=www.orpha.net|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inclusion''' is a term used by [[people with disabilities]] and other [[disability rights]] advocates for the idea that all people should take action to freely accommodate people with a physical, mental, cognitive, and or developmental [[disability]]. For example providing ramps and accessible toilets in meeting facilities or providing additional intervention and resources in the education system are known as '[[universal design]]' {{Citation needed|reason=your explanation here|date=May 2013}} or efforts towards the goal of inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability-inclusion.html|title=Disability Inclusion {{!}} Disability and Health {{!}} NCBDDD|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of inclusion emphasizes [[universal design]] for [[law|policy]]-oriented physical accessibility issues, such as ease-of-use of physical structures and elimination of barriers to ease movement in the world, but the largest part of its purpose is on being culturally transformational. Inclusion typically promotes [[disability studies]] as an intellectual movement and stresses the need for disabled people—the inclusion-rights community usually uses the [[reclaimed word]] "cripple" or "crip" instead—to immerse themselves into mainstream culture through various modes of artistic expression. Inclusion advocates argue that melding what they term "disability-art" or "dis/art" into mainstream art makes integration of different body types unavoidable, direct, and thus positive.{{Citation needed|reason=your explanation here|date=May 2013}} They argue it helps [[able-bodied]] people deal with their fears of being or becoming disabled, which, unbeknownst to the person, is usually what underlies both the feelings of "inspiration" and feelings of [[pity]] s/he may have when watching a disabled person moving in his or her unusual way(s), or in participating in activities that obviously draw attention to the person's condition(s).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haugen|first=HM|date=2006|title=Writing the Self Determined Life|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/ohiou1147369805/inline|journal=Ohio University|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inclusion advocates often specifically encourage disabled people who choose to subscribe to this set of ideas to take it upon themselves to involve themselves in activities that give them the widest public audience possible, such as becoming professional dancers, actors, [[visual art]]ists, front-line [[political activist]]s, [[filmmaker]]s, [[orator]]s, and similar professions.

[[Mainstreaming in education|Mainstreaming]] is allowing for a person with a disability to be a member of a "mainstream" environment without added difficulty by creating inclusive settings. For example, education acts such as [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] or [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] promotes inclusive schooling or mainstreaming for children with disabilities (such as [[Autism]]) so that they can be a part of the larger "typical" community.

Inclusion, an all-encompassing practice, ensures that people of differing abilities visibly and palpably belong to, are engaged in, and are actively connected to the goals and objectives of the whole wider society, as opposed to being labeled as "Other" amongst a "typically developed" individual.

Inclusivity in the United States works to create a fair environment, accepting of diversity through laws which promote the idea of mainstreaming and inclusivity. This inclusive attitude is quite divergent from how other countries treat those who are disabled. In other countries there is a prevalence of the [[medical model of disability]] focusing on the physical and/or mental [[physical therapy|therapies]], [[medication]]s, [[surgery|surgeries]] and [[assistive device]]s that might help to "normalize" or "fix" the disabled person so that they may have an easier time in their surrounding environment. This attitude of inclusion, which has a lot in common with the [[social model of disability]], alleges that this entire approach is wrong and that those who have physical, sensory, intellectual, and/or development impairments are automatically put on a much more effective and fulfilling road to a good, complete, and 'full' life if they are, instead, looked at and valued by society from the outset as totally "normal" people who just happen to have these "extra differences" or are "differently abled". Like the social movements of [[feminism]], [[anti-racism]] and [[gay rights]] before it, inclusion is often derided by critics from the right as naïvité, and by critics from the left as [[identity politics]]. As it looks less towards 'overcoming' and 'achieving', and more towards being and existing in the moment, inclusion by its very nature forces others in the world to possibly begin to accept those who may be different than themselves.

==Resistance to inclusion in the US==

Our society is equipped for those without disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability-barriers.html|title=Disability Barriers {{!}} Disability and Health {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|date=2018-02-05|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This resistance to inclusion in the United States may be that the older architecture of its more prominent cities makes structural adjustment for disabled people costly and supposedly impractical, leading indirectly to a high measure of hostility towards disabled people lest they end up feeling 'entitled' to receive such adjustments automatically and unquestionably {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. 

Others tend to blame the attitude of [[Social Darwinism]] more generally, accusing it of corrupting the attitude of able-bodied people in the US in particular towards disabled people—often to the point that it prevents that country's culture from readily accepting disabled people in aspects and venues that are not directly [[legality]] or [[law]]-related, e.g. [[theater]], [[film]], [[dance]], and [[human sexuality|sexuality]].

'''Katherine L. Ogilvie Musgrave''' (February 8, 1920 – June 20, 2015)&lt;ref name=filly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/06/23/obituaries/katherine-ogilvie-musgrave-2/|title=Katherine Ogilvie Musgrave|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=February 21, 2016|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American academic, registered [[dietitian]], and nutritional consultant. She taught [[food science]] and [[Human nutrition|nutrition]] at the [[University of Maine]] from 1969 to 1986, and after her official retirement continued teaching for close to three decades on the university's online [[continuing education]] website, educating thousands of students. During this time she also worked as a dietitian for three [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] physicians, conducted nutrition workshops and [[Workplace wellness|corporate wellness]] programs across the state, and appeared on a weekly radio show speaking about healthy living.

A member of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|American Dietetic Association]] for over 70 years, she was a two-time president of the Maine Dietetic Association. She received an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Maine in 2006, and was inducted into the [[Maine Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Katherine L. Ogilvie&lt;ref name=stan/&gt; was born in [[Allisona, Tennessee]], to Walter William Ogilvie and his wife, Kathleen Smith Ogilvie.&lt;ref name=filly/&gt; Her mother was a Latin scholar and both her parents were college-educated.&lt;ref name=trends&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=20040707&amp;id=8OI0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6eAIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6096,1565031&amp;hl=en|title=Dietician's career a study of food trends|first=Alicia|last=Anstead|date=July 7, 2004|accessdate=February 21, 2016|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|pages=C1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her three brothers grew up in a farmhouse constructed by their grandfather in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=filly/&gt; She credited her affinity to food and cooking to her mother, who did not enjoy cooking and therefore let her practice as much as she wanted in the kitchen.&lt;ref name=cake/&gt; After graduating high school in 1937, she attended [[Maryville College]] in [[Maryville, Tennessee]], graduating with a bachelor of science degree in nutrition in 1941.&lt;ref name=filly/&gt;&lt;ref name=trends/&gt; She interned at [[Vanderbilt University School of Medicine]] the following year, becoming a registered dietitian.&lt;ref name=filly/&gt;&lt;ref name=trends/&gt;

==Career==
Following her internship, Musgrave joined the staff of the dietitian division of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. In 1945, she took up a position at the [[University of Alabama School of Medicine]], followed by posts at Burnham Hospital in [[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area|Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]], and [[Cornell University]] School of Nutrition. In 1968 she earned her master's degree in nutrition from [[Oklahoma State University]].&lt;ref name=trends/&gt; After her husband was hired by the [[animal science]] department at the University of Maine in 1968,&lt;ref name=trends/&gt; she began teaching food science and nutrition at the University of Maine as an assistant professor in 1969.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She retired as professor emerita in 1986.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;

Following her official retirement in 1986, Musgrave continued to teach and speak full-time on nutrition issues for close to three decades. She presented her FSN 101 Introduction to Food and Nutrition course on the university's online [[continuing education]] website to more than 250 students per semester,&lt;ref name=filly/&gt;&lt;ref name=trends/&gt; offered a nutrition course at [[Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot Valley]] Senior College, and appeared every Monday morning on a [[WZON]] radio show speaking about healthy living.&lt;ref name=trends/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She also conducted nutrition workshops and the nutrition segment of corporate wellness programs in Maine and neighboring states, worked as a dietitian for three Bangor physicians, and educated patients at St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor about medical nutrition therapy.&lt;ref name=filly/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=cake&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2010/02/08/news/bangor/for-dietitian-musgrave-life-just-as-sweet-at-90/?ref=relatedBox|title=For dietitian Musgrave, life just as sweet at 90|first=Jessica|last=Bloch|date=8 February 2010|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musgrave co-authored a 1984 nutrition textbook for teachers and parents. She also wrote a nutrition curriculum guide for elementary-school teachers at the behest of the [[Maine Department of Education]], and coordinated nutrition classes reaching 2,000 teachers and school nutrition educators through the state’s Nutrition Education and Training Program.&lt;ref name=filly/&gt; She published a total of 29 papers in professional journals and produced bulletins on subjects such as "Food for Children, Nutrition Games, Snacking Patterns of Adolescents, and Breast Feeding".&lt;ref name=filly/&gt;

==Positions==
[[File:Whoopie pie with dusting of confectioner's sugar.jpg|right|thumb|[[Whoopie pie]]]]
Musgrave was an outspoken critic of the ''[[Fit for Life]]'' diet. She subjected the weekly diet plan to a computerized nutritional analysis that found the levels of [[Vitamin D]], [[Vitamin B12]], [[zinc]], and [[calcium]] to be "undesirably low" when compared to the [[Dietary Reference Intake|United States Recommended Daily Allowance]] for women aged 23 to 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.co.il/books?id=dwcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|title=Between the Lines of Fit for Life|first=Lucy|last=Moll|date=September 1986|journal=[[Vegetarian Times]]|pages=40, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, she spoke at a hearing in support of a 2011 [[Maine Legislature]] bill to declare the [[whoopie pie]] as the official state dessert of Maine. Musgrave praised the chocolate pie for being rich in [[flavonoid]]s and [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref name=dawn&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bangordailynews.com/2011/03/06/health/umaine-honors-longtime-nutrition-expert/|title=Nutrition, health expert Katherine Musgrave, 91, honored at University of Maine|first=Dawn|last=Gagnon|date=March 6, 2011|accessdate=February 21, 2016|work=Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/01/whoopie-pie_debate_continues_i.html|title=Whoopie-pie debate continues in Maine Legislature|author=Associated Press|publisher=[[The Patriot-News]]|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked to clarify her position on the sugary dessert, she said, "In all food, moderation is the key word".&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; The Maine Legislature eventually approved [[blueberry pie]] as the official state dessert, and the whoopie pie as the official state treat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pressherald.com/2011/04/21/whoopie-pie-to-become-maine-state-treat/|title=It's the Law: Whoopie pie official 'treat'|author=Associated Press|date=April 21, 2011|accessdate=February 22, 2016|publisher=[[Portland Press Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust''' is an [[NHS Foundation Trust]] serving [[Lincolnshire]], England. It was established in June 2002 when social care and health services, formerly provided by Lincolnshire County Council and Lincolnshire Healthcare NHS Trust, were brought together. It was authorised as a foundation trust on 1 October 2007.

The trust established Universal Health Ltd a joint venture with  Lincolnshire and District Medical Services in 2015.  It took over the running of the Burton Road Surgery in Lincoln in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New management to take over running of Burton Road GP Surgery|url=http://www.lincolnshireecho.co.uk/New-management-running-Burton-Road-GP-Surgery/story-26812162-detail/story.html|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Lincolnshire Echo|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It runs Long Leys Court and the Peter Hodgkinson Centre in Lincoln.  Long Leys Court cares for 16 people with a learning disability, who often have complex needs. It was closed temporarily in 2015 while police investigated three serious incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Long Leys Court: Patient death post-mortem inconclusive|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-33140383|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=BBC news|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lincolnshire mum hits back at closure of Long Leys Court|url=http://www.lincolnshireecho.co.uk/Lincolnshire-mum-hits-closure-Long-Leys-Court/story-26797486-detail/story.html|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Lincolnshire Echo|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was named by the [[Health Service Journal]] as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015.  At that time it had 1886 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.6%. 62% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 56% recommended it as a place to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HSJ reveals the best places to work in 2015|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/leadership/best-places-to-work/hsj-reveals-the-best-places-to-work-in-2015/5087434.article#.VgJD8ejkJv4|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;STPs and the use of technology&lt;/small&gt; ===

Nine out of ten regional NHS plans are failing to pay enough attention to the role of medical technology, a report by the Medical Technology Group report found in November 2018. All 44 regional STP plans were analysed in the report ‘[https://mtg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/STPs-and-the-use-of-technology-low-res.pdf STPs and the use of technology]’, which concluded that the NHS is risking missing out on the opportunity to benefit from the use of innovative medical technology. Seven recommendations for ensuring healthcare systems assess, procure, commission and deliver technology-based treatments effectively are set out in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHS regional plans not valuing medical tech |url=http://www.healthbusinessuk.net/news/14112018/nhs-regional-plans-not-valuing-medical-tech |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Health Business |date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Keeping Britain Working: How medical technology can help reduce the cost of ill health to the UK economy&lt;/small&gt; ===

In November 2017, The Medical Technology Group launched its second major study, ‘[http://www.mtg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Keeping-Britain-Working-Report-web.pdf Keeping Britain Working – How medical technology can help reduce the cost of ill health to the UK economy]’. Building on the [http://www.mtg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Adding-Value-The-Economic-and-Societal-Benefits-of-Medical-Technology.pdf Work Foundation’s 2011 study], the report explores the societal and economic impact of eight technologies: hip replacements; implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs); insulin pumps; diagnostics, including sepsis; fibroid embolisation; pain management; wound care; and coronary angioplasty. The report concluded that £476 million in savings per year could be generated from the use of eight technologies in reduced long-term health costs and benefit payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS is 'missing a trick' by opting for cheaper treatment options, report warns|url=https://www.buildingbetterhealthcare.co.uk/news/article_page/NHS_is_missing_a_trick_by_opting_for_cheaper_treatment_options_report_warns/136961|website=Building Better Healthcare|publisher=HPCi Media Limited|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;The North-South NHS divide: how where you are - not what you need - dictates your care&lt;/small&gt; ===
A review of all 209 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England - published in August 2017 - revealed wide variation in waiting times and access to medical technology for patients. The study [http://www.mtg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-North-South-NHS-divide-how-where-you-are-not-what-you-need-dictates-your-care-FINAL-low-res.pdf The North-South NHS divide: how where you are - not what you need - dictates your care] examined five clinical areas in NHS 18 Week Referral to Treatment and NHS Atlas of Variation data. It found that nine out of ten of the poorest performing CCGs were based in the south of England and that almost three times more patients were waiting longer than 18 weeks for treatment compared with November 2012. The report made seven recommendations for improvement including greater transparency so that patients can compare the performance of their local health service and inspections of the poorest performing CCGs by [[NHS England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Nicola|title=NHS waiting times and treatment access are a postcode lottery, report warns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/15/nhs-waiting-times-and-treatment-access-are-a-postcode-lottery-report-warns|accessdate=15 August 2017|publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media|date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pym|first1=Hugh|title=How bad is the NHS postcode lottery?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40927705|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Déjà Review – what lessons can be learned from the past?&lt;/small&gt; ===
In June 2016, the Medical Technology Group published its report '[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B60cHNIWGkbiT0dTelYtQUd1c0k/view Déjà Review – what lessons can be learned from the past?]'. The report  identified 17 different organisations or initiatives that have been launched with the aim of promoting innovation in the NHS over the previous ten years.  In Déjà Review, the MTG noted that the NHS has historically and consistently failed to apply any learnings from the previous reviews, including 2011’s much-quoted Innovation, Health and Wealth (IHW).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wellbeing/health-advice/wasteful-nhs-reports-could-pay-for-drugs/|title=Wasteful NHS reports could pay for drugs|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Unplanned admissions&lt;/small&gt; ===

In 2015 the Medical Technology Group contacted every acute Trust and Clinical Commissioning Group in England to identify the level of unplanned or emergency hospital admissions for urology, diabetes and heart failure. The research found that unplanned and emergency hospital admissions account for more than a third of all hospital admissions – 5.4 million in total – and two thirds of all hospital bed days. It also found that the NHS spent £434 million in 2013/14 treating over 180,000 hospital patients with an unplanned admission for a urinary tract infection; unplanned admissions owing to diabetic complications cost over £200 million each year. Additional findings were that each NHS Trust handles on average over 100 deaths each year from congestive heart failure, but with regional differences in approach and success rates:  for example 66% of presenting heart patients in the Southwest were treated in hospital compared to just 16% in the West Midlands.&lt;ref name=Arwatch&gt;{{cite web|title=Better use of technology could slash A&amp;E costs|url=http://arwatch.co.uk/2015/11/better-use-of-technology-could-slash-ae-costs/|website=Arryhthmia Watch|publisher=British Journal of Cardiology|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Health Business|title=Accessing all areas of medical technology|url=https://issuu.com/psi-media/docs/hb16.2|accessdate=29 April 2016|issue=Volume 6.2|publisher=Public Sector Information Ltd|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Innovation, Health &amp; Wealth Scorecard&lt;/small&gt; ===

In June 2015 the MTG published its review of the 2011 Innovation, Health &amp; Wealth report by NHS Improvement &amp; Efficiency, Innovation and Service Improvement. The [http://www.mtg.org.uk/press-releases/innovation-health-and-wealth-scorecard Scorecard] reviewed progress against the six areas identified by the NHS as those where Clinical Commissioning Groups and acute Trusts could improve patient care through high impact innovations. The report revealed a very mixed picture, with both CCGs and Trusts in some areas performing much worse than others, and some regions of the country drastically underperforming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harpham|first1=Barbara|title=Innovation adoption: stuck in the slow lane?|journal=Clinical Services Journal|date=August 2015|url=http://www.clinicalservicesjournal.com/story/14626/innovation-adoption-stuck-in-the-slow-lane|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Infection control&lt;/small&gt; ===

Following a [[Freedom of Information]] request to all NHS Acute Trusts in England, in September 2014 the MTG published a report: [http://www.mtg.org.uk/bulletins/infection-prevention-and-control-combating-problem-has-not-gone-away Infection Prevention and Control – Combatting a problem that has not gone away] that revealed that the majority of Trusts were unaware of the full scale or the operational and financial impact of five common infections: [[sepsis]]; catheter-associated [[urinary tract infections]]; catheter-related blood infections; [[ventilator]]-associated [[pneumonia]]; and [[norovirus]]. The MTG called on the Government to develop a strategy for using technology for infection prevention and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adrian|first1=O’Dowd|title=British Medical Journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5656|accessdate=19 September 2014|publisher=BMJ|date=15 September 2014|ref=BMJ 2014;349:g5656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Hip and knee surgery&lt;/small&gt; ===

In November 2013, the MTG published a report into waiting times for knee and hip replacements on the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]]. The report, ''Hip and Knee Surgery: Combating Patient Lotteries'', reviewed ten years of government data on knee and hip replacement, and data from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information]] requests to [[NHS Trust|acute NHS hospital trusts]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtg.org.uk/images/Spotlight/Hip_and_Knee_Replacements_-_Combating_Patient_Lotteries.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The report suggested that patient experiences vary significantly according to the financial calendar and where they live.&lt;ref name="BMJ 2013;347:f6686"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kmietowicz|first=Zosia|title=Commissioners are restricting referrals for hip and knee surgery, says report|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6686|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=BMJ|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Denis|title=A&amp;E overcrowding may cost lives, emergency doctors warn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/06/accident-emergency-overcrowding-costs-lives-doctors|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patients must get fairer access to medical technology|url=http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2013/11/07/patients-must-get-fairer-access-to-medical-technology|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=The Information Daily|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patients facing hip-knee 'lottery'|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/patients-facing-hip-knee-lottery-002251392.html#7ZSqPZ5|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=Yahoo News (via Press Association)|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patients facing hip-knee 'lottery'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/patients-facing-hipknee-lottery-8923627.html#.UnoSnHyMtrw.email|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Work Foundation report&lt;/small&gt; ===

In November 2011, [[The Work Foundation]] published a report, ''Adding Value: The Economic and Societal Benefits of Medical Technology'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theworkfoundation.com/DownloadPublication/Report/296_Adding%20value%20-%20The%20Economic%20and%20Societal%20Benefits%20of%20Medical%20Technology.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  funded by a research grant from the MTG.  The report, which was launched in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], identified three key areas of benefits from medical technologies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work Foundation Report – Adding value: The Economic and Societal Benefits of Medical Technology|url=https://www.boa.ac.uk/About/CEOBlog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=94|publisher=British Orthopaedic Association|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rennard|first=Lord|title=The long term benefits of medical technology must be recognised|url=http://centrallobby.politicshome.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/the-long-term-benefits-of-medical-technologies-must-be-recognised/|newspaper=Politics Home|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Improvements in health care (quality, efficiency and the empowerment of patients);
* Improving quality of life and independent living (reducing fears and anxiety, increasing flexibility, and reducing the need for informal care and the burden on informal caregivers);
* Labour market participation and productivity (increasing labour market participation, retaining skills and improving productivity).

=== &lt;small&gt;Uterine artery/fibroid embolisation (UFE)&lt;/small&gt; ===

In 2011 the MTG and patient support group FEmISA published a report, ''The provision of and access to Uterine Artery/Fibroid'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtg.org.uk/files/UFEResearchReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a less invasive treatment for [[fibroma|fibroids]] for women.  The report, which was welcomed by the British Society of Interventional Radiologists, highlighted a lack of coherent commissioning in England, despite [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] clinical guidelines recommending UFE as a first line treatment for symptomatic fibroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Significant variation in numbers of women in England undergoing uterine fibroid embolisation to treat fibroids|url=http://www.rightcare.nhs.uk/index.php/2011/10/significant-variation-ufe/|publisher=Right Care|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your first choice: the provision of and access to UFE|url=http://kingsfund.blogs.com/health_management/2011/10/your-first-choice-the-provision-of-and-access-to-ufe.html|publisher=The King's Fund|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Insulin pump provision&lt;/small&gt; ===

In 2010 the MTG made a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information]] request to [[NHS Primary Care Trust|Primary Care Trusts]] in England on the provision of insulin pumps to patients with [[Type 1 diabetes]]. It found the average to be 3.9 per cent compared to the 12 per cent benchmark recommended by the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]. The findings were the subject of an [[Early Day Motion]] tabled by [[Adrian Sanders|Adrian Sanders MP]] on December 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early day motion 1167|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/1167|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;small&gt;Medical technology&lt;/small&gt; ===

In 2004, the MTG's report Making the Economic Case for Medical Technology suggested that increasing the provision of medical technology can "help patients better manage their conditions" and lead a "longer and relatively healthy life".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patientsorganizations.org/attach.pl/290/69/Economic%20Benefits%20of%20Medical%20Technology%20-%20MTG,%20June%202004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also suggested that by making greater use of technology there are cost benefits for [[National Health Service|the National Health Service]]. The report was the subject of an Early Day Motion tabled by [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Ian Gibson MP]]. The motion was signed by 30 [[Members of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early day motion 1865|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2003-04/1865|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==

The MTG is chaired by Barbara Harpham, National Director of [[Heart Research UK]]. She has been quoted as saying that the UK lags behind other European countries in the take-up of medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fear of cuts to NHS medical technology budgets|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8374275.stm|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS 'must boost use of technology' or risk falling behind|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/news-topics/health-informatics/nhs-must-boost-use-of-technology-or-risk-falling-behind/5008942.article|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=Nursing Times|date=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five minutes with ... the chair of the Medical Technology Group|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2014/feb/07/barbara-harpham-medical-technology-group|accessdate=2 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of '''mental health in the Middle East''' is an area of [[research]] that continues to grow in its scope and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health and psychiatry in the Middle East: historical development|author=A. Mohit|journal=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal|volume=7|number=3|year=2001|pages=336–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emro.who.int/publications/emhj/0703/2Mental.htm|title=WHO EMRO - Volume 7, issue 3 - EMHJ volume 7, 2001 - Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal|first=|last=emhj|website=www.emro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the World Mental Health Survey Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/|title=The World Mental Health Survey Initiative|website=www.hcp.med.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted by the [[World Federation for Mental Health]]. The (WFMH) was originally created in 1948 and works in concert with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).  The 1998 [[Statistical survey|survey]] sought to help define and clarify [[mental health]] Issues across many [[societies]].

To accurately evaluate and understand the mental health issues of the [[Middle East]], one must take into account the [[geography|geographic]], [[history|historical]], [[culture|cultural]], and social influences of that part of the world.  While each of the many countries commonly considered part of the "Middle East" is unique, there is a binding [[ethnic]] fabric that should be considered.  Firstly, the Middle East is the origin of many of the major world [[religions]]. [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]]  and [[Islam]], all began in this region.  Of these many religions, Islam has had the most lasting and [[cultural]]ly significant influence on the region, encompassing well over ninety percent (90%) of the [[population]] by some measurements.  The tenets of the [[Islamic faith]], and its strict purpose, certainly have served as both a guide and a hindrance to the practices' of [[mental health care]] providers in the Middle East.  There is a conflict between ancient religious teachings and the modern day or "[[Western world]]" approach to the issues of mental health.

==Historical perspective==

[[Mental health]] in the [[Middle East]], from [[Pharaonic]] times through to the [[Islamic Renaissance]], has a rich and complex history. During Pharaonic times, [[wikt:soma|soma]] and [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] were terms used to define [[mental disorders]], and such disorders were described as problems of the [[heart]] or [[uterus]], as stated in Eber's and Kahoun's Papyri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wrf.org/ancient-medicine/oldest-medical-books.php|title=Magic and Medical Science in Ancient Egypt|year=1963|author=Ghalioungui, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[mystical]] culture predominated at that time, mental disorders were treated on a [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] basis. In the [[Islamic]] era, those with mental illness were not known to have endured any forms of [[torture]], nor were they [[ostracism|ostracized]]; this was due to the belief that [[Spirit possession|possession]] by a good Muslim [[genie]] was possible. The first [[mental hospital]] in [[Europe]] was located in [[Spain]], as discussed by author [[Paul Ghalioungui]], following the [[Moorish invasions]]. Mental hospitals then expanded to other European countries. The occurrence of [[anxiety]], [[schizophrenia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]], [[conversion disorders]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorders]] had been reported, and these disorders were treated with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/ancient-egypt/|title=Ancient Egypt - Treatment of the Mentally Ill|website=mentalillness.umwblogs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality]] and [[culture]] most likely arose from a [[collective]] choice of [[communal]] decisions to provide an accepted structure of communal living. [[Geography]], [[tradition]], and the specific [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] may have been most influential in these decisions.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=what decisions, exactly?}} The development or evolution of a [[Social environment|social milieu]] integrated with the culmination of culture.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=the previous sentence does not make sense}} Cultural [[morality]] has provided a way of managing [[conflict (process)|conflict]] within a societal group.  Cultural morality and the required [[behaviors]] that are cooperative in nature and a cognizance of others within the group, ostracized [[unhealthy]] behaviors, and therefore encouraged [[emotions]] and actions beneficial to [[society]].  These realized constructs provided an outlet and model of [[motivation]]s and accepted actions within a [[social group]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Wong, "Natural Moralities," (October 2006), Oxford University Press, 2006 [abs].&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 1992 study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/7_creativity/2010/2PersonalityAndValues.pptx Personality and Values] (PPT)&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz, Roccas and Sagiv evaluated how priorities are displayed and altered by a "social experience",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11927158 | volume=109 | title=Social experience and social context alter the behavioral response to centrally administered oxytocin in female Syrian hamsters | journal=Neuroscience | pages=767–72 | last1 = Harmon | first1 = AC | last2 = Moore | first2 = TO | last3 = Huhman | first3 = KL | last4 = Albers | first4 = HE | doi=10.1016/s0306-4522(01)00523-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how those priorities affect "behavioral orientation and choices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = Shalom H | year = 1992 | title = Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries | url = | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 1–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study surmised that the majority of cultures prioritize some of ten particular [[values|value]] types: [[self-determination]], [[stimulation]], [[hedonism]], [[accomplishment|achievement]], [[power (philosophy)|power]], [[security]], [[conformity]], [[tradition]], [[altruism|benevolence]], and [[universalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/schwartz_inventory.htm|title=Schwartz's Value Inventory|website=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these there were [[values]] that [[culture]]s prioritize to varying degrees.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=This whole paragraph needs a rewrite, because it doesn't make any sense}}

Schwartz used these findings in developing his [[theory]] of specific types of [[values]], allowing varying cultures to be contrasted with one another. Data was collected from 49 countries and applied to a [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of seven value types. This was done according to the specific priority given by a society to its [[communal]] value set. Schwartz selected the seven types of values based on their compatibilities and [[contradiction]]s to one another. The value types he identified were: "[[conservatism]] vs. [[autonomy]]", "[[hierarchy]] vs. [[egalitarianism]]", and "[[mastery]] vs. [[harmony]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260108602816|title=Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Academic Press|volume=25|pages=1–65|citeseerx=10.1.1.220.3674|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60281-6|author= Schwartz, Shalom H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[value (personal and cultural)|value types]] were then used to examine [[culture]]s that were closely
related to each other. The theory is based on [[cultural]] dimensions so that conclusions can be defined to a degree, while accounting for the entire social matrix.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=The meaning of this sentence is unclear}}  This theory has helped [[researchers]] to assess the cultural implications of values on regional cultures.  The research also found a [[correlation]] between geographical proximity and shared cultural values. Schwartz attributed these relationships to the "shared [[history]]", [[religion]], level of development, culture contact, and other factors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shwartz, S.|year=1999|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/people/sharon.glazer/courses/psyc190/s1/Schwartz+1999.pdf|title=A theory of cultural values and some implications for work|volume=48|issue=1|pp=23–47|journal=Applied Psychology: An International Review|publisher=International association of applied psychology|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626115004/http://www.sjsu.edu/people/sharon.glazer/courses/psyc190/s1/Schwartz%201999.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known syndromes==

===Zār===

[[Zār]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zar|title=ZĀR – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/mccajor/cbs_glos.html TMH: Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526131405/http://homepage.mac.com/mccajor/cbs_glos.html |date=2010-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (زار) known as [[Demonic possession|possession]] by a [[spirit]], is exhibited by some Middle Eastern cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturediversity.org/mide.htm Middle Eastern&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725214245/http://www.culturediversity.org/mide.htm |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific ceremonies are performed to placate the zār and relieve the symptoms of the afflicted individual. These [[ritual]]ized ceremonies, organized and facilitated by a leader, include the affected individual and a person previously affected by the zār, and involve "[[incense]], music, and movement".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The details of the [[ceremony]] vary by region.  Some leaders may recommend that the [[patient]] first seek the help of a [[Physician|doctor]], while others believe that interventions by the doctor, such as using needles for injections, may further agitate the zār, creating more problems for the patient.  Those who choose traditional treatment for zār remain in isolation for up to seven days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; This [[syndrome]] has been reported in [[North Africa]]n and Middle Eastern countries, including [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], and [[Sudan]]. Signs and [[symptoms]] of zār may include [[dissociative state|dissociative]] episodes, unexpected laughing, yelling, or singing, or even patients hitting their heads against a wall. Clients may exhibit [[apathy]] and be [[reclusive]].  Those under the influence of the zār may refuse to eat or carry out [[activities of daily living]], and may develop an extended interaction with the possessing spirit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===The evil eye===
[[File:Ruby Eye Pendant.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Corundum]] Evil Eye [[Amulet]] from [[Mesapotamia]]  ʘDanieliness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Danieliness|title=User:Danieliness - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The "[[evil eye]]" is also known as ʿayn al-ḥasūd (عين الحسود)" and "Mal De Ojo", and has been described by a number of sources.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It is also described in [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[culture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://altmed.creighton.edu/MexicanFolk/mal_de_ojo.htm Mal de ojo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719181959/http://altmed.creighton.edu/MexicanFolk/mal_de_ojo.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfbardo.com/maldeojo.htm|title=Evil Eye - Mal de Ojo|website=www.sfbardo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dundes A, "Interpreting Folklore," Indiana University Press, Ed.,(1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dundes A"The Evil Eye: A Casebook." [[University of Wisconsin]] Press, Ed.,1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The late Professor [[Alan Dundes]] theorized that belief in the evil eye had a [[Middle Eastern]], [[Mediterranean]], and [[Indo European]] pattern of distribution, and was completely unknown in the [[Americas]], [[Pacific Islands]], [[Asia]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]] until the introduction of European and possibly [[Moorish]] culture.  He based his ideas upon the ancient underlying belief that water represented [[life]] and dryness represented [[death]]. Dundes suggested that evil caused by the evil eye came from its power to cause living beings to "dry up", specifically referring to infants, [[lactation|lactating]] [[mammal]]s, and even young fruit trees.&lt;ref&gt;Fables of the Ancients: Folklore in the Qur'an. Rowman &amp; Littlefield,(2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms included sudden [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], and loss of [[virility|potency]] in men. Dundes contended that the evil eye dries up liquids, which explained its Middle Eastern and [[desert]] origins. This unique [[syndrome]] is also mentioned in the [[DSM-IV TR]], Appendix I.&lt;ref&gt;^"Appendix I: Outline for Cultural Formulation and Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes". Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), 1. 2000. {{doi|10.1176/appi.books.9780890423349.7060}}. {{ISBN|0-89042-334-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The syndrome is also seen in many other [[Middle Eastern]] Countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Post-traumatic stress syndrome===
[[Post-traumatic stress syndrome]] (PTSD) is, unfortunately, common in the Middle East due to the myriad conflicts experienced by people in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/newsletters/research-quarterly/v21n4.pdf | title=Trauma and PTSD among Civilians in the Middle East | journal=PTSD Research Quarterly| volume =21|number= 4 |year=2010|author1=Yuval Neria|author2=Margarita Bravova|author3=Jessica M. Halper.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnostic symptoms for PTSD include recurrent experiencing of the  initial [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic event(s) through [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s or recurrent [[night sweats]] and [[nightmare]]s. Those afflicted with post-traumatic stress syndrome often seek to avoid others as well as any [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] similar to the traumatic occurrence.  They may also exhibit increased [[arousal]]. Difficulty in falling or staying asleep, unexpected episodic fits of [[anger]], and [[hypervigilance]] may also occur. The formal [[diagnostic criteria]] for both the [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD-10]]) indicate that symptoms last for more than one month and cause significant impairment in [[social functioning|social]], occupational, and/or other important areas of functioning.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV. [[Washington, DC]]: American Psychiatric Association. {{ISBN|0-89042-061-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some evidence that children suffering from PTSD in the Middle East may experience accelerated aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/pages/2015-05-07-ptsd-accelerates-aging.aspx|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Linked to Accelerated Aging|work=UC Health - UC San Diego|date=May 7, 2015|author1=Scott LaFee|author2=Heather Buschman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] in the Middle East has been specifically studied at [[Namazi Hospital]] Shiraz, in Iran.  In a 2006 study of nurses, depressive symptoms were seen in 26.9% of the individuals studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mejfm.com/journal/july2006/Depression%20in%20nurses.htm|title=Middle East Journal of Family Medicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/complete-index.shtml|title=NIMH » Depression Basics|website=www.nimh.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this [[cross-sectional survey]], the rate of depression in 130 nurses was investigated using the 21-item [[Beck Depression Inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = AT | last2 = Ward | first2 = CH | last3 = Mendelson | first3 = M | last4 = Mock | first4 = J | last5 = Erbaugh | first5 = J | year = 1961 | title = An inventory for measuring depression | url = | journal = Arch.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

A '''messiah complex''' (also known as the '''Christ complex''' or '''savior complex''') is a state of mind in which an individual holds a belief that they are destined to become a savior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flowpsychology.com/messiah-complex-psychology/|title=Messiah Complex Psychology|work=flowpsychology.com|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also refer to a state of mind in which an individual believes that he or she is responsible for saving or assisting others.

The term "messiah complex" is not addressed in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)]]'', as it is not a clinical term nor diagnosable disorder, however, the symptoms of the disorder closely resemble those found in individuals suffering from [[grandiose delusions]] or delusions of grandeur. This form of delusional belief is most often reported in patients suffering from [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]]. When a messiah complex is manifested within a religious individual after a visit to [[Jerusalem]], it may be identified as a psychosis known as [[Jerusalem syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freethoughtnation.com/dangerous-delusions-the-messiah-complex-and-jerusalem-syndrome/|title=Dangerous delusions: The Messiah Complex and Jerusalem Syndrome|work=Freethought Nation|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metabolic network reconstruction and simulation''' allows for an in-depth insight into the molecular mechanisms of a particular organism. In particular, these models correlate the [[genome]] with molecular [[physiology]].&lt;ref name=Franke_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franke|author2=Siezen, Teusink|title=Reconstructing the metabolic network of a bacterium from its genome.|journal=Trends in Microbiology|year=2005|volume=13|issue=11|pages=550–558|pmid=16169729|doi=10.1016/j.tim.2005.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reconstruction breaks down [[metabolic]] pathways (such as [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]]) into their respective reactions and enzymes, and analyzes them within the perspective of the entire network. In simplified terms, a reconstruction collects all of the relevant metabolic information of an organism and compiles it in a mathematical model.  Validation and analysis of reconstructions can allow identification of key features of metabolism such as growth yield, resource distribution, network robustness, and gene essentiality. This knowledge can then be applied to create novel [[biotechnology]].

In general, the process to build a reconstruction is as follows:
# Draft a reconstruction
# Refine the model
# Convert model into a mathematical/computational representation
# Evaluate and debug model through experimentation

==Genome-scale metabolic reconstruction==
A metabolic reconstruction provides a highly mathematical, structured platform on which to understand the systems biology of metabolic pathways within an organism.&lt;ref name=Thiele_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thiele|first=Ines|author2=Bernhard Ø Palsson|title=A protocol for generating a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction|journal=Nature Protocols|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93–121|doi=10.1038/nprot.2009.203|pmid=20057383|pmc=3125167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integration of biochemical metabolic pathways with rapidly available, annotated genome sequences has developed what are called genome-scale metabolic models. Simply put, these models correspond metabolic genes with metabolic pathways. In general, the more information about physiology, biochemistry and genetics is available for the target organism, the better the predictive capacity of the reconstructed models. Mechanically speaking, the process of reconstructing prokaryotic and eukaryotic [[metabolic network]]s is essentially the same. Having said this, eukaryote reconstructions are typically more challenging because of the size of genomes, coverage of knowledge, and the multitude of cellular compartments.&lt;ref name="Thiele_2010"/&gt; The first genome-scale metabolic model was generated in 1995 for ''Haemophilus influenzae''.&lt;ref name=Venter_Influenzae&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd|journal=Science|year=1995|volume=269|issue=1995|pages=496–512|pmid=7542800|doi=10.1126/science.7542800|author1=Fleischmann|first1=R.

M.|bibcode=1995Sci...269..496F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first multicellular organism, ''C. elegans'', was reconstructed in 1998.&lt;ref name="The1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium|journal=Science|volume=282|pages=2012–2018 |title=Genome Sequence of the Nematode C. elegans: A Platform for Investigating Biology |year=1998|doi=10.1126/science.282.5396.2012|issue=5396|pmid=9851916}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, many reconstructions have been formed.

==Drafting a reconstruction==

===Resources===
Because the timescale for the development of reconstructions is so recent, most reconstructions have been built manually. However, now, there are quite a few resources that allow for the semi-automatic assembly of these reconstructions that are utilized due to the time and effort necessary for a reconstruction. An initial fast reconstruction can be developed automatically using resources like PathoLogic or ERGO in combination with encyclopedias like MetaCyc, and then manually updated by using resources like PathwayTools. These semi-automatic methods allow for a fast draft to be created while allowing the fine tune adjustments required once new experimental data is found. It is only in this manner that the field of metabolic reconstructions will keep up with the ever-increasing numbers of annotated genomes.

====Databases====
* '''Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ([http://www.kegg.jp/ KEGG])''': a bioinformatics database containing information on genes, proteins, reactions, and pathways. The ‘KEGG Organisms’ section, which is divided into [[eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryotes]], encompasses many organisms for which gene and [[DNA]] information can be searched by typing in the enzyme of choice.
* '''BioCyc, EcoCyc, and MetaCyc''': [http://biocyc.org/ BioCyc] Is a collection of 3,000 pathway/genome databases (as of Oct 2013), with each database dedicated to one organism. For example, [http://ecocyc.org/ EcoCyc] is a highly detailed [[bioinformatics]] database on the genome and metabolic reconstruction of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', including thorough descriptions of ''E. coli'' signaling pathways and regulatory network. The EcoCyc database can serve as a paradigm and model for any reconstruction. Additionally, [http://biocyc.org/metacyc/index.shtml MetaCyc], an encyclopedia of experimentally defined metabolic pathways and enzymes, contains 2,100 metabolic pathways and 11,400 metabolic reactions (Oct 2013).
* '''[http://enzyme.expasy.org/ ENZYME]''': An enzyme [[Scientific classification|nomenclature]] database (part of the [[ExPASy]] proteonomics server of the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]]). After searching for a particular enzyme on the database, this resource gives you the reaction that is catalyzed. ENZYME has direct links to other gene/enzyme/literature databases such as KEGG, BRENDA, and PUBMED.
* '''[http://www.brenda-enzymes.info/ BRENDA]''': A comprehensive enzyme database that allows for an enzyme to be searched by name, EC number, or organism.
* '''[http://bigg.ucsd.edu/ BiGG]''': A knowledge base of biochemically, genetically, and genomically structured genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions.
* '''[http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/metatiger/ metaTIGER]''': Is a collection of metabolic profiles and phylogenomic information on a taxonomically diverse range of eukaryotes which provides novel facilities for viewing and comparing the metabolic profiles between organisms.

====Tools for metabolic modeling====
* '''[http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/ Pathway Tools]''': A bioinformatics software package that assists in the construction of pathway/genome databases such as EcoCyc.&lt;ref name=Karp_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karp|title=Pathway Tools version 13.0: Integrated Software for Pathway/Genome Informatics and Systems Biology|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=January 2010|volume=11|issue=1|pages=40–79|pmid=19955237|doi=10.1093/bib/bbp043|pmc=2810111|display-authors=etal|arxiv=1510.03964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by Peter Karp and associates at the SRI International Bioinformatics Research Group, Pathway Tools has several components. Its PathoLogic module takes an annotated genome for an organism and infers probable metabolic reactions and pathways to produce a new pathway/genome database.  Its MetaFlux component can generate a quantitative metabolic model from that pathway/genome database using [[Flux balance analysis|flux-balance analysis]].  Its Navigator component provides extensive query and visualization tools, such as visualization of metabolites, pathways, and the complete metabolic network.

====Tools for literature====
* '''PUBMED''': This is an online library developed by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], which contains a massive collection of medical journals. Using the link provided by ENZYME, the search can be directed towards the organism of interest, thus recovering literature on the enzyme and its use inside of the organism.

===Methodology to draft a reconstruction===
[[File:Metabolic Network Reconstruction Process.pdf|thumb|This is a visual representation of the metabolic network reconstruction process.]]

A reconstruction is built by compiling data from the resources above.  Database tools such as KEGG and BioCyc can be used in conjunction with each other to find all the metabolic genes in the organism of interest.  These genes will be compared to closely related organisms that have already developed reconstructions to find homologous genes and reactions. These homologous genes and reactions are carried over from the known reconstructions to form the draft reconstruction of the organism of interest. Tools such as ERGO, Pathway Tools and Model SEED can compile data into pathways to form a network of metabolic and non-metabolic pathways. These networks are then verified and refined before being made into a mathematical simulation.&lt;ref name="Thiele_2010"/&gt;

The predictive aspect of a metabolic reconstruction hinges on the ability to predict the biochemical reaction catalyzed by a protein using that protein's amino acid sequence as an input, and to infer the structure of a metabolic network based on the predicted set of reactions. A network of enzymes and metabolites is drafted to relate sequences and function.  When an uncharacterized protein is found in the genome, its amino acid sequence is first compared to those of previously characterized proteins to search for homology.  When a homologous protein is found, the proteins are considered to have a common ancestor and their functions are inferred as being similar.  However, the quality of a reconstruction model is dependent on its ability to accurately infer phenotype directly from sequence, so this rough estimation of protein function will not be sufficient.  A number of algorithms and bioinformatics resources have been developed for refinement of sequence homology-based assignments of protein functions:
* '''[http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi InParanoid]''':  Identifies eukaryotic orthologs by looking only at [[in-paralog]]s.
* '''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd CDD]''':  Resource for the annotation of functional units in proteins. Its collection of domain models utilizes 3D structure to provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships.
* '''[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ InterPro]''':  Provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites.
* '''[http://string.embl.de/ STRING]''':  Database of known and predicted protein interactions.

Once proteins have been established, more information about the enzyme structure, reactions catalyzed, substrates and products, mechanisms, and more can be acquired from databases such as [http://www.kegg.jp/ KEGG], [http://www.metacyc.org/ MetaCyc] and [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ NC-IUBMB].  Accurate metabolic reconstructions require additional information about the reversibility and preferred physiological direction of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction which can come from databases such as [http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/ BRENDA] or [http://www.metacyc.org/ MetaCyc] database.&lt;ref name="Ivanova_2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ivanova|first=N.|author2=A. Lykidis|title=Metabolic Reconstruction|journal=Encyclopedia of Microbiology, 3rd Ed.|year=2009|pages=607–621|doi=10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00010-9|isbn=9780123739445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model refinement==
An initial metabolic reconstruction of a genome is typically far from perfect due to the high variability and diversity of microorganisms.  Often, metabolic pathway databases such as KEGG and MetaCyc will have "holes", meaning that there is a conversion from a substrate to a product (i.e., an enzymatic activity) for which there is no known protein in the genome that encodes the enzyme that facilitates the catalysis.  What can also happen in semi-automatically drafted reconstructions is that some pathways are falsely predicted and don't actually occur in the predicted manner.&lt;ref name="Ivanova_2009" /&gt;  Because of this, a systematic verification is made in order to make sure no inconsistencies are present and that all the entries listed are correct and accurate.&lt;ref name="Franke_2005" /&gt;  Furthermore, previous literature can be researched in order to support any information obtained from one of the many metabolic reaction and genome databases. This provides an added level of assurance for the reconstruction that the enzyme and the reaction it catalyzes do actually occur in the organism.

[[Enzyme promiscuity]] and spontaneous chemical reactions can damage metabolites. This [[Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|metabolite damage, and its repair or pre-emption]], create energy costs that need to be incorporated into models. It is likely that many genes of unknown function encode proteins that repair or pre-empt metabolite damage, but most genome-scale metabolic reconstructions only include a fraction of all genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Linster|first = Carole L.|last2 = Van Schaftingen|first2 = Emile|last3 = Hanson|first3 = Andrew D.|date = 2013-02-01|title = Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|journal = Nature Chemical Biology|volume = 9|issue = 2|pages = 72–80|doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1141|issn = 1552-4469|pmid = 23334546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hanson|first = Andrew D.|last2 = Henry|first2 = Christopher S.|last3 = Fiehn|first3 = Oliver|last4 = de Crécy-Lagard|first4 = Valérie|date = 2015-11-19|title = Metabolite Damage and Metabolite Damage Control in Plants|journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology|doi = 10.1146/annurev-arplant-043015-111648|issn = 1545-2123|pmid = 26667673|volume=67|pages=131–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any new reaction not present in the databases needs to be added to the reconstruction. This is an iterative process that cycles between the experimental phase and the coding phase. As new information is found about the target organism, the model will be adjusted to predict the metabolic and phenotypical output of the cell. The presence or absence of certain reactions of the metabolism will affect the amount of [[reactants]]/products that are present for other reactions within the particular pathway. This is because products in one reaction go on to become the reactants for another reaction, i.e. products of one reaction can combine with other proteins or compounds to form new proteins/compounds in the presence of different enzymes or [[catalysts]].&lt;ref name = "Franke_2005" /&gt;

Francke ''et al.'' &lt;ref name="Franke_2005"/&gt; provide an excellent example as to why the verification step of the project needs to be performed in significant detail. During a metabolic network reconstruction of ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'', the model showed that [[succinyl-CoA]] was one of the reactants for a reaction that was a part of the biosynthesis of [[methionine]]. However, an understanding of the physiology of the organism would have revealed that due to an incomplete tricarboxylic acid pathway, ''Lactobacillus plantarum'' does not actually produce succinyl-CoA, and the correct reactant for that part of the reaction was [[acetyl-CoA]].

Therefore, systematic verification of the initial reconstruction will bring to light several inconsistencies that can adversely affect the final interpretation of the reconstruction, which is to accurately comprehend the molecular mechanisms of the organism. Furthermore, the [[simulation]] step also ensures that all the reactions present in the reconstruction are properly balanced. To sum up, a reconstruction that is fully accurate can lead to greater insight about understanding the functioning of the organism of interest.&lt;ref name = "Franke_2005" /&gt;

==Metabolic network simulation==
A metabolic network can be broken down into a stoichiometric matrix where the rows represent the compounds of the reactions, while the columns of the matrix correspond to the reactions themselves. [[Stoichiometry]] is a quantitative relationship between [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] of a chemical reaction. In order to deduce what the metabolic network suggests, recent research has centered on a few approaches, such as extreme pathways, elementary mode analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papin | first1 = JA | last2 = Stelling | first2 = J | last3 = Price | first3 = ND | last4 = Klamt | first4 = S | last5 = Schuster | first5 = S | last6 = Palsson | first6 = BO | date = Aug 2004 | title = Comparison of network-based pathway analysis methods | url = | journal = Trends Biotechnol | volume = 22 | issue = 8| pages = 400–5 | doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.06.010 | pmid=15283984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[flux balance analysis]], and a number of other constraint-based modeling methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = N.E. | last2 = Nagarajan | first2 = H. | last3 = Palsson | year = 2012 | title =Constraining the metabolic genotype–phenotype relationship using a phylogeny of ''in silico'' methods | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2737 | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 291–305 | pmid=22367118 | pmc=3536058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/ CoBRA Methods - Constraint-based analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme pathways===
Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name=Price_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Nathan|author2=Jennifer Reed |author3=Jason Papin |author4=Sharon Wiback |author5=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Network-based analysis of metabolic regulation in the human red blood cell|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=November 2003|volume=225|issue=2|pages=185–194|pmid=14575652|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00237-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Palsson lab, use a method of singular value decomposition (SVD) of extreme pathways in order to understand regulation of a human [[red blood cell]] metabolism. Extreme pathways are convex [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] that consist of [[steady state]] functions of a metabolic network.&lt;ref name=Papin_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papin|first=Jason|author2=Nathan Price |author3=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Extreme Pathway Lengths and Reaction Participation in Genome-Scale Metabolic Networks|journal=Genome Research|date=December 2002|volume=12|issue=12|pages=1889–1900|pmid=12466293|doi=10.1101/gr.327702|pmc=187577}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any particular metabolic network, there is always a unique set of extreme pathways available.&lt;ref name=Papin_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papin|first=Jason|author2=Nathan Price |author3=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Comparison of network-based pathway analysis methods|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=August 2004|volume=22|issue=8|pages=400–405|pmid=15283984|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; define a [[constraint-based approach]], where through the help of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] like [[mass balance]] and maximum [[reaction rates]], it is possible to develop a ‘solution space’ where all the feasible options fall within. Then, using a kinetic model approach, a single solution that falls within the extreme pathway solution space can be determined.&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; Therefore, in their study, Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; use both constraint and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] approaches to understand the human red blood cell metabolism. In conclusion, using extreme pathways, the regulatory mechanisms of a metabolic network can be studied in further detail.

===Elementary mode analysis===
Elementary mode analysis closely matches the approach used by extreme pathways. Similar to extreme pathways, there is always a unique set of elementary modes available for a particular metabolic network.&lt;ref name = "Papin_2004" /&gt; These are the smallest sub-networks that allow a metabolic reconstruction network to function in steady state.&lt;ref name=Schuster_2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=S|author2=Fell DA |author3=Dandekar T |title=A general definition of metabolic pathways useful for systematic organization and analysis of complex metabolic networks|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=March 2000|volume=18|issue=3|pages=326–332|pmid=10700151|doi=10.1038/73786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stelling_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stelling|first=J|author2=Klamt S |author3=Bettenbrock K |author4=Schuster S |author5=Gilles ED |title=Metabolic network structure determines key aspects of functionality and regulation.|journal=Nature|date=November 2002|volume=420|issue=6912|pages=190–193|pmid=12432396|doi=10.1038/nature01166|bibcode=2002Natur.420..190S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullah_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ullah|first=E|author2=Aeron S |author3=Hassoun S|title=gEFM: An Algorithm for Computing Elementary Flux Modes Using Graph Traversal.|journal=IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=122–34|date=2015|doi=10.1109/TCBB.2015.2430344|pmid=26886737}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stelling (2002),&lt;ref name = "Stelling_2002" /&gt; elementary modes can be used to understand cellular objectives for the overall metabolic network. Furthermore, elementary mode analysis takes into account [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometrics]] and [[thermodynamics]] when evaluating whether a particular metabolic route or network is feasible and likely for a set of proteins/enzymes.&lt;ref name = "Schuster_2000" /&gt;

===Minimal metabolic behaviors (MMBs)===
In 2009, Larhlimi and Bockmayr presented a new approach called "minimal metabolic behaviors" for the analysis of metabolic networks.&lt;ref name=Larhlimi_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larhlimi|first=A|author2=Bockmayr, A.|title=A new constraint-based description of the steady-state flux cone of metabolic networks|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|year=2009|volume=157|issue=10|pages=2257–2266|doi=10.1016/j.dam.2008.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like elementary modes or extreme pathways, these are uniquely determined by the network, and yield a complete description of the flux cone. However, the new description is much more compact. In contrast with elementary modes and extreme pathways, which use an inner description based on generating vectors of the flux cone, MMBs are using an outer description of the flux cone. This approach is based on sets of non-negativity constraints. These can be identified with irreversible reactions, and thus have a direct biochemical interpretation. One can characterize a metabolic network by MMBs and the reversible metabolic space.

===Flux balance analysis===
{{main article|Flux balance analysis}}
A different technique to simulate the metabolic network is to perform [[flux balance analysis]]. This method uses [[linear programming]], but in contrast to elementary mode analysis and extreme pathways, only a single solution results in the end. Linear programming is usually used to obtain the maximum potential of the objective function that you are looking at, and therefore, when using flux balance analysis, a single solution is found to the optimization problem.&lt;ref name = "Stelling_2002" /&gt; In a flux balance analysis approach, exchange [[flux]]es are assigned to those metabolites that enter or leave the particular network only. Those metabolites that are consumed within the network are not assigned any exchange flux value. Also, the exchange fluxes along with the enzymes can have constraints ranging from a negative to positive value (ex: -10 to 10).

Furthermore, this particular approach can accurately define if the reaction stoichiometry is in line with predictions by providing fluxes for the balanced reactions. Also, flux balance analysis can highlight the most effective and efficient pathway through the network in order to achieve a particular objective function. In addition, [[gene knockout]] studies can be performed using flux balance analysis. The enzyme that correlates to the gene that needs to be removed is given a constraint value of 0. Then, the reaction that the particular enzyme catalyzes is completely removed from the analysis.

===Dynamic simulation and parameter estimation===
In order to perform a dynamic simulation with such a network it is necessary to construct an ordinary differential equation
system that describes the rates of change in each metabolite's concentration or amount. To this end, a rate law, i.e., a kinetic equation that determines the rate of reaction based on the concentrations of all reactants is required for each reaction. Software packages that include numerical integrators, such as [[COPASI]] or [http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsimulator SBMLsimulator], are then able to simulate the system dynamics given an initial condition. Often these rate laws contain kinetic parameters with uncertain values. In many cases it is desired to estimate these parameter values with respect to given time-series data of metabolite concentrations. The system is then supposed to reproduce the given data. For this purpose the distance between the given data set and the result of the simulation, i.e., the numerically or in few cases analytically obtained solution of the differential equation system is computed. The values of the parameters are then estimated to minimize this distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dräger|first=A|author2=Kronfeld M |author3=Ziller MJ |author4=Supper J |author5=Planatscher H |author6=Magnus JB |author7=Oldiges M |author8=Kohlbacher O |author9=Zell A  |title=Modeling metabolic networks in C. glutamicum: a comparison of rate laws in combination with various parameter optimization strategies|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=January 2009|volume=3|issue=5|pmid=19144170|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-3-5|pmc=2661887|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One step further, it may be desired to estimate the mathematical structure of the differential equation system because the real rate laws are not known for the reactions within the system under study. To this end, the program [http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer SBMLsqueezer] allows automatic creation of appropriate rate laws for all reactions with the network.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dräger|first1=Andreas|last2=Hassis|first2=Nadine|last3=Supper|first3=Jochen|last4=Schröder|first4=Adrian|last5=Zell|first5=Andreas|title=SBMLsqueezer: A CellDesigner plug-in to generate kinetic rate equations for biochemical networks|journal=BMC Systems Biology|volume=2|issue=1|page=39|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-2-39|pmid=18447902|pmc=2412839|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic accessibility===
Synthetic accessibility is a simple approach to network simulation whose goal is to predict which metabolic gene knockouts are lethal. The synthetic accessibility approach uses the topology of the metabolic network to calculate the sum of the minimum number of steps needed to traverse the metabolic network graph from the inputs, those metabolites available to the organism from the environment, to the outputs, metabolites needed by the organism to survive. To simulate a gene knockout, the reactions enabled by the gene are removed from the network and the synthetic accessibility metric is recalculated. An increase in the total number of steps is predicted to cause lethality. Wunderlich and Mirny showed this simple, parameter-free approach predicted knockout lethality in ''E. coli'' and ''S. cerevisiae'' as well as elementary mode analysis and flux balance analysis in a variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wunderlich|first=Z|author2=Leonid Mirny|title=Using the topology of metabolic networks to predict viability of mutant strains|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=September 2006|volume=91|issue=6|pages=2304–11|pmid= 16782788|doi=10.1529/biophysj.105.080572|pmc=1557581|bibcode=2006BpJ....91.2304W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of a reconstruction==
* Several inconsistencies exist between gene, enzyme, reaction databases, and published literature sources regarding the metabolic information of an organism. A reconstruction is a systematic verification and compilation of data from various sources that takes into account all of the discrepancies.
* The combination of relevant metabolic and genomic information of an organism.
* Metabolic comparisons can be performed between various organisms of the same species as well as between different organisms.
* Analysis of synthetic lethality&lt;ref name="Costanzo, et al. (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costanzo|first=M|title=The Genetic Landscape of a Cell |journal=Science|year=2010|volume=327 |pages=425–431 |doi=10.1126/science.1180823| issue=5964|pmid=20093466|display-authors=etal |pmc=5600254|bibcode=2010Sci...327..425C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use in metabolic engineering for high value outputs

Reconstructions and their corresponding models allow the formulation of hypotheses about the presence of certain enzymatic activities and the production of metabolites that can be experimentally tested, complementing the primarily discovery-based approach of traditional microbial biochemistry with hypothesis-driven research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ivanova|first=A|author2=A. Lykidis|title=Metabolic Reconstruction|journal=Encyclopedia of Microbiology, 3rd Edition|year=2009|pages=607–621|doi=10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00010-9|isbn=9780123739445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results these experiments can uncover novel pathways and metabolic activities and decipher between discrepancies in previous experimental data.  Information about the chemical reactions of metabolism and the genetic background of various metabolic properties (sequence to structure to function) can be utilized by genetic engineers to modify organisms to produce high value outputs whether those products be medically relevant like pharmaceuticals; high value chemical intermediates such as terpenoids and isoprenoids; or biotechnological outputs like biofuels.

Metabolic network reconstructions and models are used to understand how an organism or parasite functions inside of the host cell. For example, if the parasite serves to compromise the [[immune system]] by lysing [[macrophages]], then the goal of metabolic reconstruction/simulation would be to determine the metabolites that are essential to the organism's proliferation inside of macrophages. If the proliferation cycle is inhibited, then the parasite would not continue to evade the host's immune system. A reconstruction model serves as a first step to deciphering the complicated mechanisms surrounding disease. These models can also look at the minimal genes necessary for a cell to maintain virulence. The next step would be to use the predictions and postulates generated from a reconstruction model and apply it to discover novel biological functions such as [[drug-engineering]] and [[drug delivery]] techniques.

'''Michael Gerard Santos''' (born January 15, 1964) is an American prison consultant, author of several books about prison, a professor of criminal justice, and an advocate for [[criminal justice reform]]. Santos spent twenty-six years inside nineteen different United States federal prisons. During his decades inside federal prison, Santos committed to transforming his life, obtained an education, got married, wrote several books, blogged, and worked to prepare himself for a successful law-abiding life.&lt;ref name=NBCnews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Garvin|title=From "Scarface" to SF State: One Teacher's Remarkable Journey|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/From-Scarface-To-SF-State-One-Teachers-Remarkable-Journey-228289111.html|publisher=NBC Bay Area|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santos served more than twenty-six years of a forty-five year sentence.

After release from prison, Santos taught a course for criminal justice students at [[San Francisco State University]], works as a prison consultant, motivational speaker and life coach and continues to advocate for reforming America's criminal justice system.

==Early life==
Michael Santos grew up in Lake Forest Park, a suburb of North Seattle, Washington with two sisters and had a relatively stable family life.&lt;ref name=cal&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction: Michael G. Santos returns to society|url=http://www.cafwd.org/reporting/entry/an-introduction-michael-g.-santos-returns-to-society|publisher=cafwd.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santos is the son of a Cuban immigrant father and a mother of Spanish descent.&lt;ref name=sf/&gt; His parents were small business owners.&lt;ref name=cal/&gt; While in high school, Santos received probation for receiving stolen property as part of a gambling debt owed to him, which was his only arrest and/or conviction before his conviction for distributing cocaine.&lt;ref name=november&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Santos|url=http://www.november.org/thewall/cases/santos-m/santos-m.html|publisher=November Coalition|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santos graduated from [[Shorecrest High School]] in 1982 and was a mediocre student.&lt;ref name=cal/&gt; Santos played football and skied in high school.&lt;ref name=sf/&gt;

==Drug trafficking, trial, and sentencing==
===Crime===
After graduating from high school, Santos worked for a highway construction firm that his family had operated since 1970.&lt;ref name=november/&gt; In 1985, Santos and a friend became involved in a cocaine transaction involving several kilograms.&lt;ref name=november/&gt; After this first big sale, Santos got involved in buying and selling cocaine. Although he made thousands of dollars in Seattle, he wanted more, so he moved to [[Miami]] to work with suppliers.

Santos eventually relocated to [[Key Biscayne]], [[South Florida]] in search of better prices for cocaine.&lt;ref name=november/&gt; His lifestyle was influenced by the movies ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[Miami Vice]].''&lt;ref name=sf/&gt; Santos purchased cocaine from a source in [[Miami]], a friend transported it from Miami to Seattle, and the friend from the original purchase would distribute it locally in Seattle.&lt;ref name=november/&gt; In June 1986, [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] Agents arrested Santos' friend in Seattle.&lt;ref name=november/&gt;

===Arrest and trial===
In 1987, at the age of 23, Santos was arrested by federal agents for leading a scheme to distribute [[cocaine]]. In exchange for his cooperation, Santos' friend received a four-year prison term, for which he served about 27 months.&lt;ref name=november/&gt;

In contrast, Santos on the advice of retained counsel took his case to trial. Santos' partners testified against him at his trial.&lt;ref name=sf/&gt; Moreover, Santos testified on his own behalf in the trial stemming from the first indictment against him.&lt;ref name=november/&gt; Santos was found guilty on all counts.&lt;ref name=november/&gt; Although Santos was not initially charged with the distribution of cocaine that took place after his arrest, he made a statement to the U.S. attorney accepting full responsibility for distribution while incarcerated and admitted that he perjured himself during the trial. Santos separately agreed to plead guilty to charges of perjury and for helping others to distribute cocaine that was left over from the previous indictment.&lt;ref name=november/&gt;

===Setting goals and sentencing===
As Santos awaited sentencing, he picked up a copy of ''Treasury of Philosophy'' by [[Dagobert D. Runes]] and learned about [[Socrates]].&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt; Santos told Judge [[Jack Edward Tanner]]: "I have to find a way to reconcile with society."&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt; Santos set three goals: to educate himself, to find a way to contribute to society, and to start building a support network of law-abiding citizens who could mentor him.&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt;

Judge Tanner sentenced Santos to a 45-year sentence for "operating a continuing criminal enterprise".&lt;ref name="ethic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicsdaily.com/michael-santos-rare-success-in-prison-rehabilitation-cms-18258 |title=Michael Santos – Rare Success in Prison Rehabilitation on |publisher=Ethicsdaily.com |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sf/&gt; Santos was tried and convicted during Ronald Reagan's heightened [[war on drugs|War on Drugs]] that included creating mandatory minimum sentencing. Once he was determined to be guilty, this resulted in the federal government using Santos' sentencing to make an example to deter other criminals.&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt;

==Prison==
Michael served his sentence in many different prisons of every security level, from high-security United States Penitentiaries to minimum-security federal prison camps across the United States.&lt;ref name="sf"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Whiting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Inmate-shares-prison-survival-strategies-4064484.php |title=Inmate shares prison survival strategies |publisher=SFGate |date=2012-11-24 |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santos began his sentence at the infamous [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]].&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt; Santos also was imprisoned at [[Federal Correctional Institution, McKean]], [[Federal Correctional Institution, Fairton]], [[Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix]], and [[Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc]], among others.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=Michael|title=FORT DIX: A LONG-TERM PRISONER'S DESCRIPTION|url=http://www.prisonerlife.com/s_writings14.cfm|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
When Santos arrived at the Atlanta penitentiary his then-wife divorced him. Santos' father lost his business; his parents separated.&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt; Despite such adversity Santos remained disciplined and stuck to his goals. By 1992 Santos earned a bachelor's degree from [[Mercer University]] (with a degree in human resources management).&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt; By 1995 Santos earned a master's degree from [[Hofstra University]], and began work toward his doctorate at the [[University of Connecticut]]; however, a [[Bureau of Prisons]] warden blocked Santos from completing his studies to earn a doctorate.

===Writing and activism===
After the warden ended his education opportunities Santos shifted focus to develop programs and resources to help fellow inmates and their families.&lt;ref name=ethic/&gt; Additionally, while incarcerated Santos authored seven books and had published a number of articles, including for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref name=ethic/&gt;&lt;ref name=sf/&gt;&lt;ref name="Power In Prison"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/24/power-prison-penitentiary-biz-power08-cx_ms_0924santos.html |title=Power In Prison |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since prisons did not offer access to computers, Santos in [[longhand]] manually wrote all books and articles. Santos' wife Carole would then transcribe his work into computer format. Carole also served as a liaison with publishers.

With help from his wife and family, from within prison Santos nevertheless built a significant presence on the Internet. Through the website MichaelSantos.com chronicled his long arduous journey. Moreover, the appeal of his writing resulted in Santos receiving widespread popularity. Media publications cite Santos saying his published writings are his way of contributing to society. His wife maintained his contributions to a [[blog]]. Those writings resulted in his receiving significant recognition&lt;ref name=ethic/&gt;&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Xeni Jardin at 2:15 pm Wed, Jan 9 |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/01/09/what-is-it-like-to-be-exposed.html |title=What is it like to be exposed to new technology after 20+ years in prison? |publisher=Boing Boing |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and universities use his work in courses that teach [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref name=ethic/&gt;

==Release==
The Bureau of Prisons released Michael Santos to [[community confinement]] in August 2012, when he was 48. At that time he had served more than 25 years in federal prison, a (total of 9,135 days in federal custody).&lt;ref name="sf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cafwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafwd.org/reporting/entry/while-in-prison-michael-santos-reconciles-with-society |title=While in prison, Michael Santos reconciles with society &amp;#124; California Forward |publisher=Cafwd.org |date=2012-10-05 |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael remained in federal custody for another year within the confines of the [[halfway house]]. He concluded his obligation to the Bureau of Prisons after more than 26 years on August 12, 2013. ''[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Inmate-shares-prison-survival-strategies-4064484.php The San Francisco Chronicle]'' published an article describing Michael Santos' lengthy odyssey. Michael claimed that he could maintain a high level of discipline and energy because he kept his focus on reconciling with society and emerging with his dignity intact. The Chronicle quoted Distinguished [https://www.law.stanford.edu/profile/joan-petersilia Stanford Professor Joan Petersilia] as saying that Michael was a "Messiah" to other prisoners.

After his release Michael continued to work toward ending mass incarceration and toward helping others who were being prosecuted by the criminal justice system. Along with Justin Paperny of [http://michaelsantos.org/ The Michael G. Santos Foundation], Michael developed programs to help people emerge from the prison experience successfully; he worked to help the formerly incarcerated transition into the labor market; and he worked to bring more awareness to social breakdowns which he believes are spawned by "America's commitment to mass incarceration". He is also a public speaker on overcoming adversity, using the context of his journey as evidence that anyone can become more than external circumstances. Michael has also lectured at numerous universities, including Stanford Law School, the [[University of San Francisco]], and [[UC Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=sf/&gt;

In 2014, PBS's Newshour did video feature story on Santos' efforts to help empower people incarcerated in America and Santos' criticism of America's commitment to mass incarceration.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodruff|first1=Judy|title=Former inmate speaks out against U.S. ‘commitment’ to mass incarceration|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/santos-former-prisoner-looks-help-others/|publisher=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Santos teamed with the [[Maine Department of Corrections]] to improve the outcomes of the state's prison system through programs designed by Santos.&lt;ref name=maine&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=Michael|title=Prison Reform in Maine State Prison|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-santos/prison-reform-in-maine-st_b_7537900.html?ir=Crime|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2960">'''Michigan State Asylum''' may refer to any number of early mental institutions in the state. [[Michigan]] became a state in 1837 and five years later accepted that the principal caring for the mentally afflicted was a state problem. In 1848 a joint resolution required an annual return from the adviser of the number of [[insane]], [[hearing impairment|deaf]], [[muteness|dumb]], and [[blindness|blind]] in the state. In that same year the legislature set aside {{convert|5000|acre}} of land for buildings, next year nearly double that amount, and in 1850, {{convert|16000|acre}}. Not until 1853 was money, $20,000, appropriated out of the general fund of the state treasury. Many hospitals/prisons have been referred to as ''"Michigan State Asylum"''.   There were once 16 State-operated psychiatric facilities in Michigan.  Between 1987 and 2003 Michigan closed three quarters of its 16 state psychiatric facilities.  Here is a partial list.

*[[Traverse City State Hospital]] in [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]]  - Northern Michigan Asylum
*The [[Newberry State Hospital]] in [[Newberry, Michigan|Newberry]] - Michigan State Asylum for the Insane
*[[Ionia State Hospital]], Ionia, Michigan, now Riverside Correctional Facility - Michigan State Asylum
*[[Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] -  Michigan State Asylum for the Insane
* [[Northville Township, Michigan#Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital|Northville State]] or Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital in Northville, Michigan - Michigan State Asylum
* [[Pontiac State]] or Eastern Michigan Asylum, later renamed the Clinton Valley Center in 1973 in Pontiac, Michigan - Michigan State Asylum
*[[Lapeer State Home and Training School]] in Lapeer, Michigan
*[[Ypsilanti State Hospital]], Ypsilanti, Michigan

The large hospital complex in [[Nankin Township, Michigan|Nankin Township]] called [[Eloise (psychiatric hospital)|Eloise]] was not a Michigan State Asylum.  It was founded as a poor house and farm in 1839 and grew into a large hospital complex. At one time there was a T.B. Sanitarium on the grounds which was phased out in 1923. Wayne County was the only one of Michigan's 83 counties that operated a psychiatric hospital, a general hospital, and an infirmary division all at the same place.

Michigan's three remaining State-operated in-patient psychiatric facilities are:

* [[Caro Center]], Caro, Michigan
* [[Kalamazoo Psychiatric Center]], Kalamazoo, Michigan
* [[Walter Reuther Psychiatric Hospital]], Westland, Michigan

The '''Military Biscuit''' ({{lang-de|Militärbiscuit}}; {{lang-fr| biscuits militaires}}; {{lang-it|biscotti militari}}; {{lang-rm|biscuits militars}};) is a food component of the Swiss army.

==History==
Oscar J. Kambly, the second-generation boss of the traditional swiss company ''Kambly SA'', developed the recipe for flavor-neutral pastries in 1959. It was to replace the military [[Zwieback]] known as ''Bundesziegel'' in German language ([[Federation|federal]] [[Roof tiles|brick]]) and should be compatible  with cheese or sausage as well as with chocolate. It should have a shelf life of at least three years. Since 1959, the army has distributed about a million servings of the military biscuits to the soldiers every year. The military biscuits are also popular by the civilian population of Switzerland.

Some private traders sold military biscuits, which the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport|DDPS]] initially wanted to prevent, because the trade with army food is forbidden. This is also noted on the packaging. Since 2010, Kambly, still a manufacturer of military biscuits, is allowed to sell these to large distributors. The packaging has to be different from the biscuits produced for the military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/leben/essen-und-trinken/Der-Kult-ums-staubigste-Guetzli-/story/10317711 Der Kult ums staubigste Guetzli]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the biscuits have also been distributed together with the military chocolate in a gift box with the dedication of the [[Chief of the Armed Forces (Switzerland)|Chief of the Armed Forces]] to the soldiers who have fulfilled their military service obligations. 25,000 such gift boxes include the recurring yearly production for a year's release for the soldiers in Switzerland.

[[File:Militärbiscuits mit Verpackung.jpg|thumb|Smale Militärbiscuits Package and both sides]]
In addition to the standard packaging, the Military Biscuit is also available as [[promotional merchandise]] with two pieces packed to a 9g small packaging.

The 16-year-old was held captive, [[Child abuse|abused]] and [[Torture murder|tortured to death]] over a period of three months by Gertrude Baniszewski, Baniszewski's children, and other neighborhood children. Likens' parents, who were [[Traveling carnival|carnival]] workers, had initially left her and her sister Jenny in the care of the Baniszewski family, paying Gertrude $20 a week to care for the sisters.

Baniszewski, her daughter Paula, her son John, and two neighborhood youths, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs, were tried and convicted of torturing and [[Child murder|murdering]] Likens. The case was described by the prosecutor in Baniszewski's trial as "the most terrible crime ever committed in the state of Indiana".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835635,00.html Avenging Sylvia]; ''Time Magazine'', 27 May 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backgrounds==

===Gertrude Baniszewski===
'''Gertrude Nadine Baniszewski''' ({{nee|'''Van Fossan'''}}; September 19, 1929 – June 16, 1990) was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to Mollie Myrtle (''née'' Oakley) and Hugh Marcus Van Fossan Sr., both of whom were originally from [[Illinois]] and were of [[Americans|American]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent. Baniszewski was the third of six children. On October 5, 1939, Baniszewski witnessed her 50-year-old father's death from a sudden heart attack. Six years later, she dropped out of school to marry 18-year-old John Stephan Baniszewski (1926–2007), who was originally from [[Youngsville, Pennsylvania]], with whom she had six children. Although John Baniszewski had a volatile temper, the two stayed together for ten more years before divorcing.

Baniszewski, then 34, moved in with 22-year-old Dennis Lee Wright, who abused her. She had one child with Dennis, Dennis Lee Wright Jr. (later given the name Denny Lee Wright by his adoptive mother), but after his birth, Wright abandoned Gertrude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/2.html|title=truTV - Funny Because it&amp;#039;s tru|website=truTV|access-date=2016-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016070750/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/2.html|archive-date=2013-10-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sylvia Likens===
'''Sylvia Marie Likens''' (January 3, 1949 – October 26, 1965) was the third child of [[Carny|carnival workers]] Lester Cecil Likens (1926–2013) and his wife Elizabeth Frances "Betty" (née Grimes, 1927–1998). She was born between two sets of fraternal [[twin]]s: Diana and Danny (two years older), and Jenny and Benny (one year younger, the former disabled by [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]).&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901828,00.html Addenda to De Sade]; ''Time Magazine'', 6 May 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Likens' parents' marriage was unstable. The family moved frequently, and the parents had financial difficulties. Likens and her sister Jenny were often boarded out or forced to live with relatives, such as their grandmother, so that their schoolwork would not suffer while their parents were on the road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/3.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Foster Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825083251/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/3.html |date=2008-08-25 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; To earn money, Likens babysat and ironed, the same kind of work that was done by Gertrude Baniszewski. At the time of Likens' death, her favorite rock band was [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kLG4NQn0yfQC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=Memorial+Baptist+Church+sylvia+likens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b7s7j_Pkzw&amp;sig=2KWFo_DLm67dUl2gi640-scvsbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_x47YxJzWAhWFy7wKHaCNCDQQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Memorial%20Baptist%20Church%20sylvia%20likens&amp;f=false|title=House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1965, Sylvia and Jenny Likens were living with their mother, Betty, in Indianapolis. During that time, Betty was arrested and jailed for [[shoplifting]]. Lester Likens, who had recently separated from his wife, arranged for his daughters to board with Gertrude Baniszewski, the mother of the girls' new friend Paula Baniszewski (aged 17) and Paula's six siblings, Stephanie (15), John (12), Marie (11), Shirley (10), James (8), and few-months-old Dennis Lee Wright Jr. During her early time with the Baniszewski family, she would sing with Baniszewski's daughter, Stephanie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/4.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Foster Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601215939/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/4.html |date=2009-06-01 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Baniszewskis were poor, Lester "didn't pry" into the condition of the house (as he reported at the trial), and he encouraged Baniszewski to "straighten his daughters out."&lt;ref name=IndyStar&gt;[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/sylvia.html The murder of Sylvia Likens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010807200635/http://www.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/sylvia.html |date=2001-08-07 }}; ''Indianapolis Star'', Library Factfiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse and death==
Lester Likens agreed to pay Baniszewski $20 a week in exchange for her care of the Likens girls. Baniszewski, described by ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' as a "haggard, underweight [[asthma]]tic",&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; was suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and the stress of several failed marriages. When the weekly payment arrived late, Baniszewski beat the Likens girls on their bare buttocks with paddles.

Baniszewski soon focused her [[child abuse|abuse]] exclusively on Sylvia. She accused her of stealing candy that she had bought, and humiliated her when she admitted that she once had a boyfriend. Baniszewski's daughter, Paula, who was pregnant at the time, kicked Likens in the genitals and accused her of being pregnant. Later medical examination proved that Likens was not pregnant and could not have been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/5.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: A Dubious Start] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912111536/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/5.html |date=2008-09-12 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; Baniszewski began allowing her older children to beat Likens and repeatedly push her down stairs for entertainment. During a church function, Baniszewski [[Force-feeding|force-fed]] Likens a [[hot dog]] overloaded with condiments. Likens vomited afterwards, which she was later forced to consume. Baniszewski also accused Likens of [[prostitution]] and delivered [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] sermons about the filthiness of prostitutes and women in general.

Likens was later accused of spreading rumors within [[Arsenal Technical High School]] that Paula and Stephanie Baniszewski were prostitutes. This supposedly provoked Stephanie's boyfriend, Coy Hubbard, to physically attack Likens. Hubbard and his classmates soon made frequent visits to the Baniszewski residence to torment Likens, often collaborating with Bansizewski's own children and Baniszewski herself. With Baniszewski's encouragement, they routinely beat her&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;, forced her to eat feces and drink urine, used her as a practice dummy in violent [[judo]] sessions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/features/looking-back-indianas-infamous-crime-50-years-later/|title=Looking Back On Indiana's Most Infamous Crime, 50 Years Later|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, lacerated her, burnt her body with lit cigarettes over 100 times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/teen-girl-fatally-bullied-indiana-house-horrors-article-1.1309751|title=Teen girl fatally bullied in Indiana house of horrors|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and severely injured her genitals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+mauling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGSvm_dYp&amp;sig=3-BNwkDBPlm0lQBoSFJ6blvfd_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijhc61muPXAhVGErwKHY6mCAUQ6AEIcTAP#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20mauling&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To entertain Gertrude and her teenage accomplices, Likens was forced to strip naked in the living room and insert an empty Coca-Cola bottle into her own vagina.&lt;ref name="IndyStar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fOQxIMXq35sC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;lpg=PR16&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+masturbate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RHokquSaYH&amp;sig=-W1vEH9TaPhi2Xx0-Gq8YIOOmRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj84ILu6d3YAhXBopQKHemdAtUQ6AEITzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20masturbate&amp;f=false|title=House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Baniszewski once beat Likens in the face with such force that she broke her own wrist. She later had to wear a cast, which she used to further beat Likens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177&amp;sid=0be6b27a888f78f72360647d85b4b093|title=Jenny Fay Likens - Sister of Deceased - Sylvia Likens|website=sylvialikens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=eONxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+beaten+with+cast&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7-werp-P_L&amp;sig=PMyFIdvOAIDl2BNcGJXM7j-bkc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVtd-khprWAhXFwrwKHVZQCQMQ6AEIWDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20beaten%20with%20cast&amp;f=false|title=World Encyclopedia of 20th Century Murder|last=R. Nash|first=Jay|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude Baniszewski later forced Jenny to hit her sister, beating her if she did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/7.html "The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917053831/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/7.html |date=2008-09-17 }} Crime Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Raymond and Phyllis Vermillion, a middle-aged couple who moved next door, saw Gertrude to be an ideal caretaker for their two children. They visited the Baniszewski residence on two occasions, where they witnessed Paula, with Gertrude's approval, abusing Likens and boasting about it in front of them. The Vermillions refused to report the abuse to the authorities out of fear on both occasions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=173|title=Phyllis Vermillion - Next Door Neighbor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baniszewski eventually forbade Likens from attending school after Likens confessed to having stolen a gym suit from the school when Baniszewski would not buy a gym suit for her. She brutally beat and whipped Sylvia and did the same for Jenny after remembering that she supposedly stole a tennis shoe. Baniszewski then switched the topic to the "evils" of premarital sex and brutally kicked Sylvia repeatedly in the genitals. She also burned all of her fingers with matches and further whipped her.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+gym+suit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGVvnS7Um&amp;sig=WTIum4elXzljW-EsdKm3G49sWvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPqKqsx7rYAhUKe7wKHRdDBq4Q6AEIZDAP#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20gym%20suit&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Likens eventually became [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]] due to the severity of the torture.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kLG4NQn0yfQC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+incontinent+house+of+evil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b7t7l5RjEw&amp;sig=0tzn0Z2Pfp3iwl56pA-2U5PUlpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS_MnXvsfYAhVMmJQKHefRBcYQ6AEIZDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20incontinent%20house%20of%20evil&amp;f=false|title=House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was denied access to the bathroom and so was forced to wet herself. As punishment for her incontinence, Baniszewski threw her in the basement and locked her in. Throughout her captivity, Baniszewski frequently, with the assistance of her children and their friends, restrained Likens in a bathtub filled with scalding water and rubbed salt onto her burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177|title=Jenny Fay Likens - Sister of Deceased|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was often kept naked and rarely fed. At times, Baniszewski and her twelve-year-old son John Jr. would make Likens eat her own feces, as well as urine and feces from the diaper of Gertrude Baniszewski's one-year-old son. She also made abusing Likens a pastime, charging the neighborhood children five cents to see the "display" of Likens' naked body and tie, beat, burn and mutilate her. Likens attempted to alert the neighbors for help by screaming and hitting the walls of the basement with a spade, ultimately to no avail.

The Likens sisters had no way to contact other family members to inform them of the abuse. Jenny, especially, struggled to do this since she was constantly threatened by Baniszewski that she would be abused and tortured next like her sister. She was also [[Bullying|bullied]] by the neighborhood girls and beaten whenever she alluded to Sylvia's situation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Nonetheless, they encountered Diana, their older and married sister, at the local park. Since Diana was forbidden by her parents to make contact with the sisters due to her estrangement, she initially assumed that the punishments Sylvia and Jenny were receiving were related to this. Neither party was aware that they lived less than a mile and a half apart. Diana eventually learned that Sylvia and Jenny were staying at a strangers' home and she attempted to visit them. Upon her visit, Bansizewski told Diana, unaware of who Baniszewski was, that the Likens sisters were not allowed to see her and ordered her off her property. At one point, Diana secretly gave a starving Sylvia a sandwich. Sylvia remained silent about the matter but after Marie Baniszewski revealed it, Paula and Gertrude choked and paddled Sylvia before subjecting her to another scalding bath.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, a neighbor made an anonymous report, which prompted an in-home visit by a public health nurse. The nurse entered the home and made inquiries, but had no choice but to leave without further investigation. She told Baniszewski the report was about Likens; Baniszewski replied she had kicked Likens out of her house, and that her whereabouts were unknown. The nurse had no way of knowing that the subject of her inquiry was right below her in the basement. 

Likens was often deprived of water. Jenny later speculated, during her court testimony, that Likens was unable to produce tears due to [[dehydration]].&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"/&gt;

On October 22, Likens was forced by John to eat a bowl of soup with her fingers. John quickly took away the bowl when Likens attempted to eat it. Baniszewski eventually allowed her to sleep upstairs, under the condition that she learned not to wet herself. That night, Likens whispered to Jenny to give her a glass of water before falling asleep. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;On October 23, Baniszewski discovered that Likens had urinated herself. As punishment, Likens was forced to masturbate with an empty glass Coca-Cola bottle in front of Baniszewski's children. After that, she stripped Likens naked and [[Human branding|carved]] the words "I'M A PROSTITUTE AND PROUD OF IT" onto Likens' abdomen with a heated needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19651028&amp;id=ZgYrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NZgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6404,6841839&amp;hl=en|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+whipping&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGToqZfVh&amp;sig=drMzugkCi-YaYiR60-NR5kUjptI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY8sXyie3XAhWLp5QKHb8LC7gQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=october%2022&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Baniszewski was unable to finish the branding, she had Richard Hobbs finish. Hobbs continued to brand Likens as Baniszewski calmly took Jenny to the groceries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hobbs and 10-year-old Shirley Baniszewski then used an [[Fire iron|iron poker]] in an attempt to burn the letter "S" into Likens' chest; the burn scar ended up looking like the number "3."&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"&gt;[http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177&amp;sid=2d539eaab9268eeaf90fd1f33a10776d] Jenny Fay Likens&lt;/ref&gt; Baniszewski later taunted Likens about how she would never be able to marry a man due to the words carved onto her stomach. Likens was taken back to the basement, where Coy Hubbard arrived to tie her up and slam her body against the walls six to seven times. That night, Likens confided to her sister, "I'm going to die. I can tell". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;The next day, Baniszewski woke Likens, then dictated a letter to her, intending to mislead her parents into believing that she had run away. The letter also tried to frame a group of anonymous boys for abusing and mutilating Likens after she supposedly agreed to have sexual relations with them. After Likens finished the letter, Baniszewski formulated a plan to have John Jr. and Jenny take Sylvia to a nearby forested area and leave her there to die.

On October 25, Likens tried to escape after overhearing Baniszewski's plan to blindfold her&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"/&gt; and dump her body in Jimmy's Forest, a wooded area nearby. Likens fled to the front door but due to her extensive injuries, Baniszewski caught her in time. Likens was provided with toast but was unable to eat it due to her severe dehydration. Baniszewski shoved the toast into her mouth and struck her face several times with a curtain rod. She violently threw Likens into the basement and with the assistance of Hubbard, she tied and bludgeoned her until she was unconscious. Likens managed to recover but was unable to speak intelligibly and move her limbs properly. Likens tried to exit the basement but collapsed before she could make it to the stairs. Baniszewski crushed her head with her feet and stood there for several moments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 26, after multiple beatings, burnings, and scalding baths, Likens died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; She was 16 years old.

When Stephanie Baniszewski and Richard Hobbs realized that Likens was not breathing, Stephanie tried to give her [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. Banzisewski, however, shouted at them that Likens was "faking it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=135|title=Richard Hobbs - Defendant|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Baniszewski finally realized that Likens was dead, she sent Hobbs to call the police from a nearby [[payphone]]. When police arrived, Gertrude Baniszewski handed them the letter she had forced Likens to write a few days previously. Before the police officers left the house, however, Jenny Likens approached them and said, "Get me out of here and I'll tell you everything."&lt;ref name="LETTER"&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/13.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: The Letter Before End] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824165415/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/13.html |date=2008-08-24 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; Her statement, combined with the discovery of Likens' body, prompted the officers to arrest Gertrude, Paula, Stephanie and John Baniszewski, Richard Hobbs, and Coy Hubbard for murder. Other neighborhood children present at the time—Mike Monroe, Randy Lepper, Darlene McGuire, Judy Duke, and Anna Siscoe—were arrested for "injury to person".

==Trial==
[[File:Jenny Fay Likens.jpg|thumb|Jenny Likens watching the proceedings of the Baniszewski trial. She instigated the investigation and the subsequent arrest of her sister's torturers and murderers.]]

Baniszewski, her children, Hobbs, and Hubbard were held without bail pending their trials.

An examination and autopsy of Likens' body revealed numerous burns, bruising, muscle and nerve damage. All of her fingernails were also broken backwards and most of the skin's outer layer peeled off. Her severely mutilated body led authorities to initially believe that it was the work of an "anonymous madman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+autopsy+madman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmFWmlW7Uh&amp;sig=6hLu6CWNFGw57Ko9l_aoXYzGUKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZsMys-5nWAhXHzbwKHXp1DPIQ6AEIUjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20autopsy%20madman&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her death throes, Likens bit through her lips, partially severing each of them. Her vaginal cavity was nearly swollen shut, although an examination of the canal determined that her [[hymen]] was still intact, which meant it was possible she was still a virgin, discrediting Baniszewski's assertions that Likens was a prostitute and her insistence that she was pregnant. The official cause of death was brain swelling, internal hemorrhaging of the brain, and shock from severe and prolonged damage to her skin.

During the highly publicized trial, Gertrude Baniszewski denied being responsible for Likens' death. She pleaded [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. She claimed that she was too distracted by her ill health and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] to control her children.

Four minors who took part in the abuse of Likens were also put on trial. They were:

*Paula Baniszewski, aged 17
*John Baniszewski, aged 13
*Richard Hobbs, aged 15
*Coy Hubbard, aged 15

The attorneys for the minors claimed that they had been pressured by Baniszewski.

When Gertrude's 11-year-old daughter, Marie Baniszewski, was called to the stand as a witness for the defense, she broke down and admitted that she had been forced to heat the needle with which Hobbs had carved Likens' skin. She also testified that she had seen her mother beating Likens and forcing her into the basement.

In his closing statement, Baniszewski's lawyer said: "I condemn her for being a murderess ... but I say she's not responsible because she's not all here!" He tapped his head to make his point about her state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/16.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Drama in the Court Room] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824121151/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/16.html |date=2008-08-24 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1966, Gertrude Baniszewski was convicted of first-degree [[murder]]. She was spared the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

Paula Baniszewski, who had given birth to a daughter during the trial, was convicted of second-degree murder. She was also sentenced to life imprisonment.

Richard Hobbs, Coy Hubbard, and John Baniszewski Jr. were all convicted of [[manslaughter]] and given two 2-to-21-year prison sentences.

==Aftermath==
Hobbs, Hubbard, and John Baniszewski Jr. each served two years in a reformatory before being paroled in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "150 Hear Likens Case Sentences," ''The Indianapolis News,'' May 25, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indystar"&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS06/80814026 ''Library Factfiles: The murder of Sylvia Likens.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65aUb7lAe?url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FNEWS06%2F80814026# |date=2012-02-20 }} The Indianapolis Star. Access date: November 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski were granted another trial by the [[Supreme Court of Indiana|Indiana Supreme Court]], largely for reasons of a prejudicial atmosphere due to heavy news media publicity before and during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "Court Orders New Trial in Likens Slaying", ''The Indianapolis Star'', September 2, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Baniszewski pleaded guilty to [[voluntary manslaughter]] and was released from prison one year later.&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; Gertrude Baniszewski, however, was again convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "Mrs. Baniszewski Meted Life in Likens Slaying", ''The Indianapolis Star'', August 20, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next 14 years, Baniszewski became a model prisoner at the [[Indiana Women's Prison]], working in the sewing shop and becoming a "den mother" to younger female inmates. By the time she came up for parole in 1985, she was known by the prison nickname "Mom".

The news of Baniszewski's parole hearing sent shockwaves through the Indiana community. Jenny Likens and her family appeared on television to speak out against Baniszewski; the members of two anti-crime groups, Protect the Innocent and Society's League Against Molestation, travelled to Indiana to oppose her parole and support the Likens family, beginning a sidewalk picket campaign. Over the course of two months, the groups collected over 40,000 signatures from the citizens of Indiana, including those who were too young to remember the case, demanding that Baniszewski be kept behind bars.&lt;ref&gt;Caleca, Linda Graham: "Baniszewski Ruling Won't Affect Past Parole Cases, Judge Says", ''The Indianapolis Star'', October 30, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mermel, Marcy: "Mrs. Baniszewski Portrayed as a New Woman", ''The Indianapolis News'', December 3, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efforts, Baniszewski was granted parole. During the hearing, she stated: "I'm not sure what role I had in it ... because I was on drugs. I never really knew her ... I take full responsibility for whatever happened to Sylvia." The [[parole board]], taking her [[Good conduct time|good behavior]] in prison into account, voted in favor of granting Baniszewski's freedom 3–2, and she was released.

Baniszewski was released from prison on December 4, 1985, and traveled to [[Iowa]], where she called herself Nadine Van Fossan, using her middle name and maiden name. She lived in obscurity until her death in [[Laurel, Iowa]], from [[lung cancer]], on June 16, 1990, aged 60.&lt;ref name="indystar"/&gt;

When Jenny Likens, who was then married and living in [[Beech Grove, Indiana]], saw Gertrude Baniszewski's obituary in a newspaper, she clipped it and mailed it to her mother with the note: "Some good news. Damn old Gertrude died. Ha ha ha! I am happy about that."&lt;ref name="Indy Star"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suitcase of sorrow|work=The Indianapolis Star, Linda Graham Caleca (4-3-99)|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/articles/040399.html|accessdate=2009-06-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719004707/http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/articles/040399.html|archivedate=2009-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenny Likens Wade died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on June 23, 2004, at the age of 54.

After the [[Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden|Westside Middle School massacre]], John Baniszewski Jr., by then calling himself John Blake, made a statement claiming that young criminals are not beyond help and describing how he had turned his life around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: In Memoriam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930100521/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html |date=2012-09-30 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] at General Hospital in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], on May 19, 2005, at the age of 52.

Coy Hubbard, Stephanie Baniszewski's boyfriend (who had beaten Likens) was in and out of prison after his release. He was later charged with the murder of two men but was acquitted. He died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on June 23, 2007, at the age of 56 in [[Shelbyville, Indiana]]. 

Paula Baniszewski, the eldest of Gertrude's seven children, received a prison sentence of twenty years to life for her part in Likens' death. Her baby daughter, Gertrude, whom she gave birth to while incarcerated, was later [[Adoption|adopted]]. In 1971, she twice tried unsuccessfully to escape from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=bg13QcMSsq8C |page=910 }} |title=The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis - David J.

The murder charge against Gertrude Baniszewski's second-eldest daughter, Stephanie (aged 15), was dropped after she [[Turn state's evidence|turned state's evidence]] against the other defendants. She assumed a new name and became a school teacher. She married and has several children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Noe |first=Denise |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html |title=The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens — In Memoriam — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930100521/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html |archive-date=2012-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The injury-to-person charges against the younger juveniles, Anna Ruth Siscoe, Judy Darlene Duke, Michael John (Mike) Monroe, Darlene McGuire, and Randy Gordon Lepper, were dropped.

On May 10, 2015, Likens' sister Diana (who was using the name Dianna Bedwell) and her husband, Cecil Knutson, were reported missing by their son, Robert Acosta. Dianna and Cecil had been gambling at the [[San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians|Valley View Casino]] in [[Valley Center, California]]. Surveillance video recorded the couple leaving the casino at about 2 p.m. by car, but they did not show up at their son's house in [[La Quinta, California|La Quinta]]. Acosta contacted the police and appeared on television, asking the public's help in finding his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/05/13/sylvia-likens-older-sister-vanishes-california/27232635/|title=Archives: Sylvia Likens' older sister vanishes in California|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2015, the couple was found in a mountainous area of an Indian reservation by members of a volunteer Jeep patrol. Cecil was dead and Dianna was severely dehydrated after surviving on just rainwater and some food. Dianna was airlifted to a hospital in serious condition. She told investigators they were looking for a shortcut when they got lost and became stuck on a rugged road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2015445/elderly-missing-couple-found-in-california-husband-dead/ |title=Elderly missing couple found in California, husband dead |publisher=globalnews.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house at 3850 East New York Street in which Likens was tortured and murdered stood vacant and rundown for many years after the murder. Although there was some discussion of purchasing it for renovation and using it as a [[women's shelter]], the necessary funds were never raised. The house was demolished on April 23, 2009. The property is now a church parking lot.

A {{convert|6|ft|m|-tall|adj=mid|spell=in}} block of granite was dedicated in June 2001 as a memorial to Likens in Willard Park, 1700 E. [[Washington Street (Indianapolis)|Washington Street]]. The dedication was attended by several hundred people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Will|title=Retro Indy: The Murder of Sylvia Likens, as told 50 years ago|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2015/10/23/indianapolis-most-sadistic-act-sylvia-likens-gertrude-baniszewski-torture-slaying-indianapolis-news-indianapolis-crime-crime-horror-torture/74209878/|accessdate=March 31, 2017|work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 researchers from the Ontario College of Family Physicians reviewed the epidemiological literature from 1992-2003 on health effects and concluded that "exposure to all the commonly used pesticides — phenoxyherbicides, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethrins — has shown positive associations with adverse health effects"&lt;ref&gt;Sanborn et al.

==History==
Pink Triangle Sdn Bhd was founded in 1987 to provide a telephone counseling service for HIV/AIDS and sexuality issues. It was founded to cater for [[gay men]] in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="ptfoundationturns21"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fridae.asia/gay-news/2008/11/27/2162.malaysias-pt-foundation-turns-21 |title=Malaysia's PT Foundation turns 21 |publisher=[[Fridae]] |access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation started in a small room in an apartment on the 13th floor of City Tower in Jalan Alor, Kuala Lumpur before moving to Jalan Inai and finally to its current location at Jalan Ipoh Kecil. &lt;ref name=malaymail2018/&gt; In 2000, PT Foundation was registered under the Register of Companies and took over the assets of Pink Triangle Sdn Bhd and was formally recognized as a Foundation in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="ptfmalaysia.org"&gt;as noted from their website at http://ptfmalaysia.org/v2/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has evolved to provide support and care services to four other vulnerable communities: ''Maknyah'' (a Malay term for a male-to-female [[transgenders|transgender people]]), [[sex worker|commercial sex workers]], drug users and people living with [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="ptfoundationturns21"/&gt;

The '''Pharmaceutical Association of Mauritius''' ('''PAM''') is a professional society serving [[pharmacists]] in [[Mauritius]]. It was founded by a group of pharmacists in 1979.

==Mission==
The goal of the association "is to meet members' needs, encourage personal and professional growth and provide information about events, issues and continuous education opportunities,, industrial news, and a wide variety of membership activities, and to ensure the well-care of patients".&lt;ref name="About Us"/&gt;

* President
* Vice - President
* Secretary
* Assistant - Secretary
* Treasurer
* Assistant - Treasurer
* 5 Members&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmassociationmauritius.org/about_us.html |title=About Us|publisher=Pharmaceutical Association of Mauritius |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory body==
The pharmacy sector in Mauritius is regulated by two laws: the Pharmacy Act 1985 and the Dangerous Drugs Act 2000.&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmassociationmauritius.org/Laws.html |title=Pharmacy and other Laws concerning Health |publisher=Pharmaceutical Association of Mauritius |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
PAM works in close collaboration with the Pharmacy Board of the Mauritius Ministry Of Health and Quality of Life on different matters, such as The National Pharmacovigilence.

==History==
* In 2010 the Pharmaceutical Association of Mauritius delayed its celebration of the Commonwealth Pharmacist Day due to the General Elections being held in Mauritius and of the Football World Cup at the same time. The celebrations were finally held on 7 August, under the chairmanship of Mr Sudhir Misri (as PAM President). The chief guest, Mrs Maya Hanoomanjee, the then Honorable Minister of Health, stated in her speech that she agreed to promulgate the Pharmacy Council Bill and to revisit the Pharmacy Act to bring it in line with other countries.&lt;ref name="Pharmacists_Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthpharmacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Email-news.pdf |title=Commonwealth Pharmacists Day |publisher=commonwealthpharmacy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth Pharmacists Day is celebrated every year on 16 June around over 40 Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth_Countries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-tech-soc.org/CPA.html |title=Commonwealth Pharmacists Association  |publisher=science_technology_and_society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacy_Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevoiceslu.com/features/2009/june/13_06_09/June_16_is_Commonwealth_Pharmacy_Day.htm |title=Commonwealth Pharmacy Day  |publisher=The_Voice_Slu_online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2012, P.A.M, as a founding member of the 'Fédération Pharmaceutique de l’Océan Indien (F.P.O.I) participated actively in the 1st joint [http://pharmassociationmauritius.org/FPOI_CIPF.html F.P.O.I/C.I.P.F]* (Congrès International des Pharmaciens Francophones) conference held at the Sofitel Imperial Hotel in Flic-en-Flac.&lt;ref name="FPOI/CIPF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defimedia.info/dimanche-hebdo/dh-magazine/item/18459-congr%C3%A8s-international-des-pharmaciens-francophones-%E2%80%93-faire-progresser-les-connaissanceset-les-%C3%A9changes.html |title=Congrès international des pharmaciens francophones – Faire progresser les connaissances et les échanges |publisher=Defimedia.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress was chaired by Mr Jayesh Rampadarath (as PAM President).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">'''Photophthalmia''' ( pho·toph·thal·mia (''fōt″of-thal´me-ah'') ) is [[ophthalmia]] or [[inflammation]] of the [[eye]], especially of the [[cornea]] and [[conjunctiva]] due to exposure to intense light of short wavelength (as [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]]), as in snow blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=photophthalmia|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/photophthalmia|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves occurrence of multiple epithelial erosions due to the effect of ultraviolet rays,  especially between 311 and 290&amp;nbsp;nm. Snow blindness occurs due to reflection of ultraviolet rays from snow surface. Photoretinitis is another form that can occur due to infra-red rays (eclipse burn of retina).

==Clinical features==
It can present with the following:&lt;ref name="NemaNema2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=H. V.

In many countries, laws mandate that public agencies use plain language to increase access to programs and services. The United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] includes plain language as one of the "modes, means and formats of communication".&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations General Assembly]]. [http://templatelab.com/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/ ''Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202042110/http://templatelab.com/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/ |date=2016-12-02 }}, Article 2 - Definitions. 13 December 2006, A/RES/61/106, Annex I.

==Definition==

Most [[literacy]] and communications scholars agree that plain language means:
* "Clear and effective communication" ([[Joseph Kimble]])
* "The idiomatic and grammatical use of language that most effectively presents ideas to the reader" ([[Bryan Garner]])
* "Clear, straightforward expression, using only as many words as are necessary. It is language that avoids obscurity, inflated vocabulary and convoluted construction. It is not baby talk, nor is it a simplified version of ... language." (Dr [[Robert Eagleson]])
* "A literary style that is easy-to-read because it matches the reading skill of the audience" ([[William DuBay]])
* "Language that is ''clear, concise'' and ''correct"'' ([[Richard Wydick]])

Plain language focuses on ways of writing a text so that it is clear, concise, pertinent, efficient, and flows well for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;About Plain Language. (n.d.). Plain Language Association International. Retrieved from : http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/About_Plain_Language/aboutplainlanguage.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center for plain language states that: "[a] document, web site or other information is in plain language if the target audience can read it, understand what they read, and confidently act on it".&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"&gt;Write better. (2014). Center for plain language.

==Guidelines and tips==

Writers who wish to write in plain language must first and foremost consider their target audience.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  This should have an influence on what information is included in the text and on how it is written.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  Different audiences have different needs, and require different information.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  When writing, it is important to consider what the target audience needs to accomplish, and what and how much information they need to complete it.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  The target audience will also affect the chosen vocabulary: writing for someone in the same field as the author is different than writing for someone for whom English is his or her second language.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"&gt;Public Works and Government Services Canada. (2014). 13 Plain Language. The Canadian Style. Retrieved from : http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=eng&amp;lettr=chapsect13&amp;info0=13&lt;/ref&gt;

The text must be organized logically: the most important information should be mentioned first, in the text as a whole and in every individual paragraph.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Headings help the reader skim the text more rapidly to find what he or she is looking for.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  Sentences should be kept short, and only include the necessary information.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  A long, verbose sentence tends to present too much information at once, and blurs its main point.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  The text should be direct and concise, and have an easy flow to it.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;

The chosen vocabulary must remain simple and familiar.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Everyday language should be favoured against acronyms, jargon and legal language.&lt;ref name="plainlanguagenetwork.org"/&gt;  Plain language favours the use of the verb form of the word, instead of the noun form.&lt;ref name="plainlanguagenetwork.org"/&gt;  To enhance clarity, plain language privileges the active voice, in which the subject does the action of the verb.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Sentences written in plain language have a positive construction and address the reader directly.&lt;ref name="plainlanguagenetwork.org"/&gt;

Writing in plain language also takes into account the presentation of the text.  It is important to choose a font that is easy to read, and set it to an adequate size.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Sentences written in capital letters are harder to read because the letters are less distinguishable from one another.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Simple design elements like leaving white spaces, using bullets, and choosing contrasting colours encourages a user to read the text and makes it easier to read.&lt;ref name="btb.termiumplus.gc.ca"/&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
[[Cicero]] argued, "When you wish to instruct, be brief; that men's minds take in quickly what you say, learn its lesson, and retain it faithfully. Every word that is unnecessary only pours over the side of a brimming mind."{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Cicero writes that the plain style is not easy. While it may seem close to everyday speech, achieving the effect in formal discourse is a high and difficult art: "Plainness of style seems easy to imitate at first thought, but when attempted, nothing is more difficult."

Plainness does not mean the absence of all ornaments, only the more obvious ones. Cicero recognizes what [[Aristotle]] had already pointed out, that a well-turned [[metaphor]] or [[simile]] can help us see a relation we had not recognized. In fact, he makes use of metaphor and simile to teach us what the plain style is all about: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... although it is not full-blooded, it should nevertheless have some of the sap of life so that, though it lack great strength, it may be, so to speak, in sound health.... Just as some women are said to be handsomer when unadorned... so this plain style gives pleasure when unembellished.... All noticeable pearls, as it were, will be excluded. Not even curling irons will be used. All cosmetics, artificial white and red, will be rejected. Only elegance and neatness will remain. (The Orator, xxiii, 76-79)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shakespeare parodied the pretentious style, as in the speeches of Dogberry in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. 
The plain, or native style, was, in fact, an entire literary tradition during the English Renaissance, from [[John Skelton]] through [[Ben Jonson]] and include such poets as [[Barnabe Googe]], [[George Gascoigne]], [[Walter Raleigh]], and perhaps the later work of [[Fulke Greville]]. In addition to its purely linguistic plainness, the Plain Style employed an emphatic, pre-Petrarchan [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (each syllable either clearly stressed or clearly unstressed).

===19th century===
By the end of the 19th century, scholars began to study the features of plain language. A. L. Sherman, a professor of English literature at the University of Nebraska, wrote ''Analytics of Literature: A Manual for the Objective Study of English Prose and Poetry'' in 1893. In this work, Sherman showed that the typical English sentence has shortened over time and that spoken English is a pattern for written English.

Sherman wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Literary English, in short, will follow the forms of the standard spoken English from which it comes. No man should talk worse than he writes, no man writes better than he should talk.... The oral sentence is clearest because it is the product of millions of daily efforts to be clear and strong. It represents the work of the race for thousands of years in perfecting an effective instrument of communication.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1900 to 1950===
Two 1921 works, Harry Kitson's "The Mind of the Buyer", and [[Edward L. Thorndike]]'s "The Teacher's Word Book" picked up where Sherman left off. Kitson's work was the first to apply empirical psychology to advertising. He advised the use of short words and sentences. Thorndike's work contained the frequency ratings of 10,000 words. He recommended using the ratings in his book to grade books not only for students in schools but also for average readers and adults learning English. Thorndike wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is commonly assumed that children and adults prefer trashy stories in large measure because they are more exciting and more stimulating in respect to sex. There is, however, reason to believe that greater ease of reading in respect to vocabulary, construction, and facts, is a very important cause of preference. A count of the vocabulary of "best sellers" and a summary of it in terms of our list would thus be very instructive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1930s saw many studies on how to make texts more readable. In 1931, Douglas Tyler and Ralph Waples published the results of their two-year study, "What People Want to Read About". In 1934, Ralph Ojemann, [[Edgar Dale]], and Ralph Waples published two studies on writing for adults with limited reading ability. In 1935, educational psychologist [[William S. Gray]] teamed up with Bernice Leary to publish their study, "What Makes a Book Readable".

[[George Orwell]]'s 1946 essay "[[Politics and the English Language]]" decried the pretentious diction, meaninglessness, vagueness, and worn-out idioms of political jargon. In 1979, the [[Plain English Campaign]] was founded in London to combat "gobbledegook, jargon and legalese".&lt;ref&gt;Plain English Campaign. Retrieved August 16, 2011, from: http://www.plainenglish.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===1951 to 2000===
[[Lyman Bryson]] at Teachers College in Columbia University led efforts to supply average readers with more books of substance dealing with science and current events. Bryson's students include Irving Lorge and [[Rudolf Flesch]], who became leaders in the plain-language movement. In 1975, Flesch collaborated with [[J. Peter Kincaid]] to create the [[Flesch-Kincaid readability test]], which uses an algorithm to produce grade level scores that predict the level of education required to read the selected text.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkaid, J.P., Fishburne, R.P., R.L., &amp; Chissom, B.S. (1975). Derivation of New Readability Formulas (Automated Readability Index, Fog Count, and Flesch Reading Ease formula) for Navy Enlisted Personnel. Research Branch Report 8-75. Chief of Naval Technical Training: Naval Air Station Memphis.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument looks at word length (number of letters) and sentence length (number of words) and produces a score that is tied to a U.S. grade school level. For example, a score of 8.0 means that an eighth grader can read the document.

Others who later led plain language and readability research include educator Edgar Dale of Ohio State, Jeanne S. Chall of the Reading Laboratory of Harvard, and George R. Klare of Ohio University. Their efforts spurred the publication of over 200 readability formulas and 1,000 published studies on readability.

Beginning in 1935, a series of literacy surveys showed that the average reader in the U.S. was an adult of limited reading ability. Today, the average adult in the U.S. reads at the 9th-grade level.

Access to health information, educational and [[economic development]] opportunities, and government programs is often referred to in a social justice context. To ensure more community members can access this information, many adult educators, legal writers, and social program developers use plain language principles when they develop public documents{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. The goal of plain language translation is to increase accessibility for those with lower literacy levels.

In the United States, the movement towards plain language legal writing began with the 1963 book ''Language of the Law'', by David Mellinkoff.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.|first=Johnson, Lori|date=2015|title=Say the Magic Word: A Rhetorical Analysis of Contract Drafting Choices|url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/897/|journal=Scholarly Commons @ UNLV Law|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the movement was popularized by Richard Wydick’s 1979 book ''Plain English for Lawyers.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was followed by famous plain language [[Promissory note|promissory notes]] by Nationwide Mutual Insurance and Citibank in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimble|first=Joseph|date=December 1992|title=Plain English: A Charter for Clear Writing|url=https://www.michbar.org/file/generalinfo/plainenglish/pdfs/92_dec.pdf|journal=Michigan Bar Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned about the large number of suits against its customers to collect bad debts, the bank voluntarily made the decision to implement plain language policies in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, M., (2003).

American [[law school]]s began requiring students to take legal writing classes that encouraged them to use plain English as much as possible and to avoid legal jargon, except when absolutely necessary.  Public outrage with the skyrocketing number of unreadable government forms led to the [[Paperwork Reduction Act]] of 1980.

In 1972, the Plain Language Movement received practical political application, when President [[Richard Nixon]] decreed that the "Federal Register be written in layman's terms". On March 23, 1978, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed Executive Order 12044, which said that federal officials must see that each regulation is "written in plain English and understandable to those who must comply with it".&lt;ref name=plainwriting&gt;

By 1991, eight states had also passed legislation related to plain language. Plain Language Association International (PLAIN) was formed in 1993 as the Plain Language Network. Its membership is international; it was incorporated as a non-profit organization in Canada in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About PLAIN |url=http://plainlanguagenetwork.org/networkindex.html |publisher=Plain Language Association International |accessdate=2008-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110220806/http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/networkindex.html |archivedate=2008-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech by SEC Commissioner: Remarks at the Plain Language Association International's Fifth International Conference|publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission]]|year=2005|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch110405cag.htm|accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In June 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] issued a memorandum that called for executive departments and agencies to use plain language in all government documents.&lt;ref name=plainwriting/&gt; Vice President [[Al Gore]] subsequently spearheaded a plain language initiative that formed a group called the Plain Language Action Network (PLAIN) to provide plain language training to government agencies.

[[File:Power of attorney.jpg|thumb|Power of attorney]]
A '''power of attorney''' ('''POA''') or '''letter of attorney''' is a written authorization to represent or act on another's behalf in private affairs, business, or some other legal matter. The person authorizing the other to act is the ''principal'', ''grantor'', or ''donor'' (of the power). The one authorized to act is the ''[[agency (law)|agent]]''&lt;ref&gt;Under Louisiana state law only, the agent is referred to as a "mandatary".  See [http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=110025 Louisiana Civil Code Art. 2989]&lt;/ref&gt; or, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''attorney-in-fact'''.

Formerly, the term "power" referred to an [[legal instrument|instrument]] signed under [[Seal (contract law)|seal]] while a "letter" was an instrument under hand, meaning that it was simply signed by the parties, but today a power of attorney need not be signed under seal. Some jurisdictions require that powers of attorney be notarized or witnessed, but others will enforce a power of attorney as long as it is signed by the grantor.

==Attorney-in-fact==
The term ''attorney-in-fact'' is used in many jurisdictions instead of the term ''agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorney-in-Fact|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/attorney-in-fact|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That term should be distinguished from the term ''[[attorney at law (United States)|attorney-at-law]]''. In the United States, an attorney-at-law is a [[solicitor]] who is also licensed to be an advocate in a particular jurisdiction. An attorney-in-fact may be a layperson and is authorized to act pursuant to the powers granted by a power of attorney, but may not engage in acts that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

In the context of the unincorporated [[reciprocal inter-insurance exchange]] (URIE) the attorney-in-fact is a stakeholder/trustee who takes custody of the subscriber funds placed on deposit with him, and then uses those funds to pay insurance claims. When all the claims are paid, the attorney-in-fact then returns the leftover funds to the subscribers.

The Uniform Power of Attorney Act employs the term ''agent''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/dpoaa/2008_final.htm Uniform Power of Attorney Act, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129080542/http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/dpoaa/2008_final.htm |date=2011-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an agent, an attorney-in-fact is a [[fiduciary]] for the principal, so the law requires an attorney-in-fact to be completely honest with and loyal to the [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]] in their dealings with each other.

Care must be taken when selecting an attorney-in-fact, as some attorneys-in-fact have used their authority to steal the assets of vulnerable individuals such as the elderly (see [[elder abuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Michele|title=Remedying Financial Abuse by Agents Under a Power of Attorney for Finances|journal=Marquette Elder’s Advisor|volume=2|issue=4|pages=39-48|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&amp;context=elders|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and requirements==

===Capacity of the grantor===
{{Main article|Capacity (law)}}
The person who creates a power of attorney, known as the grantor, can only do so when he/she has the requisite mental capacity. Suppose the grantor loses capacity to grant permission after the power of attorney has been created (for example, from [[Alzheimer's disease]] or a head injury in a car crash); then the power will probably no longer be effective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  In some powers of attorney the grantor states that he/she wishes the document to remain in effect even after he/she becomes incapacitated. This type of power is commonly referred to as a [[#Durable power of attorney|durable power of attorney]]. If someone is already incapacitated, it is not possible for that person to execute a valid power. If a person does not have the capacity to execute a power of attorney (and does not already have a durable power in place), often the only way for another party to act on their behalf is to have a court impose a [[conservatorship]] or a [[guardianship]].

===Oral and written===
Depending on the jurisdiction, a power of attorney may be oral and, whether witnessed, will hold up in court, the same as if it were in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power of Attorney|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/power_of_attorney|publisher=Cornell Legal Information Institute|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some purposes, the law requires a power of attorney to be in writing. Many institutions, such as [[hospital]]s, [[bank]]s and, in the United States, the [[Internal Revenue Service]], require a power of attorney to be in writing before they will honor it, and they will usually keep a duplicate original or a copy for their records. Nursing homes often follow the same practice.

===Equal dignity rule===
The '''equal dignity rule''' is a principle of law that requires an authorization for someone performing certain acts for another person to have been appointed with the same formality as required for the act the representative is going to perform. This means, for example, that if a principal authorizes someone to sell the principal's house or other real property, and the law requires a contract for the sale of real property to be in writing (which is required under the [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]] in most U.S. jurisdictions), then the authorization for the other person to sign the sales contract and deed must be in writing too. Likewise, in common-law jurisdictions other than the U.S., a power of an attorney to execute a [[deed]] (i.e. instrument under seal or executed in presence of two witnesses) must be itself executed as a deed.

===Execution===
In order for a power of attorney to become a legally enforceable document, at a minimum it must be signed and dated by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irving|first1=Shae|title=Durable Financial Power of Attorney: How It Works|website=Nolo|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions also require that a power of attorney be witnessed, notarized, or both.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1/&gt; Even when not required, having the document reviewed and signed (and often stamped) by a [[notary public]] may increase the likelihood of withstanding a legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing Challenges to Your Power of Attorney|url=http://www.agis.com/Document/470/preventing-challenges-to-your-financial-power-of-attorney.aspx|publisher=AssistGuide Information Services|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the attorney-in-fact is being paid to act on behalf of the principal, a [[contract]] for payment may be separate from the document granting power of attorney. If that separate contract is in writing, as a separate document it may be kept private between the principal and agent even when the power of attorney is presented to others for the purposes of carrying out the agent's duties.

==Types== &lt;!-- The article [[Right to die]] links to this heading --&gt;
A power of attorney may be: ''special'' (also called ''limited''), ''general'', or ''temporary''. A special power of attorney is one that is limited to a specified act or type of act. A general power of attorney is one that allows the agent to make all personal and business decisions&lt;ref name=ppl&gt;{{cite web|title=Powers of Attorney|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/node/739|publisher=People's Law Library|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Power of Attorney vs. Special Power of Attorney|url=https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/general-and-special-power-of-attorney-documents--important-differences.rl|publisher=RocketLawyer|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary power of attorney is one with a limited time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temporary Power of Attorney|url=http://oregonlawhelp.org/resource/temporary-power-of-attorney?ref=97xzj|publisher=oregonlawhelp.org|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ever required, a durable power of attorney can be revoked or changed as long as the principal is still mentally competent to act.

===Durable===
Under the common law, a power of attorney becomes ineffective if its grantor dies or becomes "incapacitated," meaning unable to grant such a power, because of physical injury or [[mental illness]], for example, unless the grantor (or principal) specifies that the power of attorney will continue to be effective even if the grantor becomes incapacitated. This type of power of attorney is called "power of attorney with durable provisions" in the United States or "[[enduring power of attorney]]" elsewhere. In effect, under a durable power of attorney (DPA), the authority of the attorney-in-fact to act and/or make decisions on behalf of the grantor continues until the grantor's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Elias|title=Gratuitous Transfers: Wills, Intestate Succession, Trusts, Gifts, Future Interests, and Estate and Gift Taxation|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-16040-9|pages=310|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
In some jurisdictions, a durable power of attorney can also be a "health care power of attorney."  This particular affidavit gives the attorney-in-fact the authority to make health-care decisions for the grantor, up to and including terminating care and life support. The grantor can typically modify or restrict the powers of the agent to make end-of-life decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksbar.org/public/public_resources/pamphlets/living_wills.shtml |publisher=Kansas Bar Association |title=Living Wills And The Durable Power Of attorney For Health Care |accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions a health care power of attorney is also referred to as a "[[health care proxy]]" and, as such, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How a Power of Attorney Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/power_of_attorney.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with advance health care directive====
Related to the health care power of attorney is a separate document known as an [[advance health care directive]], also called a "living will". A [[living will]] is a written statement of a person's health care and medical wishes but does not appoint another person to make health care decisions. Depending upon the jurisdiction, a health care power of attorney may or may not appear with an advance health care directive in a single, physical document. For example, the California legislature has adopted a standard power of attorney for health care and advance health care directive form that meets all of that state's legal wording requirements for a power of attorney and advance health care directive in a single document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Elias|title=Gratuitous Transfers: Wills, Intestate Succession, Trusts, Gifts, Future Interests, and Estate and Gift Taxation|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-16040-9|pages=311|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this to New York State, which enacted a Health Care Proxy law that requires a separate document be prepared appointing one as your health care agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New York Code, Public Health Law, Sec. 2981|publisher=State of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Springing===
In some U.S. states and other jurisdictions, it is possible to grant a ''springing power of attorney''; i.e., a power that takes effect only after the incapacity of the grantor or some other definite future act or circumstance.&lt;ref name=ppl /&gt; After such incapacitation the power is identical to a durable power, but cannot be invoked before the incapacity. This power may be used to allow a spouse or family member to manage the grantor's affairs in case illness or injury makes the grantor unable to act.&lt;ref name=spring&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Financial Power of Attorney|url=http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving-resource-center/info-11-2010/lfm_financial_power_of_attorney.html|publisher=AARP|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a ''springing'' power is used, the grantor should specify exactly how and when the power ''springs'' into effect. As the result of [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|privacy legislation in the U.S.]], medical doctors will often not reveal information relating to capacity of the principal unless the power of attorney specifically authorizes them to do so.

Determining whether the principal is "disabled" enough to initiate this type of representation is a formal process. Springing powers of attorney are not automatic, and institutions may refuse to work with the attorney-in-fact. Disputes are then resolved in court.

Unless the power of attorney has been made irrevocable by its own terms or by some legal principle, the grantor may revoke the power of attorney by telling the attorney-in-fact it is revoked.  However, if the principal does not inform third parties and it is reasonable for the third parties to rely upon the power of attorney being in force, the principal might still be bound by the acts of the agent, though the agent may also be liable for such unauthorized acts.

===Standardized forms===
Standardized forms are available for various kinds of powers of attorney, and many organizations provide them for their clients, customers, patients, employees, or members.  However, the grantor should exercise caution when using a standardized POA form obtained from a source other than a lawyer because there is considerable variation in approved formats among the states.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1/&gt; In some states statutory power of attorney forms are available. Examples include the [http://www.ssrplaw.com/files/ca_stautory_pofa.pdf California Statutory Form Power of Attorney], [http://easternabstractny.com/pdf/POA-new.PDF New York Form Power of Attorney] and [http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/forms/advdirectives/F00036.pdf Wisconsin Form Power of Attorney].

==Implied limitations on agent's power==
Although a power of attorney grants the agent powers to perform acts in the absence of the grantor, the POA cannot grant powers to the agent that conflict with rules and regulations governing people and companies that the agent deals with.  For example, if a bank has regulations that require the grantor to be physically present in the bank to perform certain actions, the POA cannot grant the agent power to perform those actions in the absence of the grantor.

==Specialized uses==

===Proxy voting===
[[Robert's Rules of Order]] notes that [[proxy voting]] involves granting a power of attorney. The term "proxy" refers to both the power of attorney itself and the person to whom it is granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 428}}(RONR)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance===
In financial situations wherein a principal requests a securities broker to perform extensive investment functions on the principal's behalf, independent of the principal's advice, power of attorney must be formally granted to the broker to trade in the principal's account. This rule also applies to principals who instruct their brokers to perform certain specific trades and principals who trust their brokers to perform certain trades in the principal's best interest.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Legal status by country==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney.  This can be done either for a pre-defined period of time, or in perpetuity ("enduring").  The power of attorney can be granted to one individual, or to multiple individuals.  When granted to multiple individuals, they may be authorised either to act jointly (all together) or to act severally (each can act individually).  

===England and Wales===
In English and Welsh law, anyone with capacity can grant a power of attorney. These can be general (i.e., to do anything which can legally be done by an attorney), or relate to a specific act (e.g., to sell freehold property). A power of attorney is only valid while the donor has the capacity to ratify the attorney's actions, unless it is made in the form of a [[lasting power of attorney]] and registered with the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This new form of power of attorney was introduced in 2007 under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]] and replaced the former [[enduring power of attorney]], although EPAs correctly made before the law changed are still valid. EPAs only need to be registered if the donor has since lost capacity.

The [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]] provides online process for registering power of attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Make a lasting power of attorney|url=https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/home|website=Gov.UK|publisher=U.K. Government Digital Service|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the provisions in the earlier paragraphs above use terminology different from either common UK usage or terms used in the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. Examples are enduring power of attorney, advance directive, and notary public.

===Republic of Ireland===
In Irish law there are two forms of power of attorney:
*Power of attorney, which may be general or specific, which ceases once the donor becomes incapacitated&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html|title=Power of Attorney|accessdate=27 February 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)] license.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enduring power of attorney, which takes effect once the donor is incapacitated&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
The death of the donor ends both.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

The relevant legislation is the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 and the Enduring Powers of Attorney Regulations 1996 (SI No. 196/1996) as amended by [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] No. 287/1996.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt; Part 7 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for new arrangements for those who wish to make an Enduring Power of Attorney and once the 2015 act is commenced, no new powers of attorney will be created under the 1996 act.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

====Creating powers of attorney====
A solicitor is not necessary when creating Power of Attorney - it can be created when signed by the donor in the presence of a witness.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

Creating an Enduring Power of Attorney requires the following:
*it must be in a particular format&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a doctor stating that the doctor thought the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power of attorney when the document was executed&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from the donor to say that they understood the effect of creating the power&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a solicitor to say they are satisfied that the donor understood the effect of creating the power of attorney&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;
*a statement from a solicitor to say the donor was not acting under undue influence&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

The courts play a general supervisory role in the implementation of the power.&lt;ref name=citizensinformation-power-of-attorney/&gt;

===Russia===
Under Russian law, specifically art. 185 of the Russian Civil Code, a power of attorney may be executed under hand or in notarial form.&lt;ref name="base.garant.ru"&gt;[http://base.garant.ru/10164072/10/#1010 See the Civil Code of Russian Federation (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The power of attorney to act must be notarially executed. Notarial execution is required for any power of attorney made for concluding a contract subject to special public recordation, namely those dealing with interests in immovable property.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 16 of Act 122 of 200З "On state registration of interests in immovable property and related transactions" (in Russian) [http://base.garant.ru/11901341/3/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A power of attorney, pursuant to art. 186 of the Russian Civil Code, must also be dated.&lt;ref name="base.garant.ru"/&gt; Any POA without an express date of execution is void.

;''[[Predstavitelstvo]]'', ''[[:ru:Доверенность|Doverennost]]'' {{ru icon}}
A power of attorney cannot be irrevocable. The grantor may terminate the POA at any time at his or her sole discretion. Any waiver of this right is void, as provided by the Civil Code.

===Scotland===
The Office of the Public Guardian in Scotland offers the eAttorney Electronic Power of Attorney (EPOAR) system for the submission and payment of powers of attorney registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I make a submission?|url=http://www.publicguardian-scotland.gov.uk/power-of-attorney/epoar/submitting-a-power-of-attorney|website=Office of the Public Guardian (Scotland)|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12302">'''Project Mercy, Inc. ''' is a [[Christian]], [[non profit organization]] located in [[Yetebon]], [[Ethiopia]], founded in 1977 by Marta Gabre-Tsadick and Deme Tekle-Wold. Over the past 18 years, Project Mercy's original mission has been expanded to include community development and self-help programs.

The international ministry of Project Mercy was started to provide emergency relief and relocation assistance to Ethiopian refugees.  The ministry has expanded to reach to a number of additional countries including Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Guinea, Iraq, Kenya, Malawi and Sudan.  In 1993, the organization shifted its focus to creating a relief and development model that can be used by others to help break the cycle of famine and poverty in communities.  They have taken a holistic community development approach in aiding the Yetebon community (a farming district in Central Ethiopia) With a variety of programs to aid both the physical and spiritual needs of the area.

== Yetebon, Ethiopia ==

[[Yetebon]] is a small village located 9&amp;nbsp;km from Butajira, and is about a two-hour drive south of [[Addis Ababa]]. It has a population of about 70,000&amp;nbsp;people. Yetebon is the home of the Gurahge people who are tradesmen, herdsmen, and farmers. Project Mercy sits on {{convert|53|acre|m2}} of land, donated by the elders of Yetebon. The people Project Mercy serves in Yetebon are predominantly [[Muslim]] believers. There are many mosques and [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches in the area.

== History ==
In 1974, Marta Gabre-Tsadick, her husband, Demeke Tekle-Wold, and their children were all forced to flee Ethiopia, barely escaping the chaos of the emerging [[Marxist]] government.  Marta, the first woman senator in the Ethiopian government, had been identified as a supporter of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], and because of this, her execution was assured. After hearing this news, Marta and Deme made the decision to flee to [[Kenya]]. After first finding help there, the family soon moved to the United States. Eventually, they all became U.S. citizens,  but Marta and Deme intended to return to help the people in Ethiopia. So, in 1977, they established Project Mercy in Yetebon, the birthplace of Marta's father. It was started to provide [[emergency relief]] and relocation help to refugees. They wanted to "one day return to their homeland to do everything they could to educate its future leaders in restoring its rich heritage" (casefoundation.org). Marta eventually had the opportunity to return to Ethiopia. She received word that a few of the elders of Yetebon wanted to meet with her. The elders expressed to her how they feared for their children's future because there was no hope (people were dying from preventable diseases, the community was illiterate, and there was no clean water or usable roads). Project Mercy is affiliated with [[Share Our Strength]] (SOS). Share Our Strength works with organizations like Project Mercy to identify the most efficient ways of expanding existing social services, and to replicate exemplary models. Project Mercy was originally started as a school for children, grades K-10. In December 2002 Project Mercy used a US$20,000 donation from SOS to feed 600&amp;nbsp;people for six weeks, focusing on severely malnourished children and their parents. In 1983, Marta wrote and published a book, Sheltered by the King, which describes the hardships she and Demeke, along with their children, endured while fleeing Ethiopia to find safety in the U.S., and eventually establish Project Mercy.

== Programs ==

When it started, Project Mercy provided emergency relief and relocation assistance to African [[refugees]]. Project Mercy enlarged its initial focus and, for nearly two decades, it not only provided emergency relief aid, but has expanded its help to educational assistance and support for refugee [[Evangelism|evangelists]]. Project Mercy provides [[social services]], including emergency feeding, job training, [[health care]], including [[HIV/AIDS]] education, irrigation systems, agricultural development, orphan support, and [[education]]. Project Mercy not only responds to crises, but also focuses on self-sufficiency, sustainability and measurable impact.

"In order to fight against poverty you have to attack it from many different directions and then pluck it out," said Marta in 2009 as she described the community development model of Project Mercy.  "We cannot educate children if the only outcome is to make them discontented with the limited job opportunities currently available to them.  We cannot just treat symptoms of malnutrition in the clinic and not also improve nutrition and agricultural production.  We cannot teach good hygiene practices if people still need to bathe and drink from the same contaminated water supply.  Clean water piped into each home is possible but only if economic conditions are improved for the entire community.  Project Mercy is involved in all these things in order to be a means of transformation through which God's love can renew the heart of the nation."

=== Childcare Programs ===

Project Mercy recently embarked on a new orphan and foster care program called the “Children’s Institute”.  This was in response to a request by the local government of the Oromiya Region in Ethiopia if they would accept and provide care for vulnerable children, many of whom are HIV/AIDS victim orphans.  The plan provides for an intimate and nurturing environment for 200 young children in a family-like setting of one house mother and up to eight children per home, and anticipates the construction of 30 family homes.  The homes will each have a garden along with a cow to provide ongoing nutrition and care.  Construction has begun with significant progress being made on the first section of six homes.  Currently a number of orphans are being housed and cared for with other foster children at the Yetebon compound.
Many of the students give back to the community by teaching literacy, HIV/AIDS prevention, family planning, basic arithmetic and back yard gardening to families in the hard to reach mountain areas surrounding Yetebon.  Thousands of people have benefited from this initiative and nearly 8,000 can now read and write for the first time because of these programs.

=== Education Programs ===
The Medhane-Alem School has about 1,600 students enrolled in Kindergarten through grade 12, and there are over 90 graduates of the high school who are currently enrolled in various universities within Ethiopia.  The School Meal Program also provides two meals per school day to each of the students.

==== Skills Enhancement Programs ====
A Skills Enhancement Program is empowering men and women from the community by training them in marketable skills that they can use to earn an income.  Women are being trained in traditional spinning of cotton, weaving baskets, creating embroidered table linens and making elegant jewelry.  Men are learning masonry, construction material fabrication, carpentry and metal working.  In addition to learning a valuable trade, every individual enrolled in our Skills Enhancement Program must also learn basic reading, writing and arithmetic.

=== Healthcare Programs ===
Project Mercy operates the Glenn C. Olsen Primary General Hospital.  This state of the art facility is equipped with diagnostic services, as well as a Surgical Ward, Pediatric Ward, Delivery Ward and Medical Ward.
Additionally, health classes are taught on personal hygiene, food keeping, housekeeping, and communicable and non-communicable disease control.
The hospital also has people from the community who have gone through training to become sanitarians.  They go into the mountains and outer areas of the region and teach families about hygiene and sanitation practices.

=== Relief Programs ===
Providing a means for ongoing food sources is the key to eradicating future famine.  Initiating family food security measures provide sustenance and also a means for income.  Project Mercy’s agricultural program’s focus began as a result of the 2003 famine.  Project Mercy worked very hard during that time to deliver monthly dry rations dispersed to 200,000 heads of families at sites within a 180-mile circumference from Yetebon.  Project Mercy also cared for hundreds of the most severe cases of malnutrition in its emergency feeding centers.  Project Mercy’s Supplemental Care program involved 75,000 children who were fed five times per day.  An additional 1,300 children and elderly were cared for (fed intravenously due to the severity of malnutrition) in our Therapeutic Feeding Program.  In spite of the horrendous effects of the famine, most of the children and elderly were saved.

=== Agriculture Programs ===

==== Demonstration Gardens ====
The farmers in the rural areas of Ethiopia had not been taught many of the newer farming techniques or how to replenish their land.  Project Mercy started large demonstration gardens in order to teach the school students as well as local farmers some of the methods that can be used to enhance their crops.  Gardens were started using a variety of nutritious vegetables – many of which were new to the people of Yetebon.  Once the vegetables matured, many from the community had their first introduction to broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, kale, spinach, etc.  The seeds of some of the new vegetables were also dried for the next planting and shared with those in the community who were interested.  The Project Mercy gardens are also used to provide a large portion of the food for the School Meal Program.

==== Drip Irrigation ====
Depending solely upon their small one acre farms for sustenance was something disastrous for farmers due to long periods of no rain or torrential rains that would wash out their crops.  Project Mercy began experimenting with drip irrigation within its own gardens to manage the effects of the weather cycles.  After it proved to be successful in the demonstration gardens, the drip irrigation program expanded through the dispersion of drip irrigation bucket kits.

==== Fruit Trees ====
ECHO (Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization) has been extremely helpful and gracious in supplying expertise along with a variety of fruit tree seedlings, including avocado, mango and papaya seeds.  Once the trees reach a certain growth stage, they can be used for grafting.  The avocado, mango and papaya survive well with little water and are excellent sources of nutrition.  Once the root stock is built up and growing strong, grafts will be provided to local residents.  These trees will generate nutritious fruit at home sites throughout the community to produce a cash crop in good times and serve as a buffer in times of scarcity.

==== Dairy Cattle Breeding ====
Additional funding and expertise continues to be invested in a Dairy Cattle Breeding Program, which hopes to dramatically increase the milk production through successful crossbreeding and artificial insemination.  The number of new calves born under the program continues to grow.  Barns have been constructed on the 350 acre site in Cha Cha, Ethiopia and new equipment is in place to also plant and assist with crop management.

[[File:Connecting hands.png|thumb|Connecting hands of restorative justice.]]
The practice of [[Restorative justice]] offers an alternative approach for dealing with harm caused by crime.&lt;ref name=Latimer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latimer|first=Jeff |author2=Craig Dowden |author3=Danielle Muise|title=The effectiveness of restorative justice practices: A meta-analysis|journal=The Prison Journal|year=2005|volume=85|issue=2|pages=127–144|doi=10.1177/0032885505276969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses a three-dimensional approach that includes the [[wikt:victim|victim]], the [[offender]], and the [[community]].&lt;ref name=Bazemore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bazemore|first=Gordon|title=Crime victims, restorative justice and the juvenile court: Exploring victim needs and involvement in the response to youth crime|journal=International Review of Victimology|year=1999|volume=6|issue=4|pages=295–320|doi=10.1177/026975809900600404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restorative justice programs are used as a method of improving victim and/or offender satisfaction, increasing offender compliance with restitution, and decreasing the recidivism of offenders as an alternative to traditional criminal justice methods of response (i.e., incarceration, probation, court-ordered restitution, etc.).&lt;ref name="Latimer" /&gt; The current approach to crime, as Stinchcomb and Fox (1999) point out, “does little to reinforce any sense of either personal responsibility on the part of the offender or personal involvement in the justice process on the part of the victim."&lt;ref name=Stinchcomb&gt;{{cite book|last=Stinchcomb|first=Jeanne|title=Introduction to Corrections|year=1999|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restorative justice practices in social work are often geared towards cultivating alternative spaces, which value personal responsibility and involvement.

==Definition==
Latimer, Dowden, and Muise (2005) define restorative justice as:
::A voluntary, community-based response to criminal behavior that attempts to bring together the victim, the offender, and the community, in an effort to address the harm caused by the criminal behavior.&lt;ref name="Latimer" /&gt;

The fundamental premise of the restorative justice paradigm states that crime is a violation of people and relationships rather than just a violation of law.&lt;ref name=Zehr&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehr|first=Howard|title=Changing lenses : a new focus for crime and justice|year=1990|publisher=Herald Press|location=Scottdale, Pa.|isbn=0836135121|edition=3. ed., [Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; A violation of relationships requires a restoration process which incorporates voluntariness, truth telling, and a face-to-face encounter.&lt;ref name=Llewellyn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Llewellyn|first=Jennifer|author2=Robert L. Howse |title=Restorative justice: A conceptual framework|journal=Prepared for the Law Commission of Canada|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models of restorative justice can be grouped into three categories: circles, conferences, and victim-offender mediations. The principles upheld in each remain relatively similar.&lt;ref name="Latimer" /&gt;
::'''Circles''', which are often called peacemaking, sentencing or talking circles, are "a method of communication and problem solving derived from aboriginal and Navajo traditions as a community-based way to resolve conflict."&lt;ref name=Gumz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumz|first=Edward J.|author2=Cynthia L. Grant |title=Restorative Justice: A Systematic Review of the Social Work Literature|journal=Families in Society|date=1 January 2009|volume=90|issue=1|pages=119–126|doi=10.1606/1044-3894.3853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
::'''Conferences''' are sometimes referred to as restorative conferences or [[Family Group Conference|family group conferences]].  They involve "extensive pre-conference preparation with the assistance of a facilitator and ultimately allows for family members of the victim and offender to meet in person to express their thoughts and feelings as a way to heal the pain of wrongdoing."&lt;ref name="Gumz" /&gt;
::'''[[Restorative justice#Processes|Victim-Offender Mediation (VOM)]]''' is "a face-to-face meeting involving a trained mediator, crime victim, and person who committed the crime."&lt;ref name="Gumz" /&gt; During this contact, the offender and the victim might share their experiences and feelings surround the event.&lt;ref name="Gumz" /&gt;

Methods of restorative justice benefit both victims and offenders by emphasizing the recovery of the victim through redress, vindication, and healing and by encouraging recompense by the offender through reparation, fair treatment, and habilitation.&lt;ref name="Van Ness"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Ness|first=Daniel|title=Restoring justice|year=1997|publisher=Anderson Pub.|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|isbn=1583605207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of coming together to restore relationships, the community is also provided with an opportunity to heal through the reintegration of victims and offenders.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn" /&gt;

==History==
The [[Restorative justice#History|history of restorative justice]] has its roots in the indigenous rituals of New Zealand communities where shaming of the offender was used as punishment for wrongdoings. Other communities—including African American, Latin@, Canadian Mennonite, and Native American—have also engaged in various restorative justice practices for many years.&lt;ref name="Gumz" /&gt;

[[Howard Zehr]] is known as the grandfather of the Americanized restorative justice movement and refers to the three pillars of restorative justice:

::				
::*Wrongs and offenses to victims mean that offenders need to be held accountable and responsible.				
::*Restorative justice principles emphasize the importance of victims, offenders, and the community to be involved in a dialogue about what justice means in a particular case.&lt;ref name=Zehr2&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehr|first=Howard|title=The little book of restorative justice|year=2002|publisher=Good Books|location=Intercourse, PA|isbn=1561483761}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
		 	 	 						
The traditional justice system utilizes a one-dimensional adversarial approach with attention given primarily to the offender,&lt;ref name="Gumz" /&gt; as opposed  to the alternative approach, restorative justice, which provides a holistic approach including all involved in the injustice.

In 1994, Mark Umbreit founded the Center for Restorative Justice &amp; Peacemaking at the School for Social Work in the University of Minnesota. This was the first academic-based center for restorative justice that sponsored both research and training in the field. Having already been established in the School for Social Work since the early 1980's, Umbreit developed the Humanistic Approach to Mediation, emphasizing how restorative dialogue humanizes the resolution process as parties connect more deeply with the humanity of the other party. Mediators, through deep listening and mindfulness, learn to practice an indirect approach to facilitation by knowing when to 
step out of the way so that victimized and offending parties can experience direct, heart-to-heart conversation.

==Application in social work==

[[Restorative justice]] through a social work lens exists as an alternative to punitive methods of justice. It works to humanize all people involved, including ones being held responsible for an injustice. [[Social justice]] is one of the core values of [[social work]]. As a core value, it calls for more restorative methods of justice to be adopted, in order to break off the continuation of marginalizing systems, such as the [[prison-industrial complex]]. Restorative methods of justice seek peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Van Wormer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Wormer|first=Katherine|title=Restorative justice: a model for social work practice with families|journal=The Journal of Contemporary Social Services|year=2003|volume=84|issue=3|pages=441–448|doi=10.1606/1044-3894.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focus attention on the harm done by an injustice and repairing the hurt caused, as opposed to the focus being on punishing the perpetrator of the injustice.&lt;ref name="Van Wormer" /&gt; It is in accordance with social work as a field to redistribute justice and counteract the present societal state of affairs.

Restorative justice practices have the potential to decrease recidivism of offenders, fewer long-term effects of victimization, and strengthening of the aggregate well-being of a community. This three-dimensional approach to handling interpersonal injustices can be beneficial for all parties involved.&lt;ref name="Latimer" /&gt;			
					
Van Wormer (2002) describes restorative justice as a practice requiring societal institutions to work towards repairing the damage incurred by those who have been injured, while reintegrating perpetrators into society. Additionally, those most directly affected by crime (including victims and family members) should have the voluntary opportunity to participate in the response to crime.&lt;ref name="Van Wormer2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Wormer|first=Katherine|title=Restorative justice and social work|journal=Social Work Today|year=2002|volume=2|issue=1|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tschudi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tschudi|first=Finn|author2=Sissel Reichelt |title=Conferencing when therapy is stuck|journal=Journal of Systemic Therapies|year=2004|volume=23|issue=1|pages=38–52|doi=10.1521/jsyt.23.1.38.29398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Restorative justice methods===
The three types of restorative justice practices specific to social work are [[Restorative justice#Processes|victim–offender mediation]] (VOM), [[Family Group Conference|family group conferencing]] (FGC), and peacemaking circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccp.org/ccpprograms/peacemakingcircles.html|title=Peacemaking Circles - Restorative Justice in Action - Lancaster, PA|work=ccp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Umbreit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Umbreit|first=Mark S. |author2=Robert B. Coates |author3=Betty Vos|title=Victim‐offender mediation: Three decades of practice and research|journal=Conflict Resolution Quarterly|year=2004|volume=22|issue=1-2|pages=279–303|doi=10.1002/crq.102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
			
Van Wormer and Bednar (2002) offer a bridge between restorative justice and the strengths perspective, which is a widely used social work approach that takes into consideration client capabilities and positive characteristics as a vehicle for change and coping. For example, an integrated theoretical understanding applied to battering males is termed “the restorative-strengths approach” and offers a new application for social work practice utilizing restorative justice practices.&lt;ref name="Van Wormer3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Wormer|first=Katherine|author2=Susan G. Bednar |title=Working with male batterers: A restorative-strengths perspective|journal=Families in Society|year=2002|volume=83|issue=5|pages=557–565|doi=10.1606/1044-3894.66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SSM Health''' is a [[Catholic]], not-for-profit [[United States]] [[health care system]] with more than 1,600 employed physicians and 40000 other employees in four states, including [[Wisconsin]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Illinois]], and [[Missouri]].  SSM Health is one of the largest employers in the cities it serves. 

SSM Health adopted the electronic health record early on, and provides care in a range of settings, including [[hospitals]], pediatric medical centers, outpatient centers, clinics, surgery centers, [[nursing homes]], assisted living facilities, physician offices, emergency centers, rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, home care, and hospice.

Based in St. Louis, Missouri, SSM Health operates 20 hospitals, and has affiliations with 39 additional hospitals. SSM Health also owns two nursing homes and has a variety of partnerships with physicians.

In 2013, Dean Health System, a large multi-specialty physician group and health plan, finalized a deal to merge Dean and its subsidiaries, including Dean Health Plan, into SSM Health. The merger became effective on September 1, 2013, after all necessary regulatory approvals were received.

SSM Health is sponsored by the [[Franciscan Sisters of Mary]] and is one of the largest Catholic hospital systems in the [[United States]].
Recently SSM Health has acquired Agnesian HealthCare from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  This acquisition included 3 hospitals, Waupun Memorial, Ripon Medical, St Agnes Hospital along with a surgery center in Fond du lac. This included various clinics, nursing homes/hospice care, urgent care facilities.

== History of SSM Health ==
SSM Health traces its roots to 1872, when Mother [[Mary Odilia Berger]] and four other sisters came to St. Louis from [[Germany]], after caring for sick and wounded soldiers during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Facing religious persecution in Germany, they came to the [[United States]]. When they arrived in St. Louis they began providing [[nursing]] care to people in their own homes. That winter, when a smallpox epidemic hit St. Louis, the sisters cared for the sick and dying. For a short time, people referred to them as the Smallpox Sisters. In 1874, the congregation received its formal name: the [[Sisters of St. Mary]] (SSM) from the parish where their convent was located, [[St. Mary of Victories Church|St. Mary of Victories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Historic St Mary of Victories Hungarian Catholic Church|url = http://smov.info|website = smov.info|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the riverfront in St. Louis.

Five years after their arrival in St. Louis, the sisters borrowed $16,000, to open their first hospital, St. Mary’s Infirmary. Almost 60 percent of their patients were unable to pay for their health care services. Account ledgers from this time identify those who were unable to pay for their services as an “ODL,” a designation that stood for “Our Dear Lord’s.” During this time, the sisters relied on God to provide for their needs as they cared for the poor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Most of the [[health care]] facilities that today belong to SSM Health were previously part of a group of hospitals owned by the Sisters of St. Mary and centrally governed, but not centrally managed. In the mid-1980s, the sponsoring congregation decided to reorganize its hospitals into a system of centrally managed health care providers, and SSM Health was created in 1986. Today the system is managed by a team of professionals—both lay and religious—and governed by members of the sponsoring congregation as well as by laypersons from the communities served by its facilities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 2012, SSM Health stated that it was 'disappointed with the contraceptive mandate' regarding being legally forced to cover such items by the [[Affordable Care Act]], against Catholic [[freedom of conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel3000.com/health/30345393/detail.html Channel 3000, accessed 8th Feb 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SmartCare''' electronic [[health record system]] (EHR) has been developed and deployed by the [[Zambia]] [[Ministry of Health (Zambia)|Ministry of Health]] (MoH) in collaboration with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and many other implementing partners.

SmartCare is:

* A fully integrated electronic health record system to provide continuity of care
* A clinical management information system at the facility and district (management/admin) level
* A key component in 'one National M&amp;E system'

SmartCare is also the name of a child care management software solution available in the United States.

== Programme ==
=== Vision ===
* Every Zambian receives cost-effective, confidential, quality health care whenever and wherever they need it.
* Every man, woman and child has an electronic health record;
* Every point of clinical service can access and update this record;
* Every clinician understands the value of this record and is committed to maintaining it;
* Each clinical facility, District, Provincial and the national Ministry of Health HQ routinely monitors &amp; evaluates reports  from this data, and uses this information to optimally allocate human and other resources, and to assure continuous systematic improvement in health services.

=== Mission ===
To enable the delivery of cost-effective, confidential, quality health care for everyone, everywhere, every time, by improving health records and related health information systems.

== System innovations ==
; Distributed database system
: Given resource constraints in developing countries such as Zambia where electricity is still not available in some parts of the nation, having Internet access throughout the nation will take many more year. SmartCare data is held at each facility in a distributed design; unlike centralized designs of most systems. Internet is not essential, merely an added benefit.
; Care Card
: SmartCare uses client carried care cards or staff carried flash drives for a lower-tech connectivity solution that works today. An individual's health information is stored on a very compressed, secure care card to maintain continuity of care between visits, health services and health facilities. The individual's health record is also stored on the health facility installation database for backup and generation of facility level and health management information system reports.
; Touchscreen
: Making the data capture task bearable can be the most challenging part of EHR design. SmartCare extends a successful Malawi idea, where touchscreen data entry by existing staff lowers this barrier. The software works well with a touch screen monitor enabling the clinician to view and record patient data. This tool, in combination with client specific data, can provide decision support for over-extended clinicians, and clinician assistants. Clinicians can ‘read and touch’ to enter data; no typing is required. See the image at top for example screen with touch screen technology enabled.
; GIS data visualization
: Aggregate health data stored at health facilities can be visualized in GIS maps. This includes live patient data as well as static data from health surveys.

== Deployment status in Zambia ==
* Ministry of Health, Zambia has deployed SmartCare in &gt; 800 facilities (clinical and district/provincial/national levels), in 94 districts (mid-2014); patient enrollment &gt;200,000
* Partners are supporting deployment in government and private facilities (for instance: ZPCT &gt;44, CIDRZ &gt;56, AIDSRelief &gt;12), but government deployment &amp; enrollment rates are increasing most rapidly

=== Future plans ===
* Capacity building and systems strengthening by developing SmartCare 
* Completion of ambulatory service modules e.g. OPD, family planning, and children’s clinic
* Systems integrations with other health record systems in Zambia ex: [[ZEPRS]]
* Integration of drug stock management system

== Customizations ==
In addition to Zambia, SmartCare is also being used in Ethiopia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilahun |first1=Binyam |last2=Fritz |first2=Fleur |date=April 2015 |title=Comprehensive Evaluation of Electronic Medical Record System Use and User Satisfaction at Five Low-Resource Setting Hospitals in Ethiopia |journal=JMIR Medical Informatics |volume=3 |issue=2 |page=e22 |doi=10.2196/medinform.4106 |pmid=26007237 |pmc=4460264 |url=https://medinform.jmir.org/2015/2/e22/ }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{As of|2012|lc=yes|post=,}} it was only available for use by partner organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Millard |first1=Peter S. |last2=Bru |first2=Juan |last3=Berger |first3=Christopher A. |date=4 July 2012 |title=Open-source point-of-care electronic medical records for use in resource-limited settings: systematic review and questionnaire surveys |journal=BMJ Open |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=e000690 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000690 |pmc=3391372 |pmid=22763661 |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000690 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

; Ethiopia
: Electronic Health Record System called SmartCare-Ethiopia. {{As of|2007|12|post=,}} the system is being piloted in one of the hospitals.
; Zambian National Blood Transfusion Service
: Blood donor data collection and reporting system called the SmartDonor module. The system is being piloted at the national blood transfusion centre headquarters, {{as of|2009|1|lc=yes|post=,}} and plans to deploy to the nine provincial transfusion centres are underway.

'''Smart drinks''', also known as [[nootropic]] drinks, are beverages made from a mix of fruit juices,  [[vitamins]], herbal supplements, and a variety of [[amino acid]] supplements.

==History==
The consumption of smart drinks and "smart drugs" began in the early 1980s when [[baby boomers]] started using because they believed these products would improve [[job performance]] and give them a competitive edge in the workplace. The popularity of smart drinks peaked during the early 1990s, as all-night [[techno]] and [[house music]] parties took place, events of the underground dance culture at the time, known as "[[rave]]s." Rave enthusiasts preferred drugs such as [[MDMA|ecstasy]], [[methamphetamine]], [[ketamine]], or "[[poppers]]" to alcohol. Instead of drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]ic beverages at raves, the dancers would drink smart drinks. Smart drinks not only held a novelty factor for the vibrant social [[subculture]], but they also helped rave promoters by eliminating the need to secure alcohol sales permits and therefore allowed raves to be held outside of the traditional nightclub, bar or pub scene.

Smart drink ingredients often include substances such as [[DL-Phenylalanine|DL-phenylalanine]] or L-[[phenylalanine]], L-[[tyrosine]], [[choline]] (trimethylaminoethanol), [[pyroglutamic acid]], [[B vitamins]], [[glucuronolactone]], and [[DMAE]] (dimethylaminoethanol). These amino acids were claimed to have positive or enhanced effects on alertness, stress resistance and energy levels. Some of the acids, then considered "foods" and [[nutritional supplements]] by government agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), changed in status and have since been removed from store shelves. Others are still available  when  [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] by a doctor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">'''Smoking in Hungary''' is viewed as an important [[public health]] issue. Several studies have shown that smoking of [[tobacco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/tobacco/communications/events/wntd/2006/Report_v8_4May06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[narcotics]] (e.g. [[cannabis]]) have different negative impacts on the society. (Vide [[Health effects of tobacco]], [[Effects of cannabis]]) That is why this topic has come into discussion in different [[Politics of Hungary|political]], [[Economy of Hungary|economical]], [[Science and technology in Hungary|scientific]] and [[Health in Hungary|medical]] forums.

==Statistics==
According to the [[World Health Organization]] 28.2% of the population were regularly smokers out of people aged 15 or above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.sdg.3-a-viz?lang=en|title=GHO {{!}} World Health Statistics data visualizations dashboard {{!}} Tobacco smoking|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
It has been forbidden to smoke in 5 meter radius from the entrance of [[primary schools]], [[secondary schools]], [[universities]], [[dormitories]] and other higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A1600135.TV&amp;timeshift=fffffff4&amp;txtreferer=00000001.TXT|title=2016. évi CXXXV. törvény - a dohányzás visszaszorításával összefüggő egyes törvények módosításáról|last=Kft.|first=Wolters Kluwer|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is not allowed to smoke in [[public transport]], [[pubs]], [[bar]]s, [[restaurants]] and in [[national institutions]].

It is also forbidden for children under the age of 18 to buy [[cigarette]]s.

The sale of tobacco is limited to state-controlled (but privately owned) tobacco shops called ''Nemzeti Dohánybolt'' (''National Tobacco Shop'').

==Politics==
In 2013 the [[World Health Organization]] awarded Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] in "accomplishments in the area of tobacco control".

==Tobacco factories==
In Hungary several types of cigarettes can be found. The three big tobacco companies in Hungary have producing facilities in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7085">The '''Structured Clinical Interview for [[DSM-IV]]''' Axis I Disorders ('''SCID-I''') is a diagnostic exam used to determine [[DSM-IV]] [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Multi-axial system|Axis]] I disorders (major [[mental disorder]]s). The SCID-''II'' is a diagnostic exam used to determine Axis II disorders ([[personality disorder]]s). There are at least 700 published studies in which the SCID was the diagnostic instrument used. Major parts of the SCID have been translated into other languages, including [[Danish language|Danish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and  [[Zulu language|Zulu]].

An Axis I SCID assessment with a psychiatric patient usually takes between 1 and 2 hours, depending on the complexity of the subject's psychiatric history and their ability to clearly describe episodes of current and past symptoms. A SCID with a non-psychiatric patient takes 1/2 hour to 1-1/2 hours. (See editions below.) A '''SCID-II''' personality assessment takes about 1/2 to 1 hour.

The instrument was designed to be administered by a mental health professional, for example a [[psychologist]] or [[psychiatrist]]. This must be someone who has relevant professional training and has had experience performing unstructured, [[open-ended question]], diagnostic evaluations. However, for the purposes of some research studies, non-clinician research assistants, who have extensive experience with the study population in question, and who have demonstrated competence, have been trained to use the SCID. The less clinical experience and specific education the potential interviewer has had, the more training is required.

==DSM-IV editions of SCID-I and SCID-II==
There are several editions of the SCID-I addressed to different audiences:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scid4.org/info/refscid.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three Research Versions:
** Patient Edition (SCID-I/P)&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael First|First, Michael B.]], [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Spitzer, Robert L]], Gibbon Miriam, and Williams, Janet B.W.: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Patient Edition. (SCID-I/P) New York: Biometrics Research, New York State Psychiatric Institute, November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Patient Edition, with [[psychotic]] screen (SCID-I/P W/ PSY SCREEN)&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael First|First, Michael B.]], [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Spitzer, Robert L]], Gibbon Miriam, and Williams, Janet B.W.: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Patient Edition With Psychotic Screen (SCID-I/P W/ PSY SCREEN) New York: Biometrics Research, New York State Psychiatric Institute, November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Non-patient Edition (SCID-I/NP),&lt;ref&gt;First, Michael B., Spitzer, Robert L, Gibbon Miriam, and Williams, Janet B.W.: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Non-patient Edition.

New York: Biometrics Research, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clinician Version (SCID-CV)&lt;ref&gt;First, Michael B., Spitzer, Robert L, Gibbon Miriam, and Williams, Janet B.W.: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Clinician Version (SCID-CV). Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCID-II for DSM-IV comes in a single edition.&lt;ref&gt;First, MB., Gibbon M, Spitzer RL, Williams, JBW, Benjamin LS.: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders, (SCID-II). Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version of the SCID for DSM-5, intended for researchers, was released on 24 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=December 2014 |title=What's New? |website=Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders  |url=http://www.scid4.org/ |dead-url=no |archive-date=21 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021144533/http://www.scid4.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychiatric Association Publishing offers four versions the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5), and pricing varies according to intended use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) |website=American Psychiatric Association Publishing |url=https://www.appi.org/products/structured-clinical-interview-for-dsm-5-scid-5 |access-date=29 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM-III editions of SCID-I and SCID-II==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

The DSM-III SCID had one edition per axis: SCID-P/SCID-NP&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Robert L, Williams Janet BW, Gibbon Miriam, First Michael B, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Patient Edition/Non-patient Edition,(SCID-P/SCID-NP), Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and SCID-II.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Robert L, Williams Janet BW, Gibbon Miriam, First Michael B, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Axis II Disorders,(SCID-II), Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the SCID for DSM-III-R has been reported in several published studies. With regard to reliability, the range in reliability is enormous, depending on the type of the sample and research methodology (i.e., joint vs. test-retest, multi-site vs. single site with raters who have worked together, etc.)

==SCID-D==
The ''Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV'' [[Dissociative disorders]] (SCID-D)&lt;ref name="SCID-D"&gt;Steinberg M: [http://www.appi.org/set.cfm?id=8862 Interviewers Guide to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D)]. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; is widely used to diagnose [[dissociative disorders]], especially in research settings. This interview takes about 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on individual's experiences. The SCID-D has been translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and is used in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name = "pmid2006691"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boon S, Draijer N |title=Diagnosing dissociative disorders in The Netherlands: a pilot study with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Dissociative Disorders |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=148 |issue=4 |pages=458–62 |year=1991 |pmid=2006691 |doi=10.1176/ajp.148.4.458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Biggest Loser''''' is an American competition [[reality show]] that has run on [[NBC]] for 17 seasons, from 2004 to 2016. The show features [[Obesity|obese]] or overweight contestants competing to win a cash prize by losing the highest percentage of weight relative to their initial weight. The show has not been officially cancelled, but no new seasons have been announced.

''The Biggest Loser'' has been fairly popular for some of its run, ranking among the top 50 shows in the United States from 2004 to 2005 and again from 2009 to 2011. It has also attracted significant controversy, including both general critiques of its approach of rapid weight loss, and specific allegations that contestants have been malnourished, dehydrated, overexerted and, in some cases, been given weight loss pills, in order for them to lose as much weight as possible.

The ''Biggest Loser'' format has been highly popular around the world, spawning [[The Biggest Loser|over 30 international adaptations]], some of which remain on the air.

==Premise==
Each season of ''The Biggest Loser'' starts with a weigh-in to determine the contestants' starting weights, which serve as the baseline for determining the overall winner.

The contestants are grouped into teams of three, each wearing separate colored T-shirts. Depending on the season a team may work with a specific trainer or all trainers may work with all contestants.  The trainers are responsible (in conjunction with medical personnel retained by the show) for designing comprehensive workout and nutrition plans and teaching them to the contestants.  However, the contestants are individually responsible for implementing the principles taught.

During an episode, various challenges and temptations (see below) are featured. Those who win a particular challenge are given special privileges, such as a weight advantage for the next weigh-in or even full [[immunity (reality television)|immunity]] from being voted off the show.

Each week culminates in another weigh-in to determine which team has lost the most weight for that week, in percentage of total weight lost. The team that has lost the least percentage during that week (known as "falling below the yellow line", which refers to a line featured on a video screen showing the cutoff between safety and being at-risk) will have one member voted off (unless the team consists of only one remaining member, in which case there is no vote).  The vote is usually made by the other teams, though some episodes feature one team making the decision alone.  Some episodes feature a second, "red line"; if a contestant falls below the red line the contestant is automatically off the show with no vote.  Other episodes allow for the contestants, if successfully meeting a goal at the weigh-in, to all receive immunity for the week.

When the number of contestants has shrunk to a predetermined smaller number (unknown to the contestants), the teams are dissolved and the contestants compete one-on-one against each other.

The season finale features both the contestants remaining on the show and those sent home early; the latter are brought back for the final show.  Those sent home early compete for a smaller prize while those on the show compete for a larger prize and the title of "The Biggest Loser".

==Episode format==
Episodes are typically two hours long. Some episodes have been aired in a shortened one-hour format to accommodate adjacent network programming such as ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''&lt;ref name=zap2itshortened&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Robert|title=NBC's 'The Biggest Loser' Shortened and Moved for 'The Voice'|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/03/01/nbcs-the-biggest-loser-shortened-and-moved-for-the-voice/84126/|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2It|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[State of the Union address]].&lt;ref name=HuffpostOneHourSotU&gt;{{cite news|title=The Biggest Loser: Dolvett Can't Take The Attitude, Kicks One Contestant Out Of The Gym (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/25/the-biggest-loser-dolvett-kicks-one-out-of-gym-video_n_1230283.html|work=[[HuffPost TV]]|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=February 20, 2012|first=Jason|last=Hughes|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode features some, but not all, of the following activities (some contestants may not participate in an activity with physical requirements if placed on medical restrictions):

# '''Temptation''':&lt;br /&gt;Contestants prepare for the first day of the week only to find a situation that involves temptation. The temptation usually requires contestants to gamble by eating or drinking delicious but high-calorie foods in exchange for what may seem to be a beneficial trade-off. The benefits may or may not be known to the contestants in advance. Examples include eating sweet foods for a chance to call their loved ones, eating a big slice of cake to win an unknown prize (which, in one episode, turned out to be an exercise bike) or giving up time with a trainer for a chance to win money. Contestants are given a set period of time before the offer passes.
# '''Reward Challenge''':&lt;br /&gt;Contestants compete to win a prize, first as teams and then as individuals after the teams are dissolved. After the challenge, viewers are shown the winning team enjoying their reward while the losing team accepts their loss. Prizes range from [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]]- which is exemption from elimination—to [[exercise equipment]], phone calls home or weight prizes, which allow winners of a challenge to have a greater weight loss at the Weigh-In, or losers of a challenge to have a lower weight loss at the Weigh-In (e.g. a 6&amp;nbsp;lb weight loss would result in a 7&amp;nbsp;lb weight loss if a contestant were to win a "1 pound advantage" whereas it would result in a 5&amp;nbsp;lb weight loss if a contestant were to win a "1 pound disadvantage"). If there is an unequal number of players on each team, then the team(s) with more players must pick an individual or individuals who will sit out until there is an equal number of players on each team. Occasionally, players have to be cleared by the show's doctors in order to participate in physical challenges.
# '''Initial Workout''':&lt;br /&gt;Contestants work out with the trainers. During this segment, the trainers will often speak with certain contestants, especially those who are doing poorly. Usually, underlying emotional issues are revealed at this time (such as a loss of a family member or a physical calamity), often the triggering events that led to the weight gain in the first place.
# '''Last Chance Workout''':&lt;br /&gt;Last chance workouts are often shown as grueling, final preparations for the weigh in. This is a real test of strength and trainers push contestants to their limits.
# '''Last Chance Challenge''':&lt;br /&gt;Introduced in season seventeen, the last chance challenge is a variant between a reward challenge and a last chance workout. As with the last chance workout, the last chance challenge will usually take place inside the gym. The winning team will win a prize that benefits the team just before the upcoming weigh-in (for example, a two-pound weight advantage for the team).
# '''Weigh-In''':&lt;br /&gt;Although the show depicts the weigh-in in an evening setting, the actual weight measurement occurs off-camera in a morning session and the contestants are not told of the results at that time. All contestants are weighed to determine the amount they have lost relative to their total body weight. During team-based competition, the team that loses the highest percentage wins and the losing team must send one person home. When the teams are dissolved and the show becomes an individual competition, the two contestants who lose the lowest percentage of weight are below the yellow line and eligible for elimination. A similar setup to individual-based weigh-ins happens when the two initial teams are broken up into four teams of two or three, as happened in the second and fourth seasons. In season ten, the rules changed. The contestants are now expected to weigh in before challenges. The yellow line now increases up to half of the slots depending on how many contestants there are at the ranch. Contestants below the yellow line face an elimination challenge before the vote. In addition, the Biggest Loser of the week is allowed to save a person below the yellow line from elimination. Some episodes have featured both a yellow line and a red line; a contestant who falls below the red line is eliminated outright from the competition without a vote of the other contestants.
# '''Elimination Challenge''':&lt;br /&gt;Introduced in season nine, the elimination challenge was for the two people below the yellow line. In the only elimination challenge of that season, the longest one standing stayed while the other went home. In season ten, the elimination challenge was re-introduced. Those below the yellow line participate in a challenge to escape from the vote. The two least successful contestants face the vote.
# '''The Vote''':&lt;br /&gt;The final segment of the show takes place in a dining room that has refrigerators labeled with each contestant's name (active contestants have their name illuminated) and filled with that contestant's favorite tempting foods. Prior to the vote, contestants facing elimination plead their case as to why they should remain on the Ranch (several episodes feature contestants making a "sacrificial" request to be sent home, generally a team agreeing as to which member should stay and which one should go, or one contestant feeling that they can make progress at home while another needs the Ranch setting to continue his/her progress). The other contestants are not required to honor any requests to be sent home, though generally such requests are honored. The contestants facing elimination arrive at the dining room first; the other contestants each carry a covered plate containing the name of the person they wish to vote out. In the event of a tie, the contestant or team who lost the least percentage of weight is eliminated, except if both of the contestants or teams lost the least percentage of weight. As people are voted out, the light for their name is extinguished.  After the vote, the eliminated contestant is shown at home and discusses the progress they made in their weight loss.

==Weight loss regimen: risks and criticism==
{{quotebox|quote="I’m waiting for the first person to have a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].  I have had some patients who want to [follow the show's regimen], and I counsel them against it. I think the show is so exploitative.

{{quotebox|quote="Simply put, the Biggest Loser provides viewers with a completely inaccurate picture of what you must do to lose weight and live healthy.

{{quotebox|quote="Risks aside, weight-loss experts say that the biggest problem with the Biggest Loser is that extreme methods of dropping pounds are less likely to work in the long run.

According to LiveScience.com, "physicians and nutritionists worry the show's focus on competitive weight loss is, at best, counterproductive and, at worst, dangerous".&lt;ref name="livescience1"/&gt; Contestants on the show lose upwards of 10 pounds per week (in the very first week, some contestants have lost 20–30+ pounds in that one week alone), whereas the established medical guidelines for safe weight loss are between 1 and 2 pounds per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001940.htm |title=Tips for losing weight: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true even though that weight-loss rate originates from an examination of the database from the [[National Weight Control Registry]], where members have lost a minimum of 30 pounds and maintained that weight loss for a minimum of a year. So while researchers did find a correlation between that rate, on average, with members of the Registry, all this correlation can mean—if there is any causal correlation at all (there is no control group) -- is that it is more likely, on average, for someone to be successful at losing a large amount of weight, and more successful at maintaining that weight loss. There is no way of stating whether this rate is more ''healthy'' than any other rate, simply because (a) there is no comparison with any other rate, and not even any comparison between disease or mortality rates of members of this Registry and any other random group.

Other health writers take it even further, suggesting that everything from the shows dietary guidelines to workout routines are completely flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undeferredliving.com/the-biggest-loser/ |title=The Biggest Loser: Making Weight-Loss an Unreachable Goal for Millions |publisher=Undeferredliving |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutritionist Dr. [[Barry Sears]] sums up the wellness paradox: "First, eating less can cause stress to the system causing more hunger. Second, the more people exercise, the hungrier they become." Dr. Sears continues by claiming that "even with the most intense training, people are unlikely to add more than five pounds of muscle in 12 weeks of weight training. The reason viewers see their muscles emerging as the show goes on is because as the layer of fat surrounding the muscles is lost, muscles become more visible. Those muscles were always there but covered by a mass of fat tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonediet.com/blog/gaining-it-back-the-science-behind-the-biggest-losers-failure |title=Gaining it Back: The Science behind The Biggest Loser’s Failure |publisher=ZoneDiet|date=2016-05-10 |accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weight-loss regimen used in the show—severe caloric restriction combined with up to six hours a day of strenuous exercise—involves risks including a weakening of the [[heart]] muscle, [[irregular heartbeat]] and dangerous reductions in potassium and [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt09"&gt;{{cite web| title= On ‘The Biggest Loser,’ Health Can Take Back Seat | url= http://www.gainesville.com/article/20091125/ZNYT01/911253011/1109/SPORTS?Title=On-x2018-The-Biggest-Loser-x2019-Health-Can-Take-Back-Seat | work=The New York Times| publisher=via [[The Gainesville Sun]] | date=November 25, 2009| accessdate=November 26, 2009| author=Edward Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contestants, regardless of their weight, are required to certify that they believe they are "in excellent physical, emotional, psychological and mental health".&lt;ref name="nyt09"/&gt;

''[[The Biggest Loser: Second Chances]]'' included a one-mile foot race in its first week, an event that led to the hospitalization of two of its contestants; Rob Huizenga, the show's medical consultant, when asked about the foot race said that "If we had it to do over, we wouldn’t [have done] it" and noted that in response, the show's producers have "changed a lot of the way [they] do things" (including the close monitoring of contestants’ [[body temperature]]s during exercise).&lt;ref name="nyt09"/&gt;

One attempt to create a more healthy environment after Season 8's dangerous foot race was to include an [https://www.endlesspools.com Endless Pool] for low-impact cardio. This helped contestants to lose weight in a healthier and safer way than some previous exercise routines on earlier seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.endlesspools.com/tv-film.php |title=The Endless Pool is ready for its close-up! |publisher=endlesspools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the show is a contest that involves eliminations from it, some contestants are encouraged to take risks that endanger their health.  Ryan C. Benson, the winner of the [[The Biggest Loser (season 1)|program’s first season]], publicly admitted that "he dropped some of the weight by fasting and dehydrating himself to the point that he was urinating blood". Also since the show Benson has regained all of his weight, but 10–12&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="nyt09"/&gt;  In 2009, [[Kai Hibbard]] (runner-up from the [[The Biggest Loser (season 3)|third season]]) told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "she and other contestants would drink as little water as possible in the 24 hours before a weigh-in" and would "work out in as much clothing as possible" when the cameras were off. She further stated that two weeks after the show ended, she had regained about 31 pounds, mostly from staying hydrated.&lt;ref name="nyt09"/&gt; In a June 2010 interview, Hibbard said, "I do still struggle [with disordered eating]. I do. My husband says I’m still afraid of food... I’m still pretty messed up from the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bigger Loser Finalist Says Show Gave Her An Eating Disorder |first=Golda |last=Poretsky, H.H.C. |date=June 16, 2010 |url=http://jezebel.com/5564997/bigger-loser-finalist-says-show-gave-her-an-eating-disorder |publisher=Jezebel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2011 press conference with the [[Television Critics Association]], comedian and actor [[Jerry Lewis]] was critical of the competitive nature of ''The Biggest Loser'', claiming that the show is about contestants "knocking their brains out trying to see how we beat the fat lady at 375 pounds, and in four months she's going to be 240. Who cares? It's ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'': "[http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/jerry-lewis-ousted-as-mda-telethon-host/1184371 Jerry Lewis out as telethon host]", page 1A, August 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by ''The New York Post'', California authorities inquired the show due to allegations of doping contestants.

===Longitudinal study===
In 2016, the results of a long term study by the US [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH) were released that documented the weight gain and loss of contestants in Season 8, which aired in 2009.&lt;ref name=NIHStudy&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kolmata|first1=Gina|title=After ‘The Biggest Loser,’ Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/health/biggest-loser-weight-loss.html?WT.mc_ev=click&amp;WT.mc_id=NYT-E-I-NYT-E-AT-050516-L2&amp;amp=&amp;amp=&amp;em_pos=medium&amp;emc=edit_el_20160505&amp;nl=el&amp;nl=at-times&amp;nl_art=0&amp;nlid=16129359&amp;ref=headline&amp;te=1|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that most of the 16 contestants regained their weight, and in some case gained more than before they entered the contest. Their metabolisms had slowed to the point where they were burning hundreds of calories a day less than other people of their new, reduced, size. The ''New York Times'' reported: "What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants’ metabolisms did not recover... It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight." The article quoted Dr. Michael Rosenbaum who said, "The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower."

After the study results were revealed, former contestants demanded NBC cancel the show.&lt;ref name=NIHStudy/&gt;

|1|| ''[[The Biggest Loser (season 1)]]'' || October 19, 2004 || December 14, 2004 || Two teams of six || Ryan Benson || David Fioravanti || Featured 12 contestants divided into two teams, the Red team and the Blue team. The Red Team was coached by trainer Jillian Michaels, while The Blue Team was coached by trainer Bob Harper. The eventual winner of the $250,000 grand prize was Ryan, with a total weight loss of 122 pounds (37%).

|2|| ''[[The Biggest Loser (season 2)]]'' || September 13, 2005 || November 29, 2005 || Two teams of seven divided by gender || Matt Hoover || Pete Thomas || Featured fourteen contestants divided into two teams based on gender. Season two introduced the change that weigh-ins would be won or lost based on the percentage of total weight lost, rather than on the number of pounds lost. This change was made to create a more even playing field among contestants of varying weights. Matt was the eventual winner.

|4|| ''[[The Biggest Loser (season 4)]]'' || September 11, 2007 || December 18, 2007 || Three teams of six || Bill Germanakos || Jim Germanakos || In February 2007, it was announced that [[Caroline Rhea]] was leaving the show, to be replaced by ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' actress [[Alison Sweeney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etonline.com/tv/news/2007/02/44135/|title= Alison Sweeney Joins 'Biggest Loser'}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that there would be three teams (named for the color each team member would wear: blue, red, or black), with Bob Harper, Jillian Michaels and Kim Lyons returning as personal trainers. One of the contestants for this season was Amber Walker, a paramedic from Pasadena, Texas, who won a viewer vote among potential candidates on the April 23, 2007, edition of NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/18233299/|title= Did you choose the 'The Biggest Loser'?}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the other three choices (Jez Luckett, Lezlye Donahue, and David Griffin) were eventually chosen as contestants as well. The winners were each twins: Jim, a contestant who had been voted off won the prize for the eliminated contestants. Bill won the grand prize of $250,000 and was pronounced The Biggest Loser by Sweeney.

His total percentage of weight loss was 50.19%. "At home" winner Koli Palu went on to win the $100,000 prize.  Palu, who spent the full season on the show, was eliminated in the finale, but he lost a larger percentage than Michael Ventrella and would have won the overall prize had he been selected by the viewers to move on instead of Daris George.

|13|| ''[[The Biggest Loser (season 13)|The Biggest Loser: No Excuses]]'' || January 3, 2012 || May 1, 2012 || Ten teams of two || Jeremy Britt || Mike Messina || In a theme of "No Excuses", each week is centered on a different excuse related to weight loss and obesity and how to tackle those excuses. For the first time teams will be competing against their partner in challenges, workouts and elimination. Dolvett Quince returns for his second season. Season 13 begins with a smaller cast than the previous seasons with the heaviest contestant weighing in at 403 pounds. Social media called this season the most hated and spoiled cast in the history of the show. Perhaps the most notable moment of the season is the cast revolt and walkout that took place over the possibility of old contestants coming back at top 5.

Season 17 also marks the return of couples for the first time since season 13 with Dolvett and Jennifer training four couples each on their Red and Black teams respectively.

==Spin-offs==
{{Main|The Biggest Loser: Special Edition}}
A spin-off of ''The Biggest Loser'', ''The Biggest Loser: Special Edition'' features a team of people competing against another team, with each competition airing in two one-hour episodes. They spend 11 days on the ranch working with Bob and Jillian and then return home to continue to lose weight. The announced groups included "family vs. family", where two families with restaurants of different cultures competed to lose weight, "engaged couple vs. engaged couple", and "Marines vs. Navy". Each episode featured one of the mini-competitions from start to finish.

===''Losing It with Jillian''===
''Losing It with Jillian'' was a reality program that debuted on [[NBC]] on June 1, 2010. The spin-off involved former Biggest Loser trainer [[Jillian Michaels]] helping families lose weight in one week. The series was cancelled after 7 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/03/21/development-update-monday-march-21-137422/9188/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Monday, March 21 - TheFutonCritic.com|work=thefutoncritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Finsbury moorfields eye hospital 1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust|Moorfields Eye Hospital]]]]
In July 2007 the then Health Minister Lord Darzi recommended the establishment of a number of academic health science centres in the UK.&lt;ref name=natbio1&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Nuala Moran | year = 2008 | month = | title = London forges £2 billion research cluster | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages =1056 | id = | doi = 10.1038/nbt1008-1056 | url = http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n10/full/nbt1008-1056.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust (now Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust), UCL and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust announced their intention to form UCLPartners in August 2008.&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt;&lt;ref name=natbio1/&gt; In February 2009 Professor [[Sir Cyril Chantler]] was appointed as the first Chair of UCLPartners and it was officially designated as one of the UK’s first academic health science centres by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|UK Department of Health]] in March 2009.&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt;

Key strategic appointments were made in summer 2009, including Professor David Fish as Managing Director and seven Programme Directors. An alliance between UCL, UCLPartners, [[Yale University]] and [[Yale-New Haven Hospital]] was announced in October 2009.&lt;ref name=yaleucl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uclpartners.com/yale-ucl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912051825/http://www.uclpartners.com/yale-ucl|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 September 2010|title=Yale-UCL Collaboration|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=UCLPartners|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCLPartners academic strategy and key research priorities were agreed in November 2009.&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt; In October 2011 it was announced that [[Barts and The London NHS Trust]] and [[Queen Mary, University of London]] had agreed to join UCLPartners, making it the largest academic health science centre in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.hsj.co.uk/5036604.article|title=UCLPartners to become 'biggest AHSC in the world'|accessdate=30 October 2011|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=17 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225347/http://m.hsj.co.uk/5036604.article|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust]] agreed to join UCLPartners in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/acute-trusts/barking-havering-and-redbridge-university-hospitals-nhs-trust/london-acute-joins-ucl-partners-academic-health-science-centre/5043842.article|title=London acute joins UCLPartners academic health science centre|accessdate=18 May 2012|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 UCLPartners was officially designated as one of 15 [[Academic Health Science Networks]] established by the NHS in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS England OKs 15 Academic Health Science Networks|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/13-05-23/NHS_England_OKs_15_Academic_Health_Science_Networks.aspx|website=www.pharmatimes.com|publisher=PharmaTimes|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 UCLPartners established [[MedCity (London)|MedCity]], an initiative to develop the life sciences cluster in London and the wider "golden triangle", in partnership with the [[Mayor of London]], [[King's Health Partners]], [[Imperial College Academic Health Science Centre]] and the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/10746343/London-to-complete-golden-triangle-of-UK-bioscience.html|title=London to complete 'golden triangle' of UK bioscience|accessdate=7 October 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2014/apr/29/medcity-learn-techcity-london-oxford-cambridge|title=What MedCity can learn from TechCity|accessdate=7 October 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">'''Water supply terrorism''' involves intentional sabotage to a [[water supply]] system, through [[chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[biological warfare]] or infrastructural sabotage. Throughout [[military history]] and the [[history of terrorism]], water supply 
attacks have been perpetrated by [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]]{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and [[water politics|political groups]], intending to scare, cause death, or [[drought]].

==Chemical and biological attacks==

===History===
In 1984 members of the [[Rajneeshee]] religious cult contaminate a city water supply tank in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], using [[Salmonella]] and infecting 750.&lt;ref name="pacinst"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 The [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) put lethal concentrations of [[potassium cyanide]] in the water tanks of a Turkish Air Force compound in [[Istanbul]].

In 2000, workers at the Cellatex chemical plant in northern France dumped 5000 liters of [[sulfuric acid]] into a tributary of the [[Meuse River]] when they were denied workers’ benefits.&lt;ref name="pacinst"/&gt;

In 2000 in [[Queensland, Australia]], police arrested a man for using a computer and radio transmitter to take control of the [[Maroochy Shire]] wastewater system and release sewage into parks, rivers and property.

===LSD threats to the water supply===
Despite the fact that it is impractical and very unlikely to produce any effect at large scale, during the 1960s a great deal of attention was paid to the notion that [[counter-culture]] figures could intoxicate a whole city by putting a small dose of [[LSD]] in the water supply.

On 19 March 1966 ''[[London Life]]'' ran an interview claiming that anyone could take control of London in under eight hours by putting 'acid' in the water system. Dr [[Donald Johnson]] claimed: “It is quite feasible that LSD could be used to take over a city or even a country. I agree if it were put into reservoirs, it would disable people sufficiently for an enemy to take control.” 
&lt;ref name="fortean"&gt;

|accessdate=2013-03-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1966 ''[[Vue magazine]]'' ran '''“Why They Had to Outlaw LSD”''', in which writer [[WH Carr]] claimed that “[A] few ounces of it, dumped in the water supply of a major city, could shake up millions.” &lt;ref name="fortean"/&gt;

Counter-culture icon [[Abbie Hoffman]] threatened to put LSD in Chicago's water-supply to protest the [[Vietnam War]] during the Democratic convention.&lt;ref&gt;

==Infrastructural or resource-based attacks==

===History===
In [[Lusaka]], Zambia, in 1999, a bomb destroyed the main water pipeline, cutting off water for the city 3 million.

In 2001 Water flow to [[Kumanovo]] (population 100,000) was cut off for 12 days in conflict between ethnic Albanians and Macedonian forces.&lt;ref name="pacinst"/&gt;

The [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) detonated a bomb inside a tunnel in the [[Chingaza Dam]], which provides most of Bogotá’s water.&lt;ref name="pacinst"/&gt;

Four incendiary devices were found in the pumping station of a Michigan water-bottling plant. The [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) claimed responsibility, accusing [[Ice Mountain Water]] Company of stealing water for profit.

In 2003 Jordanian authorities arrested Iraqi agents in connection with a failed plot to poison the water supply that serves American troops in the eastern Jordanian desert near the border with Iraq.

In 2006 [[Tamil Tiger]] rebels cut the water supply to government-held villages in northeastern [[Sri Lanka]]. Sri Lankan government forces then launched attacks on the reservoir, declaring the Tamil actions to be terrorism.

===Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes===
The draining of the [[Mesopotamian Marshes]] occurred in [[Iraq]] and to a smaller degree in [[Iran]] between the 1950s and 1990s to clear large areas of the [[marshes]] in the [[Tigris-Euphrates river system]]. Formerly covering an area of around {{Convert|20000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, the main sub-marshes, the [[Hawizeh Marshes|Hawizeh]], [[Central Marshes|Central]], and [[Hammar Marshes]] were all drained at different times for different reasons. Initial draining of the Central Marshes was intended to reclaim land for agriculture but later all three marshes became a tool of war and revenge.

Many international organizations such as the [[U.N. Human Rights Commission]], the [[Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq]] (SCIRI), the [[International Wildfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau]], and [[Middle East Watch]] have described the draining as a political attempt to force the [[Ma'dan people]] out of the area through water diversion tactics.&lt;ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

* [[Kurt Vonnegut]]’s book ''[[Cat’s Cradle]]'' (1963) describes a fictional chemical that freezes water at room temperature and ends up destroying the world.
*[[Edward Abbey]]’s (1975) novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' featured blowing up dams, poisoning water supplies and attacking resources.
*The film ''[[The Tuxedo]]'', starring [[Jackie Chan]], features a power-hungry bottled-water mogul trying to destroy the world’s natural water supply to force everyone to drink his bottled water.
*The film ''[[Batman Begins]]'' portrays a terrorist's attempt to introduce a vapor-borne hallucinogen into the water system.
*The film ''[[Waterborne (film)|Waterborne]]'' is set in the aftermath of a bio-terrorist attack on the water supply of Los Angeles.
*The film ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' (2006) features corrupt government leaders contaminating London’s water supply.

'''Water testing''' is a broad description for various procedures used to analyze [[water quality]]. Millions of water quality tests are carried out daily to fulfill regulatory requirements and to maintain safety.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water testing – pass or fail?|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/10/6/market-insight/water-testing-pass-or-fail.html|publisher=Global Water Intelligence|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing may be performed to evaluate:
* '''ambient or environmental water quality''' – the ability of a [[surface water]] body to support aquatic life as an [[ecosystem]]. ''See'' [[Environmental monitoring]], [[Freshwater environmental quality parameters]] and [[Bioindicator]].
* '''[[wastewater]]''' – characteristics of [[water pollution|polluted water]] (domestic [[sewage]] or [[industrial waste]]) before treatment or after treatment. ''See'' [[Environmental chemistry]] and [[Wastewater quality indicators]].
* '''"[[raw water]]" quality''' – characteristics of a water source prior to treatment for domestic consumption ([[drinking water]]). ''See'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]] and specific tests such as [[turbidity]] and [[hard water]].
* '''"finished" water quality''' – water treated at a municipal [[water purification]] plant. ''See'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]] and [[:Category:Water quality indicators]].
* suitability of water for '''industrial uses''' such as laboratory, manufacturing or [[Water cooling#Industrial usage|equipment cooling]]. ''See'' [[purified water]].

==Government regulation==
Government regulations related to water testing and water quality for some major countries is given below.

===China===

====Ministry of Environmental Protection====
The Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China is the nation's environmental protection department charged with the task of protecting China's air, water, and land from pollution and contamination. Directly under the State Council, it is empowered and required by law to implement environmental policies and enforce environmental laws and regulations. Complementing its regulatory role, it funds and organizes research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEP Mission|url=http://english.mep.gov.cn/About_SEPA/Mission/200803/t20080318_119444.htm|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China]].

====Regulatory challenges and debates====
In late 2009, a survey was carried out by China Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development to assess the water quality of urban supplies in China's cities, which revealed that "at least 1,000" water treatment plants out of more than 4,000 plants surveyed at the county level and above failed to comply with government requirements. The survey results were never formally released to the public, but in 2012, China's Century Weekly published the leaked survey data. In response, Wang Xuening, a health ministry official, released figures derived from a pilot monitoring scheme in 2011 and suggested that 80% of China's urban tap water was up to standard.

China's new drinking water standards involve 106 indicators. Of China's 35 major cities, only 40% of cities have the capacity to test for all 106 indicators. The department in charge of local water and the health administration department will enter into a discussion to determine results for more than 60 of the new measures; hence it is not required to test the water using every indicator. The grading of water quality is based on an overall average of 95% to fulfill government requirements. The frequency of water quality inspections at water treatment plants is twice yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gong|first=Jing|title=What's coming out of China's taps?|url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4962-What-s-coming-out-of-China-s-taps-|publisher=China Dialogue|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet department of the United States federal government, created in response to the September 11 attacks, and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the United States of America and U.S. territories (including protectorates) from and responding to terrorist attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. ''See'' [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 designates the Environmental Protection Agency as the sector-specific agency for the water sector's critical infrastructure protection activities.  All Environmental Protection Agency activities related to water security are carried out in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security. Possible threats to water quality include contamination with deadly agents, such as cyanide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Testing and Treatment Reflect the Times|url=http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2004/05/water-testing-and-treatment-reflect-times|publisher=R&amp;D Magazine|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physical attacks like the release of toxic gaseous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Sector: Critical Infrastructure|url=https://www.dhs.gov/water-sector|publisher=US DHS|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316071920/http://www.dhs.gov/water-sector|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental Protection Agency====
The principal U.S. federal laws governing water testing are the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and the [[Clean Water Act]]. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issues regulations under each law specifying analytical test methods. EPA' s annual ''Regulatory Agenda'' sets a schedule for specific objectives on improving its oversight of water testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulatory Agendas and Regulatory Plans |url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/regulatory-agendas-and-regulatory-plans |date=2017-05-31 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Drinking water analysis
Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, [[public water system]]s are required to regularly monitor their treated water for contaminants. Water samples must be analyzed using EPA-approved testing methods, by laboratories that are certified by EPA or a state agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/dwanalyticalmethods/learn-about-drinking-water-analytical-methods |title=Learn about Drinking Water Analytical Methods |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-10-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/dwlabcert/learn-about-laboratory-certification-drinking-water |title=Learn About Laboratory Certification for Drinking Water |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-10-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 revised total coliform rule and the 1989 total coliform rule are the only microbial drinking water regulations that apply to all public water systems. The revised rule highlights the frequency and timing of microbial testing by water systems based on population served, system type, and source water type. It also places a legal limit on the level for ''[[Escherichia coli]].'' Potential health threats must be disclosed to EPA or the appropriate state agency, and public notification is required in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revised Total Coliform  And Total Coliform Rule |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/revised-total-coliform-rule-and-total-coliform-rule |date=2017-02-24 |website=Drinking Water Requirements for States and Public Water Systems |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for measuring acute toxicity usually take between 24 and 96 hours to identify contaminants in water supplies.&lt;ref name="Performance Verification Testing"&gt;{{cite web |title=Performance Verification Testing |url=http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/watersecurity/upload/2004_04_01_watersecurity_fs_security_rapid-tox.pdf |publisher=EPA |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Wastewater analysis
All facilities in the United States that discharge wastewater to surface waters (e.g. rivers, lakes or coastal waters} must obtain a permit under the [[Clean Water Act#NPDES permits for point sources|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]], a Clean Water Act program administered by EPA and state agencies. The facilities covered include sewage treatment plants, industrial and commercial plants, military bases and other facilities. Most permittees are required to regularly collect wastewater samples and analyze them for compliance with permit requirements, and report the results either to EPA or the state agency.&lt;ref name="NPDES basics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-07-24 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regulatory challenges and debates====

=====Hydraulic fracturing=====
The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] created a loophole that exempts companies drilling for natural gas from disclosing the chemicals involved in fracturing operations that would normally be required under federal clean water laws. The loophole is commonly known as the "Halliburton loophole" because Dick Cheney, the former chief executive officer of Halliburton, was reportedly instrumental in its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dorner |first=Joshua |title=Cheney's Culture of Deregulation and Corruption |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/06/cheney_deregulation.html |publisher=Center for American Progress |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Safe Drinking Water Act excludes [[hydraulic fracturing]] from the Underground Injection Control regulation in section 1421 (d)(1), the use of diesel fuel during hydraulic fracturing is still regulated. In addition, there may be additional regulations for hydraulic fracturing by state oil and gas agencies. States or EPA have the authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate discharge of produced waters from hydraulic fracturing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Under the Safe Drinking Water Act |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/uic/class2/hydraulicfracturing/wells_hydroreg.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, federal environment officials scientifically linked underground water pollution with hydraulic fracturing for the first time in central Wyoming. EPA stated that the water supply contained at least 10 compounds known to be used in fracking fluids. The findings in the report contradicted arguments by the drilling industry on the safety of the fracturing process, such as the hydrologic pressure that naturally forces fluids downwards instead of upwards. EPA also commented that the pollution from 33 abandoned oil and gas waste pits were responsible for some degree of minor [[groundwater pollution]] in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lustgarten |first=Abrahm |title=Feds Link Water Contamination to Fracking for the First Time |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/feds-link-water-contamination-to-fracking-for-first-time |publisher=Pro Publica |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which is responsible for overseeing oil and gas production in Alaska, proposed new rules for regulating hydraulic fracturing in the state, which contains over two billion barrels of shale oil (second only to the Bakkan) and over 80 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Companies will be required to conduct water testing at least 90 days prior to and up to 120 days after hydraulically fracturing a well, which includes analysis of pH, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, and total petroleum hydrocarbons. The proposed rules necessitate disclosure of the identity and volume of chemicals used in fracturing fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=D'Angelo |first=Wayne J. |title=Hydraulic fracturing: State Regulatory Roundup Vol. 14 |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4023f7ca-2992-47a2-b644-b17805bffed5 |publisher=Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission]].

In February 2013, the state of Illinois introduced the Illinois Hydraulic Fracturing Regulatory Act, H.B. 2615, which imposes strict controls on fracturing companies, such as chemical disclosure requirements and water testing requirements. The bill includes baseline and periodic post-frack testing of potentially affected waters, such as surface water and groundwater sources near fracturing wells, to identify contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing wells will be closed if fracturing fluid is released outside of the shale rock formation being fractured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HB2615|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09800HB2615lv&amp;SessionID=85&amp;GA=98&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;DocNum=2615&amp;print=true|publisher=Illinois General Assembly|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pharmaceuticals and personal care products=====
Detectable levels of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the parts per trillion, are found in many public drinking water systems in the US as many water treatment plants lack the technological know-how to remove these chemical compounds from raw water. There are now increasing worries about how these compounds degrade and react in the environment, during the treatment process, inside our bodies, and the long-term exposure to multiple contaminants at low levels. Out of over 80,000 chemicals registered with the EPA, the US federal drinking water rules mandate testing for only 83 chemicals, which calls for increased monitoring of pharmaceuticals on the presence and concentrations of chemical compounds in rivers, streams, and treated tap water. As traditional waste water regulations and treatment systems target microorganisms and nutrients, there are no federal standards for pharmaceuticals in drinking water or waste water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNabb|first=John|title=Testimony to Oversight Hearing|url=http://www.cleanwateraction.org/files/publications/ma/testimony-drugsinwater-mcnabb.pdf|publisher=Clean Water Action|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent developments====
In May 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency released a new list of contaminants, known as the unregulated contaminant monitoring regulation 3 (UCMR3), that will be part of municipal water systems testing starting this year and continuing through 2015. The UCMR3 testing will help municipal water system operators measure the occurrence and exposure of contamination levels that may endanger human health. The State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa is the only state environmental public health laboratory that has been certified and approved to test for all 28 chemical contaminants on the new list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Pat|title=What's in your water?|url=http://now.uiowa.edu/2013/03/whats-your-water|publisher=Iowa Now|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency developed a new rapid water quality test that provides accurate same day results of contamination levels, which marks a significant improvement from current tests that require at least 24 hours to obtain results. The new test will help authorities determine whether beaches are safe for swimming to keep the public from falling sick and could help prevent beaches from being closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Water Testing Could Prevent Beach Closures|url=http://eponline.com/articles/2013/03/20/new-water-testing-could-prevent-beach-closures.aspx|publisher=Environmental Protection|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The International Maritime Organization, known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization until 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IMO|url=http://www.imo.org/|publisher=IMO|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in Geneva in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Michael L|title=Ship Organization Nears Final Form; U.N.

''See'' [[International Maritime Organization]].

The International Maritime Organization has been at the forefront of the international community by taking the lead in addressing the transfer of aquatic invasive species through shipping. On 13 February 2004, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments was adopted by consensus at a diplomatic conference held at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. According to the convention, all ships are required to implement a ballast water and sediments management plan. All ships will have to carry a Ballast Water Record Book and will be required to carry out ballast water management procedures to a given standard. Parties to the Convention are given the option to take additional measures which are subject to criteria set out in the Convention and to International Maritime Organization guidelines. Ballast water management is subjected to the ballast water exchange standard and the ballast water performance standard. Ships performing ballast water exchange shall do so with an efficiency of 95 per cent volumetric exchange of ballast water and ships using a ballast water management system (BWMS) shall meet a performance standard based on agreed numbers of organisms per unit of volume. The Convention will enter into force 12 months after ratification by 30 States, representing 35 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballast Water Management|url=http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/ballastwatermanagement/Pages/Default.aspx|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Ballast water discharge and the environment]].

==="Razor and Razor-blade" business model===
The water test market is approximately two-thirds equipment and one-third consumables. Reagents are used with each test and generate [[recurring revenue]] for companies. Aftermarket maintenance agreements, operator training and parts replacement help to ensure resources are maximized.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt; The market leader with an estimated 21% market share, Danaher, is able to reap EBIT{{clarify|what does EBIT mean?|date=November 2017}} margins in the high-teens-to-low-20% on test equipment, but can command 40%+ margins on the water test reagents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geraghty|first=Michael|title=Global Themes Strategy|url=http://fa.smithbarney.com/public/projectfiles/f8e732d5-6162-4cd9-8b1d-7b7317360163.pdf|publisher=Citi|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Freebie marketing]].

===Distribution===
Companies tend to employ the "direct-to-end-user" model for most products, but may also try to sell low-end equipment via the Internet to reduce distribution costs.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

===Pricing===
Pricing depends on application and type of product. Instruments range from as low as $10 to thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

===Suppliers===
The low-end test equipment is dominated by few large suppliers, notably Germany's Loviband and Merck, DelAgua Water Testing of the UK who work globally, and US-based LaMotte. Major manufacturers of in-line equipment include Siemens and Danaher's Hach. Thermo Scientific and Waters are key producers of high-end test equipment.&lt;ref name="Something in the water"/&gt;

===End markets===
The end markets include municipal water plants, industrial users, such as beverage and electronics, and environmental agencies, such as the United States Geological Survey.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

==Water testing facilities==
There are two main types of laboratories: commercial and in-house.

===In-house laboratories===
In-house laboratories are usually present in municipal water and waste water facilities, breweries and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. They account for roughly half of all tests run annually.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

===Commercial laboratories===
Most of the commercial laboratories are single-site firms that only service institutions in the geographical region. The employee head count for each laboratory is usually fewer than five people, and revenues are under $1 million. These laboratories account for one quarter of all tests. There are several major laboratory groups, such as UK-based Inspicio and Australia-based ALS, which account for another quarter of all tests.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

==Privatization==

===Opinion===
The conventional impression is that private water systems, which sources groundwater from rural areas, produce higher water quality compared to public water systems. Studies have demonstrated that groundwater is vulnerable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which necessitates frequent water testing. However, critics like Charrois argue that inconvenience and time constraint impede regular testing in private wells and water systems, which poses risk of poor water quality to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kruger|first=Sasha Nicole|title=A Blue Revolution: The Global Crisis of Water Quality and Accessibility|url=http://dc.cod.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1365&amp;context=essai|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario's Common Sense Revolution===
In Ontario, Canada, the Harris government introduced the "Common Sense Revolution" to cut the large provincial deficit accumulated under the previous Rae government, implementing major cuts to the environment budget, privatizing water testing labs, deregulating water protection infrastructure, and firing trained water testing experts. ''See'' [[Mike Harris]].

In 1999, in spite of a Canadian federal government study that found a third of Ontario's rural wells were contaminated with E. coli, the Ontario government dropped testing for E.coli from its Drinking Water Surveillance Program and subsequently closed the program in 2000. In June 2000, there was a wave of E. coli outbreaks in several communities in rural Ontario, where at least seven people died from consuming the water in Walkerton. The private testing company, A&amp;L Laboratories, detected E. coli in the water but failed to disclose the contamination to provincial authorities due to a loophole in the "common sense" regulation. A&amp;L Laboratories claimed that the test results were "confidential intellectual property" and therefore belonged only to the "client", who was the authorities of Walkerton who lacked the training for proper assessment.&lt;ref name=MB/&gt; ''See'' [[Escherichia coli]].

===Legal cases===
In March 2013, a defense lawyer asked a federal judge to dismiss charges against the owner of Mississippi Environmental Analytical Laboratories Inc. accused of falsifying records on industrial waste water samples. According to the indictment, Borg Warner Emissions Systems Inc. hired Tennie White, the owner of the laboratory, to test waste water discharge at its car parts plant in Water Valley. White is accused of creating three reports in 2009 that indicated tests were completed when they were not. The motion to dismiss was based on the lawyer's argument that the documents referred to in the indictment were not signed and were not submitted to a government agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawyer wants dismissal charges over water tests|url=http://www.wjtv.com/story/21654671/lawyer-wants-dismissal-charges-over-water-tests|publisher=WJTV|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, '''women''' have made up a large majority of the profession and academic discipline of nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.sagepub.com/northouse6e/study/materials/reference/reference1.2.pdf|url = http://www.sagepub.com/northouse6e/study/materials/reference/reference1.2.pdf|website = www.sagepub.com|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's nursing roles include both caring for patients and making sure that the wards and equipment are clean.  Currently, females make up the majority of the field of nursing.  Statistics show that in 2005, "women comprised 92.3% of Registered Nurses (RNs).&amp;nbsp;Additionally, registered nurses are projected to create the second largest number of new jobs among all occupations between 2004 and 2014, increasing by 29.4%."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women's Bureau (WB) - Statistics on Registered Nurses|url = http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/Qf-nursing.htm|website = www.dol.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daily tasks throughout history==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
Nurses in the past were required to work long days and care for many patients, for very little pay. In addition, the typical university setting where nurses learned the work of the trade was not in existence back then. Instead, nurses learned the trade while working in the field. Another difference was that nursing students were called probationers. As probationers, they were required to follow the strict rules and regulations that were set forth by the institution. Additionally,  probationers were required to follow all physicians’ orders without question and perform various household duties. After learning how to take orders, probationers were then sent to the operating room for a 6-week rotation. During that 6-week period, probationers learned how to inventory sterile bandages, keep operating room meticulously clean and provide sterile water for surgeons during surgery. Upon completion of their training, probationers turned into nurses.

As nurses, some of their roles included providing patient education concerning nutrition and child related illnesses when needed. In general, nurses were the ones responsible for bathing patients, inserting [[Catheter|catheters]], dispensing medications, administering [[Enema|enemas]], keeping the ward clean, and making sure that everything was documented correctly. During that time, there were no nurses' aides available to help with the daily care of patients. Thusly, all tasks fell upon the nurse. To add to that long list of tasks, a nurse was also responsible for preparing any [[Holistic health|holistic medications]] that were needed at the time to treat the various alignments that patients presented with. In the present time, holistic medications are hardly used, and any medications that are required are generally handled and prepared by a pharmacy. This is with the expectation of some [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (IV), [[antibiotics]], and [[insulin]] preparations that the nurse will prepare on the floor (after receiving an order from a doctor).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2016}} Listed below are more duties of nurses in these time periods.

=== 1880s ===
* Nurses had 50 patients apiece to care for and were in charge of both their nursing notes and keeping the ward clean.&amp;nbsp; Some of their daily tasks are listed below:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nursing Through the Generations|url = http://www.valleychildrens.org/PressRoom/Publications/NursingExcellence8/Pages/NursingThroughGenerations.aspx|website = www.valleychildrens.org|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Daily sweep and mop the floors of your ward; dust the patients’ furniture and window sills. 
** Maintain an even temperature in your ward by bringing in a scuttle of coal for the day’s business. 
** Light is important to observe the patient’s condition; therefore, each day fill kerosene lamps, clean chimneys, and trim wicks. Wash windows once a week. 
** The nurse’s notes are important in aiding the physician’s work. Make your pens carefully. You may whittle nibs to your individual taste. 
** Each nurse on day duty will report every day at 7 a.m. and leave at 8 p.m., except on the Sabbath on which day you will be off from noon to 2 p.m. 
** Graduate nurses in good standing with the director of nurses will be given an evening off each week if you go regularly to church. 
** Each nurse should lay aside from each payday a goodly sum of her earnings for her benefits during her declining years, so that she will not become a burden. For example, if you earn $30 a month, you should set aside $15. 
** Any nurse who smokes, uses liquor in any form, gets her hair done at a beauty shop, or frequents dance halls will give the director of nurse’s good reason to suspect her worth, intentions, and integrity. 
** The nurse who performs her labors, serves her patients and doctors faithfully and without fault for a period of five years will be given an increase by the hospital administration of 5 cents a day, providing there are no hospital debts that are outstanding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== During the war ===
* War time saw a demand for nurses.  For that demand to be filled, nurses made the transition into the battlefield, leaving their home life behind.  On the battlefield, the main duty was to care for the sick and wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women nurses in World War 2 - Facts {{!}} World War Stories|url = http://worldwar42.blogspot.com/2012/09/women-nurses-in-world-war-2-story.html|accessdate = 2015-04-09|first = DavidBri|last = Kizmo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the war ===
* Completion of the war helped nurses gained a new level of respect from having learned about both anesthesia and psychiatric nursing.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, around this time penicillin was created.  This in turn helped to cure many infections and ultimately save many lives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A History Of Nursing From 1900 - Today {{!}} eLearnPortal.com|url = http://www.elearnportal.com/resources/careers/a-history-of-nursing-from-1900-today|website = www.elearnportal.com|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1950s ===
* During this generation injections were "still prepared with a pestle and mortar. Oxygen tanks were strapped to beds and there was very little equipment that was disposable. Nurses were in charge of sharpening needles and sterilizing catheter units."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1960s ===
* The 1960s brought about the development of the Intensive Care Units (ICU) where nurses were required to read telemetry monitors and take patient’s blood pressure.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the ICU, the ability to be able to specialize in one field of nursing and obtain an advanced nursing degree (i.e. nurse practitioner degree) become available. Another thing that nurses were required to do (no matter what field they are in) was to stand when doctors entered the room.  Lastly,  female nurses were still wearing the traditional white uniform and hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nursing in the 1960s|url = http://nursinglink.monster.com/nurse-supervisor-jobs/articles/14836-nursing-in-the-1960s|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
* This period saw several changes, with one being that new nurses had to generally work the graveyard shift as they worked their way up in the ranks.  Generally, nothing came prepared, which left nurses responsible for mixing, calculating and drawing up both antibiotics and IV medications. To add to this nurses were still using paper charts and medication was kept under lock and key in a cabinet.&amp;nbsp; The last main thing about this period was that nurses were still required to stand when doctors entered the room and the traditional white uniform and hat were still in practice in some facilities but with some modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hospital Nursing in the 1970s|url = http://scrubsmag.com/hospital-nursing-in-the-1970s/|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980-1990s ===
* Within this time frame, nurses saw an improvement of technology and its introduction into the field of nursing.&amp;nbsp; The improved technology improved efficiency but it also required that nurses had to go to back to training so that they knew how to use it in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://ac.els-cdn.com/0020748988900806/1-s2.0-0020748988900806-main.pdf?_tid=8679b588-def7-11e4-8a72-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1428611722_fe7da972ccd3e2559795f116f0e14d84|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/0020748988900806/1-s2.0-0020748988900806-main.pdf?_tid=8679b588-def7-11e4-8a72-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1428611722_fe7da972ccd3e2559795f116f0e14d84|website = ac.els-cdn.com|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
* Nurses in this period today are still responsible for the direct care of patients (i.e. bathing, feeding, toileting, ambulating, positioning), following doctor’s orders, taking vital signs, obtaining daily weights, recording both input and output, obtaining various lab samples, administering medications and charting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nursing Duties, Responsibilities and Career Options|url = http://study.com/nursing_duties.html|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may seem like a lot for one nurse to do in one shift but they are not alone.&amp;nbsp; Meaning that they can delegate some of those tasks to the nursing aide.&amp;nbsp; The ones that they can delegate are the taking of vital signs, recording input and output, obtaining daily weights, and the direct care of patients.&amp;nbsp; There is one important thing that nurses have to think about with delegate though is that they are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the outcomes.&amp;nbsp; To prevent any issues the nurse must first determine if the delegation is within the person’s skill level and if the facility allows the nurse to delegate that specific task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Guidelines to Effective Delegation in Nursing {{!}} NurseTogether.com|url = http://www.nursetogether.com/guidelines-to-effective-nursing-delegation|website = www.nursetogether.com|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nurse's uniforms throughout history==

=== 19th century&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The History of Nursing Uniforms|url = http://www.nursinguniforms.net/blog/the-history-of-nursing-uniforms|website = www.nursinguniforms.net|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
During this time nursing uniforms were very similar to "servants’ uniforms, which consisted of a full black or printed gown with a white gathered or banded cap and a white apron." Around 1840, the field of nursing gained more respect and nurses were trained more.&amp;nbsp; With this said the uniforms worn at this time started to change from the servant uniforms to the more classic "ladylike gowns with white aprons and caps to indicate that they were nurses." During this time a very influential nurse started their career in the field of nursing; that nurse was Florence Nightingale.&amp;nbsp; She brought many different things to the field.&amp;nbsp; For instance she helped to make the field a more respectable one with the introduction of both better schooling and uniforms.&amp;nbsp; The improvements in uniforms helped us to determine the rank of all the different nurses practicing.&amp;nbsp; This was accomplished by having nurses wear a hat with a different color band depending on their rank. "Fresh nurse students would wear ribbon bands of pink, blue, or other pastel colors. Senior nurses and nursing teachers would wear black ribbon bands to indicate seniority."

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Photographs_of_World_War_I_nurse_uniforms_from_the_National_Archives.jpg|thumb|A World War I nurse in a [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] ward uniform (left) and another nurse wearing a dark blue cape (right)]]
This period brought about the start of change in the uniforms by adding white bibs and pockets to the dresses. In addition, large hats were worn that resembled a nun’s hat and veil. These types of uniforms stayed in practice up until the [[World War I|First World War]], when it was decided that the uniforms needed to be revamped to make them more practical and improve nurses' efficiency. For instance, the sleeves on the uniforms were changed so that they rolled up, the bulky aprons were removed, and the shirts shortened. All these things helped with convenience and allowed nurses to function better, and were often coupled with shoulder-covering capes, which were usually navy or dark blue in colour on the outside with red lining on the inside.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By the 1950s, paper hats and simple folded hats replaced the large, elaborate crown-like caps that were worn by nurses during the First World War. The simple paper hats were more comfortable. The policy to use hats to denote seniority level was abolished, since the morality of nurses was affected by the discrimination. Dresses also evolved, since no one has the time to launder elaborately tailored clothing anymore. Dresses became less form fitting and were easy to wash, iron and wear."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

By the 1970s with the appearance of males in the field wearing scrubs, the female uniforms once again changed, they "became less gendered". The hat was lost and uniforms become less formal. In addition, they started to resemble normal clothing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning About Scrubs: The History Of Nursing Uniforms|url = http://learningaboutscrubs.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-history-of-nursing-uniforms.html|date = 1 February 2013|accessdate = 9 April 2015|first = Learning About|last = Scrubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, the cap and the cloth apron was gone. To replace the cloth apron, nurses started to wear disposable ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nursing 50 Years Back and Today: How the Nursing Field Has Changed Over the Last 50 Years {{!}} HEALTHeCAREERS|url = http://www.healthecareers.com/article/nursing-50-years-back-and-today-how-the-nursing-field-has-changed-over-the-last-50-years/158432|website = www.healthecareers.com|accessdate = 2015-04-09|first = HEALTHeCAREERS|last = Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today ===
Nurses today continue to wear scrubs with many different colors and patterns available.&amp;nbsp;The scrubs usually consist of drawn string pants and a V-neck top.&amp;nbsp; The formal uniform (i.e. color and patterns allowed) though varies by policy. &amp;nbsp;In some facilities it is required that the different types of employees all wear different color scrubs so that their specific job title can be determined by their scrub color. For example, "nurses in one color, techs in another, etc." Additionally "some hospitals are even going back to requiring that nurses wear white, though they haven't yet returned to skirts, hats, and stockings."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Suicide sidebar}}
'''World Suicide Prevention Day''' ('''WSPD''') is an [[awareness day]] observed on 10 September every year, in order to provide worldwide commitment and action to prevent suicides, with various activities around the world since 2003.&lt;ref name=sitnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Alaska Observes World Suicide Prevention Day and Alaska Suicide Prevention Month |url=http://www.sitnews.us/0904news/091104/091104_suicide_prevention.html|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=SitNews|date=11 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Association for Suicide Prevention]] (IASP) collaborates with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[World Federation for Mental Health]] (WFMH) to host World Suicide Prevention Day.&lt;ref name=suicidology&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide in the U.S.A.

On its first event in 2003, the 1999 World Health Organization's global suicide prevention initiative is mentioned with regards to the main strategy for its implementation, requiring:&lt;ref name="IASPpr"/&gt;
# "The organisation of global, regional and national multi-sectoral activities to increase awareness about suicidal behaviours and how to effectively prevent them." 
# "The strengthening of countries's capabilities to develop and evaluate national policies and plans for suicide prevention."

As of recent WHO releases, challenges represented by [[social stigma]], the [[taboo]] to openly discuss suicide, and low availability of data are still to date obstacles leading to poor data quality for both suicide and suicide attempts: "given the sensitivity of suicide – and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries – it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death."&lt;ref name="WHO2017"&gt;{{cite web |website=www.who.int |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Suicide - Challenges and obstacles |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs398/en/ |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO2002"&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO |title=Self-directed violence |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/en/selfdirectedviolfacts.pdf |website=www.who.int|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Suicide has a number of complex and interrelated and underlying contributing factors ... that can contribute to the feelings of pain and hopelessness. Having access to means to kill oneself – most typically firearms, medicines and poisons – is also a risk factor.&lt;ref name=sitnews/&gt;|source=Campaign release}}


==Background==
{{See also|Suicide Prevention|Suicide|Epidemiology of suicide}}
&lt;!--
National health services operate suicide prevention, including charity organizations. In the United States, both the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] address different methods of reducing suicide. The [[Campaign Against Living Miserably]] and the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]] are charities in the UK that attempt to highlight this issue for public discussion.
!--&gt;
An estimated one million people per year die by suicide or about one person in 10,000 (1.4% of all deaths), or "a death every 40 seconds or about 3,000 every day". As of 2004 the number of people who die by suicide is expected to reach 1.5 million per year by 2020.&lt;ref name=rtenews&gt;{{cite news|title=World Suicide Prevention Day is marked |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0910/suicide.html|accessdate=11 June 2012 |newspaper=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=10 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, three male suicides are reported for every female one, consistently across different age groups and in almost every country in the world.

Social norms play a significant role in the development of [[suicidal behavior]]s. Late 19th century's sociological studies recorded first ever observations on suicide: with statistics of the time at hand, sociologists mentioned the effects of industrialization as in relations between new urbanized communities and vulnerability to self-destructive behavior, suggesting [[social pressure]]s have effects on suicide.{{small|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.hawaii.edu/~fm/durkheim.html|title=Emile Durkheim (1858-1917)|website=University of Hawaii at Manoa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncGenSoc2009"/&gt;}} Today, differences in suicidal behavior among different countries can show significant.

Another way to think of it, is that since populations age structures are often very different, but the likelihood of dying by suicide is generally increased with age, in order to avoid masking the sensible differences given by each country's age distributions, countries' rates are reciprocally [[weighted]] into the overall trend to globally frame national suicide rates, and the [[epidemiological]] prevalence of suicide. Age-standardization works over time as a measure of the prevalence of suicide across diversely populated countries, by rounding down when populations are composed of a higher percentage of older people compared to the "standard" population, and viceversa.|group=note|name=nam}}&lt;/small&gt;!!Crude&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(2015)&lt;/small&gt;!!Male:Female&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(2015)&lt;/small&gt;!!&lt;small&gt;Rate&lt;br&gt;(2012)&lt;/small&gt;!!&lt;small&gt;Male:Female&lt;br&gt;(2012)&lt;/small&gt;!!&lt;small&gt;Rate&lt;br&gt;(2008)&lt;/small&gt;!!&lt;small&gt;Male:Female&lt;br&gt;(2008)&lt;/small&gt;

Suicide prevention's priorities, as declared on the 2012 World Suicide Prevention Day event, are stated below:&lt;ref name=IASPpr2012/&gt;
* We need to continue to research suicide and non-fatal suicidal behaviour, addressing both risk and protective factors.
* We need to develop and implement awareness campaigns, with the aim of increasing awareness of suicidal behaviours in the community, incorporating evidence on both risk and protective factors.
* We need to target our efforts not only to reduce risk factors but also to strengthen protective factor, especially in childhood and adolescence.
* We need to train health care professionals to better understand evidence-based risk and protective factors associated with suicidal behaviour.
* We need to combine primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.
* We need to increase use of and adherence to treatments shown to be effective in treating diverse conditions; and to prioritise research into effectiveness of treatments aimed at reducing self-harm and suicide risk.
* We need to increase the availability of mental health resources and to reduce barriers to accessing care.
* We need to disseminate research evidence about suicide prevention to policy makers at international, national and local levels.
* We need to reduce stigma and promote mental health literacy among the general population and health care professionals.
* We need to reach people who don't seek help, and hence don't receive treatment when they are in need of it.
* We need to ensure sustained funding for suicide research and prevention.
* We need to influence governments to develop suicide prevention strategies for all countries and to support the implementation of those strategies that have been demonstrated to save lives.

Follows a brief summary of key quotes on the subject of [[suicide]] from different sources:
{{quote|"The main suicide triggers are poverty, [[:en:Socioeconomic status|unemployment]], the loss of a loved one, arguments and legal or work-related problems [..] Suicide results from many complex sociocultural factors and is more likely to occur during periods of socioeconomic, family and individual crisis (e.g. loss of a loved one, unemployment, sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide Attempts among Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Adults|url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf|publisher=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; difficulties with developing one's identity, disassociation from one's community or other social/belief group, and honour). [..] In [[developed countries|richer countries]], three times as many men die of suicide than women do, but in low- and middle-income countries the male-to-female ratio is much lower at 1.5 men to each woman. [..] In the United States, males are four times more likely to die from suicide than are females. However, females are more likely to attempt suicide than are males. [..] The disparity in suicide rates has been partly explained by the use of more lethal means and the experience of more aggression and higher intent to die [..] in men than women."&lt;ref name=rtenews/&gt;&lt;ref name="befrienders"&gt;{{cite web |website=Befrienders Worldwide |title=Suicide Statistics |url=https://www.befrienders.org/suicide-statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="who2014EXEsumm"&gt;{{cite web |author=World Health Organization |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Preventing suicide - A global imperative |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/131056/9789241564779_eng.pdf |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IASPpr2012/&gt;

{{quote|
"In much of the world, suicide is stigmatized and condemned for religious or cultural reasons. In some countries, suicidal behavior is a criminal offence punishable by law. Suicide is therefore often a secretive act surrounded by taboo, and may be unrecognized, misclassified or deliberately hidden in official records of death. [..] [[Social stigma|Stigma]], particularly surrounding [[mental disorder]]s and [[suicide]], means many people thinking of taking their own life or who have attempted suicide are not seeking help and are therefore not getting the help they need. The prevention of suicide has not been adequately addressed due to a lack of awareness of suicide as a major public health problem and the taboo in many societies to openly discuss it. [..] Raising community awareness and breaking down the taboo is important for countries to make progress in preventing suicide."&lt;ref name="WHO2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO2017"&gt;{{cite web |website=www.who.int |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Suicide - Challenges and obstacles |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs398/en/ |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Physical and especially [[mental health]] disabling issues such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], are among the most common of the long list of complex and interrelated factors, ranging from financial problems to the experience of abuse, aggression, exploitation and mistreatment, that can contribute to the feelings of pain and hopelessness underling suicide. Usually substances and alcohol abuse also play a role. Prevention strategies generally emphasize public awareness towards [[social stigma]] and [[suicidal behavior]]s.&lt;ref name=sitnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201004/the-six-reasons-people-attempt-suicide&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IASPpr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO2017"/&gt;

[[WHO]]. 2011. Archived on 22 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1999, death by self-inflicted injuries was the fourth leading cause of death among aged 15–44, in the world. In a 2002 study it's reported the countries with the lowest rates tend to be in [[Latin America]], '[[Muslim countries]] and a few [[Asian countries]]', and noted a lack of information from most [[African countries]] (see map).&lt;ref name=IASPpr/&gt; Data quality is to date a concern for suicide prevention policies. Incidence of suicide tends to be under-reported and misclassified due to both cultural and social pressures, and possibly completely unreported in some areas. Since data might be skewed, comparing suicide rates between nations can result in statistically unsound conclusions about [[suicidal behavior]] in different countries. Nevertheless the statistics are commonly used to directly influence decisions about public policy and public health strategies.&lt;ref name="Samaritans2012"&gt;{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Scowcroft |publisher=Samaritans |title=Suicide Statistics Report 2012 |url=http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/Suicide%20Statistics%20Report%202012.pdf |website=www.samaritans.org|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 34 member countries of the [[OECD]], a group of mostly [[high-income economy|high-income countries]] that uses [[market economy]] to improve the [[Human Development Index]], [[South Korea]] had the highest [[suicide rate]] in 2009. In 2011 South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare enacted legislation coinciding with WSPD to address the high rate.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Choi|first=Jung-yoon|title=South Korea to step up suicide prevention efforts: In 2009, 15,413 people took their lives, a rate that is three times higher than two decades ago.

In 2008 it was reported that young people 15–34 years old in China were more likely to die by suicide than by any other mean, especially young Chinese women in rural places because of 'arguments about marriage'. By 2011 however, suicide rate for the same age group had been declining significantly according to official releases, mainly by late China’s urbanisation and migration from rural areas to more urbanised: since the 1990s indeed, overall national chinese suicide rate dropped by 68%.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsBeijing&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=James|title=Chinese youth 'face suicide risk'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7608575.stm|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News, Beijing|date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|title=Back from the edge - A dramatic decline in suicides |website=economist.com |url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21605942-first-two-articles-chinas-suicide-rate-looks-effect-urbanisation-back |date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[World Health Organization|WHO]], in 2009 the four countries with the highest rates of suicide were all in [[Eastern Europe]]; Slovenia had the fourth highest rate preceded by Russia, Latvia, and Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Roundup: Ljubljana|url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1425769|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=Slovenska Tiskovna Agencija|date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stays within findings from the start of the WSPD event in 2003 when the highest rates were also found in Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name=IASPpr&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating the 1st World Suicide Prevention Day 10 September 2003|url=http://iasp.info/wspd/2003_wspd.php|work=Press Release|publisher=International Association for Suicide Prevention|accessdate=12 June 2012}} adapted from the chapter on "Self-Directed Violence" from the ''World Report on Violence and Health'', [[World Health Organization]], Geneva, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 the highest suicide rates are still in Eastern Europe, [[Korean Peninsula|Korea]] and the Siberian area bordering China, in [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Guianas]], Belgium and few Sub-Saharan countries.&lt;ref name=WHO2015Snapshot/&gt;

According to WHO's Mental health Atlas released in 2014, no low-income country reported having a national [[suicide prevention]] strategy, while less than 10% of lower-middle income countries, and almost a third of upper-middle and high-income countries had.&lt;ref name="MentalAtlas2014" /&gt; Focus of the WSPD is the fundamental problem of [[suicide]], considered a major public health issue in high-income and an emerging problem in low and middle-income [[developed countries|countries]].&lt;ref name=IASP2013brochure&gt;{{cite web|title=September 10 2013 World Suicide Prevention Day.

[[Socioeconomic status]] plays an important role in suicidal behavior, and wealth is a constant with regards to Male&amp;ndash;Female suicide rate ratios, being that excess male mortality by suicide is generally limited or non existent in low- and middle-income societies, whereas it is never absent in high-income countries (see table).

Suicidal behavior is also subject of study for economists since about the 1970s: although national costs of suicide and suicide attempts (up to 20 for every one completed suicide) are very high, suicide prevention is hampered by scarce resources for lack of interest by mental health advocates and legislators; and moreover, personal interests even financial are studied with regards to suicide attempts for example, in which insights are given that often "individuals contemplating suicide do not just choose between life and death [..] the resulting formula contains a somewhat paradoxical conclusion: attempting suicide can be a rational choice, but only if there is a high likelihood it will cause the attempter's life to significantly improve."{{small|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2003/10/the_economics_of_suicide.html |title=The Economics of Suicide|website=Slate (magazine)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061698|title=The Economics of Suicide |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=Jan 2003 |volume=69|issue=3|pages=628–643 |doi=10.2307/1061698}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the United States alone, yearly costs of suicide and suicide attempts are comprised in 50-100 billion dollars.{{small|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sprc.org/about-suicide/costs/|title=Costs of Suicide|website=Suicide Prevention Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/|title=Suicide Statistics — AFSP|website=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United Nations issued 'National Policy for Suicide Prevention' in the 1990s which some countries also use as a basis for their assisted suicide policies nevertheless the UN noted that [[suicide bombers]]' deaths are seen as secondary to their goal of killing other people or specific targets and the bombers are not otherwise typical of people committing suicide.&lt;ref name="united nations"/&gt;

According to a 2006 WHO press release, one third of worldwide suicides were committed with [[pesticide]]s, "some of which were forbidden by United Nations (UN) conventions."&lt;ref name="united nations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Conference by World Health Organization on Suicide Prevention |url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2006/060908_Suicide.doc.htm|publisher=United Nations Department of Public Information|accessdate=11 June 2012|format=Press Conference|date=8 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO urged the highly populated Asian countries to restrict pesticides that are commonly used in failed attempts, especially [[organophosphate]]-based pesticides that are banned by international conventions but still made in and exported by some Asian countries.&lt;ref name=CBCNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Restrict pesticides to reduce suicides: WHO |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2006/11/09/pesticide-suicides.html|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=CBC News|date=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO reports an increase in pesticide suicides in other Asian countries as well as [[Central America|Central]] and South America.&lt;ref name=CBCNews/&gt; It is estimated that such painful failed attempts could be reduced by legalizing controlled voluntary euthanasia options, as implemented in [[Switzerland]].

As of 2017, it is estimated that around 30% of global suicides are still due to pesticide self-poisoning, most of which occur in rural agricultural areas in low- and middle-income countries (consisting in about 80% world population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restrict pesticides to reduce suicides: WHO |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs398/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In high-income countries consisting of the remaining 20% world population most common methods are firearms, hanging and other self-poisoning.

[[Europe]]an and [[Americas|America]]n societies report a higher male mortality by suicide than any other, while various [[Asia]]n a much lower. According to most recent data provided by WHO, about 40,000 females of the global three hundred thousand female suicides and 150,000 males of the global half million male suicides, deliberately take their own life every year in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] (consisting of about thirty percent world population).&lt;ref name="WHO 2015 Snapshot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/gho/mental_health/suicide_rates_male_female/en/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429062418/http://www.who.int:80/gho/mental_health/suicide_rates_male_female/en/ |archive-date=29 April 2017 |title=Age-standardized rates, male:female ratio |publisher=[[WHO]] |year=2015|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, apart from a few South and East Asian countries home to twenty percent of world population, Morocco, Lesotho, and two Caribbean countries, because of changing [[sociology of gender|gender roles]] suicide rates are globally higher among [[men]] than [[women]].&lt;ref name=IASPpr/&gt;

{{Quote|''Even though women are more prone to suicidal thoughts than men, rates of suicide are higher among men. On average, there are about three male suicides for every female one – though in parts of Asia, the ratio is much narrower.'' &lt;small&gt;([[WHO]], 2002)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO 2002"&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO |title=Self-directed violence|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/en/selfdirectedviolfacts.pdf |website=www.who.int |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quote|''The disparity in suicide rates has been partly explained by the use of more lethal means and the experience of more aggression and higher intent to die, when suicidal, in men than women.'' &lt;small&gt;([[International Association for Suicide Prevention|IASP]], 2012)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=IASPpr2012/&gt;}}
{{Quote|''There are many potential reasons for different suicide rates in men and women: gender equality issues, differences in socially acceptable methods of dealing with stress and conflict for men and women, availability of and preference for different means of suicide, availability and patterns of alcohol consumption, and differences in care-seeking rates for mental disorders between men and women. The very wide range in the sex ratios for suicide suggests that the relative importance of these different reasons varies greatly by country and region.'' &lt;small&gt;([[WHO]], 2012)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldBankRates2012"&gt;{{cite web |author=World Health Organization |title=Preventing suicide - A global imperative |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/131056/9789241564878_eng.pdf#page=27 |website=www.who.int|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Western world|western]] countries men are about 300% or thrice as likely to die by suicide than females, while a few countries (counting over a hundred million residents overall) exceed the 600% figure. Most considerable difference in male–female suicide ratios is noted in countries of the former Soviet Bloc and in some of Latin America.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015 Snapshot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EncGenSoc2009"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jodi O'Brien (Editor)|publisher=SAGE Publications |title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society (p. 817)|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lr91AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT869&amp;lpg=PT869&amp;dq=gender+paradox+suicidal+behavior&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KYNsuHKSuX&amp;sig=DIb32dcIYk2eHlTcFOHcS7Bgpxk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMxaqsxMnZAhXLFsAKHQhPBkYQ6AEIhQIwHQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, in 2015 women had higher suicide rates in eight countries. Due to permanence of [[Globalization and women in China|traditional gender roles]], in [[China]] (almost a fifth of world population) women were up to 30% more likely than men to commit suicide and up to 60% in some other [[South Asian]] countries: overall South [[Asia]]n (including [[South-eastern Asia|South-Eastern]] Asia, a third of world population) [[age-adjusted]] ratio however, was ''around'' global average of 1.7 : 1 (men being around 70% more likely than women to die by suicide).&lt;ref name=CrudeRates2017UpdateSnapshot_byCountry/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOsuicideRates2015Snapshot/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2015Snapshot/&gt;

Some suicide reduction strategies do not recognize the separate needs of males and females.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Payne, Sarah| title=The social construction of gender and its influence on suicide: a review of the literature | journal=Journal of Men's Health | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=23–35  | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875686708000146 | doi=10.1016/j.jomh.2007.11.002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have recommended aggressive long-term treatments and follow up for males that show indications of suicidal thoughts. Studies have also found that because young females are at a higher risk of attempting suicide, policies tailored towards this demographic are most effective at reducing overall rates.

Shifting cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] and [[social norms]], and especially ideas about [[masculinity]], may also contribute to closing the gender gap: social status and working roles are assumed to be crucial for men's identity.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thompson, Martie| title=Examining Gender Differences in Risk Factors for Suicide Attempts Made 1 and 7 Years Later in a Nationally Representative Sample | journal=Journal of Adolescent Health | volume=48 | pages=391–397 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X1000368X | doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.07.018|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norway2013"&gt;{{cite web |author=Mette Lyberg Rasmussen |publisher=Norwegian Institute of Public Health - University of Oslo, Norway |title=Suicide among Young Men: Self-esteem regulation in transition to adult life |url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/46008/dravhandling-%20Rasmussen.pdf?#page=20 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Your Candidates–Your Health''' is an initiative launched by [[Research!America]] and partner organizations to inform voters of their presidential and congressional candidates’ views on health and research.&lt;ref name="YCYH"&gt;[http://www.yourcandidatesyourhealth.org/ Your Candidates–Your Health website.]&lt;/ref&gt; The resource is a free, online voter education tool featuring candidates’ responses to questions about health and research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_10-22-2006/Intelligence_Report Lyric Wallwork Winik. “Intelligence Report.” PARADE. October 22, 2006. Accessed March 11, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, all candidates for the United States [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] were invited to respond to a 10-question survey on several health and research issues, including [[stem cell]] research, research funding and global competitiveness in innovation.&lt;ref name="KXnet"&gt;[http://www.kxmc.com/t/george-bush/45814.asp KXnet.com. “2006 Elections: Medical Research &amp; U.S. Competitiveness Key Issues for Voters &amp; Candidates.” September 18, 2006. Accessed March 11, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates' responses, along with the public’s view on the same questions, were posted on the ''Your Candidates–Your Health'' website and were available to educate voters’ decisions in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 congressional elections]].&lt;ref name="KXnet"/&gt;

The initiative continued in 2007 with attention shifted to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]].  Presidential candidates from both parties were asked 17 questions in a survey on health, research and other related issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capwiz.com/pan/issues/alert/?alertid=10723311 Parkinson’s Action Network. Accessed March 11, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire covered topics such as the [[Health care in the United States|American health care system]] and its costs; [[Health insurance in the United States|health care coverage]]; [[electronic health records]]; [[global health]]; [[stem cell]] research; global competitiveness in innovation; and funding for the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]], the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]].&lt;ref name="YCYH"/&gt;

The nonpartisan initiative was advertised in key primary states in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com Jonathan D. Rockoff. “Science Campaigns for Cash: Researchers Want Presidential Hopefuls to Commit More Funds.” Baltimore Sun. October 22, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its promotion, voters were asked to contact candidates and encourage them to respond to the survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/ Donald Kennedy. “The Real Debate.” Science.  February 1, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama and Senator [http://www.yourcandidatesyourhealth.org/john_mccain_medical_research_positions.php John McCain] responded.

The initiative is now collecting responses from the 2012 presidential and congressional candidates. As March 2012, responses from [http://www.yourcandidatesyourhealth.org/profile.php?c_id=NTUwMA%3D%3D President Barack Obama] and presidential candidate [http://www.yourcandidatesyourhealth.org/profile.php?c_id=NTQ5NA%3D%3D Newton Gingrich] are available.
